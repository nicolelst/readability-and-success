and anxiety are the most prevalent diseases that contribute to global disability, especially if they are not early recognised and properly treated. They occur as part of many chronic diseases, often remain unrecognised at an early stage, and significantly contribute to the progression of the underlying disease reducing the quality of life in these patients. Numerous studies have shown that anxiety \/ depression and dyspnea are the leading symptoms in patients with COPD that are associated with high morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the degree of depression, anxiety and stress, using DASS- 21 scale, and changes in locomotor parameters in smokers who are prone to develop COPD. The study included 164 patients, smokers and non-smokers, who underwent spirometry, 6-minute walk test and bicycle ergometer. They were all measured for body weight, height, waist circumference, pulse, blood pressure and each patient completed DASS-21, CAT and IPAQ questionnaire. The results of the IPAQ questionnaire indicated a statistically significant difference in the physical activity of smokers and non-smokers. A statistically significant was found between DASS-21 and patients physical activity (p=0.0001), 6-minute walk test (r=-0.186, p=0.017), VO2 max (r=-0.220, p=0.005) and weekly calorie consumption (r=-0.222, p=0.004). According to the results of the study, an increased degree of anxiety, depression and stress is an important factor influencing changes in locomotor parameters in smokers who are prone to develop COPD. ","3":null,"4":"This study aimed to assess the level of satisfaction with fixed prosthodontic work among patients in Croatia and investigate the level of awareness about maintaining oral hygiene and the importance of regular check-ups. The study included 235 participants from Croatia, 163 women, and 72 men. As a data source, we used a questionnaire previously filled in by patients. The questions asked were short and simple to understand. 25 patients were in the preparation phase of prosthetic therapy, 34 in the middle of the process, and 176 already had the whole procedure done. Most study patients were satisfied with fixed prosthodontic work's aesthetic and functional parameters. Aesthetic aspects such as the color and appearance of the prosthodontic work positively affected the patient's self-confidence and further quality of life. Most of the environment noticed the patient's new smile after prosthodontic work. Patients must be aware of the importance of maintaining proper oral hygiene because it directly affects a fixed prosthetic replacement's lifespan and indirectly affects the subjective impression and level of patient satisfaction with the overall work. ","5":"Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a non-pharmacological method widely used by medical specialists to manage acute and chronic pain in different circumstances. It can be used to manage pain during many dental procedures, as well as pain due to various conditions affecting the maxillofacial region. The aim of this study was to provide insight into the clinical research evidence for the analgetic application of TENS in pediatric patients. The hypothesis was that TENS device will achieve analgetic effect on teeth during dental procedure. This study included 125 patients treated at the School of Dental Medicine, University of Zagreb clinic during two-year period. After diagnosis of caries and need for restorative treatment, patients were randomly selected in three groups. Group 1 received local anesthesia, group 2 had no anesthesia and group 3 used TENS device. Level of pain was measured with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Research was conducted by one therapist that was calibrated. We found no statistically significant difference between TENS group and group without anesthesia(p&gt;0.05). TENS device is not as efficient in achieving analgetic impact during dental procedure as local anesthesia. ","6":"The topic of research was phenomenon of impaired age self-consciousness in non-psychotic latent schizophrenia patients defined. The study sample comprised 141 patients with latent schizophrenia (pseudo neurotic (F21.3 - 64.5%, 91 patients), coenesthopathic (F20.8 - 25.5%, 36 patients) and pseudo psychopathic (F21.4 - 9.9%, 14 patients)) aged 16-31 (average 22.1 years old) in 2007-2019. A follow-up, experimental psychological and clinical study was conducted. The onset of impaired age self-identity was dominated by a radical drop of the subjective age in self-conscious mind of the patients accompanied by a tormented feeling of loss of self-dependence, role autonomy, helplessness, inability of decision making and to be answerable. Patients described this sudden condition as a loss of 'maturity feeling' and return to the juvenile perception of self. In a delusive and unclear manner, phrases such as 'I feel inferior to others as if a helpless child among adults', 'I feel as if my childhood is back' were uttered. Excessive worrying and enlivening of childhood memories were also included. This correlates to occurrence of humble and sometimes dependent\/avoidant behavior, feeling of helplessness and fear with respect to caring for one self, rising subordination and suggestibility. This phenomenon of regress to earlier ontogenetic level of personal development reported as impaired age self-consciousness can thus be regarded as an obligate form of depersonalization in patients with latent schizophrenia. ","7":"Preservation of health, increase in life expectancy determine the need to improve the effectiveness of medical recommendations, which, despite the success of pharmacology, are insufficient for reasons related to the low level of compliance with these recommendations by patients. The authors of the article believe that compliance is a kind of quantifiable and behaviorally realized reflection of therapeutic interaction, refracted through the prism of the patient's individual personality characteristics. Participants of the study-148 employees of medical institutions: 12 men, 136 women, their age ranged from 27 to 74 years. The research tool was the neuropsychological rapid method. 3 research subgroups were formed: 27-40 years (37 people), 41-50 years (60 people), 51 years and older (51 people). Comparison of the results of subtests of neuropsychological Express technique showed heterogeneous results in subgroups of the study. In addition, the dynamic characteristics of psychological processes were evaluated: depletion, inertia, impulsivity. A significant difference in the performance of the graphomotor test between the subjects of the age subgroup of 27-40 years and the subgroup of 41-50 years was statistically confirmed. For the qualitative performance of this simple test requires a sufficient level of development of all structural and functional components of brain functions and, in particular, the \"front\" function of programming and management and consistent organization of movements. In older people revealed a much greater number of errors, interruptions of the test than the representatives of the more \"young\" subgroup. Similar results were obtained when comparing the \"young\" and \"old\" subgroups. Despite the absence of signs of decompensation of concomitant pathology, representatives of the subgroups took a different amount of concomitant therapy. Using the scale of assessment of drug compliance, it was found that compliance is most reduced in the subgroup of 41-50 years. In this subgroup, a comprehensive decrease in compliance across the \"behavioral\", \"emotional\", and \"cognitive\" domains was detected in 87.8% of cases, while in the younger subgroup partial non-compliance was 32.4%, in the older subgroup - 74.5% An analysis of the states of cognitive functions in 52 representatives of the middle age subgroup with low compliance rates showed that, unlike other representatives of the same subgroup, their indices for a number of neuropsychological tests are close to the results of more adult participants in the study. Individuals demonstrating low compliance with quite favorable CNS resources are at risk for the formation of pathological aging.","8":"Total hip arthroplasty is \"gold standard\" in surgical treatment of hip osteoarthritis but we still lack quality information on patients' perspective. Preoperative narrative approach as instrument of patient-centered paradigm that provide detailed information tailored to the patients' needs, might give patient control over the whole process and better outcomes. The aim of this article is to explore the lived experience of patients from onset of disease to final treatment. This is a qualitative study using direct content analysis. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 33 patients who undergone total hip arthroplasty in Special hospital for orthopedics in Biograd na Moru, Croatia, 6 to 9 months after surgery. Interviews were coded and organized to themes. Three main themes emerged and all themes were closely related to information available: 1) Pre-operation information (information about disease and coping with it, pain management, exercise for muscle and joint function maintenance), 2) Information about operation and technical information (waiting list transparency, type of implant, possible complications and risks), 3) After operation information (early rehabilitation, stationary rehabilitation, quality of life after operation). Our findings reveal that patients experience lack of information prior to referral to our hospital. Involving patients in the process through good communication with doctor and providing extensive information on what to expect before and after surgery, and how surgery will affect quality of life, make them feel that they progress better. Identifying hidden barriers and enablers might help in patients' healing process. Our results indicate that preoperative narrative approach was a worthy time investment that contributed to patient general satisfaction. ","9":null,"10":"To evaluate the defense mechanisms (DM) in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy and, to determine whether displacement is associated with seizures. Following an examination, 50 patients were diagnosed in accordance with the 2005 proposal of the International League Against Epilepsy and the definition of drug-resistant epilepsy from 2010. The neuropsychological examination used the Defense Style Questionnaire (DSQ-40). We measured the intensity of individual DMs. Mature DMs: sublimation, humor, suppression and anticipation; neurotic DMs: undoing, pseudo-altruism, idealization and reactive formation; and immature DMs: projections, passive aggression, acting out, isolation, devaluation, autistic fantasies, denial, displacement, dissociation, splitting, rationalization and somatization. The values were compared with 50 subjects without epilepsy. Patients with drug-resistant epilepsy use immature defensive styles significantly more (p=0.0010). Displacement have a positive correlation with frequency of seizure (p=0.0412). Blaming others is a characteristic of the behavior of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, especially if they have seizures. As such, they may be less adaptable in a micro social environment. ","11":"Previous studies have indicated that changes in the expression of certain inflammatory biomarkers are associated with cognitive impairment (CI), but only a limited number of studies were conducted in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). The present study aimed to evaluate the potential association between serum levels of several inflammatory markers and cognitive impairment in AIS patients. These markers included interleukin 6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), plasma fibrinogen, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and white blood cell (WBC) count. All participants were prospectively recruited from the Department of Neurology, Clinical Center University of Sarajevo. A total of 100 patients with first-ever AIS were included in stroke group and 30 in the non-stroke control group. Each patient underwent a comprehensive cognitive assessment and laboratory tests (IL-6, CRP, fibrinogen, ESR and WBC) within the first three days of admission. Cognitive status was assessed using cognitive instruments: the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, the Frontal Assessment Battery, and the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised. Female stroke patients with CI had higher levels of IL-6 compared to those without CI and controls (p&lt;0.017). AIS patients with CI had significantly higher plasma fibrinogen (p&lt;0.001) and CRP levels (p&lt;0.001) than controls, whereas there was no significant difference in comparison with cognitively intact patients. There were no statistical differences in ESR or WBC count between groups. Of the inflammatory markers, only IL-6 levels were associated with CI in AIS patients. Measuring circulating IL-6 could be used as a screening test to identify all such patients.

Symptomatic questionnaire of Yu. Alexandrovich and questionnaire SF-36 were used. The survey was conducted in 124 patients aged 18 to 65 years. Anxiety disorders are the most common among the mental disorders in patients with GERD, depressive and psychasthenic disorders - in patients with combined pathology. All indicators of quality of life were lower in patients with combined pathology.

Pelvic physical rehabilitation is a relatively simple, non-invasive, outpatient method that, if applied properly before and\/or after RP, can significantly reduce adverse effects, increase patient quality of life and satisfaction with surgery, but also reduce health care costs and accelerate return to work. It is therefore important that our patients and physicians are aware of the benefits of a pelvic muscle training program.","15":null,"16":"A collaborative care model between clinical pharmacists (CP) and general practitioners (GPs) for treating patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) has not been described yet in the medical literature in Central Europe. Therefore, the main aim of this paper was compared standard of care and collaborative care model including clinical pharmacist in a systematic review form. A systematic search in Pubmed\/Medline using the terms pharmacist, depression, and primary care in Medline through to September 2016 was conducted to identify randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs). The patient's data for the case report was obtained from the medical records. 23 RCTs were found. In total 3 RCTs were included in this systematic review. Efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms in collaborative care model compared to the standard of care (without clinical pharmacist) were shown in all RCTs. A collaborative care model also showed positive treatment outcomes in case report. This systematic review shows positive treatment outcomes in patients included in collaborative care model compared to current standard of care. This positive case report shows evidence for the effectiveness of a collaborative care model with a CP in a primary care setting. CPs can assist GPs in choosing the appropriate pharmacotherapy.

Devastating earthquakes, 5.5 and 6.2 on Richter scale hit Croatia in 2020 during the brutal pandemic year. Our experience served us as our initial motivation for finding out all clinical outcomes after an earthquake. Previous research has shown increased rates of suicidal thoughts, susceptibility to PTSD and depressive symptomatology. Mental health action plans should be encouraged and well prepared in advance by leading organizations. Studies conducted to date have found that the number of patients with gastric and duodenal ulcers increased as an earthquake aftermath. Other gastrointestinal symptoms were abdominal pain, distension and constipation. Earthquakes provide a good example of how acute stress can trigger cardiovascular events, predominantly through sympathetic nervous activation. Studies conducted to date have found an increased incidence of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, arrhythmias and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

Data collection forms including the SAVE-9 scale, prepared for this cross-sectional study, were converted into online questionnaires and sent to family physicians in order to evaluate and examine the extent of anxiety and stress of family physicians working as family physicians in different provinces of Turkey via e-mails and communication groups between December, 2020 and March, 2021. The responses of 500 family physicians who were accessible in this way and volunteered to participate in the study were recorded to be analysed. Of all the 500 physicians, the SAVE-9 scale was re-administered to the subgroup of 50 family physicians in the post-vaccination period. The responses were compared with those received in the pre-vaccination period. Of all the 500 family physicians in this study, 40.6% of them were found to be in a state of anxiety about the viral epidemic. In particular, the scores of anxiety about the viral epidemic and of work-related stress were found much higher in female physicians and in those reporting that they had inadequate income. While there was a significant decline in the scores of anxiety about the viral epidemic in the subgroup in the post-vaccination period of health care workers, no statistically significant change was found in work-related stress scores. Family physicians have been suffering anxiety due to the pandemic. The vaccination period has a positive impact on anxiety levels. ","33":"While much of the world's attention is focused on the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on physical health, the virus's psychological impacts must not be disregarded. Therefore, it is important to understand and document the role of emotional intelligence as a mitigating variable in the relationship between psychological distress and life satisfaction. This correlational study was carried out with the participation of 483 college students. Their ages ranged from 18 to 31 (X=20.89, Sd=2.27). The hierarchical regression analysis results revealed that both emotional intelligence and psychological distress were statistically significant predictors of the participants' levels of satisfaction with life. Moreover, emotional intelligence was a significant moderator in the relationship between psychological distress and life satisfaction. Researchers and practitioners may find the findings of this study useful in better understanding the role of emotional intelligence in making cognitive assessments of life in the face of hardship.

The article begins with the perspective of Judaism on the tension between individuality and as part of the collective, as one of the direct results of the pandemic outbreak was life in isolation due to closures and fear from infection, a measure that had many implications on our daily life and health. The main part of the article deals with the challenges that the Jewish community faced during the pandemic. The challenges faced by the Jewish Community divided into two categories, general challenges and spiritual challenges. In the general part, the author explores the impact of the pandemic on the Jewish Community, on its structure and the spread of antisemitism. In the other part, regarding spiritual challenges, the author first brings the perspective of Judaism on mental illness and on the mentally ill, then he brings two guiding examples of spiritual challenges faced by the Jewish spiritual leadership during the pandemic.","36":"COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted, in a very inflictive way, the need for less hubristic political leadership, revealing the menaces of arrogant decision making of those in power. Hubris Syndrome is associated with power and it is more likely to manifest itself the longer the person exercises power and the greater the power he exercises, while our modern times 'Hatei' (the goddess that blinded ancient leaders committing hubris) may be called positive illusion enhancement due to prolonged exposure to power. Hatei might also blurs the decision makers' vision through a hormonal pathway, since hormones seem to affect risk taking, as well as through serotonin, which is also involved in the regulation of decision making and processing punishment-related information, deficiencies of which could be relevant to Hubris Syndrome. Other findings may provide information regarding the neuro-anatomical 'location' of Hatei, since fronto-striatal and limbic-striatal dopaminergic pathways have been identified as important regulators of impulsive behaviors. Therefore we might consider choosing political leaders and state officials whose less illusionary character is more likely to become non-flammable against the fire of hubris, in periods of crisis like the current COVID-19 Pandemic. Especially in SARS-CoV-2 era we should bring whatever scientific data there may be to tackle the intoxicating effects of power, keeping also in mind that there are no anti-hubris medication and that it is unlikely to have this social construct improved via pharmacology. Before establishing constitutional procedures for the early diagnosis of hubris as well as for the subsequent constrain of our leaders' power, we should focus on the criteria by which we elect them and maybe include the pre-existence of depressive diathesis among those criteria, especially if we consider that those leaders might have to handle tough situations like the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, that require increased empathy in decision making.","37":"","38":"","39":"","40":"","41":"","42":"","43":"","44":"","45":"","46":"","47":"","48":"The importance of effective health care transitioning of young people from adolescent to adult health services is well established in general and within mental health services in particular.

The aim was to investigate the intervention effect of positive rumination-based sports prescription on the mental health of teenagers. 497 teenagers living in four communities randomly selected in Guangxi, China community from February 2021 to August 2021 were included in this study using convenience sampling method. Firstly, Beck Depression Inventory was adopted for measurement, and 61 volunteers were randomly selected from a population of depressive symptoms to participate in intervention. There were 29 people the Experimental group, 32 in the control group. The intervention using positive rumination-based sports prescription was performed on the Experimental group. After intervention, the depression score of the control group and the Experimental group was lower than that before intervention (P&lt;0.001).

This cross-sectional study was performed on a consecutive sample of 105 participants, 47 first episode participants and 58 with multiple episodes. Primary outcome was the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP). We observed three independent variables: childhood trauma measured by Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, psychotic symptoms measured by Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and personality dimensions measured by the Inventory of Personality Organization (IPO) (primitive defences, identity diffusion and reality testing). All outcomes were observed among total sample and subgroups of first and multiple episode participants. Median DUP in total sample was 60.0 (IQR 14.5-285) days. In the subgroup of multiple episode participants, an association between multiple childhood trauma and shorter DUP was found, while no association between DUP and the existence of any specific trauma was found in neither subgroup, or in total sample. With regards to personality dimensions, in the first episode subgroup, significant positive correlations between DUP and primitive defences and reality testing subscales were found, while no correlations in total sample, nor in multiple episode subgroup were observed. Positive symptoms and general psychopathology correlated positively with DUP in total sample, and in first episode subgroup, while in multiple episodes subgroup only a positive correlation with positive symptoms was found. Total PANSS score positively correlated with the DUP only in the first episode subgroup. DUP was not associated with specific type of childhood trauma. First episode participants with longer DUP had predominant primitive defences and severely decreased ability to test reality, while there were no correlations between personality dimensions and DUP in multiple episode subgroup. ","55":"The age of 3-6 years is a key period of rapid emotional and behavioral development of children. Family cohesion, adaptation, and parenting style are related to the emotions and behaviors of children. This study aims to discuss the correlations between parenting style and emotional behaviors of children aged 3-6 years. Children aged 3-6 years from kindergartens in Longting District, Kaifeng City, Henan Province, China were selected through cluster sampling method from February to July 2021. A total of 2058 children were collected. Investigation contents include general information of parents and children, emotional behaviors of children, and parenting style. The correlation between parenting style and emotional behaviors of children aged 3-6 years was analyzed using a logistic regression model. Among 2058 children, the detection rate of abnormal emotional behaviors is 18.37% (378\/2058), which is 22.57% (237\/1050) in boys and 13.99% (141\/1008) in girls, indicating statistically significant differences (c2=25.270, P&lt;0.05). Boys exhibit significantly lower parent support\/participation scores than girls (P&lt;0.05), but significantly higher parent hostility\/forcing scores (P&lt;0.05). Children with abnormal emotional behaviors exhibit significantly lower parent support\/participation scores than children without abnormal emotional behaviors (P&lt;0.05), but significantly higher parent hostility\/forcing scores (P&lt;0.05). The results of the logistic regression analysis show that parent support\/participation is beneficial to the emotional and social development of children ages 3-6 years (P&lt;0.05). Parental support\/participation is conducive to decreasing abnormal emotional behaviors and improving the emotional social development of children ages 3-6 years. However, parent hostility\/force increases the risk of abnormal behaviors. Hence, improving the bad parenting style is conducive to promoting the healthy social development of emotions of children.

However, studies on the impact of attachment parameters on symptoms of the offspring in childhood are still lacking. We therefore investigated the influence of attachment parameters of the grandparents on those of the parents treated in a psychiatric hospital, and finally on the symptoms of their (grand)children. Furthermore, the impact of attachment factors on parenting style and on resilience of parents and children has been examined. A sample of n=50 mother-child-dyads in an inpatient setting was examined using the questionnaires FEB (Questionnaire on the Parental Attachment; adult and child perspective), RQ2 (Relationship Questionnaire), EFB-K (Educational Questionnaire, short form), RS13 (Resilience Scale; adult and child perspective), and CBCL (Child Behavior Checklist). Regression analyses and correlation analyses were carried out. On grandparents' level, attachment patterns predicted parents' attachment patterns (p=0.012): Grandfather's care (control) behavior correlated with more (less) mother's care for their own children (0.002 (0.005)). Control behavior of the grandfather was negatively correlated with the resilience of their daughters (p=0.033). On parents' level, a secure attachment style predicted a less overreacting parenting style (p=0.004), whereas an anxious-avoiding (p=0.035) or clinging attachment style (p=0.044) predicted an increased overreacting parenting style. On child's level, mental (esp. attentional (p=0.013) and externalizing (p=0.032)) symptoms correlated negatively with the level of care reported by the mother. Functional attachment behavior at the grandparents' level correlated significantly with functional attachment behavior at the parental level, which in turn correlated with reduced mental symptoms at the child's level. The parenting style seems to play a mediator role for the development of attachment between mother and child, with resilience mediating between attachment and the onset of mental disorders. The results point to the crucial role of attachment parameters for mental development with corresponding implications for psychotherapy. ","58":"Medication-induced psychotic disorder (MIPD) is a diagnostic term for a syndrome with symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions directly related to drug intake. The purpose of this review is to report and comment on the current knowledge about pathomechanisms, risk factors, symptoms, and treatment of MIPD caused by selected widely used medications. PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases were searched for articles on MIPD published prior to January 2021 using search terms 'psychosis' OR 'psychotic disorder' AND 'side effects' combined with certain medications group. The initial search was then narrowed to medications with more pathomechanisms than only direct dopamine-inducing activity that are widely used by clinicians of various medical specialties. Steroids, antiepileptic drugs, antimalarial drugs, and antiretroviral drugs can induce psychosis with persecutory delusions and auditory hallucinations as the most frequently reported symptoms. Mood changes and anxiety may precede psychosis after steroids and antimalarials. Psychiatric history and female sex are risk factors for most of the MIPD. Treatment involves cessation of the suspected drug. Administration of atypical antipsychotic drugs may be helpful, although there is insufficient data to support this approach. The latter should be done with careful consideration of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions. MIPD is a rare condition. The appearance of psychotic symptoms during systemic treatment may be associated with administered medications, psychiatric comorbidity, or be a part of the clinical picture of a certain disorder. Furthermore, sometimes it may be challenging to distinguish MIPD from delirium. Therefore, we consider that the key to proper management of MIPD is a thorough differential diagnosis. ","59":"Love is a delicate experience that delves into the foundations of the psyche, and many sources of the emotional experience of love remain unconscious. The nature of love is twofold and contradictory, regressive and progressive, constructive and destructive, connecting and separating, directed toward the object and the self. The ability to idealize is a precondition for \"falling in love\". Abrupt disappointments can be traumatizing, but gradual ones include the work of mourning and may lead to a more authentic relationship that is less obscured by narcissistic needs. Some aspects of projective identification, which can be a defense, a primitive form of object relation, and a path for psychological change, may be present in all forms of love. These are the close interaction of self and object, blurred boundaries between them, the need that the other person feels what one feels, and a strong desire to continue the relationship. A therapeutic setting can enable the long-term transformation of love in transference and more mature expressions of love in life. The maturation of narcissism is the hallmark of mature love. One of the prerequisites for mature love is a mature superego, which does not require suffering as a prerequisite for satisfying one's needs. Clear differentiation of the boundaries of the self enables safe (temporary) blurring or disappearing of its boundaries and satisfaction of needs for repetition of lost fusion with the primary object of love. Mature love also means the capacity for tolerating ambivalence, i.e., the capacity to integrate both love and hatred experiences of the same person. One can see love as a \"glue\" that helps integrate different aspects of the psyche into a harmonious whole.","60":"","61":"","62":"","63":"","64":"","65":"","66":"Ibn Sina (Avicenna) is primarily known for his philosophy and medicine, but there is almost no scientific discipline in which this great man didn't leave a significant mark.

These works contain synthesis of all Greek, Indian and Iranian medical schools, but also new breakthroughs achieved by Muslim scholars through their own experimentation and practice. Although he wrote many medical works, his most important one is El-Kanun fit-tib, which can be translated as The Canon of Medicine. It's made out of five books which systematically show everything known in the area of medicine up until that point in time. In it, Ibn Sina discusses, among other things, the structure of psychological apparatus of human being and the connection of psychological functions with the brain as well as the role of psyche in etiology of somatic diseases. He also describes certain psychiatric diseases along with the explanation of their etiology and recommended therapy. He considered psychology to be very important for medicine, so in his psychological works he discusses, in great detail, the essence of human soul, consciousness, intellect and other psychological functions.","67":"In this paper authors described some of the principles and theses of Hippocratic medicine. They emphasized that regardless existing controversial opinions as to whether Hippocrates stated some theses or not, and controversial views on some of his principles, he is often called the \"father\" of medicine, who laid the foundations in medicine as a science. Hippocrates gave recommendations on the doctor's behavior towards the patient, which is relevant up today. His holistic approach to medicine is becoming more and more relevant in the modern medicine. The application of the Hippocratic Oath today depends on the legislation of individual states, related to how legal solutions in some states are pro or contra to it. Authors opened and discussed his attitudes that mental illnesses are a sign of a diseased brain, his consideration the food as medicine and that the disease came from the intestines. Also issue of prognosis of the disease was opened and discussed as well as and Hippocrates's consideration of work and physical activity as the most appropriate medicine. Furthermore, authors considered importance of Hippocratic medicine related to Creative psychopharmacotherapy based on therapeutic communication and the creative satisfaction of needs in the therapeutic relationship with patients and in the recovery itself.

It is considered the most-used plant-based psychoactive substance with millions of different usages across the world. To review what the studies, conducted over the past two decades, indicate about effects of the cannabis on physical and mental health as well as the impact on social functioning. We selected literature review using PubMed resources, to summarize the findings of the existing publications on cannabis and cannabinoids and their possible psychopharmacological therapeutic effects only. Research supports cannabis' clear acute effect on neurocognition, while non-acute effects for prolonged use of marijuana are unclear and still insufficiently explored. Due to cannabidiol's (CBD) safety and tolerability, the absence of psychoactive or cognitive effects, the existence of clinical trials with positive results and its broad pharmacological spectrum, CBD is a cannabinoid whose initial results will likely lead to implementation into clinical practice. The fact that the results of previous studies establish the claim of CBD as an antipsychotic and anxiolytic, makes the above developments even more likely. However, long-term, double-blind, placebo studies with samples of patients with different psychotic and anxiety disorders are still necessary. Likewise, due to CBD's biphasic effects, determining an adequate therapeutic dose remains a challenge to conclude, the cannabinoid system represents a promising target for new therapeutic interventions in psychiatry. Further controlled studies are essential to determine the precise mechanisms of action of cannabinoids on various neuropsychiatric disorders as well as the safety of their use are needed. Never just the use of 'smoking cannabis in an unlicenced way'. The use of simple 'smoked cannabis' remains dangerous because of the effects on inducing psychosis which the article itself refers to, and needs to remain illegal.

High prescribing rates of anxiolytics may be indicative of higher prevalence of anxiety-related phenomena in a given society, either in a form of an anxiety disorder or as pressure on physicians to keep prescribing them, against current guidelines. We inspected prescribing rates of anxiolytics in 21 European countries and compared them with six dimensions of Hofstede's cross-cultural framework, namely uncertainty avoidance (UAI), power distance (PD), individualism (IDV), masculinity (MAS), long-term orientation (LTO) and indulgence (IND). According to our findings, anxiolytic prescribing patterns in selected European countries correlate positively with Hofstede's dimensions of UAI and PD and negatively with IDV. Differences in prescribing rates of anxiolytics and trends in their use may be affected by cross-cultural factors. More research is needed to shed light on these regional differences in anxiolytic prescribing. ","72":"Depressive disorders in pregnancy are common and generate concerns regarding their treatment.

Selective serotonine reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first choice of treatment of depressive disorders. However, there are some concerns which should be adressed. The aim of this systematic review is to explore the SSRI usage in pregnancy. We studied the latest literature in the PubMed databases and recommendations from the guidelines. Decision to treat depression in pregnancy should be taken with careful consideration of many factors.

Treatment should include care for the mental health of women of childbearing age, pregnancy planning, during the prenatal period, and then during the postpartum period. The authors highlighted creative psychopharmacotherapy which is the foundation of holistic and integrative treatment of mental disorders. They emphasize the significant role of the mother in the emotional development of the child, which begins while the child is still in the womb. Mothers who stop taking psychotropic drugs during pregnancy have an increased risk of recurrence of the mental disorder after childbirth because the mother's psychiatric illness is not a benign event and can cause significant morbidity for both the mother and her child, therefore, discontinuation or denial of medication during pregnancy is not always the safest option. For more serious disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and severe depression, medications may be needed during pregnancy and lactation, despite complex evidence based on the effects of psychotropic medications on the fetus and newborn. Perinatal mental health has become a significant focus of interest in recent years. The randomized controlled examinations provide evidence of the effectiveness of psychological and psychosocial interventions at the individual level. It is necessary to make a new conceptual shift in the approach to maintaining the mental health of pregnant women and newborns, and that is to optimize the mental health of pregnant women, and not simply reduce the symptoms of mental disorders from which they suffer before conception, during pregnancy and after childbirth. Dilemmas and challenges of psychopharmacotherapeutic treatment in the prenatal period are intensified by the knowledge that the psychological difficulties of mothers can significantly affect the integrity of the safe relationship between mother and child, which is essential for the emotional, cognitive, and behavioral development of the child. Often, these problems existed before pregnancy or occurred during pregnancy, and they are often the deterioration of the mental state due to discontinuation of pharmacotherapy during this period. The quality of the biopsychosocial milieu in the fetal period and childhood during the early neuroplastic development phase is one of the determinants of risk for diseases during the life cycle. For this reason, the mental health of pregnant women and mothers must be optimized. For many of these women, health is optimized with pharmacotherapy.","74":"Paediatric psychopharmacology involves the application of psychotropic agents to the treatment of children and adolescents with mental disorders and gathered knowledge from child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP), neurology, paediatrics and pharmacology. Defining elements of this discipline are: the metabolism of drugs is different in children than in adults (pharmacokinetics), the developing brain reacts specifically to the drug (pharmaco dynamics), and psychopathology itself is not differentiated yet. To make and overview of specifics in psychopharmacological use in CAP and emphasize some experiences from Bosnia and Herzegovina in that field. Through insight in current literature, we presented comprehensive findings and compare it with situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The most common conditions in which psycho pharmaceuticals are used in CAP were attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD), depressive and bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder and the treatment of early psychosis. Psycho pharmaceuticals were also used to treat agitated conditions in various causes. We made an overview of psycho pharmaceuticals use in Bosnia and Herzegovina CAP and emphasized the fact that psycho stimulants are not approved for the use yet, although they are mostly prescribed medicament in CAP over the world. That limits us in the effectiveness of the treatment in ADHD and put us in the situations to use other medicaments instead (anxiolytics, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers) which are not approved for that condition. The use of psycho pharmacotherapy in CAP is justified in cases where it is necessary to reduce the suffering of children and to improve their functionality at the time when cognitive, social and emotional advancement is most pronounced. Further research and clinical monitoring of efficacy and safety in the use of psycho pharmaceuticals in youngsters are necessary. ","75":"Modern psychiatric treatment is largely dictated by national and international guidelines rested on evidence-based data, including psychopharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. An alternative to the rigid application of official guidelines and criterion for the standards of treatment in psychiatric practice is the concept of creative psychopharmacotherapy. It is a concept based on the integration of different approaches to a person as whole, mental disorders and their treatment into person-centered clinical practice. In this sense, group psychotherapy and creative psychopharmacotherapy today are part of the overall integrative efforts in psychiatry. Neuroscientific discoveries suggest that they share similar neural pathways that lead to changes in brain function and symptoms relief. Various integrative elements make group psychotherapy and psychopharmacotherapy in combination more effective and efficient. The integration of the concept of creative psychopharmacotherapy and group psychotherapy into everyday clinical practice can improve treatment options as well as clinical practice by creating opportunities for research and development of new modalities of overall treatment.","76":"The concept of a script in Transactional Analysis (TA) can be considered as the basis for the occurrence and duration of mental disorders. As such, a script change can be the solution leading to improved mental health and well-being. In addition to redecision therapy, offered by TA, there are other techniques for changing the script. One of them is the psychotherapeutic technique, The Hero's Journey, by Robert Dilts, developed from Joseph Campbell's idea of a single myth; i.e. a monomyth, which is in fact the narrative of all narratives. It is this model of all myths that is actually a story about the meaning of life, which is exactly what gives the patient the power to achieve the goal. This goal is also the cornerstone of all existential psychotherapeutic modalities. Life can be viewed as a journey in which each chooses their own path by choosing their own goals, in any sphere of life; private, professional, or other. Misalignment of goals or failure to achieve them can cause mental disorders, leading to a loss of the meaning of life and with this loss, one's goals. When illness appears on the journey, the treatment itself becomes the journey. By applying personalized psychopharmacotherapy and removing the symptoms of the disease, further treatment aims to help the patient enter stabilization and socialization. In this phase of treatment, the hero's journey becomes a therapeutic journey. Through setting new goals and thus changing the meaning of life, the patient is introduced to the last phase of disease prevention, where health becomes a life goal through metaphors of achieving various personal goals. The synergy of both approaches can bring the patient into a state of remission that becomes a permanent state as the patient has established their own goals, felt fulfilled and found their own meaning and purpose in life using motivation, creativity and their forgotten or neglected resources and potentials.","77":"\"Narative medicine\" promotes theraputic healing and recovery using fairy tales and traditional folk stories. Individuals are capable of shaping their lives through various narrative strategies and re-authoring alternative stories that are concerned with different aspects of acceptance and change. Psychotherapy through the eyes of stories and fairy tales can have two perspectives. Firstly, fairy tale acts like a weft around which the very story\/script of the patient is formed, which in itself becomes the basis for interpreting the occurrence of a mental disorder. The second perspective is the perspective of healing or getting out of a \"fairytale\" story\/script by changing an incoherent life narrative into an alternative coherent narrative (reframing). The aim of this pilot case studies approach was to use a narrative approach based on stories and fairy tales in order to promote psychological growth, meaning in life, resilience, self-realization and improved well-being and highlight the dialectic of recovery, an interplay of acceptance and change (reframing). With properly applied personalized narrative psychopharmacotherapy, the patient is capable of changing their beliefs in order to reach a new meaning of life, and thus to facilitate the lowering of symptomatology, its dissaperance and possibly even a cure, whatever that may mean for an individual. Considering its promising results, clinical implications and possible further applications are discussed.","78":"Addiction does not mean \"addiction to substances\" only. At the core of the definition of substance dependence is the loss of control. Gambling addiction belongs to non-substance \/ non-chemical addictions or behavioral\/behavioral addictions. The concept of behavioral addictions is new and revolutionary in psychiatry. Gambling addiction, formerly pathological or problematic gambling occurs due to loss of control over gambling. There is growing evidence to suggest that behavioral addictions resemble substance addictions in many domains, including phenomenology, tolerance, comorbidity, overlapping genetic contribution, neurobiological mechanisms, and response to treatment. Behavioral addiction has been proposed as a new class in the Diagnostic Statistical Manual Fifth Revision (DSM-5), but the only category included is gambling addiction. The prevalence of gambling disorders in adolescence is very high and for certain disorders (especially related to the use of the Internet) it becomes more pronounced over time. In this paper, we presented a comprehensive overview of gambling disorders from definition, epidemiology, manifestations, comorbidities, assessment, treatment options, and existing forms of treatment. Given the complexity of the approach to the treatment of gamblers, a creative individualized integrative approach is necessary, which is the basis of creative psychopharmacotherapy. Due to the possibility of the emergence of problem gambling and other impulse-control deficits we need to be very careful when commencing a patient on dopamine replacement therapy or therapy with aripiprazole.","79":"Ketamine, synthesized in 1962, approved in 1970, is considered safe for use in controlled conditions, mainly as an anesthetic, especially in pediatric populations and in people suffering from pulmonary diseases, as well as in emergency departments and in war situations. Dissociative states (derealization and depersonalization) produced by ketamine made it a popular recreational drug, which led to increased regulation in most countries. Intravenous application of ketamine has shown rapid, although transitory antidepressant and antisuicidal effects in patients with unipolar and bipolar depression. Esketamine, the S(+) enantiomer of ketamine, with better pharmacodynamic selectivity, has just been approved for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, in the form of a nasal spray. Presently, the high cost of the spray not only limits its widespread use, but also makes it less prone to abuse and diversion.

Resistant schizophrenia is a condition diagnosed after no response is noticed to two different antipsychotics of which one is atypical. The treatment has to be undertaken with adequate doses and duration of therapy. Clozapine is the golden standard in the treatment of therapy-resistant schizophrenia. It has shown its superiority among other antipsychotics in various studies. Aside from greater effectiveness, advantages include absence of extrapyramidal side effects. During clozapine treatment, regular blood tests should be performed as a screening method for agranulocytosis. Twenty to thirty percent od schizophrenia patients suffer from treatment resistant schizophrenia. Sixty percent of the latter ones show no therapeutic response to clozapine. In conclusion twelve to eighteen percent of all patients suffering from schizophrenia show no response to any form of treatment. Attempts to augment clozapine effectiveness are being made by increasing the dose of monotherapy, using antipsychotic polipharmacy or adding other types of drugs to clozapine. Unfortunately, these augmentation methods have not yet proven themselves to be effective enough to be added to standard therapy algorythms. On the other hand, electroconvulsive therapy is neuromodulatory method that shows promise in increasing therapeutic success. Although many methods of treatment are being researched, therapy-resistant schizophrenia remains a clinical challenge which affects a significant percentage of population and will require additional research.","82":"The new classification systems in psychiatry have dressed both patients and psychiatrists in completely new attire. One (DSM -5) is widely used and critics are hardly at peace with the psychiatry of normal living conditions and phenomena and a missed opportunity to 'save the normal'. The second attire is still standing on the mold in tailoring salon in Geneva (ICD-11) and is being ornamented by the online testing through a global network of clinical practice, now around 15,000 clinicians and mental health professionals, before it is distributed to psychiatrists worldwide. The objective is to (be) treated better and to keep quiet. We remain silent for fear, shame and insecurity in the face of devastating tendencies in the modern world. Unprocessed traumas and mourning from the past in current global setting support various mental disorders. Trauma leaves strong emotions, so if it has not been processed and the loss has not been mourned, these charged emotions get the characteristics of emotional volcanoes or timed bombs that are easily activated. Unprocessed group trauma among political or ideological leaders can become a means of strong manipulation of the masses. And the 'masses' are immersed, globally, in the mentalization of cognitive achievement at the expense of the emotional principle. By forcing competitiveness, perfectionism and narcissism, people try to 'be successful' at all costs. Perfectionism is a phenomenon that, under the influence of scientific and technological progress, computerization and globalization, increasingly affects the psychosocial development, functioning of the individual and society as a whole. Perfectionism is increasingly associated with anxiety and affective disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, eating disorders, and suicidality. Virtual reality, virtual sexuality, pornography, pervasive alienation and loneliness create a position of shame and cultural discomfort, which is so far the price of conformism. But in the Manichean prism, we might also call the new age an era of shamelessness and perversion in the broader sociocultural context leaving open the key question: \"Can modern civilization avoid self-destruction?\"","83":"In this paper, we focused on the complexity of diagnosis in psychiatry and problems during its communication, and its acceptance \/ non-acceptance, both by the patient and family members of the patient, which has a significant impact on the success of treatment. It is not uncommon for somatic diseases to be related to mental illness, which due to damage to certain organs requires adequate psychiatric therapy. The treatment process is a joint agreement between the patient, his \/ her family members and the psychiatrist regarding the explanation of the illness, how to take the medication and the agreement with the patient about the psychotherapy that would suit him \/ her best. Psychosocial support to the patient(s) is also very important in the treatment of psychiatric patients, because only with such support do we empower sick people, their families and the social environment, and the result is successful treatment and reintegration into everyday life in the community.","84":"A good\/beautiful word in creative psychopharmacotherapy offers: an environment for purposeful activities, such as creative work, structured work, enjoying the nature of essence and existence; and a feeling of security and safety, according to which it is necessary to act with respect and dignity, and permit the development of a feeling of belonging, value and trust; it is necessary to have time to express one's feelings to other members with sympathy, and active listening; the opportunity and encouragement for developing feelings and drawing conclusions from experience, including illness and its treatment; receiving permission and encouragement to develop a relationship with God or the Absolute; enable people to experience holiness, regardless of the time, place and privacy for prayer and worship; spiritual education, encouragement in faith, a feeling of universal connection and forgiveness.","85":"It is well known that emotions have always attracted the special attention of both laymen and scientists because life without emotions is unthinkable. Emotions prepare us for all life circumstances regardless of their qualities and intensities. Reviewing the available literature, the authors described the phenomenon of emotional contamination and its importance in interpersonal relationships with a focus on \"infecting\" other people's emotions. Research has shown that individuals mimic facial expressions as well as other emotional reactions of others by emotional contamination in interaction with another person manifesting emotional behavior, and in such situations mimic model reactions, with the perception of their own reactions eliciting an appropriate emotional state. They stressed the importance of patient's perceptions of the emotions of the physicians treating them and the caring attitude that is crucial to contributing to treatment outcomes in clinical practice. Specific expectations between the patient and his physician, when they meet and achieve a physician-patient relationship, reduce uncertainty, and play a useful and crucial role in healing. A caring emotional practitioner who can effectively connect with patients is a huge boon to health. The connection of emotional contamination with creative psychopharmacotherapy and with several therapeutic options is especially described, determined in different ways either through narrative psychopharmacotherapy, through assertive and positive communication, creating a favorable and positive therapeutic relationship whereby a partnership is created, which together leads to the main goal, which is the successful treatment of the patient to the mutual satisfaction. It is useful for patients to have a doctor who spends more time with them and listens carefully and, with adequate emotions, strongly and effectively facilitates treatment. They conclude that emotional contamination is a phenomenon that happens every day in life, especially in specific situations, and that it is up to professionals to use this type of therapeutic opportunity and assistance in the right way to help their patients and be creative in a psychopharmacotherapeutic sense.","86":"Since it is generally known that the human body is the best image of the human soul, this paper aims to explain how important body language is when diagnosing psychiatric diagnosis \"depression\". It is important to point out the importance of other alternative approaches in the treatment of depression when standard psychopharmacotherapy is not enough. Body language is a powerful form of non-verbal communication that provides important traces of intentions, emotions, and motivations in other people. In everyday life, we collect information about what people think and feel by their body posture, manners, and gestures. Evaluations of clinical depression are traditionally based on verbal information. However, non-verbal expressive behavior, related to reflexive feedback of a person, may reveal negative emotional or social processes that are not fully controlled by patients therapy, along with other artistic therapies (art therapy, drama therapy, and music therapy are other artistic therapies that are applied in Great Britain) offers an attractive opportunity for patients because it enables them to work on those issues that are placed on non-verbal and pre-verbal level. Creative psychofarmacotherapy is the concept that involves creativity as its main means. In this context, the importance of physical activity and body movements will be emphasized in the treatment of depression, when regular psychopharmacotherapy is not sufficient. To conclude, the patient has the right to actively take part in creating a therapeutic relationship and responsibly contributes to overcoming psychopathology. The importance of physical activities and body movements is emphasized in the treatment of depressive people. Studies have shown that the anti-depressive effect of physical activity is increased with simultaneous use of antidepressants, as well as that movement therapy and music therapy, together with regular pharmacotherapeutic methods, help with fast recovery and that they can be used in a creative approach to problem-solving.","87":"The concept of mentalization is relatively new in modern psychiatry, whose utilization is expanding daily in working with clients suffering from mental illness. Mentalization enables the incorporation of several different theoretical models and therapeutic techniques into a single whole, which encourages a holistic and integrative approach to treating patients. This theoretical model looks at different spheres of mental states, both the client seeking medical help and the doctor himself in the therapeutic process. Consequently, providing an adequate basis for the creation of a therapeutic\/working alliance, which is imposed in the age of modern psychiatry, as a \"condition without which it is impossible\" to achieve the desired therapeutic response. Therefore, it is necessary to creatively implement treatments while creating a \"therapeutic\/working alliance\" between the patient and the doctor in order to improve the therapeutic response and change the patient's perception.","88":"Psychopharmacotherapy does not stand alone. The act of prescribing involves much more than solely choosing \"best\" medication. It seems that somewhere in the process of trying to objectify and scientify our therapy, we have neglected an important and effective dimensions of it. Psychopharmacology should consider much more than just biological dimension of drugs. Psychological, social and behavioral factors that influence drug metabolism, efficacy and side-effects are largely overlooked. Obviously, the subtext of information provided by the medical professional inevitably contains suggestion. Important part of that subtext is consisted in way we think of it, we talk of it and we perform that information. Defining of preformative and performative psychopharmacotherapy was atempted as well as desciption of narrative creative person-centered psychopharmacotherapy. Studies that indicate that medicines (SSRI) do not work on its own but as amplifier of the influence of the living conditions on mood are provided. Undirected susceptibility to change hypothesis which request acknowledging the importance of social, psychological, environmental factors to explain such the mechanisms underlying the recovery from the disease is explained. Understanding the role of medicines (SSRIs) as amplifier of the influence of the living conditions on mood represents a critical step in developing a creative, person-centered psychopharmacotherapy aimed at better matching patients with treatment and avoiding potential harmful consequences.","89":"Resilience is a complex multidimensional psychobiological concept that researchers define differently depending on the context of their research and theoretical orientation. Resilience indicates the ability of a child or adolescent (person) to adequately deal with problems, to continue to improve, grow and develop, and to successfully adapt to a new situation, regardless of the threats and challenges that characterize the environment. Salutogenesis is a sociomedical concept that focuses on factors that support human health and feelings of satisfaction, rather than on factors that cause disease. Through the salutogenic model, through the sense of coherence as a basic concept and a central resource, through generalized and specific resources of resilience, a person manages to preserve his physical and mental health even in the most difficult life circumstances. Promoting salutogenesis and the search for health factors, not diseases, in the study of children and young people and the importance of the salutogenic health model in times of wars, economic crises, social change, major changes on the planet can be a significant goal of treatment.","90":"A personalized and holistic approach to therapy is increasingly demanding answers to questions related to the meaning of life. Over the years, research has shown a direct link between the presence of meaning in life, health and recovery. It becomes impossible to ignore this connection as well as the issues of spirituality and religiosity that are immersed in the meaning of life. The article presents different definitions of meaning, the relationship of meaning in life and parts of meaning to quality of life, allostasis, stress, pathological conditions and recovery, and finally connecting the points between creative psychopharmacotherapy and meaning. A complementary approach to the meaning of life implies a desire for a clear, reliable understanding of three related but different dimensions: continuity (as opposed to fragmentation), purpose (as opposed to pointlessness), and value (as opposed to worthlessness). Creating personal meaning in life structures can provide a context for understanding and integrating stressful situations. Finding meaning means connecting, meaning are the expected connections and associations that human beings see in their world. In this aspect, the construction of meaning is a dimension that we impose on the world. Each person's ability is to decide what makes their life meaningful. The meaning of life is a changing cognitive-emotional framework, directly accessible to subjective assessment based on one's own needs and values. The art of living is to discover in though and painful life situations their true meaning, values and meaning of life, and thus health and disease. Creative psychopharmacotherapy can be used to help patients discover and explore the sensation of meaning, create a new meaning in life, a new life story, manifest their potential through recovery. Mental disorders present a chance to break with misplaced life goals and values and turn to authentic values through new forms of thinking, experiencing, behaving, and creating a successful life.","91":"Modern psychopharmacotherapy is a hot and controversial topic, glorified by some and vilified by others within the field of psychiatry that is by itself deeply divided and stigmatized. Mental disorders are multifactorial and polygenic phenomena with polymorphic clinical manifestations and poorly defined endophenotypes. They are characterized with high rate of morbidity, comorbidity, disability, mortality, and treatment failures. These relentless and commonly tragic disorders represent heavy burden on patients, their families and society and there is an urgent need to improve treatment successfulness in psychiatry. The best treatments are those that utilize and integrate multiple modalities. The time is ripe for psychiatry to find its transdisciplinary integrative soul and increase treatment effectiveness. Creation and fostering hope, meaning, personal responsibility, spirit of optimism and commitment can significantly contribute to overall positive response to pharmacotherapy, but in the other way round drug treatment can contribute to creation and fostering hope, meaning, personal responsibility, spirit of optimism and commitment. This paper addresses the concept of creative person-centered narrative psychopharmacotherapy (CP-CNP) as a transdisciplinary integrative strategy for improvement of the therapeutic effectiveness in patients with mental disorders. CP-NCP represents a set of tools that can allow higher effectiveness and efficiency in treatment of major mental disorders in a systemic way.","92":"","93":"There is a gap in existing literature regarding Over the Top (OTT) platform use contributing to the excessive and problematic screen time. We aimed to assess OTT platform use among college students and its associations with increased screen time, mental well-being, COVID-19 related anxiety and personality traits. A total of 1039 students from a college in India were invited to participate in this web-based survey. A majority of participants used OTT platforms regularly. Subscription to paid OTT platforms, poor mental well-being were associated with problematic OTT use; whereas personality trait of conscientiousness seemed to offer protection against problematic OTT use.","94":"Until recent times, healthcare specialists lagged behind other fields in terms of computer networks and software usage, partly because they were uncomfortable with information and communication technologies. The rapid development of personal wearables, their easier connections with smartphones and other similar devices, and the possibilities of online or cloud storage of personal medical data led to improvements of eHealth services in terms of ease of access and reduced costs of delivery. The current research aimed to fill a research gap regarding attitudes towards e-Health during the COVID-19 pandemic in three Balkan countries: Greece, Bulgaria, and Romania. A total number of 775 adult participants (healthcare professionals and students in the field) were contacted in the winter of 2020 and asked to complete a questionnaire regarding their e-Health attitudes. The Greek participants had the most negative attitudes toward e-Health services. This may be due to forced use of eHealth applications during the pandemic crisis and the need for mastering the necessary technical skills to use them. It should be noted that in the scientific literature no research is found on this topic, therefore it is the first study aimed to assessing and comparing attitudes towards eHealth in these countries.

A survey of 210 participants, 86 (41%) doctors, 124 (59%) nurses, were included in our study. When we evaluate the Beck anxiety levels, the majority of the participants (44%) were normal, while about one third had mild anxiety. When we evaluated the acute stress scale, all participants had a certain amount of stress levels. The majority (80 people each (38%)) experienced mild and moderate acute stress.

As the pandemic spread, cancer patients were immediately recognized as a high-risk population with regard to COVID-19 infection. Moreover, epidemiological measures, like social distancing and lockdowns, additionally burdened patients with cancer. Even outside pandemic breast cancer patients are prone to psychological distress with prevalence ranging approximately 20-40%. This multicentric study aimed to examine the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the level of distress among breast cancer patients in Croatia while the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. Fife hundred forty-five breast cancer patients were offered to participate in the study. A total of two hundred and one patient, with disease stages ranging I-IV, completed the questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of disease and socio-demographic characteristics followed by the Distress Thermometer and a problem list. The cut off value of 4 was used to define the high level of distress within Distress Thermometer. High distress level was reported in 54.2% of patients. The most significant problems reported by the participants of our study affected emotions, causing worry, sadness, depression, fear, and nervousness. Additionally, specific practical problems emerged (e.g., child care, housing, and work\/school), most probably partly due to the lockdowns and social distancing. Interestingly enough, none of the socio-demographic or disease characteristics were linked to the level of distress. During first wave of COVID-19 pandemic more than half of breast cancer patients, undergoing active oncologic treatment, experienced a high level of distress. Therefore, distress driven by the COVID-19 pandemic should be promptly addressed and additional psychological and social support, targeting specific practical and emotional problems, should be provided for those patients.

With the development of a holistic approach, midwives have become continuous support during pregnancy and childbirth. Childbirth education is an intervention that affects delivery outcomes and the experience of childbirth. Music therapy has been proven to be a safe and effective non - pharmacological method to gain in pregnancy and puerperium. The study aimed to prove the impact of educating pregnant women and listening to classical music on the experience of childbirth pains and the occurrence of psychological symptoms during puerperium. A prospective randomized controlled trial (n=198) was conducted. The experimental group of pregnant women was educated during pregnancy and listened to classical music the rest of the pregnancy, while the control group received the usual care. The VAS scale was used to assess pain, and the 90 - point scale was used to assess the incidence of psychological symptoms. The difference in pain assessment between the experimental and control groups was significant (p&lt;0.001). The experimental group rated their childbirth pain as moderate (M=5.98), while the control group experienced severe pain (M=8.42). A significant difference in the incidence of psychological symptoms between groups was found in the dimensions of interpersonal sensitivity, hostility, phobic anxiety, and paranoid ideations (p=0.042; p=0.014; p=0.013; p=0.008). This study demonstrated the impact of midwifery education and listening to classical music on the perception of childbirth pain and mental health in the puerperium. The experimental group rated childbirth pain significantly lower compared to the control group and had significantly fewer psychological symptoms 6 weeks after delivery. ","119":"This study aimed to examine the results of Acceptance of Cosmetic Surgery Scale among the Croatian population and its correlations with other scales and demographic data. The sample consisted of 420 people who voluntarily filled out an online questionnaire. They completed demographic questions and four scales: Acceptance of Cosmetic Surgery Scale (ACSS), Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), and Body Appreciation Scale-2 (BAS-2). ACSS scale showed five statistically significant differences between genders and a higher overall score in women, but no significant differences were recorded in three ACSS subscales and the overall ACSS score. In contrast to men, women respondents recorded a significant negative correlation between ACSS subscales score (Social, Consider) and BAS-2 and Satisfaction with life score, while a positive correlation was recorded with BMI. The ACSS score among the Croatian population was higher than the results among the Italian and Serbian population, and similar to the original American study, which tells us that the Croatian population accepts and considers cosmetic surgery a lot. Furthermore, our results are important for practitioners and patients because they revealed correlations between ACSS scores and the self-thinking scale. ","120":"Although it was previously shown that prolonged prophylactic antibiotic exposure and multiple inadequate antibiotic therapies are independent risk factors for multidrug-resistant ventilator associated pneumonia there were no studies investigating whether pre-operative prophylactic dose of antibiotics changes oral microbiome and increases the risk of ventilator associated pneumonia. The aim of the study was to determine if pre-operative prophylactic dose of antibiotics affects the oral microbiome, increases the colonization with Gram-negative bacteria and subsequent risk of ventilator associated pneumonia. Mechanically ventilated adult patients receiving surgical antibiotic prophylaxis were included in the study. The presence of Gram negative microorganisms in the pre-prophylactic and post-prophylactic oral swabs and tracheal aspirates, as well as the occurrence of ventilator associated pneumonia, were analyzed. Number of patients colonized with Gram negative bacteria in post- prophylactic oral swab was significantly higher compared to oral swab taken before prophylactic antibiotic. On the other hand, the number of patients with Gram- negative bacteria in tracheal aspirates remained similar as in post- prophylactic oral swabs. Moreover, we found that presence of Gram- negative bacteria in both pre- and post- prophylactic oral swabs was in the positive correlation with the presence of Gram- negative bacteria in tracheal aspirates. This study showed increased colonization of oral cavity with Gram- negative bacteria after preoperative prophylactic antibiotics. Furthermore, receiving two prophylactic antibiotics from WHO Watch list increased the incidence of Gram- negative bacteria in oral swabs and tracheal aspirates, and the risk of ventilator associated pneumonia development. ","121":"The most common clinical sign in pediatric cardiology is heart murmur, which can often be uncharacteristic. The aim of this research was to present the results of development of a classifier based on machine learning algorithms whose purpose is to classify organic murmur that occur in congenital heart defect (CHD). The study is based on the data collected at Pediatric Clinic, Clinical Center University of Sarajevo during three-year period. Totally, 116 children aged from 1 to 15 years were enrolled in the study. Input parameters for classification are parameters obtained during basic physical examination and assessment of patient. First, analysis of relevance of the feature for classification was done using InfoGain, GainRatio, Relief and Correlation method. In the second step, classifiers based on Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine were developed and compared by performance. The results of this research suggest that high accuracy (&gt;90%) classifier for detection of CHD based on 16 parameters can be developed. Such classifier with appropriate user interface would be valuable diagnostic aid to doctors and pediatricians at primary healthcare level for diagnostic of heart murmurs.","122":null,"123":"In previous studies, the relationship between career choice and psychological factors has been discussed many times. On the other hand, we have less information about interaction between early maladaptive schemas and career choice. We planned to evaluate the specialty preferences of doctors in the perspective of schema theory. Doctors from the 2 to 10 years of their careers were included in the study. A Sociodemographic data form and Young Schema Questionnaire - Short Form 3 was applied to 275 participants; 167 clinical specialties and 108 surgical specialties. According to our results surgeons scored higher in emotional deprivation, mistrust \/ abuse, social isolation \/ alienation, defectiveness \/ shame, and emotional inhibition. As schema domains, surgeons scored higher disconnection and rejection and excessive responsibility and standards. Early maladaptive schemas can affect the choice of profession and the ability to adapt. Understanding early maladaptive schemas can play a role both in orientation towards the right career choice and in resolving negative factors related to the work environment. ","124":"The growing closeness between psychiatry and theology may impact positively the healthcare of the religious psychiatric patients. However, some significant divergences regarding the health care religious methods and the concept and believe in the demonic possession of psychiatric patients continue to shape the relationships between these professionals. While the religions generally admit the demonic or spirit possession as real, the current views of physicians and psychiatric patients are just taken for granted and therefore demands new investigations. In this study, we have performed a targeted survey on this subject. The survey was based on a questionnaire addressed to 216 psychiatrists and 201 non-psychiatrists, and 408 psychiatric patients. For physicians, the questionnaire was randomized sent to hospitals in Romania. The patients received the questionnaire on paper. Except for patients with dementia and those in the acute phase of a psychiatric illness, all psychiatric disorders available at the time of the investigation were randomized included in the study. The results showed that about 20% of physicians and 60% of psychiatric patients considered that demonic possession might be associated to a psychiatric illness, while the later would like a priest in the therapeutic team (89.4%, CI: 0.86-0.92). In addition, the psychiatrists declared a lower attendance of religious services, although the majority would accept a priest in the therapeutic team (p&gt;0.05, CI: 0.61-0.70). These findings invite to a more practical collaboration between psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, and theologians\/priests with training in psychiatry for a more integrative mental care of the religious psychiatric patients. The results call as well for more efficient practical solutions for psychiatric patients, raise awareness towards the personal religious needs and critical beliefs of such patients, and finally might narrow the gap of the controversy between psychiatrists, non-psychiatrists, psychologists and theologians\/priests on the addressed issues. ","125":"Treatment of multiple sclerosis has been a dynamic field lately, with many new and emerging treatment options. In this study, we investigate the use of disease modifying therapies (DMTs) for multiple sclerosis in Croatia. The data on DMT use was provided by the Agency for Medicinal Products and Medical Devices of Croatia (HALMED). The data from 2005 to 2016 was available. Consumption of DMTs (in DDD\/1000\/day) has been increasing by 9% annually on average since 2005. In the same period, the annual cost for those drugs has been increasing by 14.6% annually on average. The consumption of IFN-beta 1-a has been increasing by a much steeper rate than IFN-beta 1-b. Until 2010 the consumption of glatiramer acetate has been negligible, with a steep increase between 2011 and 2014, and a steady rate of consumption since. Recently, several new DMTs became available, namely dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide and fingolimod. Natalizumab became available after 2010, and its consumption has been growing steadily, but its consumption figures are exceeded by alemtuzumab. New DMTs are not as readily available in Croatia as they are in some countries. However, there is a continuous increase in the number of prescriptions, along with growing costs in pharmacological treatment of multiple sclerosis, and this can be expected to become even more pronounced in the following years, due to the abundance of new therapeutic options that are steadily becoming available.","126":"Achalasia is a disorder characterized by insufficient relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter and absent peristalsis. It is usually primary (idiopathic) achalasia, but it can also be secondary achalasia (pseudoachalasia). With a review of the literature, epidemiological data was gathered on achalasia in this paper, and followed up with presented etiopathogenetic mechanisms of achalasia. An optimal diagnostic algorithm along with the therapeutic possibilities in achalasia, from endoscopic to surgical methods of therapy, was analyzed. The most common causes of pseudoachalasia and the mechanisms of this disorder are reported. In patients with dysphagia and suspected achalasia, it is important to distinguish idiopathic achalasia from pseudoachalasia, since pseudoachalasia most often occurs due to tumor infiltrations of the lower esophageal sphincter. In this paper, the importance of a timely and accurate diagnosis of pseudoachalasia in relation to idiopathic achalasia was shown.","127":null,"128":"The review outlines the importance of understanding speech and language difficulties that occur among the first symptoms of frontotemporal dementia, as well as the role of speech therapists in the management of people with frontotemporal dementia. Frontotemporal dementia is one of the most common types of dementia in adults under the age of 65. The main variations of frontotemporal dementia are behavioral, progressive nonfluent aphasia, semantic dementia, and logopenic progressive aphasia. Speech and language difficulties are often among the first indicative signs of frontotemporal dementia, and their proper recognition and understanding play a significant role in the differential diagnosis. Speech and language therapists have to be involved both in the diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia and its treatment to provide the highest quality services to people with dementia and their carers.","129":"Cognitive dysfunction appears all through the course of multiple sclerosis (MS). Mild and moderate cognitive impairment is present in up to 40% of MS patients and severe cognitive decline affects more than 50% of patients in progressive course of the disease. The most common cognitive disorders in MS include diminished information processing speed, compromised word fluency, complex attention deficit and executive dysfunction. In this mini review, we present the reader with the most common neuropsychological assessments for the evaluation of cognition in MS, addressing the question of cognitive relapse. Source of data presented in this review is PubMed search of the recently published literature on cognitive decline in MS. Patients with cognitive relapse often fail to meet diagnostic criteria for classical relapse in MS. Although, cognitive decline relates poorly to functional disability in MS, it correlates well with neuropsychological testing and with neuroimaging parameters of the disease. Cognitive decline might be considered as additional indicator of MS activity, and therefore evaluated routinely, irrespective of clinical presentation. Brief cognitive assessment, with confirmed psychometric qualities, might be useful in detection of cognitive relapse in MS patient.

The authors analyse the causes of such a perception of the Croatian judicial system, especially the length of criminal proceedings in high profile cases, and try to evaluate it by comparing available statistical information concerning the judiciary in Croatia with that of other EU countries. The authors also take into account and describe the effect which contemporary issues like news coverage by increasingly partisan media have on public perception of the judicial system, and polarization of public opinion on key social and legal matters. In conclusion, the authors give an overview of recent studies which found that corruption has a detrimental effect on mental health.","131":"The media are certainly in the service of health - following it with their information, advice, statistics, discoveries, innovations. There is a well-known saying that health is the greatest wealth. Being healthy and taking care of one's health is a good thing. This article presents the media in the service of health and health care. The World Health Organization stresses that the media should cooperate with health services in promoting health. The introduction emphasizes the growing presence and availability of media in daily life, as well as its relevance in health education. In doing so, people of different ages, occupations and education are informed about health and advised about healthy living. The article goes on to discuss the importance of the media in the world. The media have various roles: information, education, instruction, and entertainment, but in doing so they must be ethical. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines health as a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the simple absence of disease or infirmity. The article then discusses the importance of health in our lives. The mass media reaches a great number of readers, listeners, and viewers each day with up-to-date and varied information, making them the most essential source of information regarding health and a healthy living. They transmit information from the sender (doctors, experts, and institutions) to the recipient - the people themselves. Health awareness strongly influences the care and treatment of individuals. There is talk of cooperation between the media and health care institutions in the function of improving people's health. Physician-media communication was also analyzed, contributing to better information on health and the health system. The article provides valuable information and guidance concerning the relationship between health and the media. The article concludes with a discussion of the media during the COVID-19 pandemic. Research is cited showing that demand for media content increased during the pandemic. The media has a critical role to play in alerting the public about the pandemic, the disease's progress, and how to battle COVID-19. Unfortunately, the media has had a harmful influence on human health, particularly the propagation of fear, panic, and excitement, as well as cardiac and mental illnesses. The media inundates the public with varied facts on the proliferation of COVID-19 in Croatia and throughout the world with daily news broadcasts.","132":"A main aim of this paper is to critically turn to the cruciallity, and inevitability of the transdisciplinary approach in the context of the contemporary psychopathological stances of the individuals. In this paper, transdisciplinarity will be observed as a kind of necessity in the broadly differentiated disciplinarity of the modern societies. A given disciplinarity of the particular exacts sciences, in its self-sufficiency and the distance (paralaxis) from the other particular disciplines is forfeiting from sight a consciousness (and the self-consciousness) regarding the necessity of the focusing to the research object universality. Authors will propose thesis that transdiciplinarity is the shift towards the consciousness regarding the research object as the fundamental segment of the science. Following the given context, contemporary disciplinary boarders should be set a side and approach a certain phenomena un-hierarhically, through all the available scientific methods. In the frame of such placed predispositions of science, contemporary issue of more and more frequently presence of the neurotic must inevitably include psychiatric and psychological knowledge as the base, but certainly the sociological and philosophical knowledge as well, in the context of understanding etiology, socio-genesis and psychogenesis of the certain issue in the most adequate way. Only when the excluding hierarchisation of the disciplines, in the context of understanding the neurotical disorders, is set aside, a true impacts of the science can come to the fore. A given certainly includes analysis of the sociocultural context, psychosocial development of the individual, ethical social norming, development of the ones spirit and self of its own beingness, as well as the various development issues of the physiological structures of the human brain. In the given context, in this paper we will discuss a transdisciplinary synthesis of the psycho-therapeutical approaches along with the original sociological-philosophical variants of the socio-therapy.","133":"In this paper we see the personality of man through his comprehension as a moral entity. An entity that emerges, thinks morally and\/or behaves morally, inseparable from the society in which he lives as a moral being, and by its moral thinking and\/or behaviour further defines the morals of the whole society. Accordingly, we present (post)modern society as a society of tolerance of value ambiguity. In that kind of society we perceive medical situation as moral situation and define the role of medical ethics in the field of biomedicine. In that kind of society politics is perceived as one of the social spheres where different varieties of systems of values of individuals or groups are publicly embraced, touched, or terribly unhappily pursued... all in the name of understanding man and his world. In order to prevent the victory of Thanatos, who prevails in the contemporary concept of politics and in postmodern global society, we suggest implementing applied bioethics as a form of metapolitics as an answer. We explain the idea of bioethics and suggest bioethical education as the operationalisation of metapolitics through bioethics as orientation knowledge, in both medicine and politics.","134":"The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between religiosity and liberal versus conservative attitudes about sex. The study involved 1287 residents of Montenegro over the age of 18, of which 848 women and 439 men. They completed the scale for examining the liberality of attitudes about sex, which the authors of the article compiled for the purposes of this research. Respondents declared their religiosity as believers, agnostics or atheists, so there were 957 believers, 171 atheists and 159 agnostics in the sample. We found that agnostics are the most liberal in terms of attitudes about sex, then atheists and then believers. In addition to religiosity, we examined the connection of attitudes about sex with gender, age, and education level. More educated respondents proved to be more liberal than less educated ones. The women in our sample proved to be more conservative than the men. We did not confirm the assumption that younger respondents would be more liberal than older ones, which can be partly explained by the numerical inequality of age groups. The knowledge we have gained in this study can be of great use primarily as guidelines for further research work, and can also be implemented in various educational programs.","135":"Alcoholics Anonymous is, according to the Program's basic documents, a spiritual program - especially regarding Steps 2-3, 5-7, and 11-12. This paper reviews the history of the Program with emphasis on its spiritual background, as well as on the roots of the spiritual side of the program, and showing the spiritual accents in the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous. The paper also considers the Christian background of the movement and, more broadly, explores the connection of AA founders William (Bill) Wilson and Dr. Robert (Bob) Smith with several Catholic people, such as Edward (Ed) Dowling, SJ, and John C. Ford, SJ, and indicates some points of contact between the Program and Ignatian spirituality. The paper illustrates the pioneering role of the Alcoholics Anonymous program in integrating spirituality into the process of recovery from and treatment of addictions, an integration that just recently has been embraced by modern psychotherapy and psychiatry. The paper shows the theoretical and spiritual underpinnings of the Program in the religious context. The paper illustrates the orientation of the Program in assisting addicts to integrate into their recovery their own spirituality, a clearer image of God, and personal spiritual and religious progress.","136":"Many chronic medical conditions such as glaucoma, senile macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy are further complicated by emotional and psychological disorders. Religiousness represents a part of a social culture and has a significant role in the prevention of mental difficulties of the patients, especially those belonging to older population. The aim of this study was to investigate the connection between religiousness, anxiety, and depression in patients with glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy and to test their connection related to different diagnosis. This cross-sectional study included 163 patients divided into three groups (glaucoma group, senile macular degeneration group and diabetic retinopathy group). Respondents voluntarily agreed to participate in the study and with assistance they fully completed the Scale of Religiousness, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, General Health Questionnaire and demographic information (age, gender, education, employment and marital status). The results showed noticeable religiosity of the respondents (M=18.31, SD=5.28), but also the presence of anxiety (M=7.55, SD=3.73), especially in patients with glaucoma, as well as impaired mental health in AMD patients (M=19.56, SD=4.14). No differences were found in the severity of anxiety, depression, general health and religiosity between groups, but the presence of depression in subjects with age-related macular degeneration significantly affects the level of religiosity (p=0.032). These results unequivocally point to the need for further research and raising awareness of all health professionals about the importance of a holistic approach to the patient regardless of his diagnosis in order to identify the possible effective ways to deal with chronic disease considering all levels of patient's needs.

","138":"Psycho-oncology is a branch of medicine which, combining psychiatry and oncology, studies the biological and psychological factors related to the onset and treatment of carcinoma. The struggle with this life-threatening disease requires an adaptation to a new life situation characterized by changed routines of everyday life and dynamics of personal relationships. The psycho-oncological approach is a multidisciplinary one, as modern medicine recognizes more and more the role of spirituality in the treatment and recovery from various pathological conditions. Spirituality is the adaptive capability of intelligent beings to retain the will for life in spite of adversities and awareness of the imminence of death. Faced with a challenge of malignant disease people are nevertheless able to react with positive personality changes, which leads them to a more meaningful and substantial life. The so-called posttraumatic growth is a feature which enables an individual to assume control over his own reactions to disease, which in turn can have a positive influence on the treatment outcome. An essential role in this process is played by the spiritual growth of an individual. Malignant disease can represent an opportunity for spiritual growth, a dimension often neglected by contemporary lifestyles. Religion, as an important constituent part of spirituality, can offer the believer a meaning of suffering and thus turn the disease into an opportunity for self-knowledge and development of a more mature spirituality. Christian spirituality can represent a path which helps an individual to cope with malignant disease. Modern medicine should be based on a multidisciplinary approach to the patient and encompass all the human dimensions (rational, emotional and spiritual), whereas treatment itself must be both personalized and participatory.","139":"The first part of this paper provides a theological and anthropological insight into Christian understanding of the relations between illness, sin, death and Christian salvation idea. The second part of the paper explains the foundation of the present sacramental Church practice with regard to the Jesus's relation to the sick and with regard to the actions taken by the Apostolic Church, as testified in the New Testament, especially in the Epistle of James (Jam 5, 14-15) and as expressed in the teaching of the Church. The third part of the paper emphasizes the therapeutic significance of the Sacrament of Anointing which is analysed through the speech on the sacrament effects which are: relief and spiritual strengthening, forgiveness of sins and preparation for death. In order to realize this \"sacramental therapy\" in pastoral practice, a certain type of diagnosis of the patient's spiritual condition is needed.

This idea already appears in the Bible, but also in many places all over the Talmud and rabbinic literature. Sometimes, the action performed is passive, the sages do not ask for it directly, while sometimes it is active and deliberate. Since Judaism is known for its attitude to witchcraft, which is explicitly prohibited in the Torah, it is clear that such powers are not based on magic. If so, what forces are involved and what is their origin? In this paper, we attempt to answer these questions and discuss other issues, such as the relationship between medicine and Jewish law, the attitude of Judaism toward medical healing and intervention in God's affairs, healing and the power of prayer and healing as a fulfillment of the obligation to save lives. The main part of this paper examines miraculous healings in the Bible, in the Talmud and during the rabbinic period.

He observes the problem through the perspective of traditional points of view and based on the same, he puts the question about God's allowing suffering in the world and notices the inadequacy in answers given by traditional points of view. Suffering presents itself as a natural companion to the human existence from the beginning till present times. In this respect Rahner observes suffering as the consequence of created imperfect human freedom, although it is true grace given to human beings. Our author observes suffering as a test which serves human being as a means for growth in love to God and neighbour. He reflects on suffering as an act of human person being directed to others, and even more, as a certain attitude of human direction towards eternal life. Rahner agrees with every answer that traditional points of view offer but also finds a space for further development in giving an answer to the question: Why God allows that we suffer? At the and he notices that incomprehensibility of presence of suffering in our life is in fact an acceptance of God's incomprehensibility (cf. K. Rahner, Esperienza, pp. 175-191) and concludes that we do not have an answer which would be satisfying for all people in every period of time. He also concludes that in human life suffering has a therapeutic role and gives a deeper meaning to human existence.","145":"This article discusses the notion of compassion using interdisciplinary approach - theological and psychological - providing a brief development of the notion, as well as distinct image in relation to other, similar notions. Seeing that compassion contributes to psychological, spiritual, as well as socialhealth, the article also discusses the importance of compassion in life of individuals and communities. Compassion is also one of the core notions in world religions, and it is key to making communication between religions possible, and equally importantly, opens up a dialogue between religion and various scientific approaches. This article mostly refers to the notion of compassion as described in the Bible, namely New Testament, from aspect of Christianity. Still, in a smaller extent, we researched how Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, and Judaism perceive and describe compassion. Development of compassion in personal and social relations greatly helps in achieving a healthier society, both for individuals and for the whole communities.","146":"This paper explores the contribution of the psychoanalytic paradigm to Christian anthropology. In three thematic units, the author explores how certain classical psychoanalytic phenomena and concepts can contribute to a better understanding of growth and development in Christian maturity. In the first part of the article, the author interprets the instance of the unconscious within the psychic apparatus, with particular emphasis on the analysis of untapped potentials, repressed abilities, and conflicts that can obstruct growth in evangelical values. Since the imbalanced psychic structure can affect the spiritual dimension and impede its authentic growth and development, the contribution of psychoanalytic theory, which enters into deep dynamic and motivational categories, has a significant role in pastoral activities. Therefore, the second part of the paper focuses on the differential picture of the application and understanding of the psychoanalytic model of the unconscious in the pastoral context. In the third part, from the perspective of Christian anthropology, the author elaborates through the analysis and presentation of specific clinical cases how psychological maturation, which inevitably leads to a re-examination of motivational forces, can prepare the ground for a \"dark night of the soul\", after which a person, with the action of grace, can experience a qualitative leap of faith, and turn a psychological struggle into a spiritual struggle. In the concluding part, the author emphasizes the importance of integrating the natural and the supernatural dimension, and concludes that the psychoanalytic model and Christian anthropology should not be viewed from an exclusive \"or-or\" perspective, or through a model of identification, but rather that these two autonomous areas should be viewed in a dialogical and cooperative relationship.","147":null,"148":"Although the question of death and the fear of it is one of the oldest questions man has dealt with, we have no discussions from ancient times about fear in an existential sense. The thematic approach to this phenomenon in Western philosophy and theology occurs in Hellenism and in the Christian religion, but it gains its full meaning only in the philosophies of existence. The famous Islamic philosopher and physician Ibn Sina, better known in the West as Avicenna (980-1037), wrote A Treatise on the Cure for the Fear of Death and the Treatment of Anxiety Caused by It more than nine centuries ago. Relying on Islamic teachings, Ibn Sina made a comprehensive analysis of this problem in the Treatise, giving precise instructions on how to deal with people who have mental impediments due to the fear of death, which in modern psychiatry are called anxiety and fear-related disorders. In this paper, a brief analysis of the Treatise is made in order to point out possible guidelines in the approach to the problem of fear of death, which in modern psychiatry, psychopathology and psychotherapy is obviously not given enough attention.","149":"The paper gives an approximate significance of religion in the mental health of believers. Islamic views of the soul are presented, as a basic principle of human life. The correct, beneficial effects in the attitudes and behavior of individuals towards their souls are also shown. It is also shown what can negatively affect the soul, which creates a basis for the disruption of mental well-being, which causes a mental disorder or mental illness. The paper focused on Islam, as a complete worldview based on the theory of the Revelation of the Qur'an and the practices of God's Messenger, Muhammad, peace be upon him (p.b.u.h.) through which the Revelation was given to all mankind. The basic Islamic theoretical and practical principles and their beneficial protective and healing effect on the mental, psychosocial and psychosomatic well-being of the individual and the community are enumerated and briefly explained when the daily routine of Islamic living is properly applied.

Qur'anic verses and Prophet's hadiths will be our source in defining the key words what will further guide us towards the explanation how islam affects, influences and in general contributes to the mental, spiritual, individual and global health. Considering that spiritual health is not only the absence of illness, rather it is soul contention, it is necessary to include observation of the ways for strenthening the faith, what will, consequently, lead to the spiritual well being and, in the end, towards better mental health for the individual and community in general. Since the faith is confirmed through humantiy and fraternity, the observation on the faith's influence on more human picture of mankind is inevitable. Almost every individual strives to find the answer on the question what is the purpose of his\/hers life. The faith gives answer on this question and the presence of this awareness (purpose of life) strengthens mental health.","151":"From the historical point of view, the concept of mental health is both in positive and negative terms very much intertwined with religion. We might say that, up to the modern age, there was no other treatment of what we now know as mental illnesses apart from the one offered by religion. Of course, in many cases superstition and brutality prevailed (they always come together, indeed); but, again, we may still look into religious tradition and find many inspiring examples that might help us solve some important problems regarding the mental health issues. The most important ones are, we find, those connected with interpersonal and social context of both their etiology and treatment. Following this line of thinking, we have selected two well-known texts from the New Testament in order to offer an interpretation of them which might answer some questions that we find are fundamentally important for dealing with such a broad theme regarding the relation between religious teachings and mental health.","152":"Brotherhood or fraternity is a very broad term, so its various aspects are described. These are the rhetorical, political, religious and psychological aspects of the fraternity. An interdisciplinary approach with an emphasis on communication theory, especially media ecology, is used. The author gives a short periodical historical review of the brotherhood through the various developmental phases of human consciousness. The thesis is that spiritual guidance is an extremely important element for the quality of growth and realization of brotherhood in humanity, because with every transition of consciousness there is a risk for mental health. However, scientific research shows that spirituality and spiritual development have positive effects on the psychophysical condition of humans. The paper shows that brotherhood can have positive and negative manifestations. The positive manifestation of brotherhood and spiritual friendship in today's global society has an invaluable influence on the mental health of people and provides guidelines for healthy integration and healing of the world burdened with conflicts. The development of civilization of compassion is possible through growing up and ingrowth in mystical Body of Christ through brotherhood.","153":"This paper explores and discusses the Jewish view on brotherhood in humanity and its bond with global mental health. Human brotherhood is one of the foundations of the Jewish religion and is widely found in the ethics of the Jewish prophets and in the tradition of Israel. The halakhic sources oblige a person to do good to others by every possible means - his money, body, soul and mind. The concept of brotherhood in its deepest meaning contains a social responsibility that requires more than transferring a financial contribution to a particular account. In brotherhood, we adopt values that inspire us and put soul in all our actions. The adoption and assimilation of social values into society's policy concerns the very existence of the entire world. The legacy of the grace and brotherhood of our ancestor Abraham is the legacy of human love and universal human brotherhood. In this paper, we bring many Jewish sources from the rabbinic literature on human brotherhood from the Talmudic period to our time. We will show the great importance of human brotherhood in Judaism, and how great the reward is for acts of brotherhood and lovingkindness. We will try to show the scope and range of brotherhood in humanity. As well, we will explore the concept of brotherhood in humanity as \"Tikkun Olam\" - \"repairing the world\" to bring about a societal change, and finally, social justice. In the final part of this work, we would like to show that human brotherhood is possible even in the most inhuman conditions, by bringing one short story from the Holocaust.","154":"Zuckerman-Kuhlman-Aluja Personality questionnaire (ZKA-PQ) measures five psychobiologically based personality factors (activity, aggression, extraversion, neuroticism, and sensation seeking). The inner strength (from the ten perfections based on Theravada Buddhism) deems positive character, which includes truthfulness, perseverance, wisdom, generosity, morality (five precepts), mindfulness and meditation, patience and endurance, equanimity, determination, and loving kindness measured by the strength-based inventory (SBI). Our aim was to unfold the relationship between ZKA factors and SBI. 642 Thai (age mean = 28.27, SD = 10.61) individuals (males 26.2%, females 73.8%) filled out our questionnaire battery: (1) Zuckerman-Kuhlman-Aluja Personality questionnaire - 200 items, 20 facets, five factors: Aggressiveness, Sensation Seeking, Activity, Extraversion, Neuroticism. (Cronbach alphas: 0.88, 0.81, 0.83, 0.89, 0.91 for AG, SS, AC, EX, NEU, respectively). (2) Strength-based inventory - 10 items, measuring 10 inner strength (Cronbach alpha: 0.68). Pearson correlation, neural network modelling and person-oriented methodology (model-based clustering) were conducted for analysis. Our correlational results revealed that inner strengths are negatively related to Aggression (r=-0.44**), Neuroticism (r=-0.43**), Sensation seeking (r=-0.16**), whereas positively related to Extraversion (r=0.37**) and Activity (r=0.24**). Highest correlations were found between AG and patience (-0.43**) and NEU and perseverance (r=-0.40**), both with negative sign. According to neural network modelling Activity was most related to Perseverance, Aggression to lack of Patience, Neuroticism to lack of Perseverance and Equanimity, Sensation Seeking to lack of Morality. Extraversion was most weakly related to inner strengths, but it was related to all other personality dimensions. Model based clustering revealed four typical personality profiles: resilients (41.8%), extraverted undercontrollers (29.0%), introverted undercontrollers (10.6%) and overcontrolled (18.6%). Results showed that resilients had highest inner strength levels, whereas overcontrolled ones had the lowest. Negative traits are, as expected, conversely related with strength, while positive traits (extraversion and activity) are positively related with strength. Our results confirm that resilient personality pattern can be linked to the inner strengths measured by SBI scale, which was based on 10 Buddhist perfections. Further results should be addressed how increase in inner strength can be related to changes in biologically based personality dimensinos towards the resilient pattern. ","155":"Our God image not only determines the nature of our relationship with God, it also influences our personality, actions, self-concept, mindset and social relations. It acts within and through us. Although everyone has a God image - regardless of whether one is a believer or not - the ways in which we experience God's relation to us are manifold. It is not unusual that even believers of the same congregation give accounts of diverse God images. Schema is a widely used term in psychology. Schemas describe cognitive structures that filter, encode and interpret the stimuli affecting the person. They can influence the perception of reality, which later impacts the behavior and mood of the individual and in severe cases can result in pathology. The factors influencing the God image and early maladaptive schemas both have proven roots in early childhood and are impacted by the child-parent relationship. Our research focuses on examining the connection between maladaptive schemas and the God image and their relation to parental influence.","156":"Previous researches have identified the positive effects of gratitude on happiness and well-being. It has been found that spirituality can enhance gratitude and well-being. Our study aimed to examine the link between gratitude and subjective well-being among religious and non-religious people. Furthermore we tested if a 4-week long gratitude diary has a positive effect on subjective well-being. In our online, qualitative investigation the sample consisted of 54 males and 169 females (mean age=39.13, SD=15.90). 54.1% of respondents regarded themselves as \"religious with a given religion\", 24.8% as \"religious on my own way\" and 21.2% as \"non-religious\". The experimental group (leading a gratitude diary for 4 weeks) with 103 individuals and a control group with 120 individuals with no differences in age, gender and religiousness. We compared the questionnaires' results (filled out both before and after the intervention) of the experimental group (n=103) with the results of the control group (n=120) similarly filled out on two different occasions. We applied Gratitude Resentment and Appreciation Test and Subjective Well-being Scale. Our results showed that religious people showed elevated level of gratitude (F(2, 219)=23.66, p&lt;0.001) but same well-being (F(2, 219)=1.97, p=0.142) compared to non-religious groups. In the experiment group the gratitude and the subjective well-being both increased (p&lt;0.01), and there was no significant changes in control group. 2x2 ANOVA showed significant interaction effect (Subjective well-being: (F(1, 221)=13.32, p&lt;0.001); Gratitude: F(1, 221)=12.43, p&lt;0.001). Religiousness is linked to higher gratitude and an increase in gratitude can result in an increase in subjective well-being. The importance of gratitude diary both among religious and non-religious people will be discussed. ","157":"The paper deals with relation of spirituality and religion as well as its influence on mental and spiritual health. It analyzes how people use their beliefs and religion as help in restoring balance necessary for attaining mental health. The paper also points out the significance of spirituality and spiritual peace as the component of mental health and its preservation. The purpose of this paper is to show that religious people deal easier and better with dangers which can damage mental health. That is noticed through longer lifespan and rare illnesses. However, spirituality is not a guarantee that religious persons will not suffer from mental disorders which can result in mental illnesses and their consequences. Illness usually leads to distorted self-image and the environment which surrounds the patient. Being a religious person does not mean being exempt from illness, but religious persons deal easier with illness and going through the healing process.","158":"This contribution aims to explore the main aspects and concerns due to suffering and illness in psychological and spiritual terms. It will be given to everyone in life to make experiences of suffering and sickness - even if for the latter not necessarily in the first person -, dramas and fundamental faces of humanity inaggirabili of our earthly pilgrimage, despite the narcissism of a society that tends to anesthetize every little human pain and suffering. In general one is never fully equipped to face suffering and illness, especially when it involves a lot of pain, and basically all possible declensions to understand them fail, at least partially, the enterprise. Without any pretension of resolving the issue, occasionally bringing it up may offer or remind us of the existence of some possibility of meaning and significance, thus contributing to greater understanding and acceptance. Appealing to the Bible and to Christ himself, and particularly to some extremely significant experiences, including the figure of Job and the experience of V. Frankl, the \"nonsense\" of suffering and illness could take on an unthought out meaning and face, and encounter a healing that goes beyond the purely, though important, corporal. The revisitation of the psychological and spiritual dimensions, the latter not always easily accepted, sometimes completely rejected, could thus become weapons and support in the common and often daily intrusiveness of suffering and illness. Thus, after a brief anthropological passage, these will be addressed in their main psychological and spiritual dimensions, in order to find possible ways of meaning, which often seemingly or superficially seems impossible to exist.","159":"In this time of pluralism and effectivness, it is rarely, if ever, in our daily lifes, as just as the broader social circles, spoken of the right upbringing, the virtues and the exemplary behaviour - a \"role model\". While an admirable person presents us the character we can readily look up to, we recognize a call to follow certain values this person idealy-tipically lives by. Regarding that fact, the explicite role models, primarily the people who lived their deep spirituality (for an instance, the saints!) greatly contribute to a healthy development of one's personality and a genuine understanding of ethics.","160":"Spiritual therapy starts with the belief that a man is an original spiritual being and the human spirit is the strongest source of his power. In fact the spirit is the most powerful and most important factor in a complete healing. Spiritual therapy respects and accepts all the help a person can receive from other types of psychotherapy, provided that those also respect the fundamental principles of theological anthropology and the basic two are: 1) the faith in God - the Creator of all that exists; and 2) the belief in the Biblical teaching that Man was created in the image of God Himself, and that he is therefore free, responsible and transcendent (open to God and absolute values) finding the meaning to his life in realizing the plan God intended for him. Spiritual therapy aims to help a person establish contact with the living God, the source of life and joy. The human spirit receives its being from God and if this connection is disturbed in any way, the person in whole will feel those harmful consequences. When a human spirit returns to God and establishes an authentic communion with Him through faith, hope and love, the person flourishes on all levels of its personality. The author analysis mental illnesses and proposes successful therapy in order for a healthy mind through the soul and its impact on the body to confirm the well-known saying: \"A healthy mind in a healthy body\". The basic principles of spiritual therapy brought in this text are: 1) Residing in peace with God, other creations and yourself; 2) Activate main abilities of the spirit: faith, hope and love within yourself; 3) Live in the liberating truth; 4) Accept and devise in faith the inevitable suffering; 5) Strengthen the power of the spirit through trust in God, prayer and sacramental life.","161":"To investigate the current situation of anxiety and coping style of college students during COVID-19 epidemic.

Some students had behavioral reactions and somatization symptoms such as panic, anxiety, depression, boredom and depression. There are differences in coping styles among college students of different genders and grades, and some coping styles are related to anxiety. The better the knowledge of epidemic prevention or the more active the coping style, the lower the anxiety level. The more negative the coping style, the higher the anxiety.

The present study investigated the association between the sense of coherence, subjective well-being, and emotional distress (depression, anxiety, and stress) that people went through while facing an acute stress situation of COVID-19 outbreak and the earthquakes. This cross-sectional study included 1152 subjects. Orientation to Life Questionnaires (OLQ-13), Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI) and DASS-21 scale were used in an anonymous online survey which was conducted on 22 March 2020 (the twelfth day of the COVID-19 outbreak in Croatia and the day of the earthquakes in the Capital). The results of the questionnaires were determined by the correlation analysis. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to evaluate the association between the subjective well-being and the sense of coherence on the emotional distress. The sense of coherence correlated positively with subjective well-being (p&lt;0.01) and negatively with all distress domains (p&lt;0.01) as well as subjective well-being (p&lt;0.01). Mild emotional distress was detected. Subjects who experienced the earthquakes showed a significantly higher degree of anxiety (p=0.005) and stress (p=0.003), with significantly decreased the two personal well-being domains: standard of living (p=0.023) and personal safety (p=0.026). Sense of coherence made a major contribution in explaining emotional distress (p&lt;0.001). The results support the importance of improving coping efficiency of the sense of coherence with respect to obtaining an appropriate level of well-being and reducing emotional distress in acute stressful situations.

The observation objects in this study were all medical workers in fever clinic under the epidemic situation in COVID-19. A total of 60 cases were selected, and the proportion of anxiety and depression of medical workers in fever clinic was investigated by electronic questionnaire. After completing the investigation, social work intervention measures under the mode of \"internet plus Music Therapy\" were implemented. After implementation, the proportion of anxiety and depression of medical workers were significantly lower than those before intervention (P&lt;0.05). The development of music therapy activities has alleviated the job anxiety of medical workers to a great extent, and the job anxiety test, total score and scores of various factors have all decreased. Social work intervention under the mode of \"internet plus Music Therapy\" can relieve anxiety and depression, and ensure the mental health of frontline medical staff during the epidemic.

While being required to provide patients with high-quality medical services, nurses also bear the responsibilities and pressures from work, face trauma, disease and even death events, and are thereby more inclined to negative psychological feelings, decline in mental health, and reduction in the quality of their clinical nursing services. Under the background of the COVID-19 epidemic, it is urgent to carry out related intervention in nurses' psychological crisis. The mental health of 400 nurses from three tertiary hospitals in Shanghai, China was assessed from September to December 2020. Then, time management training was conducted for 66 nurses who were voluntarily enrolled in the study. They were divided into the intervention group (35 participants) and the control group (31 participants). After the 16-week intervention, (1) there is a significant decrease in the total SCL-90 score of the intervention group and significant decreases in the scores in the 9 dimensions of the scale, suggesting significant improvement in the mental health level; (2) there is a significant increase in the score of the intervention group in subjective well-being, while there is no significant increase in the control group; (3) There is a significant decrease in the score of the intervention group in work stress reaction, but there is no significant decrease in the control group, and there is a significant increase in the physiological reaction of the control group in the measurement after 8 weeks.

This study was designed and conducted to assess the emotional and behavioural reactions of physicians to the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey questionnaire using the google forms platform was constructed by the authors. The items in the questionnaire were based on clinical experience, relevant literature review and discussion with peers. A list of issues that were deemed as essential components of the experience of the pandemic relevant to physicians was arrived at. Thereafter these issues were operationalized into question form and hosted on the google forms platform. The link to this questionnaire was circulated by the authors among their peer groups in the month of April 2020. We received 295 responses and 3 were unusable. Most of the responses were from India, the United States of America, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. About 60% of the respondents identified themselves as frontline and had a decade of clinical experience. Most respondents reported being anxious due to the pandemic and also observed the same in their peers and families. A majority also observed changes in behaviour in self and others and advanced a variety of reasons and concerns. A sense of duty was the most commonly employed coping mechanism. Physicians are not immune from information and misinformation, or cues in the environment. Behavioural choices are not always predicted by knowledge but by a combination of knowledge, emotional state, personality and environment. Healthcare settings need to be ready for emergencies and should focus on reducing uncertainty in physicians. These factors may also be gainfully used in the mental health promotion of physicians in COVID-19 care roles. ","167":"COVID-19 is the biggest pandemic of the last century.

A questionnaire was applied to the participants to evaluate demographic variables, history of comorbid diseases, smoking, loss of a relative due to COVID-19, and environmental attitudes after the discharge. Length of hospitalization, lung findings, intensive care history and treatments were recorded. Psychiatric morbidities were evaluated with General Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and The National Stressful Events Survey PTSD Short Scale. Anxiety was found in 20.6%, depression in 13.7% based on moderate and above levels, 21.6% had significant PTSD. Female gender, history of psychiatric and comorbid diseases, smoking, perceived discrimination, and lack of long-lasting immunity posed a risk in terms of psychological response. There was a negative correlation between age and depression scores. No relation was found between the duration of hospitalization, presence of lung involvement, receiving intensive care treatment, losing a relative due to COVID-19 and psychological response.

College English teaching has shifted from focusing on external factors such as the improvement of teaching hardware facilities to focusing on learners' language learning awareness, language psychological changes, language cognitive ability, and language emotional performance. This study was carried out on a sample of 318 Chinese undergraduates. This paper suggests that emotional anxiety is a key factor leading to low language learning efficiency and has a negative impact on project-based learning performance. Then two variables: frustration of failure and learning satisfaction, are introduced, and a multi-chain mediating model is established to explore the transmission mechanism of emotional anxiety and learning performance. With the increase of emotional anxiety, students' learning performance will be significantly affected in the process of project-based learning, and the results verify the negative relationship between anxiety and learning acquisition. Three paths that affect emotional anxiety on learning performance are identified, namely, \"Emotional Anxiety -- Frustration of Failure -- Learning Satisfaction -- Learning Performance\", \"Emotional Anxiety -- Frustration of Failure -- Learning Performance\" and \"Emotional Anxiety -- Learning Satisfaction -- Learning Performance\". English learning is not only a process of language cognition, but also a process of psychological changes in learners.

In this review article, we included different types of studies whose results are presented as relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR) with a 95% accuracy. A literature search was conducted with the use of the PubMed and EMBASE electronic databases focusing on identifying articles published in English between 1990 and 2020. The electronic searches, after duplicate records removal, provided a total of 126 citations. Of these, 107 were excluded after title\/abstract screening (not relevant to the review). We examined the full text of 19 publications remaining to summarize possible mechanisms between OAB and anxiety. According to examined literature, our result synthesis provides insight in epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnostic and therapeutic approach of both conditions. Temporal relationship between OAB and anxiety is not very well documented because available longitudinal cohort studies are limited. The limitation of the published literature is that most were population-based symptom studies demonstrating high risk of bias. Although data from analysed studies suggest that anxiety and OAB and anxiety might be casually related, studies provided on clinical population are warranted.

This is a narrative review of the medical literature utilizing PubMed, Scopus, and Web of science databases, on the social status of GD patients, their therapeutic options, as well as the medical and ethical debate on GD that are of especial interest to the Muslim readers. Gender dysphoric patients or transgender people have a long history of social discrimination, marginalization, abuse, and neglect all around the world. Currently, large scale social developments supporting of transgender rights are rapidly underway in the west. Clinical evidence-based guidelines have also been published and are available for the management of GD, albeit with some medical and ethical concerns. On the other hand, the transgender community is continued to suffer profoundly in the developing and majority of Muslim nations, due to generalized unawareness, neglect, cultural and religious boundaries on this issue. Currently, Muslim youth or young adults are showing passionate interest in GD and are actively seeking information to comprehend its complexities, but they face more dilemma on this matter than the people in the West. This article addresses and discusses key transgender issues and controversies and provides a logical explanation that demonstrates that GD is real medical condition needing attention and that its treatment guidelines are justified. We hope this article will stimulate a new and broader perspective in minds of young Muslims and will urge them to take pragmatic steps in alleviating the travails of long-suffering and neglected transgender community.","193":"Depression is one of the most common mental disorders. Currently used antidepressants, acting on the monoaminergic system, are insufficient for depression treatment. In recent years, potential application of NMDA receptor modulators in the treatment of drug-resistant depression has gained attention. Administration of ketamine, being a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, contributes to a faster remission of symptoms. The aim of this paper is to review current studies on the use of ketamine in the treatment of drug-resistant depression, compare results of various administration methods - intravenous, intranasal or oral, as well as compare its effectiveness with that of other antidepressants. Numerous studies show the drug is effective and well tolerated, particularly in patients with increased suicidal thoughts. However, there are concerns on increasing tolerance to the drug and the possibility of implementing a long-term treatment. Oral and intranasal forms of the drug are particularly promising due to their non-invasiveness and ability to self-administer.

Knowledge, ethics, empathy, coherence, solidarity, cooperation and unity are the key factors to long-term survival and flourishing of humankind. COVID-19 pandemic and infodemic can be effectively overcome only in spirit of common ethic and mutual empathy, respect, trust and public\/global cooperation sowing the seeds for humanistic self, compassionate society and empathic civilization, rather than blaming, scapegoating and xenophobia. The Psychiatria Danubina focus is on expanding the world's collective knowledge and promoting mental health through the culture of empathy and global ethics.","195":"Sexism is a type of structural discrimination that can manifest as the subjugation of woman in familial and social roles. Gender-based violence often occurs in societies where patriarchal norms exist. Violence against women and girls (VAWG) includes physical, sexual and psychological\/emotional abuse directed towards females. Emotional violence against women and girls is usually underestimated, if not overlooked. Patriarchal upbringing can predominantly result in the emotional abuse of female children. This narrative review will discuss the impact emotional abuse in women and girls mediated by patriarchal upbringing has on sexism and mental health. This paper will also explore how gendered upbringing can contribute to the normalization of VAWG and the victim-blaming of females.","196":"Surprising it may seem, the mental health issues remains largely overlooked in the highly competitive and unforgiving industry of modelling and fashion. A substantial number of models experience mental health issues due to the nature of their occupation, however, most avoid speaking out due to fear of stigma and losing out on future work. Moreover, problematic eating behaviours in attempts to improve body image can have profoundly adverse effects on mental and physical health, even leading to death in extreme cases, yet these behaviours are being reinforced and rewarded with success and career progression. Indeed, the term 'Paris Thin' was used in relation to the deaths of models from starvation who were in pursuit of 'the perfect body' whilst working in France, the epicentre of the fashion world. Although improvements have been made over the past decade, conversations surrounding common mental disorders such as depression and anxiety remain minimal at best and discussions about other serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder are virtually absent. Campaigns that amplify the voices of models living with a mental health condition must therefore be supported to reduce mental health related stigma in the industry and encourage those who are suffering and struggling to seek professional help. Research in this area is urgently needed to yield new insights that will help to improve the mental health of models.","197":"Violence Against Women and Girls (VAWG) (physical, sexual, and psychological\/emotional) is a type of structural discrimination that violates the basic human rights of females on a global scale. Cultural norms that glorify male dominance, power imbalances, and abuse of authority are the most encountered reasons for VAWG. Emotional abuse, which can start in childhood, is widely recognised as the most prevalent form of VAWG. However, although victims of emotional abuse usually suffer terribly, perpetrators often evade accountability. Emotional abuse is underestimated in part because it is normalized by victims who are mostly women and girls. The normalization of VAWG is contributing to the propagation and perpetuation of biased perceptions of sexism. The intergenerational transmission of parenting styles - which is an important contributory factor for child development - often includes gender-stereotyping norms, or patriarchy. Hitherto, limited focus has been directed towards the consequences that emotional abuse related to patriarchal upbringing has on children. Aim - to investigate if emotional abuse related to patriarchal upbringing influences the perception of sexism and gender stereotyping across genders, and the development of unresolved trauma in children. Participants were recruited via social media platforms to complete online questionnaires assessing parental emotional abuse, control, trauma, misogyny, and perceptions of sexism. Parametric analyses were conducted on the 188 participants (158 women and 30 men) recruited. Trauma and perceptions of sexism were statistically analysed using correlation and multiple linear regression. Our findings show that parental emotional abuse and control in females predicted for unresolved traumatic experiences (16.6%). Misogynistic culture and male gender predicted for hostile sexism (9.9%), whereas emotional abuse predicted for benevolent sexism (40%). Emotional abuse related to patriarchal upbringing contributes to the genesis of gender inequality and unresolved trauma in children. Given that parental styles are transmitted from one generation to the next, to reduce sexism and improve mental health outcomes, the patriarchal parental cycle must be broken.

In summary, our attempt is to focus on elements such as the enhancement of non-verbal language within the Eucharistic liturgy, the ritual (in its characteristic of repetition) as an opportunity for learning, rhythm as an opportunity for spatial-temporal and social-relational movement.","199":"We know that every therapist becomes a \"wounded healer\" the moment he goes through his own personal therapy journey and is able to activate his own recovery process. Beyond all the techniques that the therapist can use to \"heal\" a patient, one's own personal life path also significantly and unconsciously influences the healing process. The question I ask is therefore the following, why can't a person who has in some way a \"woundness\", and who has activated without therapy a process of recovery (e.g. through family resilience patterns) be a wounded healer? From this perspective, even a person with a complex disability, placed in a positive context, can turn into an \"unaware wounded healer\".","200":"Intra-operative anxiety is a commonly experienced feeling amongst patients undergoing surgery. Moreover, conscious patients are exposed to the multiple environmental factors triggering this emotion. Apprehension and fear are common emotions interlinked with associated intra-operative anxiety. Several concerning complications are associated with this emotion during surgery, many of which include severe cardiac related events, such as heart failure and acute myocardial infarction, extreme postoperative pain, increased requirement of analgesic, sedation and anaesthetic demand, extended hospital stay, and reduced patient satisfaction. In this review, the effect of intra-operative music therapy to alleviate anxiety in adults undergoing surgery will be studied in order to establish whether intra-operative music alleviates anxiety in adults undergoing local anaesthetic surgical interventions. The Population studied was adults aged 18-80 years old undergoing local anaesthetic interventions. The Intervention observed was the exposure of intra-operative music therapy. The Comparison was against patients undergoing surgery without being subject to music therapy. The desired Outcome was the alleviation of intra-operative anxiety. The intention was to develop a systematic review of the available data. In orderto develop the literature search, Key elements of the question were identified and utilized to generate alternative terms. Subsequently, Boolean Operators were used to combine these terms. Search results were narrowed down by means of limiters and selected databases; EBSCO, PubMed and ScienceDirect were used to execute the search. The PRISMA 2009 framework was used as a guideline in excluding irrelevant studies. Assessment of study eligibility was done byapplying inclusion\/exclusion criteria. Appraisal of literature was done by using The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) tool as a framework. A total of five studies were identified. These included randomised control trials. Two of these studies demonstrated statistical significance whilst the remaining three failed to do so. The overall result of these studies was inconclusive and inconsistent in attempting to determine whether intra-operative music therapy alleviates anxiety in patients undergoing local anaesthetic interventions. The presentation of a definite conclusion is not possible. However, evidence is promising and pointing towards the likelihood of beneficial outcomes resulting from the intervention of interest. However, further research is required. It is recommended that the patients be offered the choice of selecting their preferred music if they give consent to undergo surgery while being exposed to music therapy. Various cost-effective audio devices could be installed in operating theatres. The general public and healthcare professionals should be educated about the benefits of intra-operative music therapy. Future studies should use larger sample sizes, and attrition rate should be reduced through better communication with patients and thorough taking into account the demographic characteristics of the patients. ","201":"For many people with disabilities in health care even the simplest actions such as performing an examination or a test can be extremely difficult, just as a hospitalization or an access to the emergency room can be complex experiences. The issue of access to health services is felt to be particularly critical and unresolved by users, families and operators, who still report significant difficulties. The solutions to the problems of accessibility to care cannot be sought only at the clinical and professional level, but must rely on organizational and managerial innovations. The Seraphic Institute has promoted a project to ensure a better response to the health needs of people with complex disabilities to adapt the health care offer to the needs of people with disabilities, activating a proximity service aimed at reducing the inconvenience and costs related to the fragmentation of services and to improve and extend access to care of people with complex disabilities through the activation of a regional reference pole and a network of specialized multicenter and multidisciplinary assistance (Hub &amp; Spoke model).","202":"Experience shows how difficult it is for a person with disabilities to cope with the reality of a hospital, especially if he or she has an intellectual disability. The difficulty in carrying out even simple diagnostic and therapeutic manoeuvres, the complexity of the pathologies, the difficulty in relating to the patient all make it a real risk that many medical problems of patients with disabilities are overlooked or denied altogether. The person with a disability has the right to all care, not only that related to his or her particular pathology, but also that required for other specialist or general pathologies. The UN Convention clearly states the rights of persons with disabilities. The Italian Republic has implemented the UN's declaration with Law 18\/2009. The rights enshrined in Article 25 of the UN Convention are also concretely applied in the European Charter of Patients' Rights. The right of people with disabilities to be treated on an equal and non-discriminatory basis is also recalled by His Holiness Pope Francis in his latest encyclical. The DAMA (Disabled Advanced Medical Assistance) Hospital project was created to guarantee the right to health and care of people with disabilities, always, by remodelling its diagnostic and care procedures. The CAD\/DAMA Service of the Terni Hospital since 2018 has adopted the DAMA project and also since 2018 has been collaborating with the Seraficio Institute of Assisi. The aim of the CAD\/DAMA Service is also to promote and implement research in this area of care and training for healthcare professionals on disability and related issues.","203":"Attitudes of physicians toward intellectual disability (ID) impact access and quality of the health care services provided to individuals with ID. Attitudes are conceptualized as composed of cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions. However, research on attitudes toward ID frequently neglects to define the underlying theoretical framework. This work aimed to review research over the past 20 years on physicians' attitudes toward and health care practices for individuals with ID. Findings are reported on the cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions of attitudes. A systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. Articles published in English between 2000 and October 2021 were searched in Scopus and Web of Science. Descriptive statistics and frequencies were used to describe the attitudes of physicians. A total of 14 studies were included in the review. Considering the cognitive dimension of attitudes, physicians had a medium to good but almost always incomplete knowledge of ID and its associated conditions, rights and capabilities of individuals with ID, and health care practices for this population. Concerning the affective dimension, approximately half of physicians expressed feelings of pity, unsatisfaction, frustration, discomfort, and lack of confidence. With respect to the behavioral dimension of attitudes, approximately half of physicians preferred to avoid patients with ID. Physicians' attitudes are rather complex. From this work emerges a clear need to change these generally unfavorable attitudes, especially in the aspects regarding emotions and behaviors, to provide better health care to individuals with ID. Educational and training programs on ID for physicians should be developed to improve attitudes toward ID and consequently foster the wellbeing of this population. ","204":"The stigma attached to intellectual disabilities (ID) can have profoundly adverse effects on the lives of people who suffer from these conditions. Stigma is also a major barrier to accessing specialist services and consequently many people with ID continue to suffer in silence. A confidential inquiry into the premature deaths of people with ID in England and Wales revealed the median age at death of individuals with this condition was 13 years (for males) to 20 years (for females) younger than the median age at death of the general population. It has been posited that stigma is a factor that contributes to the mortality gap between those with ID and those who don't have this condition. The COVID-19 pandemic has created new challenges for people with ID and has further fortified the barriers to specialist services. To reduce stigma, improve the quality of healthcare that is provided to people with this condition and to break down the barriers to specialist services, we must pioneer innovative interventions that leverage the power of technology and 'virtual' contact with people who live with these conditions.","205":"Despite the prevalence of mental health related stigma in Muslim communities, there are only a limited number of intervention studies reported in the literature. Digital interventions (i.e., YouTube clips, videos) are relatively cheap, highly accessible and easily disseminated and are increasingly being used to improve mental health literacy and reduce mental health related stigma. However, as far as the authors are aware, there are no stigma reduction programmes targeting Muslim communities that leverage digital interventions reported in the literature. This paper outlines a protocol for a digital intervention to challenge mental health related stigma in Muslim communities. The proposed intervention will be a 5 to 10-minute YouTube clip\/video the active ingredients of which will be: [1] an interview with a Muslim expert by lived\/living experience, [2] an Imam (Muslim faith leader) and [3] a psychiatrist. We will recruit members of Muslim communities living in Muslim minority countries in the Global North (United Kingdom, Unites States of America, Canada, Australia and New Zealand) to participate in the study (inclusion criteria: adults aged 18 years and over, Muslim background). The study will be comprised of two groups: an active group that will be exposed to the Muslim faith appropriate digital intervention and a control group that will be exposed to a digital intervention that is not Muslim faith appropriate. We will administer validated psychometric stigma scales on participants in both groups before and after exposure to the interventions. We hypothesize that viewing an anti-stigma clip\/video that is Islamic faith appropriate will be associated with greater reductions in mental health related stigma in members of Muslim communities compared to viewing an anti-stigma clip\/video that is not Islamic faith appropriate.","206":"Well-structured monitoring system is crucial to identify interventions for children with Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDD). The NIDA Network enrolled more than 760 at risk for NDD and typically developing infants to detect early signs of NDD. The NIDA Network was born in some Italian regions to engage clinical centers in a research project. It is increasingly turning out to be a national monitoring project well integrated in the Italian National Health System policies. The NIDA Network activities are finalized at diagnosis and interventions to improve quality of life of children with NDD and their families.

Many difficulties arise from the clinical practice which is satisfied with what it knows and does. The term 'complex' is used in various fields. This is why it lends itself to unnecessary simplifications. For many, the adjective 'complex' qualifies the seriousness of a difficult and multi-problematic condition. The clinic of the future has a great need to manage saturated and unsaturated explanatory models. The components of the methodological arch synthesize the potential available with clinical strategies distributed in as many paths of analysis and decision-making which, under certain conditions, can become \"self-supporting\", that is, very strong. The European debate on the social future is carefully considering the potentials of innovation in the health care. This is the future that awaits us, especially if the centers of excellence want to experience this challenge together.","208":null,"209":"In the last years, traditional treatments have been combined with innovative therapies, such as robot-assisted training, an interesting new rehabilitation tool for children with neurologic impairment. The robots deliver a high dose of training and intensity, critical factors for the activation of neuronal plasticity.

The analysis of the literature reveals some positive aspects of the use of robotics in pediatric rehabilitation and others that are critical.","210":"A substantial amount of evidence suggest that music training is a powerful means of plastic reorganization of brain structures. Musical training is accompanied by plastic rearrangement of the central nervous system and numerous studies converge in disclosing that the brain differs significantly between musicians and non-musicians. Music-dependent brain changes concern both the grey and the white matter so that musicians possess a neuronal network shaped by type and degree of individual expertise as well as a different connectome than non-musicians. It is reasonable to assume that these plastic changes can provide a more efficient configuration of the neural network and justify an impact on cognition and behaviour in all ages of life. Furthermore, a number of studies suggest the effectiveness of \"neurological music therapy\" in clinical practice. Based on available literature, music should be considered one of the main activity that can preserve the brain efficiency and can be proposed as a primary non pharmachological agent in promoting a neuroprotective lifestyle. Understanding the variables of musical training that can positively influence brain plasticity might be one of the most exciting and promising areas of future research.","211":"Recent researches, following the pandemic, have shown in people, especially the youngest ones, an increase of suffering, articulated in tiredness and being worried, all feelings linked primarily to the national closure of schools and social meeting...

The strong heritability of these conditions (in particular autism and schizophrenia) argues in favor of a genetic origin. On the other hand, the massive increase in NDs implies a preponderant role of environmental factors and epigenetic mechanism (Panisi et al. 2021).","213":"People with intellectual disability or psychiatric disorders are commonly excluded from Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) because of explicit exclusion to the trials or because of inaccessible research protocols. We analyzed the exclusion rate of persons with cognitive impairment, psychiatric disorders and inability to give informed consent in interventional RCTs about the first 10 causes of global DALYs (disability- adjusted life-years) according to the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) utilizing the website Clinicaltrials.gov. A total of 2809 studies in the 10 selected categories were reviewed. \"Cognitive impairment\" was present in 488 (17.4%) studies, \"Behavioural and psychiatric disorders\" was present in 616 (21.9%) studies, \"Inability to grant informed consent\" was present in 498 (17.7%) studies and the three explicit criteria were present, alone or in combination, in 1076 studies (38.3%). Other disability-related exclusion criteria were considered to be implicit exclusion criteria and were present in 1233 (43.9%) studies. A judgement was made on the correlation between the exclusion criteria and the primary objectives of the studies analyzed. The low level of representation of people with disabilities in RCTs, in addition to being an ethical problem, is a limitation of scientific knowledge because it considerably reduces the external validity of a significant part of medical research. There is a need to review the way scientific research designs are constructed, seeking to promote greater inclusiveness of people with disabilities.","214":null,"215":"People with spinal cord injury (SCI) must battle cultural and personal attitudes and stereotypes that reduce sexuality to genitalia's physiological functions. These psychological and social restrictions stem from cultural and models of disability that emphasize phallocentric primacy and the sexual appeal of beautiful bodies when it comes to sexual pleasure. In this paper, we look at the attitudes and stereotypes, conveyed by the medical model of disability, which are based on two widespread and interconnected beliefs (myths): bodily perfection and asexuality. The medical model is based on the normalization of sexual gender roles by male-centered patriarchal culture, which is characterized by unequal relationships between men and women according to the sex most people get to know as totally phallocentric (penis-centered). Finally, we observe the effects of a psychoeducational intervention (Love &amp; Life Project) in a personal growth group on the sexual lives of two groups of people with SCI and their partners in terms of sexual interest and satisfaction, depression, and anxiety. The intervention dramatically increased the possibility and ability of the partner and patient groups to enjoy sexuality, allowing them to experience that \"No injury, no matter how serious, can take away your ability to have a relationship, experience love, and experience the attraction between two people.\"","216":"The frameworks of impulsivity and temperamental irritability of people with intellectual disabilities, presenting disabilities both for organic cause, e.g. postpartum, and for congenital mental retardation, may often present impulse control disorders, irritability and psychomotor restlessness, busyness and insomnia, from likely non-epileptic neuronal dysfunction. The patients with intellectual disabilities presenting mood disorders need to be treated with a therapy similar to that of other patients with mood disorders in the bipolar spectrum (namely predominantly with mood regulators), even if they are not mood pathologies classifiable as the others of the bipolar spectrum disorders: we can call them \"abnormal mood disorders\".","217":"That 'Childhood Adversity', which includes many traumatic events but in particular includes sexual abuse during childhood, can cause changes in the brain, such as the finding of a smaller hippocampus is well established by the observations of such persons as Thomas Frodl (2008, 2013). That traumatic events in adulthood can also cause both clinical symptoms such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, with equivalent shrinkage of the hippocampus (Smith 2005), is also well known. In this article we apply these neurological findings to the particular traumatic event of sexual abuse at any age, first to demonstrate that such abuse can indeed cause a number of mental illnesses, and hence to produce a model of how different forms of mental trauma may cause different mental illnesses. Next we describe human sexuality as a form of language, whereby feelings ranging from love to indifference to exercise of power to hatred can be expressed. We suggest that the expression of these feelings can give rise to positive feelings or to the mental illnesses we have mentioned. We emphasize how free choice is central to the 'messages' that we give to our partners through our sexuality - and therefore that we are responsible for those messages and their consequences. We point out therefore that inappropriate choices by the couple may lead to the consequent neurological changes and mental health symptoms we have mentioned. We finally analyse the act of sexual intercourse into a number of component functions (or consequences) including the Generative Function - that of producing another human person, the Choice Function - that of choosing the other person, the Language Function - that of communicating that choice to the other person and the Empowering Function- that of empowering the other person. We propose a model of human sexuality in which these four functions are linked together, so that in normal circumstances they work together in complete harmony, however, numerous circumstances of modern life can cause these four functions to operate asyncronously, thus leading to the neurological changes which we have mentioned above. These neurological changes are associated with the changes in hippocampal size which we have described above. Thus in our model, we have linked the Neurological changes of Trauma with factors relating to Choice, psychological concepts, and consequent symptomatology of illness. We do this in the context of a model of the Human Person in which mind and body are linked so that the human person can be understood as an 'Embodied Spirit', rather than the Cartesian Model. This concept goes back to the model of the Human Person of Aristotle, and was re-expressed in Medieval times by Aquinas and Augustine, and is congruent with Phenominology as expressed by Husserl and Stein. We have previously argued that such an 'Embodied Spirit' model of the Human Person is more congruent with modern neuroscience than a Cartesian Model (Agius 2017).","218":"Audio-visual technology can have a significant impact on a person's metal wellbeing to the extent that research shows that it can cause structural brain changes. In this paper we explore some of the associations between this technology and mental wellbeing. Audio-visual technology can help in fulfilling the need of human beings for connectedness, but it can be doing this inadequately. It is saturating the brain with information, and can lead to misinformation, misinterpretation, misrepresentation of such information. The impact of the media platforms on the mental wellbeing of their audience relies on an interaction between the platform and the viewer. We explore how this impact can be influenced by the viewer's age or psychiatric conditions. We advocate that if the right balance of utilisation of television and social media platforms is found, they can be a positive and crucial part of society's lifestyle.","219":"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Beyond the most common clinical features of COVID-19, mainly represented by respiratory symptoms, other systems may be interested by the infection. Among these, through a neurotropic pathway, the central nervous system (CNS) may be affected by the virus, leading to developing neuropsychiatric symptoms. Particularly, this study focuses on neurological symptoms determined by the Sars-CoV-2 infection, as well as on the underlying pathogenetic processes. For the present review, we followed a narrative approach. A literature search was carried out concerning the neurological consequences of COVID-19. Papers were screened, focusing on the clinical manifestations interesting the CNS and on their possible role in the early diagnosis of the disease. We display the most significant neurological clinical manifestations of COVID-19. Common neurological manifestations (ageusia, anosmia, and encephalitis) are first described. Subsequently, we provide a focus on delirium and its possible pathogenetic and clinical correlates. Delirium is not only a possible resultant of the COVID-19 neurotropism, but it may also be precipitated by a number of environmental factors that assume further relevance during the pandemic. Neuropsychiatric symptoms, and particularly delirium, can help identifying the infection at an early stage. Tailored treatments should be identified in order to prevent complications.

The concept of the so-called seasonal affective disorder (SAD) as a disruption of the circadian rhythm precipitated by a deficiency of environmental light during darker seasons was first described in the 1980s. Furthermore, chronobiological and hormonal dysregulation in SAD patients was repeatedly shown to be accompanied by alterations on a neuroreceptor and neurotransmitter level and to normalize after remission. Hence, SAD represents one of the most important models of a chronobiological disorder with over 1000 international publications on its aetiology and treatment options, whereby their underpinnings could be elucidated on a clinical as well as molecular level. The present article summarizes the current understanding of etiological mechanisms of SAD and provides an overview of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, which are based on available international evidence including clinical trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. According to current recommendations of international guidelines, promising treatment options as bright light therapy, psychopharmacotherapy, therapeutic sleep deprivation, and their underlying mechanisms of action are presented.","222":"Suicide rates vary with important cycles in life, according to scientific findings and sometimes only according to lay beliefs. This paper reviews empirical studies on the association between suicides and a selection of cycles in life (the course of day, week, year, and life, menstrual cycle, and the moon phases). Non-systematic review with a selection of key-papers and recent reviews, and analyses of Austrian daily suicide data from 1970-2017. For the time of day, suicides occur slightly more frequently from morning to mid-day. However, among people awake, suicides peak during nighttime. For the course of the week, suicide rates increase on Mondays and decrease on weekends. Similarly, there are more suicides after major holidays. For the course of the year, suicide rates increase in spring\/summer, decrease in December, are lowest on Christmas, peak on New Year's Day, and go back to about the yearly average thereafter. With respect to the life cycle, suicide rates are lowest in children and highest in elderly people, especially in men. Suicide rates increase during menstruation but not in the pre-menstruation phase. Suicide rates do not vary with moon-phases. There is robust evidence that suicide rates vary with some cycles in human life, such as day of the week, seasons and holidays, and there is some evidence that suicides vary with time of day and the menstrual cycle. Some of the associations seem counter-intuitive but can be explained with theories of suicides and related psychosocial mechanisms (e.g., the Broken Promise Effect). Since the effects are mostly small, findings cannot easily be translated into clinical practice but they enhance our understanding of suicides nonetheless.

In previous studies, the thoughts of healthcare professionals who gave care to coronavirus patients were investigated. The present study is the first study in which experiences and thoughts of healthcare professionals who had coronavirus disease were investigated, and unlike other studies, data were collected through one-to-one, face-to-face interviews. This study was conducted to determine the feelings, thoughts and experiences of healthcare professionals who recovered after being diagnosed with COVID-19. This qualitative study was designed based on Husserlian's phenomenological approach. The participants were selected from healthcare professionals receiving COVID-19 treatment through the purposive sampling method. The interviews were held between September 2020 and February 2021. Colaizzi's qualitative analysis method was used. After the analysis of the interviews, three themes and seven sub-themes emerged. The theme \"fear\" has three sub-themes: \"fear of the unknown\", \"fear of being infected again\" and \"fear of transmitting the disease\". The theme \"social isolation\" has two sub-themes: \"Unhappiness\" and \"stigma\". Finally, the theme \"lack of motivation\" has two sub-themes: \"excessive workload\" and \"Inadequate number of employees\". In order to help healthcare workers manage these psychosocial problems they experience, managers should make appropriate planning and should give them psychosocial support. It is recommended that the criteria regarding healthcare professionals' starting work again after they survive the COVID-19 should be reviewed and revised. In particular, healthcare workers who survive illness but cannot fully recover should be evaluated physically and psychologically before going back to work.

The aim of the study was to examine effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and Zagreb earthquake on the psychological stress level and disease condition of AD patients. This cross-sectional study included 150 AD patients (three groups with 50 patients): 1) those not exposed to either the COVID-19 pandemic or the earthquake; 2) those who only experienced the COVID-19 pandemic; and 3) those who experienced both the pandemic and the earthquake. Patients' data from the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), on AD severity (SCORAD), and their answers from our newly designed questionnaire on disease-related behaviors and AD condition during the pandemic and quarantine were examined and statistically analyzed. The subjects who experienced both disasters had a greater PSS than those experiencing only the COVID-19 pandemic, especially women, and they also had higher disease severity (SCORAD) than those in the other two groups. Also, 59% of patients reported psychological stress during the pandemic, mostly caused by: the possibility of infection (31%), a changed work life and possible loss of income (23%), general pandemic-related conditions (17%), worry about physical survival (11%) and other (6%). Concerning the earthquake, the PSS significantly positively correlated with the psychological experience of the earthquake and with the intensity of sleep disturbances.

Some of the most common symptoms include mood swings, tearfulness, irritability, loss of appetite, fatigue. The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between maternity blues, psychological, demographic and obstetrics risk factors. A cross-sectional study was conducted between October 2019 and February 2020 at the University Hospital Center Zagreb, Croatia. Final analysis included 227 mothers. Participants were assessed with Stein's Maternity Blues Scale, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Support (MSPSS) and Brennan's Experiences in Close Relationship Scale, as well as demographic and obstetric data. The prevalence of maternity blues in our study was 19.9%. Higher result on Stein's Maternity Blues Scale was associated with anxious attachment style (r=0.425, p&lt;0.01), oxytocin (r=0.308, p&lt;0.01), lower birth weight (r=-0.242), lower resilience (r=-0.252) and less perceived social support from family and significant other (p&lt;.01). This report presents the very first study assessing maternity blues occurence among Croatian mothers and in Croatian cultural environment. We believe that our report will address importance of employing adequate screening methods in preventing and timely recognizing maternity blues and subsequent postpartum depression in Croatian population.

Aim of this study was to examine the association between depressive symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in PWH from Croatia and Slovenia. A total of 112 adult PWH on prophylactic (73%) or on-demand (27%) treatment were included in the study (median age 46 years, range 18-73 years). Depressive symptoms were assessed with BDI-II, HRQoL with SF-36v2, demographic and socioeconomic data were collected using a questionnaire, and clinical data were obtained from medical records. All HRQoL scores were significantly negatively correlated with BDI-II in the -0.42 to -0.70 range (all p&lt;0.05). Socio-demographic and clinical variables explained 28-51% of HRQoL variance scores. Depressive symptoms explained additional variance for six HRQoL domain scores, with incremental variance being larger for mental domain scores (ranging between 10-27%), and for Mental Component Summary score (26%). This study's findings support that having depressive symptoms is associated with HRQoL of PWH, more so in the mental health than in the physical health domains.

Ninety eight euthymic patients diagnosed either with BD (N=48, mean age 48.79 years, SD = 8.587) or rMDD (N=50, mean age 50.02 years, SD = 9.826) underwent testing using the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Affective Disorders (BAC-A) test, the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) and the UCSD performance-based skills assessment (UPSA-brief). Euthymic patients with BD demonstrated significantly lower scores as compared to normal population values in verbal, learning and working memory, verbal fluency, attention and processing speed, affective memory for negative and positive words (p&lt;0.01 each) and motor speed (p&lt;0.05), but not for reasoning\/problem solving (p=0.05). Furthermore, their mean total SDS score of 17.60 (SD = 6.450, Sk = -0.833) and its subscale scores were higher, while their UPSA-B total scores were lower (M = 76.01, SD = 17.148, Sk = -0.412). There was a correlation between CF, SD and BLS scores (p&lt;0.01), as well as between BLS and SD scores (p&lt;0.05). The analysis of variance did not however show significant differences between subgroups of patients.

","246":"A low-grade inflammation is presumed to be related to the etiopathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily members have roles in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders because of the relationship with inflammation and neurogenesis. The aim of this study was to investigate the serum TNF-related weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) levels in patients with bipolar depression (BD), MDD and a healthy control (HC) group to determine any differences between MDD and BD in terms of inflammation biomarkers. After a 12-hour overnight fast, 5 milliliter (mL) samples of fasting blood were obtained from the participants. The TWEAK and TRAIL plasma levels were calculated using ELISA kits. The TWEAK levels were found to be higher in the BD group than in the HC group (p=0.03). No statistically significant differences were determined between the BD vs MDD and MDD vs HC groups (p=0.17, p=0.37, respectively). There were no statistically significant differences between the three groups (BD vs HC; BD vs MDD; MDD vs HC) in terms of TRAIL levels (p=0.21). To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to have explored TWEAK levels in patients with BD. The higher TWEAK levels in BD than in the control group is compatible with the inflammation hypothesis of BD. Limitations of the study were the differences in medications of the patient groups and that it was a cross-sectional study. There is a need for further longitudinal studies with larger sample size and medication-free patients. ","247":"The study aims to identify the underlying causes, risks and protection factors in the field of suicidal behavior among pedagogical students to understand and reduce the prevalence of victimization and suicide in the education system. The analysis of suicidal risk factors and protective mechanisms among pedagogical students is carried out based on the results of psychological testing, correlation and factor analysis. Results of the study show that the following two factors greatly influence suicidal behavior among pedagogical students. Firstly, there is \"Psychological (personal) risk factor of suicidal behavior\", which combines indicators of destructive personality of students, leading to suicidal behavior. Secondly, there is \"Conflict socio-environmental risk factor of suicidal behavior\" that combines indicators of disharmonious upbringing and disharmonious relationships with the immediate environment. Moreover, in stressful situations, most future teachers from the \"risk group\" use non-constructive strategies of the protective mechanisms \"projection\" and \"regression\" and have a high level of an overall tension index of these mechanisms. It is found that the suicidal factors, characteristic for pedagogical students, do not differ from the suicidal factors characteristic for students from other specialties. These factors affect a large number of pedagogical students (41.5%). There might be several risk factors at once, which increases the likelihood of suicidal thoughts and actions. The results of the study can be used to predict and prevent suicidal behavior among pedagogical students and increase the effectiveness of the psychological services of universities. ","248":"Suicidal ideation is not restricted to psychiatric patients. To the contrary, it is not uncommon in the general population and constitutes a precursor for suicide attempts and completed suicides. While risk factors for suicidality have extensively been described, much less attention has been devoted to the investigation of protective factors. In the current study we investigated two of such potential protective factors in combination, namely trait emotional intelligence (EI) and resilience in a sample of university students. We recruited 277 university students without an active physical or mental disorder requiring medical attention via an online questionnaire and assessed lifetime and four-week suicidal ideation. Resilience was measured with the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, EI with the Self-report Emotional Ability Scale and stressful life events with the Social Readjustment Rating Scale. Logistic regression was used to investigate the effect of EI and resilience on lifetime and four-week suicidal ideation. Resilience as well as intrapersonal trait EI factors were significantly lower in individuals who reported lifetime suicidal ideation. The regression analysis revealed the EI facet \"Regulation of one's own emotions\" and the resilience factor \"Control\" to be significant predictors of lifetime and\/or four-week suicidal ideation. Neither trait EI nor resilience had a moderating effect on the relationship between life events and suicidality. Low intrapersonal EI and low resilience are associated with lifetime and, in part, four-week suicidal ideation.

This is a narrative review with a goal to establish the potential role of heat shock proteins during caesarean section and development of postpartal depression. Systemic hyperinflammatory state, such as the one that occurs during surgery, may trigger protective cell reaction, which is usually called the heat shock response. Results of several researches bring strong evidence of correlation between expression of genes coding for family of heat shock proteins with the onset of depressive symptoms. Also, a recent meta-analysis established caesarean section as a risk factor for development of postpartal depression. It is obvious that heat shock proteins play a certain role in development of psychiatric disorders. However, a role of heat shock proteins in development of postpartal depression remains open for debate. We emphasise the need for a randomised control trial which would enable an answer to the mentioned issue.","257":"Western democracies continue to 'legalize recreational cannabis use' after its 'medicinal approval', while India continues to debate whether to 'decriminalize' cannabis or not. One of the strongest arguments against cannabis decriminalization is cannabis dependence and the risk of psychosis, at-least in the vulnerable groups. Endocannabinoids are involved in neuronal proliferation and differentiation during 'patterning of the central nervous system'. Aberrant neurostimulation caused by repeated heavy exo-cannabinoid exposure may increase the probability of pro-psychotic experiences. Various animal and human studies have demonstrated increased but abnormal activation of cortical and subcortical areas due to chronic cannabis use. Some of these areas are involved in the pathogenesis of psychosis or schizophrenia. A review of the literature was done to hypothesize the possible role of cannabis to cause (or precipitate) psychosis through repeated \"aberrant neurostimulation\". The 'aberrant neurostimulation model of cannabis psychosis' may explain pathogenesis, individual vulnerabilities and developing therapeutic strategies for this debated entity. In future, well designed placebo-controlled studies may find the answer with more confidence.","258":"Suicidal risk assessment is still a major challenge not only in psychiatric practice. Clinical investigation of suicidality can be significantly improved by using standardized scales for assessing suicide risk. The choice of a method for assessing suicidality also has significant implications for the search of valid available biomarker of suicidal behavior, where a less complex suicidality assessment procedure yields inaccurate results. This article offers an overview and analyzes in detail clinical studies of suicidality by electrophysiological methods since 2005 to 5\/2020, especially in connection with presumed pathophysiological mechanism of the \"suicidal brain\" and the chosen method of sucidality assessment. Electrophysiological methods such as quantitative electroencephalography indicators, event-related potential, loudness dependence of the auditory evoked potential, polysomnography and heart rate variability offer a robust battery of easily available methods for assessing impaired emotional regulation. Nowadays it is unfortunately very difficult to point out the optimal electrophysiological examination of suicidal behaviour because of conflicting conclusion of presented studies which have been probably caused by various suicidal risk assessments, not always available data on affecting medication prior to testing and small samples of suicidal participants among studies. The most consistent and hopeful results are presented by evaluation of theta power by quantitative electroencephalography, although there are also few conflicting conclusions. The authors of this paper believe that this article could be good starting point for further research of electrophysiological methods in the field of suicidality.","259":"Schizoid personality disorder (SZPD) is a Cluster A personality disorder whose essential feature is a lifelong pattern of detachment from social relationships and a restricted range of emotional expression. Although SZPD has been in every edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, empirical research on this disorder is actually limited, due to the fact that SZPD is rarely encountered in clinical settings. In fact, individuals with SZPD rarely present for treatment, as their isolation is often ego-syntonic; therefore, the prevalence of SZPD is not clearly established. Suicide ideation may be a running theme for individuals with SZPD. However, suicidality in SZPD is actually an underestimated topic. Aiming to draw more attention to this underestimated issue, with this paper the authors intend to provide a list of studies on suicidality in individuals with SZPD or traits, in the form of a clinical mini-review. Reported studies show that an underlying SZPD, or the presence of schizoid traits too, appear to be definitely a major risk factor for completed suicide and serious suicide attempts. This maladaptive personality disorder seems to not allow the individual to ask for help and to deny him the comforts of intimacy. Therefore, clinicians should be aware that schizoid traits suchs as solitary lifestyle, loneliness, emotional detachment, and impaired communication ability, are features associated with a vulnerability to suicidal behavior. We recommend the clinical assessment of this symptoms' constellation, in order to address patients with SZPD to most proper treatment.","260":"In a woman's life, pregnancy is a unique experience accompanied by significant physiological, biochemical, and psychological changes that can affect mental health status. Participation in preventive activities during pregnancy has an impact on better emotional state after childbirth.

Listening to music during pregnancy contributes to a better sense of well - being and less pronounced symptoms of postpartum depression. Scientific evidence confirms the effects of music therapy on the level of stress and anxiety in pregnant women, but also calmer children and better emotional bonding. The application of GIM therapy - music - induced imagination - also provides significant results in strengthening psychological resilience.

Aim, to examine gender differences in the expression of the adaptive and maladaptive dimensions of perfectionism and anger (state and trait, as well as the anger expression and control) and to examine whether the dimensions of perfectionism are statistically significant predictors of anger. This study included a total of 600 primary and secondary school students (305 girls and 295 boys), 12 to 18 years old. Data were collected using a Socio-demographic Features Questionnaire for general information onto the Adaptive\/ Maladaptive Perfectionism Scale (AMPS), Child-Adolescent Perfectionism Scale (CAPS), and State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2 Child and Adolescent (STAXI-2 C\/A). Statistically significant gender differences were found in the expression of the adaptive and maladaptive dimensions of perfectionism and anger. For aspects of anger, girls have been found to control their anger more often than boys. Multiple regression analysis indicates the important contribution of the dimensions of perfectionism in the explanation of anger in adolescents. Given the results obtained, our research represents a contribution to the definition of a dimensional diagnostic system to prevent comorbidity of mental disorders and provide more clinically relevant information about each individual.

A group of 325 nulliparas in the third trimester of pregnancy were enrolled at the Childbirth preparation program of the University Medical Centre Ljubljana's Division of Gynaecology and Obstetrics. The following instruments were applied: Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised, The Edinburgh Depression Scale, two aspects of anxiety - Zung Anxiety Scale and a questionnaire regarding fear of childbirth. Attachment anxiety and avoidance scales were recoded into four categories of a prototypical attachment style: secure, fearful, preoccupied and dismissive. Two-way ANOVA and the chi-square test were used for the statistical analysis. All indicators of mental health functioning of our sample of nulliparas differed significantly regarding their partner attachment style. Nulliparas with a fearful, but also with a preoccupied type of attachment, showed less optimal mental health indicators compared to those with a secure\/dismissive type of attachment. A significant interactive effect of partner attachment and emotional support from the older generation was found on the level of depression. Partner attachment styles and emotional support from the older generation were found to be statistically dependent.

It has been hypothesized that certain conditions we experience can influence our gene expression and can probably be passed onto our children, transgenerational transfer of trauma being one of them. We postulate that the notion of compassion has also been passed on from one generation to another. Our ancestors discovered that groups have a higher chance of survival than individuals. Thus, psychological traits that help form social cohesion, like compassion, are proven beneficial and passed onto the next generation. However, our perception of compassion has changed through time. In the beginning, it was expressed as a feeling of sympathy for the vulnerable, for example the elderly, the sick, pregnant women and children. These groups were innately perceived as deserving compassion. As our social awareness grew, so did the list of vulnerable groups, including members of different races, sexual or gender orientations, etc. Over time, a shift in the way we feel compassion has occurred. Nowadays, it almost seems like only those belonging to a vulnerable group are justified to feel suffering or oppression. At the same time, the suffering of those who do not belong to these exclusive vulnerable groups is marginalized. Mental illnesses like anxiety or depression are trivialized if the person in question is perceived as being privileged (in any sense), while at the same time, they are seen as warning signs if the person suffering is vulnerable. If one truly needs attention, help, or both, the easiest way is to declare oneself vulnerable. If this trend continues, we postulate that a lack of compassion in our modern society will have an impact on future societies as well. Through transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, this can create future societies whose sense of compassion will be shaped only by the definition\/perception of those who are currently perceived as vulnerable.","276":"World in which we live in, has been changing so unpredictably in the recent years that has become more than ever volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) world.

The difference between moderate drinking and the development of alcohol addiction which leads to alcoholism-related medical, social, legal and economic issues is not always clear. Alcoholism is often hidden within the private and wider social framework of a patient. Oral diseases are easy to notice in recorded alcoholics as well as in, for example, smokers. TMDs consist of a disorder of masticatory muscles and\/or a disorder of temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Since the traumatogenic factor of individuals under the influence of alcohol is clearly evident, it can potentially become an initializing factor of TMJ disorder's clinical signs and symptoms development. A modern approach to the etiopathogenesis is to include the multifactorial model, that is, combinations of potential factors with various individual importances. In everyday dental practice, co-morbidities of oral diseases and alcoholism are expected more often, as well as oral diseases with their etiopathogenesis partially related to alcohol use.","286":"Previous research has shown the simultaneous presence of health diseases and alcohol use disorder (AUD). This research emphasizes the importance of individual diseases, the simultaneous presence and connection of different diseases, which creates the conditions for more adequate treatment of patients with AUD. Determine somatic, neurological and psychiatric diseases in patients with AUD in the Tuzla Canton (TK) in the period from 01.01.2011. to 31.12.2015. A retrospective study on the systematic cause of 1,863 patients with AUD recorded in the TK health system. Among 1004 (53.9%) patients with AUD, somatic diseases were present; in men: arterial hypertension 573 (31.7%), alcoholic liver disease 269 (14.9%), diabetes mellitus 211 (11.7%); and in women: arterial hypertension 27 (49.1%), diabetes mellitus 27 (49.1%), elevated lipoproteins 3 (5.5%); alcoholic liver disease 1 (1.8%) and anemia 1 (1.8%). Among 1196 (64,2%) patients with AUD, neurological diseases were present; in men: cognitive impairment 627 (34.7%), post-stroke condition 418 (23.1%), polyneuropathy 269 (14.9%); and in women, post stroke condition 28 (50.9%). Psychiatric comorbidity was determined in 1619 (86.9%) patients with AUD; in men: depressive disorder 806 (44.6%), personality disorder 660 (36.5%), while nicotine addiction 27 (1.5%) and dementia 13 (0.7%) were least present; in women: personality disorder 33 (60.0%), neurotic disorder 27 (49.1%), depressive disorder 22 (40.0%). The largest number of patients with somatic (787 or 42.25%), neurological (939 or 50.40%) and psychiatric comorbidity (939 or 50.40%) belonged to the age group 55-64.9 years. Slightly more than half of the patients with AUD were diagnosed with somatic diseases, almost two thirds were diagnosed with neurological diseases and with more than four fifths of patients were diagnosed with psychiatric diseases. Of the somatic diseases the most common ones were, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and alcoholic liver disease; from neurological diseases: cognitive impairment, post-stroke condition and polyneuropathy; and the most common of psychiatric illnesses were depressive disorder and personality disorder. The largest number of patients are in the ages of 55-64.9.

The aim of this study was to asses health-related quality of life and mental health status in patients with endometriosis, investigating also their relationship with endometriosis-related comorbid symptoms and conditions, such as pain and infertility. An observational cross-sectional study involved 79 women with endometriosis. All patients filled the Endometriosis Health Profile (EHP-5), the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Their medical data were retrieved from medical records. Data was analyzed using the SPSS 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Of all the patients evaluated in our study, 44.3% presented depressive symptoms and 25.3% presented anxiety, while 31.7% reported stress symptoms. Moderate correlations were found between results on EHP-5 and depression (r=0.515), stress (r=0.558) and VAS score (r=0.565). Furthermore, weak positive relationship was observed between EHP-5 and anxiety (r=0.295) and infertility (r=0.267). Additionally, moderate correlation was found between depression and infertility (r=0.519), while there was weak association between VAS score and stress (r=0.236). This study showed complex relationships between symptoms and conditions manifesting in patients with endometriosis. Due to diversity of symptoms, potentially including mental health issues, it is important to emphasize the need for combined personalized treatment for these patients, taking into account both physical and psychological aspect of the disease.

This impairment is caused by unfavorable ecological and radiation conditions, external stress factors, food containing carcinogens, macro - and microelements deficiency. Technogenic environmental pollution contributes to decrease in the level of iodine in the body and more severe course of thyroid pathology. Diseases of the digestive and endocrine systems and their combination will occupy one of the leading places among the existing pathologies according to the forecasts of WHO experts in the XXI century. Adaptation of the body to various environmental influences is the most important factor in the quality of life. The relevance of the study was determined by the high incidence of psychological disadaptation, borderline personality disorders and, as a consequence, decrease in the quality of life in patients with gastrointestinal pathology and hypothyroidism. The article presents the results of comparative analysis of the quality of life indications of patients with gastric ulcer and \/ or gastroesophageal reflux disease in combination with hypothyroidism. The Russian-language analogue of the international questionnaire SF36 was used to analyze the indicatoions of patients' quality of life. The results of the study will allow to formulate the diagnosis exactly and organize adequate, comprehensive multidisciplinary treatment.","290":"Most dermatovenereological diseases are not life-threatening but nevertheless are highly prevalent disorders. Psychosocial aspects of skin diseases and physical symptoms strongly influence patient's quality of life (QoL) which results in the development of different coping mechanisms in patient's behaviour. Development of psychiatric comorbidity in patients with skin diseases is well known. On the other hand, little is known about psychological comorbidity associated with dermatovenereological diseases. Aims of this study were to investigate QoL and psychological burden among dermatovenereological patients. Two hundred and ninety patients suffering from different dermatological and venereological diseases participated in the study, divided into three study groups: itchy\/painful dermatoses, non-itchy\/non-painful dermatoses and venereological diseases. Participants completed standardized psychological questionnaires: Dermatology Specific Quality of Life (DSQL), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Intensity of the disease and localisation of the lesions were also assessed. Physical aspect of QoL was mostly influenced by itchy\/painful dermatoses but psychological aspect and everyday activities and choices were mostly affected by patients with non-itchy\/non-painful dermatoses and venereological diseases. 4.1% of participants had serious depressive symptoms, 11.5% had high and very high anxiety symptoms as state and 15.6% as trait. However, participants with severe skin conditions were more depressed, while participants with always and sometimes exposed lesions were more anxious. It is essential to recognise subgroups of dermatovenereological patients whose treatment approach should be interdisciplinary. Further studies are needed to detect psychosocial needs of patients with venereological diseases. ","291":"Fear is a negative emotion induced by the threat of danger, pain and harm. Cataract surgery is one of the most performed surgeries in the world. The aim of this study was to investigate and analyze the predominant fears in patients undergoing cataract surgery. In this cross-sectional study 152 patients were examined. Self-designed questionnaires to examine emotions of the fear, anxiety, nervousness frequency gratitude was used and insecurity immediately before cataract surgery. We also examined what the greatest fear during the cataract surgery was. The fear of blindness was compared with other life fears such as cancer, memory loss, AIDS, stroke and heart attack. The presence of fear was compared in patients having had previous cataract surgery with those undergoing their first cataract surgery. Including criteria were adults with senile cataract. Excluding criteria was ocular co-morbidity, psychiatric disorders, inability to read, deafness and surgery under general anesthesia. Completed questionnaires were analyzed. Pearson's chi-squared test was used. Fear was the most frequent emotion before cataract surgery, present in 60.5% patients. Fear of blindness was the greatest fear during cataract surgery in 55.3% of patients. There was no statistically significant difference in fear in patients having undergone their first cataract surgery and patients before their second cataract surgery (p&lt;0.05). Fear is the predominant emotion before cataract surgery which is in correlation to the leading life fear - fear of blindness. Good preoperative preparation and a trusting doctor-patient relationship are important for reducing the fear of the procedure. ","292":"In the literature, most of the studies on Charles Bonnet Syndrome (CBS) were performed on older populations. This study aims to determine the prevalence and epidemiology of CBS and the nature of the hallucinations of the younger group of patients from an ophthalmology outpatient clinic of a university hospital. Twenty-eight patients were randomly chosen from the outpatient ophthalmology clinic of a university hospital, and those who agreed to participate in the study were included. First, the patients were asked if they had ever seen visions that other people cannot when they were fully awake. The patients who were experiencing this symptom were given sociodemographic questionnaire and Psychiatry Institute Visual Hallucination Questionnaire, and asked to explain their hallucinations in detail. To exclude a psychiatric disorder, the participants were made a psychiatric interview as well. The study included 19 female (67.9%) and 9 male (32.1%) participants. Five patients (17.9%) were diagnosed with CBS. Average age of the patients diagnosed with CBS was 39.4 (min.31-max.48). Three of the 5 patients (60%) with CBS noted negative emotions (fear, wince and bewilderment) about their hallucinations. The prevalence of CBS (17.9%) we've found is compatible with the medical literature. CBS may also be accompanied by \"relatively milder\" ophthalmologic problems (myopia, astigmatism, etc.). The hallucinations which CBS patients experience could be quite distressing, and the individuals might have hard times to reveal their complaints because of the apprehension of stigmatization. To inquire this symptom during clinical examination may be the first step to help these individuals. ","293":"The aim of this research was to determine which of two chosen questionnaires for subjective symptoms of dry eye (Ocular Surface Disease Index and Schein questionnaire) is more reliable in the assessment of dry eye in patients with schizophrenia. Our research included 80 patients (160 eyes) of both sexes with schizophrenia ranging between the age of 25 and 55 who have been taking one of three antipsychotic drugs namely clozapin, olanzapin, quetiapin for five or more years and were in a stable phase of the disease or remission. All participants were required to satisfy all included and excluded criteria. They all filled out the Schein and OSDI questionnaires for assessment of subjective symptoms. Tear break-up time test (TBUT) for objective evaluation of tear film stability was also performed. In order to determine the correlation between two subjective and objective tests we calculated Spearmans correlation coefficients. Obtained results of the correlation between OSDI questionnaire and TBUT test for the right eye was r=-0.73; p&lt;0.01 and for the left eye was r=-0.72; p&lt;0.01. Results of the correlation between Schein questionnaire and TBUT test for the right eye was r=-0.62; p&lt;0.01 and for the left eye was r=-0.60; p&lt;0.01. A detailed analysis shows that there are no statistically significant differences between the correlations. Both subjective questionnaires are statistically significantly and negatively related to the TBUT test, showing that an increase in the results on the OSDI and Schein's questionnaires led to the decreases in the results on the TBUT test. In patients with schizophrenia the OSDI and Schein questionnaires are equally reliable in the assessment of subjective symptoms of Dry eye disease. Considering that, OSDI is more common in clinical practice and includes questions regarding quality of life, it would have certain advantages and it is recommended for use in patients with schizophrenia. ","294":"Dry eye disease (DED) is a multifactorial disease of the tear film and ocular surface representing one of the most common problems in ophthalmological practice. Characteristic symptoms of DED include gritty, sandy foreign body sensation as well as visual disturbances that have a negative impact on the patient's daily activities and social life. It is often assumed that the symptoms of dry eye are the main features of this disease, however, the symptoms do not always coincide with the signs and the results of diagnostic tests and the cause of this discordance in perception is still unclear. Numerous studies have been conducted in order to determine the cause of these discrepancies. Mental health disorders may be one of considerable contributing factors for dry eye symptoms and undiagnosed mental health conditions can be an influencing element for unexplained levels of DED symptoms. Depression, anxiety, stress, hypochondriasis, neuroticism, sleep and mood disorders may be associated with the exacerbation of symptoms to degrees that are not consistent with the objective signs related to tear dysfunction as well as changes in the anterior surface of the eye. Thus, a detailed medical history, thorough ophthalmological examination and referral to a psychologist or psychiatrist may be essential in the treatment of patients whose symptoms do not correlate with objective evidence of DED.","295":"Dry eye disease (DED) is a multifactorial disorder representing one of the most common ocular morbidities and a significant public health problem. It often results in eye discomfort, visual disturbances and potential damage to the corneal surface affecting quality of life (QOL). In recent years, the relationship between DED and psychiatric disorders has been gaining attention. A number of epidemiological studies have reported a possible association between dry eye and psychiatric disorders showing that the subjective symptoms of dry eye can be affected not only by changes of the tear film and ocular surface but also psychological factors such as anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSP) and subjective happiness. Apart from psychiatric disorders, psychiatric medications are also considered as risk factors for DED due to their influence on the tear film status. The incidence of ocular side effects increases rapidly with the use of polypharmacy, a very common form of treatment used in psychiatry. There is often inconsistency between signs and symptoms of DED, where symptoms often are more related to non-ocular conditions including psychiatric disorders than to tear film parameters. Consequently, in many cases DED may be considered as a psychiatric as well as ophthalmological problem. Psychiatrists and ophthalmologists need to be aware of the potential influence of psychiatric disorders and medications on tear film stability. In treatment of psychiatric patients, an integrative and transdisciplinary approach will result in better functioning and higher QOL.","296":"Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women. Modern research attempts to investigate the relationship between psychoemotional parameters and the length of survival of breast cancer patients. Understanding the factors which affect a higher level of resilience can have important clinical implications and can represent a guiding principle for designing psychological interventions that would accelerate recovery and improve the quality of life of cancer patients. To explore the relationship between resilience and quality of life of women with breast cancer. The study was conducted at the Clinic of Oncology of the University Clinical Hospital Mostar, which included 60 subjects. Objective realization was achieved through using the socio-demographic questionnaire purposely made for this research, the quality of life questionnaire WHQOL-BREF and the psychological resilience questionnaire CD-RISC-25. Subjects treated with radiotherapy achieved statistically significantly higher scores on subscales of the quality of life: mental health, social relations, and the environment. No statistically significant correlations were found between the level of resilience and results in the domains of quality of life. There is not a statistically significant association between resilience levels and quality of life in patients with breast cancer. ","297":"Coronavirus-2 pandemic has changed the functioning of health systems worldwide. It is not yet fully known which symptoms of the disease are most commonly presented in patients referred for pulmonary rehabilitation. Our aim was to investigate the profile of patients referred for pulmonary rehabilitation; what symptoms they had during the acute phase of the disease and what symptoms were still present at the start of pulmonary rehabilitation. Study included ongoing symptomatic and post-COVID patients who attended standard, in person pulmonary rehabilitation program. Patients had COVID-19 disease at least four weeks before attending pulmonary rehabilitation. Patients completed questionnaires of self-reported somatic deficits during acute and post-COVID-19 stage as well as questionnaires regarding their psychological symptoms. Pulmonary function test, expiratory and inspiratory muscle strenght, hand grip strenght and six-minute walk test was performed prior and after pulmonary rehabilitation. Study included 63 patients (32 male, 31 female), with mean age of 52.9 years. During acute COVID-19, majority of patients complained of fatigue, cough, dyspnea, myalgia and headache. More than 85% of patients reported pulmonary deficits during ongoing symptomatic and post-COVID-19 stage. Emotional distress and anxiety levels were significantly elevated in acute stage, while depression, anger and the need for help was not significantly elevated. All reported symptoms were significantly reduced in post-COVID-19 stage. There was statistically significant difference in six-minute walk distance, inspiratory and expiratory muscle strenght and hand grip strenght between first and final testing. Results of our study are similar with previous studies, the most common symptoms during acute phase were fatigue, cough and dyspnea and fatigue and respiratory problems during ongoing symptomatic and post-COVID stage. Emotional distress diminishes signifiacantly in post-COVID stage. Further larger studies are needed to clarify which acute disease symptoms are predominant in patients referred to pulmonary rehabilitation and cause prolongued discomfort. ","298":"A high rate of concurrent depression and anxiety has been identified among the patients of pain clinics. Evaluation of own pain can appear as a perception of being negatively impacted by pain-related suffering in social relations. A questionnaire with 228 variables was applied to 109 randomly chosen patients at outpatient pain clinic of the Ljubljana University Clinical Centre. Following summative scores were treated as a set of dependent variables in MANOVA, as a set of predictors in discriminant analysis: level of depression (Zung), level of anxiety (Zung), evaluation of the nature of pain and perceptions of negatively impacted social relations. Actual pain has been self-evaluated on a visual-analogue pain scale from 0 to 10 and recorded in subgroups with a low, middle and high intensity of actual pain (criterion variable). The average age of the participants was M=52.7 years (SD 13.9), 70.9 % of them female. Participants with a high intensity of pain were found to have the highest level of depression, the highest level of anxiety and were negatively impacted in their social relations to the greatest extent. Only the first discriminant function was found to be significant (p&lt;0.05). The structure matrix showed a high correlation between anxiety level (0.88) and depression level (0.86), and a low correlation with the perception of negatively impacted social relations (0.57). The results emphasize the connection between pain intensity, anxiety, depression and interpersonal relational issues in the context of patients with chronic pain at an outpatient pain clinic. Anxiety and mood were found to be the best predictors for the perception of pain intensity. The results are preliminary, but significantly support the multidisciplinary collaboration of treatment at a pain clinic with mental health professionals.

On the contrary, the dimensional approach to schizophrenia infers that schizophrenia is not a discrete illness entity, but that psychotic symptoms differ in quantitative ways from normal experiences and behaviours. Schizotypy comprise a set of inherited traits reflected in personality organization, which presents as qualitatively similar to schizophrenia. Schizotipy is in line with continuum hypothesis of schizophrenia where different combinations of genes and environmental risk factors result in a range of different phenotypic expressions lying on a continuum from normal through to clinical psychosis. We discuss evidences for the continuity of psychotic symptoms to normal experiences and theoretical and future research implications of such a continuum.","304":"There is growing evidence that resilience is a key factor for prevention of mental disorder. Low resilience levels were found in individuals at clinical high risk to psychosis and schizophrenia. Higher level of resilience was associated with better functioning, less severe negative, anxiety and depressive symptoms. Low level of self stigma is associated with recovery from schizophrenia. Aim of this paper was to determine whether resilience and self-stigma are significant predictors of mental health recovery in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and depression treated in a rehabilitation-oriented program. 51 patients diagnosed with psychoses and 53 patients with depression treated in day hospital participated in this study. Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Scale (ISMI), The Boston University Empowerment Scale (BUES), Perceived Devaluation and Discrimination (PDD) Scale, Mental Health Recovery Measure (MHRM) and Resilience questionnaire were used. Self-stigma positively correlates with PDD (r=0.44; p=0.000), and negatively with BUES (r=-0.78; p=0.000), resilience (r=-0.51; p=0.000) and with recovery (r=-0.59; p=0.000) in two groups. In addition, a higher PDD score indicates poorer levels of empowerment (r=-0.42; p=0.000), resilience (r=-0.35; p=0.000) and recovery (r=-0.44; p=0.000). Mental health empowerment, resilience and recovery all correlate significantly and positively with each other. Cross-group comparison results show the best results for patients with schizophrenia. Sociodemographic factors do not affect resilience, self-stigma nor recovery. Self-stigma and resilience are connected with moderate correlation. Research supports the need for interventions that prevent self-stigma and increase resilience in the treatment of schizophrenia patients.

A scarce number of studies have examined the effect of testosterone on aggression in women. The results obtained so far are inconsistent for some studies indicated a positive, whilst others showed a negative correlation. Since testosterone turned out to be an important factor related to aggression in men, the aim of our study was to investigate whether this correlation existed in aggressive female patients with schizophrenia. The sample consisted of 120 women, aged from 18 to 45 years, diagnosed with schizophrenia by DSM-5 criteria. Those who were breastfeeding or suffered from specific hormonal or other physical disorders were excluded from the study. They were divided into two groups of 60 - those with aggressive behavior and those with nonaggressive behavior. Psychopathology was measured by several tests (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale - PANSS, Overt Aggression Scale - OAS and PANSS Extended Subscale for Aggression Assessment). Serum testosterone hormone assays were performed. Statistical data analysis was done by parametric statistical tests, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Student's t-test and simple linear regression. All data were presented as mean values and corresponding standard deviations (SD). Testosterone levels didn't differ significantly between aggressive and nonaggressive subjects. There were no significant differences between testosterone levels in suicidal aggressive subjects compared to nonsuicidal aggressive respondents (t=0.616; p=0.540). The largest number of subjects in both groups had referent testosterone levels. Despite expecting a significant effect of testosterone levels on aggression in women with schizophrenia, conducted by previous studies, no correlation has been found. Suicidal behavior surprisingly didn't depend on the subjects' testosterone levels.

In our study, the aim was to determine whether sleep apnea affects the outcome of stroke patients. This is a prospective study in which a group of 110 patients in the acute phase of a stroke was evaluated sleep apnea. Acute stroke has been diagnosed either by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. There was no significant difference in patient's age with or without sleep apnea neither in men nor women. Neurological, neuropsychiatric, pulmonary test were performed in all patients at five different time periods. In these time periods, all patients were evaluated: Glasgow scale, The American National Institutes of Health Scale Assessment, Mini Mental Test, The Sleep and snoring Questionnaire Test, The Berlin Questionnaire Test, The Epworth Sleepiness Scale, The Stanford Sleepiness Scale and The general sleep questionnaire. One year after the onset of stroke, 91 (82.7%) of 110 patients with apnea survived. The survival rate of patients with sleep apnea is significantly lower than without sleep apnea (p=0.01). In men with apnea, the survival rate was significantly lower in patients without apnea (p=0.004). The largest number of survivors of apnea had diabetes mellitus, followed by survival of patients with heart disease, body mass index &gt;29 kg\/m2 and hypertension, with hyperlipoproteinemia and smoking. The highest number of survivors without apnea was body mass index &gt;29 kg\/m2, followed by survival of patients with hyperlipoproteinemia, heart disease, hypertension, smoking, and diabetes mellitus.

Besides different psychiatric comorbidities, depression is frequently interrelated with somatic diseases. Multi-morbidities, i.e. somatic diseases associated with depression, reduce quality of life, worsen clinical picture and increase mortality. The most frequent somatic diseases co-occurring with depression are cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Vulnerable individuals will develop depression, and the goal in modern research and in precision\/personalized medicine is to determine vulnerability factors associated with development of depression and to find easy available biomarkers of depression, especially comorbid with somatic diseases. This mini-review aimed to describe the latest published data (from 2015-20120) considering biomarkers of depression related to somatic diseases. Biomarkers related to inflammatory processes, atherosclerosis, imbalance of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, autonomic nerve system, sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system, heart rate variability and endothelial dysfunction could improve the understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms of the common pathways of depression comorbid with somatic diseases. These targeted biomarkers might be used to reduce the symptoms, improve the treatment of these interrelated diseases, and decrease the morbidity and mortality.","314":"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder clinically characterized by motor dysfunctions due to progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons and a broad spectrum of non-motor symptoms. Interestingly, non-motor symptoms like depression, anxiety and psychosis are often present several years before the occurrence of classic motor features seriously affecting patient quality of life. Their presence is often misleading, delaying the correct diagnosis of PD. Despite its high incidence, the pathophysiology and aetiology of neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with PD remains unclear. Currently, a lot of interest lays in research looking for genetic predictors of motor and non-motor symptoms in PD. The availability of next-generation sequencing technology for genome, epigenetic and transcriptional analysis opens the door to a new way of studying multifactorial diseases like PD and their comorbidities. In this review we will present new insights in the genomic and epigenetic background of psychiatric comorbidity in Parkinson's disease.","315":"Bipolar disorder (BD) is a common, recurring psychiatric illness with unknown pathogenesis. Much like other psychiatric diseases, BD suffers from the chronic lack of reliable biomarkers and innovative pharmacological interventions. Better characterization of clinical profiles, experimental medicine, genomic data mining, and the utilization of experimental models, including stem cell and genetically modified mice, are suggested ways forward. Environment, including early childhood experiences, has been documented to modulate the risk for the development of psychiatric disorders via epigenetic mechanisms. Key epigenetic regulators, microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs), govern normal neuronal functioning and show altered expression in diverse brain pathologies. We observed significant alterations of exosomal miR-29c levels in prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 9, BA9) of BD patients. We also demonstrated that exosomes extracted from the anterior cingulate cortex (BA24), a crucial area for modulating emotional expression and affect, have increased levels of miR-149 in BD patients compared to controls. Because miR-149 has been shown to inhibit glial proliferation, we hypothesized that increased miR-149 expression in BA24-derived exosomes may be consistent with the previously reported reduced glial cell numbers in BA24 of patients diagnosed with familial BD. qPCR analysis of laser-microdissected neuronal and glial cells from BA24 cortical samples of BD patients verified that the glial, but not neuronal, population exhibits significantly increased miR-149 expression. These findings support neuron-glia interaction as a possible target mechanism in BD, implicated by others in neuroimaging, postmortem, and in vivo studies of the pathological changes mediated by glial cells.","316":"Comorbidity in neurology and psychiatry involves the onset of a mental illness with the simultaneous presence of a neurological disorder or other illness. The degree of comorbidity of mental and neurological disorders is unexpectedly high. In addition to the direct connection and simultaneous occurrence of mental and neurological illness, the indirect impact of mental illness on the occurrence of neurological problems is even more significant. This link is realized through the influence of mental illness on risk factors for the development of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases. Their incidence is higher in the psychiatric population than in the general population. Numerous studies have confirmed that risk factors for cerebrovascular disease (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, etc.) are more common among patients with mental disorders than in the general population. Also, research shows that patients with mental disorders are less frequently controlled, have less control over risk factors, and that numerous comorbidities are detected later or remain undetected. Given that cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases represent one of the most important public health and socioeconomic problems of today, both in the world and in Croatia, this problem should not remain in the shadow.","317":"The prevalence of obesity, diabetes, arterial hypertension and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases is increasing worldwide. Nowdays we are witnessing a pandemic of metabolic syndrome and obesity and an epidemic of these diseases in Croatia as well. Moreover, every second Croatian citizen dies because of cardiovascular diseases. Visceral obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia and arterial hypertension tend to cluster forming a syndrome that we call metabolic syndrome. The concept of metabolic syndrome was defined several decades ago as visceral type of obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL-cholesterol, arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus (insulin resistance). Most widely used definition is the one by National Education Cholesterol Program, NCEP - Adult treatment Panel III - ATP III . Therefore, visceral obesity is considered as one of the greatest risks for mortality worldwide. COVID pandemia increased the risk od deaths especially among patients with metabolic syndrome. Pandemia perpetuated several other socio-economical risk factors (stress, depression, physical inactivity, deviant behaviour...) which also strongly influence cardiovascular health. Unfortunately, SARS-COV-2 virus enters the host (human) cell using signaling pathways (ANG II Rc) known very well from the metabolic syndrome research and connecting those two entities predesponing these patients for a much worse prognosis when infected with SARS-COV-2 virus. To conclude - chronic obesity pandemia goes hand by hand with novel COVID-19 pandemia dramatiacally increasing the risk of severe morbidity and mortality.","318":"Representations of chronic illness have a strong influence on quality of life and coping. Illness-related believes and attitudes depend on the medical condition itself (including illness type and duration), as well as individual and relational variables. Couples affected by chronic illness develop shared illness representations, which support the patients' adaptation process. Our study was focused on illness representations in five patient groups, considering variables of illness duration and relationship satisfaction. The Illness Perception Questionnaire was administered to 154 subjects (79 male 75 femaile) and their partners in five illness groups (average illness duration 6.9 years). Marital satisfaction and similarity of illness representations as well as accuracy of estimates about the partner's illness representations were studied. The five patient groups significantly differed in their illness representations. In groups with longer illness duration, illness was perceived as chronical and more symptoms were experienced. Similarity of illness perceptions between subjects and their partners was highest for the asthma and lung cancer group, and spouses' scores differed most for the dimension of coherence. Marital satisfaction was related to similarity of illness perceptions, and more accurate estimates of the partners' perception. Marital satisfaction has a remarkable influence on illness representation similarity and accuracy of the perception about the partner's illness representations. Patients and their partners are more likely to form similar illness representations if symptoms are clearly observable as in the case of asthma or lung cancer. The dimension of coherence has significant within-person variations, as illness usually has a deeply personal meaning to both the patients and their partners. ","319":"The evolution of immunology enabled the study of role of innate and adaptive immunity in systems biology network of immunosenescence and inflammaging. Due to global reduction in birth rates and reduced mortality, in year 2025 there will be about 1.2 billion of people over age of sixty, worldwide. The notion that the real age is not chronological, but the biological one led to the concept of \"bioage\", defining the biologic reactivity and resilience, including the immune competence of an individual. A competent immune network, systemic and mucosal is intrinsic to resilience and homeostasis of the human holobiont as the unit of evolution. In elderly, the immunosenescence could be associated with higher levels of proinflammatory mediators (such as IL-6), frialty and mortality. Proi-inflammatory state in elderly is denoted as inflammaging, characterized with low-grade (sterile) inflammation, as a physiologic response to life-long antigenic stimuli. When under control, inflammaging could be regarded as an efficient defense mechanism, oposed and regulated by anti-inflammatory pathways and molecules. Immunosensecence. The emerging concepts of \"individual immunobiography\" and \"trained immunity\" speak in favour that the immunological experience during the life would shape the ability of each individual to respond to various stimuli, strongly influencing the elements of innate and adaptive immunity, including macrophages and innate lymphoid cells. Older age is one of the main risk factors for the severe clinical picture and adverse outcome of COVID-19 infection, due to immunosenscence and chronic low-grade inflammation (inflammaging), both characterizing the immune reactioin in elderly. The senescent immune system, along with the advanced process of inflammaging is prone to react with uncontrolled activation of innate immune response that leads to cytokine release syndrome, tissue damage and adverse outcome of infection.

There are many reasons why the study of comorbidities and syndemics of COVID-19 is of great importance for researchers, clinicians and health policy makers who are responsible for health care organization and funding in a bid to develop more effective and efficient prevention and treatment. Thinking about COVID-19 through a syndemics concept and taking biological, psychological, social and spiritual dimensions into account, physicians could be more effective in clinical practice and community-based interventions. The outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection is determined by the virus-host interaction, with pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 being related to the presence of comorbid diseases. The risk for severe COVID-19 clinical manifestations and death increases with age of patients and comorbidity. General mechanisms of multi-system dysfunction and multi-organ damage reported in COVID-19 are probably related to ubiquitous expression of ACE2 in many tissues and its important role in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) functioning. Physicians all over the world should be aware of COVID-19 related comorbidities, multisystem disorders and syndemics, as well as treatment and preventive strategies. COVID-19 age is a right time to reconsider the state of science and practice in comorbidity medicine field from the both epistemological and treatment perspective. Comorbidities and multimorbidities are indifferent to medical specializations, so the integrative and complementary medicine is an imperative in the both education and practice. Shifting the paradigm from vertical and mono-morbid interventions to comorbidity, multimorbidity and multi-system disease approaches enhances effectiveness and efficiency of human resources utilization. The aim of this review is to summarize the theoretical concepts and clinical experience and research regarding comorbidity in general, and specifically related to the COVID-19 pandemic, syndemics and infodemic.","322":null,"323":null,"324":"During the lockdown due to COVID-19, Internet use may become more frequent in students, with possible negative consequences on mental health. In this emergency situation, variables such as depression, anxiety and external locus of control could be related to a Problematic Internet Use; on the other hand, self-esteem, internal locus of control, self-efficacy, and social support can play the role of protective factors for Problematic Internet Use. The present survey aims to verify the impact of these intrapersonal and social factors on Problematic Internet Use in college and High School students during the COVID-19 pandemic through a web-based cross-sectional study. 191 students from Lombardy, one of the Italian Regions among the most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, were included in the study. An online questionnaire has been administered during the first Italian period of forced lockdown. A logistic regression analysis was performed to assess intrapersonal and social factors as predictors of Problematic Internet Use. Analysis highlighted a higher risk of Problematic Internet Use (5.77 times more) in males compared to females. Individuals with high external locus of control and severe depression have respectively 6.56 and 2.84 times more the risk of presenting Problematic Internet Use. In contrast, social support, self-efficacy, and self-esteem were negatively related to Problematic Internet Use. In total sample, the percentage of Problematic Internet Use was high (55.5%). An increasing use of the Internet has been observed during lockdown, leading to a progressive increase in the diffusion of Problematic Internet Use. Gender, depression and external locus of control emerge as risk factors for Problematic Internet Use, while social support, self-efficacy and self-esteem represent protective factors. The current research identifies some intrapersonal and social factors in an epidemic context for which the development of effective behavioural, supportive and\/or educational interventions would be appropriate. ","325":"COVID-19 pandemic is the first modern pandemic and has occurred in an era of social media ubiquity. Despite being in stage 1 of the pandemic, and low numbers of patients, various emotional and behavioral changes were observed in junior doctors. This study was designed to assess the experience and reactions of junior doctors in a tertiary teaching hospital in North India and Tamil Nadu in the immediate aftermath of the nation-wide lockdown. This was an observational cross- sectional study of junior doctors working in tertiary care hospitals in Chandigarh and Tamil Nadu. It was conducted from 28th March to 5th April 2020. Ethical clearance obtained and anonymity was maintained. We used a 17-item self-designed questionnaire circulated online. Mean age was 28.64 years (n=362). Though mostly well informed, only 8% restricted themselves to obtaining information from a single source. Around 46% were feeling anxious and many more (73.20%) perceived the same emotion in their peers and even more of them (85.10%) in their family members. Most of them (90.1%) endorsed more than change in behavior, mainly to avoid potential risk (52%) and females tend to self-quarantine themselves more than males. Knowledge does not play as important a role in the way people behave in an outbreak. Many other covert factors may possible be involved. Strategies leading to reduction in uncertainty, interventions for reassurance in the workplace and better role models would be of help in this outbreak. ","326":"To determine the effect of lockdown measures on lung transplant patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected data from Croatian lung transplant patients before and after the lockdown and analyzed changes in weight, BMI, lung function and blood lipid status. An average increase of 3.74 kg (+4.92%) body weight during the 4 month lockdown period was observed. Lung function values and blood lipid status remained stable. Such weight gain could have detrimental effects on the morbidity and mortality of lung transplant patients. Further follow up is needed to determine the long term impacts of this observation. ","327":"Exposure to patients with COVID-19 can have a significant impact on mental health of hospital medical staff. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of proximity to patients with COVID-19 considering occupational position and gender on the mental health of hospital staff. N=78 participants were included in the study, with n=40 of them with direct contact to patients with COVID-19 (51%); eight had contact with patients suspected of having COVID-19 (10%), and n=30 with no direct contact to people with COVID-19 (39%). Multinomial regression analyses showed that proximity had a negative (inverse) influence on avoidance behaviour as part of PTSD, physical symptoms, somatization, compulsiveness and anger expression-in as tendency to suppress anger. In addition, there was a significant impact of the female gender on increased physical symptoms, while age, work experience and occupation had no further influence. These results that hospital medical staff is less psychologically stressed when closer to COVID-19 patients are inconsistent with previous studies. Self-efficacy and locus of control in these situations are relevant for processing the trauma. In summary, perception of personal risk is essential. Proximity is believed to be a proxy variable for personal risk perception. As a synopsis of these results, regular briefings of the hospital staff are recommended to prevent psychological impairment. They should contain specific information about conditions in the affected wards and the risk of infection, which could help reduce risk perception of medical personnel. ","328":"The COVID 19 pandemic has had significant psychological effects on university students as well as in all segments of society. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between education fields (medical-non medical), education styles (online-face to face), sociodemographic characteristics of university students and their levels of depression, anxiety, stress, fear of COVID-19. In the cross-sectional designed research, 1213 university students studying in Turkey was reached online. A sociodemographic form, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS 21) and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) was applied to the participants. Of all participants 887 (73%) were women. 647 (53%) students were studying in the medical field. The scores of FCV-19S and all subscales of DASS 21 were significantly higher in women. In the comparison between the field and style of education, no difference was found. DASS 21 scores were higher in the participants whose relatives had COVID-19 or who had a mental disorder in the past or medical disease. In this study, it was observed that while there was no significant difference in the scores of DASS 21 among university students in terms of the field and style of education, variables such as gender, not having COVID-19 so far, having lost a relative due to COVID-19 could cause significant differences. Identifying sensitive groups will create early intervention opportunities. ","329":"In 2020. the COVID-19 pandemic presented an additional source of stress and anxiety not just to the general population but also to medical students who are, even under normal circumstances, constantly under pressure due to demanding student duties. In addition, they experienced a series of devastating earthquakes in and around the Zagreb region which altogether could have had compromised their psychological well-being. The aim of this review was to evaluate the psychological effects of these two natural disasters on the mental health of Croatian medical students. According to standardized questionnaires for depression and anxiety evaluation, 75.3% of students were anxious and 65.2% were depressive during the \"double crisis\". No significant difference of these two outcomes was observed regarding genders, but it was found that first year students had a significantly higher anxiety score than older ones. In such stressful situations, we should emphasize the importance of mental health not just of healthcare workers, but also of medical students in order to prevent serious psychological consequences and to alleviate the negative effects on students' motivation and their educational process.

No data exists for healthcare staff, such as nurses and more specifically for gerontological nurses who exercise power on their colleagues as well as older persons. This study aims to examine whether there are emotional correlates of gerontological nurses' experienced hubris when serving in a leadership position, and to investigate possible gender differences during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a little investigated period regarding its emotional aspects on healthcare professionals. Gerontological nurses in leadership positions completed Job Affect Scale, Emotional Labour Scale, Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, Generalized Immediacy Scale, General Index of Job Satisfaction, Maslach Burnout Inventory, Wong-Law Emotional Intelligence Scale, State-Anxiety-Inventory, Perceived Cohesion Scale, and a 5-point Likert scale measuring hubristic attributes. No statistically significant differences were found between male and female nurses regarding the abovementioned classic administered emotional scales and hubris. The analyses yielded only a negative correlation between negative affect and hubris. This research provides for the first time data regarding gerontological nurses in leadership positions, suggesting that various negative and positive emotional variables do no directly relate to hubristic symptoms for this group of healthcare professionals. As hubristic behaviors and their dangerous consequences are found not to be related to abovementioned emotional variables, researchers and hospital managers should consider and focus on other indices in their attempt to prevent such phenomena.","332":"The recent empirical data represented the unprecedented opportunity to understand how threatful situations affect people adaptive and mal-adaptive behaviour and diverse ways to cope with the situation.

A cross-sectional observational study included 38 GPs\/FPs from nine municipalities in the Hercegovina-Neretva and West Herzegovina canton. Data were collected by using an Individual questionnaire for all GPs\/FPs which was prepared according to the Questionnaire for family physicians on implementing the Cancer Control Program, which is used in Croatia. Statistical analysis showed that most GPs\/FPs carried out activities on primary cancer prevention (educating patients about smoking, alcohol, diet, physical activity, cancer education, and screening). The majority of respondents stated that it was not profitable to do screening for lung cancer and stomach cancer. Most GPs\/FPs (73.7%) recommended mammography to women individually, sporadically, according to individual risk assessment. The scientific contribution and the results of this work can be applied in practice in local communities. Given its position in the health system, ongoing contact with the population that elected it, and its impact on the local community in which it operates, GP\/FP plays an important role in the prevention of disease. Integration of preventive activities into the daily work of the doctor plays the most important role in achieving excellent results.

Moreover, these findings have rarely been based on prospective studies from clinical routine settings. Identifying predictors in prospective studies could help to tailor interventions that increase participation and success rates of smoking cessation therapies for these patients at a high risk for alcohol- and smoking-related morbidities and mortalities. During inpatient alcohol dependence treatment, 99 nicotine dependent patients were recruited. 73 patients chose to participate in a voluntary smoking cessation program. Interviews and questionnaires were used at baseline and at discharge to assess a large set of variables covering smoking and alcohol related factors, general psychopathology, quality of life and personality traits. Multiple logistic regression models were calculated to predict participation in the smoking cessation program and smoking abstinence at follow-up three months after discharge. Participation in the smoking cessation program was predicted by higher stage of change, higher confidence in abstaining from smoking and lower perceived stress. Successful smoking cessation at follow-up was predicted by higher expectations of negative physical feelings due to smoking and lower expectations of temptations to smoke at baseline, and by lower number of daily smoked cigarettes at discharge. Despite the small sample size, this prospective study gives a first indication of clinically relevant predictors of participation in and success of a smoking cessation program by exploring many previously reported predictors simultaneously.

A total of 1360 pregnant women were enrolled from 14 antenatal care (ANC) hospitals during September 2015 to August 2017. All selected women were assessed longitudinally at first, second and third trimesters of pregnancy. The State Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S) scale was used to measure the antenatal anxiety symptom. Generalize estimating equations (GEE) and alternating logistic regression (ALR) model were used to measure the risk factors and repetitive anxiety symptom measurements, respectively. Over the study period, more than half (53.18%) of the women reported anxiety in at least one antenatal assessment. The prevalence of anxiety symptom in the first, second, and third trimesters was 29.5%, 23.5%, and 37.5%, respectively. Maternal anxiousness was significantly associated with the trimester, poor education, low blood hemoglobin, and low family income.

PubMed data base was used as a source of medical literature, which was afterwards filtered through established criteria to select the eligible articles dealing with attitudes toward psychiatry among medical students. Our findings indicate that likelihood of selecting psychiatry as a career is highly influenced by student's perception of the specialty, which is in turn shaped by many factors. So far several studies have underlined importance of clinical clerkship and it's positive effect among students when choosing psychiatry as a specialty. There is highly negative opinion among medical students towards psychiatry as a career choice and completion of a practice does not necessarily lead to a change in attitudes among different populations.

However, recent articles in scientific literature have disconfirmed this thesis. Trentino also seems not to deviate from this dynamic: preliminary data, collected in an unconventional, and not yet official way, have been able to show that in 2020 the suicide rate remained stable. The finding that excludes up to date such a rise in rates does not unfortunately provide any guarantee that the situation will remain constant over time, and that there cannot be significant differences regarding gender, ethnicity, religious faith, sexual orientation or social class in determining a different impact of the current crisis on the suicidal phenomenon.

Among the changes that the adolescent has to face are: accepting one's body, acquiring a social role, female or male, establishing new relationships with peers of both sexes, achieving emotional independence from parents and other adults, acquiring social behavior responsible, learn a system of values and an ethical conscience as a guide to one's behavior, develop intellectual skills and prepare for a profession, achieve independence (Juli 2020).

The incidence of migraine with aura was significantly higher in the parosmia\/phanthosmia group than in the control group (8% versus 0.9%). The allergy was reported significantly more frequent in the study group compared to the control group. Qualitative olfactory disorders occur frequently in COVID-19 patients. Those with the parosmia\/phanthosmia phenotype have a higher risk for other symptoms, notably headache (including migraine with aura), fatigue, brain fog, dizziness, and cardiovascular\/autonomic manifestations, as well as allergy. We suppose that further investigation of this phenomenon will reveal phenotypic variants depending on particular symptoms cluster; improved nosology of qualitative olfactory disorders in COIVD-19 is a prerequisite for establishing appropriate treatments.

The helping professions involved have seen an increase in stress levels, a sense of helplessness, fear, pain and social isolation. They are anchored to the hope of being able to return to their normality. In this study, 87 mental health operators were evaluated, divided into nurses, psychiatric rehabilitation technicians, educators, social workers, psychologists and doctors, working in two psychiatric care rehabilitation communities in Puglia and Campania in southern Italy. The results obtained with the administration of the scales ProQOL, BHS, Save-9, BDI-II, BEES reported a remarkable impact in nursing and medical professions due to the pandemic. A 11%. burn-out was reported by nurses. The collected data are comparable to the previous work (Franza et al. 2015, 2020); however, there is no evidence of a high level of burnout in the helping professions involved in this study. ","359":"The continuation of the health emergency due to the management of COVID-19 is having a profound effect on all aspects of society, including mental health and physical health. This observational study examined practitioners of psychiatric rehabilitation and therapeutic communities, focusing on the emotional aspects of patient care, in particular the fatigue of compassion, empathy and lack of hope, aspects that could be directly linked to the burnout of health professionals, as found in other similar studies. In this study, self-administered scale data was collected in 87 healthcare professionals recruited from 3 different psychiatric rehabilitation communities. In particular, we assessed the fatigue of compassion, vicarious trauma, burnout and hope (hopeless), empathy and depressive symptoms in the two months of May and June 2021. The results obtained after the administration of the following rating scales, ProQOL, BHS, SAVE-9, BDI-II and BEES, showed an overall increase in scores in all professional figures, a significant fatigue of compassion, while the percentage burnout is not present in several groups. The presence of high levels of hope, satisfaction of compassion is indicative of a moderate level of empathy in some professional figures; these high levels can protect workers from the risk of developing work-related stress and depressive symptoms. The data obtained with this study are not similar to those of previous studies, although they may indicate the importance of factors such as hope, empathy in the care of the patient with psychic disorders in rehabilitation communities, underlining the need for interventions aimed at the emotional management of the care relationship as a tool to improve care and prevent burnout even during times of high stress, such as managing a pandemic. ","360":"Deaths caused by the virus Covid-19 expose survivors to a high risk of developing a mourning pathology, a state of suffering that presents traumatic aspects similar to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The characteristics with which the death process took place, during the period following the Coronavirus infection, are configured as important risk factors due to the inability to give the last farewell to the deceased during the period of the lockdown, to see and accompany their loved ones in the last moments of their life. The absence of the deceased body to cry for, the lack of a funeral and any other type of social and personal ritual, are to be considered as obstacles and aggravation factors with respect to the usual elaborative dynamics of mourning. The functional role of some brain areas such as the amygdala in mediating both the responses to stress and the learning of emotions implicitly identifies its importance in the pathophysiology of major trauma such as in pathological bereavement and in PTSD. Behavioral and environmental psychology studies have highlighted the therapeutic value of open contexts, in particular green areas, such as in forest bathing, in the processing of traumas, in which the narration can take place in a way that is independent from traditional therapy, with encouraging results, as demonstrated from the clinical case of Sofia.","361":"Unresolved infectious psycho-neuro-endocrino-inflammation (PNEI) denotes an area of tragically accelerated interest because of SARS-CoV-2`s capacity to meddle with the immune responses in a stage-wise fashion. Its pandemic, interacting with antecedent further deteriorating health and living conditions, takes a direct toll of million human lives. In order to withstand the plethora of slowly or never easing ailments labeled \"Post-acute Sequelae of Covid-19 (PASC)\" a comprehensive understanding from the intrusions up to its emerging aftermaths is paramount. For the strained health professions these prospect care requirements of 1 in 5 for a non-convalescence overlapping also with other tedious long-hauling \"triggered\" disorders adjacent to psychiatry like chronic fatigue with orthostasis intolerance or intracranial hypertension (ME\/CFS-OI; IIH). For the lattter two new pathophysiologies are proposed in order to inform a strong rehabilitative psychiatric liaison not referring sufferers to a psychiatric \"enigmo-somatic bin\", but to an invigorated somato-psychic care e. g. for exertional malaise. Starting from early stimulation of escalating myeloid-derived suppressor cells the neglected mast cells show up (for now without their lymphatic partners) as ambivalent core participants. They interact or orchestrate or sequentially explode in etosis guarding or breaking sane barriers especially at cerebral arteries. In Covid-19 they seem unleashed at the blood-brain-barrier by the early virally invaded nasal ganglia, which plausibly mis-direct the quickest interstitial arterio-intramural outflow - thus a.) losing its ability to \"comply\" with pulsatile flow through varying the width of its sliding chambers causing ME\/CFS-Orthostatic Intolerance and b.) inflaming and stiffening the brain's interstitium through a \"push-back\" outpacing the confuted inventive \"glymphatic-1.0\" model.

Disturbed attitudes towards weight, body shape, and eating play a key role in the origin and maintenance of eating disorders. Eating disorders have been increasing over the past 50 years and changes in the food environment have been implicated. All health-care providers should routinely enquire about eating habits as a component of overall health assessment. Six main feeding and eating disorders are now recognised in diagnostic systems: anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder, pica, and rumination disorder (Treasure 2020).","364":"The concept of physical and intellectual disability has experienced a series of changes and evolutions over time with regard to approach, classification and rehabilitation-therapeutic programs, since it contemplates a heterogeneous clinical phenomenology in terms of severity, complexity, pervasiveness and severity of the diagnosis. The significant repercussions on the quality of life mean that a comprehensive approach is required with attention to the physical, social, emotional, sensory and cognitive profile, and that there is a need for the adoption of classification systems and assessment tools that are different and in some ways pioneering, so as to guarantee the surpassing of the concept of disability as a \"mere defect\" physical and\/or impairment and\/or loss of psychological, physiological or anatomical function (Holden &amp; Gitlesen 2003, Linden 2017, WHO 2001). It is exactly in contemplation of a bio-psycho-social model, that the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) arises, which possesses a neutral position with respect to etiology and a complementarity with the ICD-10 classification (WHO 2001), since it allows the functional diagnosis (i.e. a specialized analytical description of the potential and deficits in relation to the pathology) proposing a detailed analysis of the possible social consequences of disability by evaluating the residual capacities and measuring the \"social skills\" (WHO 2001).","365":"Candidates for bariatric surgery undergo a multidisciplinary evaluation in the pre-operative phase, including a psychiatric visit aimed at the screening for psychiatric comorbidities, including feeding and eating disorders (FEDs), which are shortcomings to the intervention or predictors of worse prognosis. The presence of FEDs, such as Binge Eating Disorder (BED) and Bulimia Nervosa (BN), is associated with higher rates of other psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, there is evidence of the association between obesity and Depressive Disorders, as well as B and C Cluster Personality Disorders. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of psychiatric comorbidities among a population of candidates for bariatric surgery. Subjects were recruited at the outpatient service of the Section of Psychiatry, Clinical Psychology and Rehabilitation of the General Hospital\/University of Perugia after being referred by surgeons. Psychiatric comorbidities were investigated by means of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Disorders. Subjects underwent specific assessment with scales for the evaluation of FEDs, namely Binge Eating Scale, Obesity Questionnaire, Bulimia Test-Revised and Body Shape Questionnaire. The sample consisted of 101 subjects: 43 (42.6%) were diagnosed with at least one psychiatric disorder, including FEDs. In particular, 30 subjects (29.7%) presented at least one FED, among which the most frequent were FED not otherwise specified (24.1%) and BED (6.8%). Moreover, 26 subjects (25.7%) were diagnosed with at least one psychiatric disorder other than FEDs, such as Personality Disorders (17.1%), with a higher prevalence of B and C Cluster Disorders. Depressive Disorders were detected in 5% of the sample. Subjects undergoing bariatric surgery often display psychiatric comorbidities, more frequently one or more FEDs. The systematic screening of these conditions should be implemented in the clinical practice in order to provide early intervention strategies and adequate monitoring.

This phenomenon cannot only be linked to school dysfunction but must be considered in a larger set of processes. Recent studies propose an understanding of school refusal in terms of psychopathology and individual functioning as well as in terms of associated environmental and family factors. We conducted a retrospective study on youths admitted in our child psychiatric unit at HUDERF with an anxious school refusal behavior. The medical records of all 442 patients, admitted in the unit between 1996 and 2019, were inspected. It allows the inclusion of 71 patients, aged from 8 to 16 years. 16% of all patients present an anxious school refusal (ASR). There is a significant difference of sex, in inpatients with anxious school refusal, with 70.42% of male (p&lt;0.0003). Concerning familial and parental characteristics, family separation (56.3%), conflict at home (27%), contact rupture with the father (25.3%) were associated with the onset of the school refusal. Parental psychiatric illness was frequently reported with maternal psychiatric illness (46.5%) and paternal history of psychiatric illness (28.2%). Maltreatment (30.9%) was also frequently observed in our inpatient population of youths with ASR. Concerning school and peers' relationships, we observe relational difficulties with peers (46.5%), bullying (26.7%), academic difficulties (36.6%) or change of school or moving home (19.7%). Mood and adjustment disorder were the most frequent associated diagnosis in our sample. We confirmed that patient with anxious school refusal that need inpatient care were usually male, with more complex psychopathologies in term of comorbidities and familial maltreatment or psychiatric loading. They also have much more peers and school problems.

Furthermore, attempts to regulate hunger and satiety through modulation pharmacological effects of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides have shown only short-term benefit. However, in light of the serious impact of DCA on patients and the scarcity of non-pharmacological therapeutic approaches, research in this area should not be abandoned, also because new generation \"molecules\" become increasingly available. Many studies looked at efficacy of antipsychotics, Tryciclics, SSRI, mood stabilizers in the treatment of ED. Gabaergic circuit, the opioid one are extremely involved in the neurohormonal mechanisms of regulation of dietary behaviors and that molecules that influence these circuits could be used in the pharmacological treatment of ED as already happens in the case of Naltrexone, gabapentine or gabaergic drugs.","368":null,"369":"Antidepressants (AD) are widely used in the treatment of mood disorders and administered for mental disorders coded across other diagnostic categories. However, inaccuracy in AD prescription may lead to unresponsive cases, decreased compliance, and treatment discontinuation.

We studied 537 medical case records of inpatients and outpatients who had received treatments on an arbitrarily chosen day, focusing on classes, doses, drug combinations, and switching patterns for AD prescription. All statistical calculations (descriptive statistics, between group comparisons using Fisher exact, binominal and Pearson chi-square tests, significant at two-tailed p&lt;0.05) were performed with the IBM SPSS 27. 15% of inpatients and 52% of outpatients with mental disorders received ADs. ADs were prescribed for major depressive disorder and other diagnoses, including the majority of schizophrenia spectrum disorders and non-organic conditions. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, particularly fluvoxamine, were used most often for outpatient and inpatient settings, but at lower average dose rather than recommended, while tricyclic ADs were more likely to be correctly administered for severe depression. ADs were often prescribed within combined treatment rather than monotherapy, but clinical recommendations were not strictly followed in relation to the drug choice, combination with antipsychotic agents and switching strategies. The clinical reality of AD prescriptions in the studied psychiatric setting differed from the clinical guidelines, insofar as the choice of AD medication did not always follow evidence-based recommendations. Choice and dosage of ADs should properly follow duration and severity of the illness, and the clinical profile of disorders.

Hope, or rather its absence, social isolation and loneliness are considered risk factors for the development of anxious and depressive symptoms. Health authorities have had to address issues regarding the mental health risks that the pandemic has created. There is numerous scientific evidences of the increase in affective disorders in the last two years. Associated with these disorders, particular characteristics of personality temperament, such as affective temperament, can determine an increased risk especially in some patient populations, such as the elderly, with significant negative consequences on the quality of life and on the onset of mental and organic diseases. The hope of the end of the pandemic has been placed on mass vaccination. After an initial enthusiasm there was a growing concern about its side effects.

The \"mixity\" is a dynamic notion describing the presence of overlapping symptoms of mixed states, in an increasing intensity level. The early utilization of the rating scale on mixed states, \"GT-MSRS\", which can demonstrate the level of \"mixity\" of the mood disorder, can prevent this.

This study aimed to investigate the stress and burnout levels of psychiatrists working in MH services in Turkey and determine the relationship between stress, workload, and support during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online questionnaire was sent to child and adult psychiatrists registered with Turkish professional mail groups. 217 psychiatrists replied, with equal numbers from child (n=108) and adult (n=109) MH services. The Copenhagen Burnout Inventory and study-specific questionnaire were used. 60.8% of psychiatrists (n=132) experienced medium-or high-intensity work-related burnout, 49.8% (n=108) experienced patient-related burnout, and 31.8% (n=69) experienced medium-or high-intensity personal burnout. Patient-related burnout scores were significantly higher in the child psychiatry group than in the adult psychiatry group. The majority (n=126, 58.1%) reported either moderate or higher stress levels linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. Turnover intention, reluctance to retrain in psychiatry and sense of lack of value in the job are all associated with higher levels of burnout. The current COVID-19 pandemic is likely to bring additional stressors to psychiatrists. This study shows that psychiatrists in Turkey already exhibit high levels of work-related stress.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the mental health burden of the Turkish population and vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 outbreak, especially exploring the effects of social support. We assessed depression, anxiety, stress symptoms and perceived social support among 894 people all over Turkey, using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) two months after the declaration of the first COVID-19 case in Turkey. According to DASS-21 subscale scores, the findings showed that the prevalence of moderate to severe depression, anxiety and stress-related symptoms was 24.8%, 21.9% and 12.6%, respectively. Female gender, being single, having a lifetime psychiatric disorder, lower education level and financial concerns were significantly associated with higher DASS-21 scores. Also, there was a negative correlation between all subgroups of perceived social support, especially from the family, and the total DASS-21 score.

The routine in-campus education of health knowledge related to the epidemic was conducted in the control group, while the experiment group received both the routine education and the intervention of psychological counseling in combination with outdoor exercise. No significant difference exists between the experiment and control groups (P&gt;0.05) before the intervention, but the scores of the experiment group in anxiety and depression are lower than those of the control group (P&lt;0.05) after the intervention; the PSQI score of the experiment group is significantly lower after the intervention, suggesting that the effect on the experiment group is better than the control group (P&lt;0.05); the scores of the experiment group in psychological resilience and its 5 dimensions are higher than those of the control group (P&lt;0.05).

Although it appears to be effective in mitigating this spread, its implementation in workplaces may undermine employees' mental health. In fact, torn between the fear of contagion and the need to maintain their jobs, employees must also comply with physical distancing measures in the workplace, which alter social interactions and set a predetermined frame and distance that guide employees' behaviors within the organization while they need empathy. This situation might increase their level of stress. This paper is a narrative review that addresses the impact of physical distancing in the workplace on employees' mental health. It presents the main factors that might moderate this impact and it recommends organizational interventions that can help to mitigate it. Physical distancing measures in workplaces are necessary and inevitable. Notwithstanding, they might undermine employees' mental health, whence the importance to implement proper organizational actions to support employees and to facilitate their adaptation, in this unprecedented organizational change.

Nolen Hoeksema demonstrated the effect of rumination on the development of various forms of psychopathology in adults, while recent data suggest that cognitive control may be a factor underlying this relationship. The aim of this study is to investigate the relation between cognitive control impairments and symptoms of depression through rumination in adolescents suffering from internalizing psychiatric disorders. The study included 100 adolescents of both genders diagnosed with internalizing psychiatric disorders at the Unit for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at University Hospital Center Osijek. During psychodiagnostic assessment, subjects completed Youth self report, CANTAB Intra-dimensional\/extra-dimensional (IED) task, The Ruminative Response Scale, and Beck Depression Inventory-II. The results indicate a clinically significant level of internalizing symptoms and a clinically and subclinically high level of depressive symptoms. The results also show a high positive correlation between internalizing symptoms, rumination, and depressive symptoms, as well as a positive correlation between female gender and internalizing symptoms, rumination, and depressive symptoms. Significant predictors of depression are female gender and rumination while cognitive control has not been detected as a significant predictor. The results of the study emphasize the importance of rumination in the prediction of depressive symptoms in internalizing psychiatric disorders among adolescents and, accordingly, the importance of rumination as a clinical variable in terms of implications in the prevention and treatment of internalizing psychopathology. ","405":"Unipolar depression is common among adolescents and has high recurrence rates. Studies conducted with adults show that oxidative stress plays a role in etiology of depression but studies with adolescent patients are limited. In addition, baseline S100B level in adult patients with depression is considered as a marker of response to treatment. The purpose of this study was to measure the levels of serum S100B, Malondialdehyde (MDA), total oxidant status (TOS), and total antioxidant status (TAS), which have not been previously investigated in adolescent patients with first-episode, drug-naive unipolar depression, and to investigate the relationship of these parameters with disease severity and patient-specific variables. This study was conducted with 37 adolescents diagnosed with unipolar depression and 37 healthy peers. Participants were asked to fill out the Beck Depression Scale, Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders, and suicide probability questionnaires. After this procedure, 5 cc blood was collected from the adolescents and serum S100B, MDA, TOS, and OSI levels measured. Serum S100B, MDA, TOS, and OSI levels were higher and TAS level was lower in patients than their healthy peers. There was no relationship between the patients' severity of depression or suicide probability and these parameters. The serum S100B, MDA, TOS, and OSI levels of female patients were higher than their healthy peers, but the TAS level was not different. Male patients had higher TOS and OSI levels and lower TAS levels than their healthy peers. The results show that increased serum S100B, MDA, TOS and OSI levels may contribute to etiology of depression regardless of gender. The gender-specific increase in S100B and MDA levels, which were significantly increased in female adolescent patients but not in males, should be supported by further follow-up studies.

Given the scarcity and reliability of data on the phenomenon, the present study focuses on the epidemiological pattern of HK in Turkey, where many cases of the HK are considered unreported or\/and falsely described. Data for this retrospective epidemiological study was collected through newspaper reports on intimate partner femicide (IPF) that published between January 1st 2010 and December 31st 2015. The proportion of HK was estimated according to independent variables by means of regression analysis. The femicide cases has increased during the study period. The proportion of the HK cases was 14%. Logistic regression analysis showed that being at the younger ages (odds ratio, OR=2.0, r=0.70, P&lt;0.001) and using other methods such as strangulation, hanging, electrocution or poisoning were the factors associated with HK (OR=1.8, r=0.60, P=0.004). Given the continued increase in the rate of the IPF cases in Turkey, where HK related information is scarce, newspaper reports can be a good monitoring tool. Data collection and monitoring systems are crucial to find the best effective prevention strategies, particularly for HK. Policies to reduce the HK cases should be including support to women, especially at the younger ages. ","407":"Depression is the most prevalent mood disorder among pregnant women. Only 50% of women seek intervention during gestation. Untreated during pregnancy, depression can induce obstetric and neonatal complications, most commonly, anhedonia, suboptimal weight gain, suicidal behavior, pre-term birth, and\/or spontaneous miscarriage. The babies more often suffer cognitive deficits, low birth weight, and growth delay. The mothers subsequently also experience an increased risk for significant degrees of postpartum depression. Those with relatively milder cases of depression should initially receive psychotherapy. Otherwise, there are many antidepressant medications available for the pharmacotherapy of depression. However, treating pregnant females with depression is a challenge because of potential teratogenic effects caused by many pharmaceuticals. Physicians should know the recommended guidelines for treating depressed women during a time of gestation. It is crucial to identify women suffering from depression during pregnancy, and electing those that warrant pharmacotherapy while picking the best and safest medication is a complex process with paramount significance. Before prescribing an antidepressant drug, explain the advantages and disadvantages of the interventions. Whenever prescribing during these circumstances, more than conventionally close obstetric, emotional, and medication monitoring is to be provided. This would also include an emphasis on diet, exercise, psychotherapy, and avoidance of any non-critical medicinal or other substance exposures.","408":"Denial of Pregnancy is a women's subjective lack of awareness of being pregnant. It can be partial (from 20 weeks but lifted before delivery) or complete (the women notice she's pregnant when labour starts). The prevalence is around 1\/500 for partial denial and 1\/2500 for complete denial. This article's aim is to review the literature broadly on the subject of pregnancy denial, its psychopathological hypothesis and the state of knowledge on the outcome for mothers and children. 26 references have been selected bases on a research on pubmed database and through bibliography on the selected papers. Despite a lot of psychopathological hypothesis and some epidemiological studies, no objective knowledge can lead to know what kind of women will deny their pregnancy and how to prevent it. After all the studies on mother characteristics, it seems there are no \"clear-cut\" explanations on why a woman denies a pregnancy or what type of women could be at risk of denial. There are no official guidelines on how to manage the condition and care for the patient long term. The first elements of research on the developmental outcome for infant seem to show a delay in psychomotor skills and possible speech disorder. They have been significant advancement on the subject of children development after pregnancy denial in the last year but the psychological and developmental impact of pregnancy denial on children and mothers is still majorly unknown. With a clinical picture known for so long, to have so little objective information on how to manage it and on the possible consequences is surprising. More research needs to be conducted to objectively know the long term effects of pregnancy denial on the whole family. International consensus should be found on the definition and care management of pregnancy denial. ","409":"The inspirational aspect of creativity remains shrouded in mystery. Methodological problems have hindered research into creativity, and such a situation makes the interpretation and comparison of studies problematic. The link between creativity and psychopathology is overstated by the print, electronic, and celluloid media. This paper attempts to explain the creative process from a psychological and psychiatric perspective leaving room for different unexplained aspects of generativity for open discussion. A selective survey of the literature was performed to identify scholarly views of creativity and psychopathology. Data sources included PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus. The concept of inspiration was examined from psychological, psychopathological, and biological standpoints. A better understanding of creativity has clinical implications. Psychopathology can facilitate creativity, but it is not the maker of creativity that involves a harmonious blending of divergent and convergent thinking. The present trend in psychiatry of medicalizing all unusual behavior is not at all productive in fostering creativity among children. The cognitively gifted children differ widely from children with autistic spectrum disorders; the creative thinking of gifted children is polythetic, whereas such potentials of autistic individuals are generally monothetic. The study of creativity helps develop an expanded model of the mind. However, research into creativity has produced contradictory results. The assumed link between creativity and mental disorder could be clarified only when we elucidate the creative process. Further research is needed in regard to the psycho-biological nature of creativity, including genetic links, implications for neuropharmacology, and the treatment of pathology or psychological disorders.","410":"","411":"Why do we react emotionally to music?

However, it is very difficult to apply the right criteria which can objectively assess scientific research. For many years, there has been a great interest in scientific ranking and evaluation of scientific journals, but also of sci-entific contribution of scientists. It is generally accepted that the IF (WoS) and the total number of citations of articles published in the journal, are the most relevant parameters of the journal's significance. However, the significance of a scientist and the value of their scientific production are much more complicated to evaluate and they cannot be directly reflected by the importance of the journals in which their articles are published. In this article, the authors describe and evaluate the most known scientific databases which are used in science. The majority of existing science metric systems, which evaluate the achievement of scientists are focused solely on the number of citations of their articles. For example, H-index, which is calculated as the lowest ranked ar-ticle which number of citations matches its ranking number, has considerable shortcoming because it does not take into account the individual contribution of each author and allows expanding author lists with authors whose contribution may be insignificant or none. Therefore, the authors propose Z-score, as a new science met-ric system, which takes into account the author's contribution to the scientific article and greatly remedy major discrepancies in evaluating scientific production of individual authors and institutions.","413":"Bosnia and Herzegovina has generally opted to join the European Union. Preliminary decisions have already been taken, but BiH needs to meet some of the standards\/criteria contained in the 14 recom-mendations made by the European Commission before formal negotiations with the EU begin. One of the important assumptions of a successful path to the EU is that BiH accelerates economic development and modernizes the economic structure as a whole. In this regard, it is especially important that BiH advances technological development, improves its environmental policy and accelerates the energy transition. The text analysed the current development level of these areas and suggested some measures that should improve the current unsatisfactory situation in them. Particular attention was paid to measures to increase innovation capacity, the need for more vigorous inter-ventions in solving environmental problems and the energy transition as a precondition for entry into Industry 4.0, the introduction of the green economy and the acceptance of decarbonisation as long-term policies. It was stressed that these are the ultimate targets by 2050, in agreement with the long-term development orientation of the European Union.","414":"The COVID-19 pandemic (SARS-CoV-2) has caused multiple consequences globally, and all can be re-searched and addressed multidisciplinary, ie from a health (medical), legal, economic and security aspect. In this paper, the author focuses on the legal, ie criminal law aspect of this pandemic. After more than a year of the COVID-19 pandemic in the world, based on the measures taken in almost all countries, it can be concluded that the health and legal aspects are primary and complementary. This claim is supported by the fact that the protection of human health must be regulated by adequate legislation, which is, above all, the Law on the Protection of the Population from Infectious Diseases. However, in such an emergency situation without criminal protection, it is difficult to achieve effective health care for the population.Therefore, this article analyzes the criminal and medical aspects of crimes against human health that are similar or almost identical in all countries in the region, such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia, Serbia, Northern Macedonia and Kosovo.","415":null,"416":"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been drawing attention in the field of medical devices.

However, an old idea based on usage of tumor-specific antibodies as the basis for a new vaccination form in patients with advanced tumors, has attracted recent research and is possible due to development of personalized neoantigenic vaccines. Each tumour has indeed, its own mutation content, only a small percentage are shared between patients. Technological advances and the established genome databases, allowed for a rapid mapping of mutations in the genome. The latter allows for a rational selection of targets for personalized vaccines and on-demand production of customized therapy according to the patient's individual tumour properties. This article accordingly, summarizes basic principles of vaccines for personalized neoantigens, translational research and clinical studies related to these vaccines. Finally, the future of such therapy with personalized vaccines is discussed.","418":null,"419":"While the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread globally, with relistic hope that will be solved with adequate vacination, more and more evidences are collected about the presence of psychi-atric and neurological manifestations and symptoms associated with this diseas.

This paper gives a brief overview of his contribution to medicine and psychology through which his unique scientific and religious approach to the study of the phenomena of human being can be best seen. Medical works of Ibn Sina represent a pinnacle of most important medical achievements of his time. These works contain synthesis of all Greek, Indian and Iranian medical schools, but also new breakthroughs achieved by Muslim scholars through their own experimentation and practice. Although he wrote many medical works, his most important one is El-Kanun fit-tib, which can be translated as The Canon of Medicine. It's made out of five books which systematically show everything known in the area of medicine up until that point in time. In it, Ibn Sina discusses, among other things, the structure of psychological apparatus of human being and the connection of psychological functions with the brain. He considered psychology to be very important for medicine, so in his psychological works he discusses, in great detail, the essence of human soul, consciousness, intellect and other psychological functions. He observed a man in his entirety, taking into consideration all aspects of his existence, paying special attention to spiritual knowledge and spiritual perfection, religiosity, and methods of achieving inner peace and well-being.","421":"The aim of this paper is to draw on John Gregory's (1724-1773) professional ethics in medicine to provide guidance to physicians for the responsible management of the potentially contested boundary between medicine and religion. The paper provides a philosophical and clinical interpretation of Gregory's method of argument by persuasion: setting out complementary considerations that together invite agreement. The cumulative effect of this argument by persuasion is that a contested boundary between medicine and religion is not required by the commitment to the evidence-based, scientific practice of medicine. Gregory's legacy to us is the concept of the profession of medicine as secular, in two senses. As scientific, medicine draws on evidence and not on divinity, transcendent reality, or sacred texts and practices. There is no necessary hostility of evidence-based medicine toward religion and faith communities.","422":"Aim is to show that the definition of the infants born at the limits of viability within the countries is dependent on the social and medical conditions in which the infant is born, and even in one country in which neonatal intensive care is available, it depends on the place of birth and organization of perinatal care. With decreasing gestational age mortality, short- and long-term morbidity of preterm infants are increasing while their survival to discharge is decreasing. It is questionable how to define viability and where the limit of viability can be set. The definition of the limits of viability is not quite clear. There are at least two ways of understanding it: the first, defining the gestational age and\/or birth weight at which human fetus has the capability of survival outside the uterus; and the second, gestational age and\/or birth weight at which more than 50% of infants survive to discharge home from the hospital. While in developing countries infants of less than 28 weeks of gestation without neonatal intensive care have 95% probability of dying, survival of infants between 22 and 25 gestational weeks in developed countries is reaching 90%. Up to now the definition of the limits of viability has not be established, and precise definition of viability scientifically has not been produced yet. Currently, the World Health Organization sets lower limit of viability at 22 weeks of gestation, or 500 g birth weight, or 25 cm of birth length. The universal definition of the limit of viability is probably not possible, because of its variability from one individual to the other, from one setting to the other and from one community to the other.","423":"One of the most controversial topics in modern bioethics, science, and philosophy is the beginning of individual human life. In the seemingly endless debate, strongly stimulated by recent technologic advances in human reproduction, a synthesis between scientific data and hypothesis, philosophical thought, and issues of humanities has become a necessity to deal with ethical, juridical, and social problems. Furthermore, in this field there is a temptation to ask science to choose between opinions and beliefs, which neutralize one another. The question of when human life begins requires the essential aid of different forms of knowledge. Here we become involved in the juncture between science and religion, which needs to be carefully explored. Modern bioethics and science are strongly concerned for the respect of human life at both ends of its existence (birth and death), but other sciences (eg. Philosophy, technology, psychology, sociology, law, and politics) consider the beginning of human life according to different points of view. However, bioethical topics like this one cannot be treated from only one perspective (eg. Biological, philosophical, or religious) because conclusions might be not good enough or reductive. This reality should be regarded in all its richness: An embryo gives a biologist and a geneticist substance for consideration, but because we are talking about the beginning of human life, it requires philosophical-anthropological consideration and confrontation with theology; in its protection we have to include ethics and law. In experiencing and investigating social behavior, other disciplines, such as the history of medicine and sociology, have to be included. It is hard to answer the question when human life should be legally protected. At the time of conception? At the time of implantation? At the time of birth? In all countries (except Ireland and Liechtenstein) juridical considerations are based on Roman law. Roman civil law says that the fetus has right when it is born or if it is born-nasciterus. Few countries agree with definition of beginning of human personality at the time of conception. The majority does not grant legal status to the human embryo in vitro (i.e., during the 14 days after fertilization). Thus, even in the absence of legal rights, there is no denying that the embryo constitutes the beginning of human life, a member of the human family. Therefore, whatever the attitude, every country has to examine which practices are compatible with the respect of that dignity and the security of human genetic material.The question when a human life begins and how to define it, could be answered only through the inner-connecting pathways of history, philosophy, medical science and religion. It has not been easy to determine where to draw the fine line between the competence of science and methaphysics in this delicate philosophical field. To a large extent the drawing of this line depends on one's fundamental philosophical outlook. The point at which human life begins will always be seen differently by different individuals, groups, cultures, and religious faiths. In democracy there are always at least two sides, and the center holds only when the majority realizes that without a minority democracy itself is lost. The minority in turn must realize its best chance lies in persuasion by reason and thoughtfulness rather than fanaticism.","424":"From historical or traditional perspective sciences at one side and arts and religions on the other side are strictly divided epistemology fields with no much mutual engagement and understanding.

Twenty patients recovered from COVID-19 as confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests and twenty-one healthy individuals were recruited. A computerized version of the Iowa Gambling Test (IGT) for measuring risk-taking behavior tendencies as a decision-making process and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and WMS-R Digit Span Forward Test (DSFT) for clinical assessments included. The assessments of the recovered patients were applied on the initial phase that the tests of the patients were negative and on the 4-week follow up phase. The results showed that the anxiety scores were significantly higher in the healthy control group than in the group of recovered patients. The IGT-Net 4 scores were significantly and IGT-Net total scores were marginally significantly lower in the group of recovered patients. In other words, recovered patients showed higher risk-taking behavior tendencies. This tendency difference is consistent with the anxiety levels of the groups. These IGT scores showed to be persistent in the 4-week follow up phase.

An online cross-sectional observational study was done with the participation of patients diagnosed with AS or COPD. AS and COPD patients completed the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to identify a major depressive disorder risk. Two hundred seventy-seven patients diagnosed with AS or COPD aged 18 to 69 (M=60.4, SD=17.6) participated. The risk of major depression was assessed using the PHQ-9 sent online after telephone contact with the participants. 30.7% of the patients during the last month reported a risk of major depression, and it was associated with a history of major depressive disorder (OR=4.39, 95% CI 1.53-12.67) and medical comorbidity (OR=1.69, 95% CI 1.00-2.86). The depression risk is associated with a history of depressive disorder and medical comorbidity in patients with AS and COPD.

Consequently, COVID-19 has become an important factor influencing adolescents' mental health. The purpose of this study is to explore the intervention effect of the integration model on the negative emotions of adolescents during the COVID-19 epidemic. Adolescents were randomly selected from five middle schools in Zhejiang Province of China from May 2020 to July 2020. First, the Self-rating Anxiety Scale, Positive and Negative Affect Scale, and Psychological Well-Being Scale were used for measurement. Then, 72 patients with moderate and severe anxiety symptoms were chosen as the research objects, and the intervention and comparison time was determined to be eight weeks. The subjects were randomly divided into the experiment group (35 members) and the control group (34 members). The integration model was employed on the experiment group. Grade, physical condition, and sleep time are important factors influencing the anxiety level of adolescents during the COVID-19 period, and the anxiety risk of adolescents is higher during their third year of junior high school. After the intervention, the SAS score of the experiment group is lower than that of the control group, and the decrease in the SAS score is higher in the experiment group than in the control group (P&lt;0.01). Moreover, the positive emotion score of the experiment group is higher than that of the control group, and the negative emotion score of the former is lower than that of the latter. The variances in the positive and negative emotion scores are higher in the experiment group than in the control group (P&lt;0.01). The variance in the overall well-being index is also greater in the experiment group than in the control group (P&lt;0.01). The intervention using the integrated model can significantly reduce negative emotions such as anxiety, increase positive emotions, and improve the overall well-being of adolescents during the epidemic period.

All participants (78 UHR, 137 with a First Episode Psychosis (FEP), and 95 non-UHR\/FEP), aged 13-35 years, completed the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States (CAARMS), the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire - Brief version (SPQ-B), the Brief O-LIFE questionnaire (BOL), and the World Health Organization Quality of Life - Brief version (WHOQOL-BREF). We adopted two different indexes of anhedonia: i.e. CAARMS \"Anhedonia\" item 4.3 and BOL \"Introvertive Anhedonia\" subscale scores. In comparison with non-UHR\/FEP, UHR individuals showed higher baseline CAARMS item 4.3 and BOL \"Introvertive Anhedonia\" subscale scores. No difference in anhedonia scores between UHR and FEP patients was found. After 1-year follow-up period, UHR subjects had a significant decrease in severity exclusively on CAARMS item 4.3 subscore. In the UHR group, CAARMS anhedonia showed significant correlations with functioning deterioration, negative symptoms, and comorbid depression (including suicide ideation), while BOL anhedonia with a poorer self-perceived quality of life and specific schizotypal personality traits (i.e. interpersonal deficits and disorganization).

","450":"The review analyzes the possible role of autoimmune processes in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and the evolution of concepts on this issue from its origin to the present. Risks of autoimmune processes causing schizophrenia are associated with several factors: an impaired functioning of dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems in the brain, kynurenine pathway disorder with overproduction of quinolinic, anthranilic, and kynurenic acids (possibly altering both neurons and T-regulators), increased intestinal permeability, as well as food antigens' effects, stress and infections with various pathogens at different stages of ontogenesis. An increase in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines as well as a decrease in the levels of anti-inflammatory ones also may contribute to schizophrenia risks. Schizophrenia often occurs in those patients having various autoimmune diseases and their first-degree relatives. Cases of schizophrenia resulted from autoimmune pathogenesis (including autoimmune encephalitis caused by autoantibodies against various neuronal antigens) are characterized by quite severe cognitive and psychotic symptoms and a less favorable prognosis. This severe course may result from the chronic immune damage of the neuronal receptors such as NMDA, GABA, and others and depend on hyperprolactinemia, induced by antipsychotics, but aggravating autoimmune processes.

A survey was conducted at the beginning of each of the above-mentioned training courses. Participants were asked to consent to participate in the study and, if they did, they were given the 'The Need for Trauma-based Services' quantitative and qualitative questionnaire, or its Arabic translation. 63 Syrian participants of the Istanbul and Gaziantep EMDR training were compared with 37 Nepalese participants who also completed the survey. The results analysis of these surveys showed significantly higher PTSD prevalence in the man-made trauma of the Syrian conflict compared with the prevalence following the natural Earthquake in Nepal. 52% of the Syrian mental health professionals surveyed suggested that PTSD is the major mental health problem in their country, compared to only 6% of the Nepalese mental health professionals. Both the Syrian (33%) and Nepalese (27%) health professionals surveyed felt that they were only able to meet around a third of their clients' needs. They felt that training in EMDR in their mother-tongue would help increase their meeting of these needs. Other suggestions of service provisions and innovations were made in order to meet more of the needs of their trauma survivors. This study highlighted a high need for trauma mental health services of the Syrian refugees as reported by mental health professionals working in the neighbouring countries.

This was a non-intervention perspective study conducted in the Department of Infectious Diseases of University General Hospital of Alexandroupolis (Greece). Patients on the discharge day completed questionnaires in which 5 topics were evaluated: pain\/discomfort, anxiety\/distress, fear\/worries, stigma and tolerance of treatment. The questionnaires were derived from similar Quality of Life Tools. The total score of each patient was normalized as percentage. Females and younger than 40 years old had more worries and fears on discharge day. Significant factors were days of hospitalization, days of fever and need of oxygen therapy. Patients who hospitalized more than 10 days, particularly in isolation negative pressure rooms, with persistent fever more than 7 days and need of oxygen therapy had more anxiety, worries for their clinical condition and fear of stigma. The majority of patients (80%) were expecting to face moderate to severe problems with family members, friends and colleagues underlying the dimensions of stigma. It is crucial to evaluate the psychosocial aspects of this infection and limit the stigma which patients may face returning to their daily routine. Further studies are needed with larger patient series and with the usage of psychometric instruments. ","489":"The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures brought for prevention of infections are associated with considerable psychosocial and psychological morbidity in the general population. Providing continuous mental health services during the pandemics is a challenge worldwide, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This paper reports on the strategies and activities taken to protect public mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in Kosovo. This included establishing online and phone psychological first aid services and developing psychoeducational videos and webinars. The paper concludes with several lessons learned during the process of establishing and maintaining these interventions, such as: initial political endorsement is crucial to gain and maintain the momentum of services; continuous training of volunteers is crucial for both addressing the needs\/problems, which arise during the process of work and maintain the motivation of volunteers; promotion of the services is crucial; academic curricula training mental health professionals should include digital mental health related courses and manualization on how to establish this kind of services in midst of crisis is crucial in order to ensure quick operationalization when needed again especially in LMIC settings. The interventions developed provide opportunity for further research especially by evaluating the impact of the services and exploring how online and provision of mental health and psychoeducation services online could help to cover services gap in times of isolation, limited movement and situations similar to pandemics in settings with limited mental health services and resources. The situation with pandemics with COVID 19 is still far from ending. Future waves of infections and restriction could again spike the mental health and psychosocial and psychological strain of the general population, therefore being prepared in provisions of psychological first aid and other mental health services online is crucial.","490":null,"491":"The world is amidst the COVID-19 pandemic that has used social distancing as a tool for containing the virus from spreading exponentially among other individuals. Previous literature suggests that human contact and attachment is a key for well-being which is why punishments like solitary confinement in detention centers like jail has always been debated as being torturous (Wolfendal 2020). With this notion, anxiety and stress may become more prevalent in individuals who experience self-isolation or are under a forced lockdown. For health-care workers like doctors and psychologists, who advocate for physical health, mental health and wellbeing; the challenges might increase during the pandemic phase as they are expected to go through the crises just like others while simultaneously contributing in rendering services related to dealing with physical and psychological health issues present in patients and clients with their continued practice from either on-site or online platforms. Although all health care professional's training inoculates the ill effects of compassion fatigue by other's overwhelming situations and discussions but they might still be prone to vicarious burnout, trauma and stress. Hence, they may become exposed to being at risk of experiencing anxiety more than the general population. This review discusses facets of the importance of self-care as mental health first aid tool for health care professionals including doctors and psychologists using research and supportive techniques to help them process stress and anxiety during and after the global pandemic.","492":"Mental health of medical workers treating patients with COVID-19 is an issue of increasing concern worldwide. The available data on stress and anxiety symptoms among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 are relatively limited and have not been evaluated in Russia yet. The cross-sectional anonymous survey included 1,090 healthcare workers. Stress and anxiety symptoms were assessed using Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics - 9 (SAVE-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder - 7 (GAD-7) scales. Logistic regression, Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin two component factor model, Cronbach's alpha and ROC-analysis were performed to determine the influence of different variables, internal structure and consistency, sensitivity and specificity of SAVE-9 compared with GAD-7. The median scores on the GAD-7 and SAVE-9 were 5 and 14, respectively. 535 (49.1%) respondents had moderate and 239 (21.9%) had severe anxiety according to SAVE-9. 134 participants (12.3%) had severe anxiety, 144 (13.2%) had moderate according to GAD-7. The component model revealed two-factor structure of SAVE-9: \"anxiety and somatic concern\" and \"social stress\". Female gender (OR - 0.98, p=0.04) and younger age (OR - 0.65, p=0.04) were associated with higher level of anxiety according to regression model. The total score of SAVE-9 with a high degree of confidence predicted the GAD-7 value in comparative ROC analysis. Healthcare workers in Russia reported high rates of stress and anxiety. The Russian version of the SAVE-9 displayed a good ratio of sensitivity to specificity compared with GAD-7 and can be recommended as a screening instrument for detection of stress and anxiety in healthcare workers. ","493":"Many research has indicated that, during the COVID-19 pandemic, health care workers are under greatly increased pressure and at increased risk for the development of mental health problems. Furthermore, previous research has indicated that psychiatrists are exposed to a number of unique stressors that may increase their risk for poor mental health. The aims of the present study were to assess the level of COVID-19 related concerns, psychological distress and life satisfaction among psychiatrists and other physicians during the first period of the pandemic and to examine whether individual differences in COVID-19 concerns, psychological flexibility, psychological resilience and coping behaviors account for differences in mental health indicators. The sample consisted of N=725 physicians, among whom 22.8% were psychiatrists. This study was conducted online during the first lockdown in Croatia and collected data regarding COVID-19 related concerns, coping behaviors and mental health indicators (Psychological Distress and Life Satisfaction). Physicians of other specialties had higher scores on a measure of COVID-19 anxiety than psychiatrists (p=0.012). In addition, a number of differences in coping behaviors are evident. Specifically, psychiatrists were less likely than physicians of other specializations to believe that being informed about COVID-19 is an effective coping strategy (p=0.013), but more prone to using sedatives and drugs as a coping strategy (p=0.002; p=0.037). Psychiatrists are at special risk for substance abuse. Younger age, psychological inflexibility, low resilience and greater COVID-19 concerns might act as specific risk factors for distress. Our findings highlight the need for promoting a healthy lifestyle and psychological flexibility as universal protective factors. ","494":"Adolescents' anxiety and depression during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak cannot be ignored. In public health crisis events, adolescents are prone to negative psychological problems, such as anxiety and depression. Hence, this research focuses on the use of reasonable and efficient methods to intervene in adolescents' psychological problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. From February to April 2020, we conducted an anonymous online survey on a total of 1,200 adolescents in the provinces of Hunan and Guangxi in China. Moreover, we randomly divided a total of 150 middle school students with anxiety scores greater than 50 and volunteered to participate in the intervention experiment into control and intervention groups, with 75 members in each group. On the basis of the proposed routine treatment, we conducted 8 weeks of model 328-based peer education intervention in the intervention group. After the intervention, the self-rating anxiety scale scores (SAS) of the intervention group are better than those of the control group (P&lt;0.001). Moreover, the self-rating depression scale (SDS) scores of both groups are reduced, but the effect is more significant on the intervention group (P&lt;0.001) than on the control group. Finally, the total Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) scores of both groups are reduced, but the effect is more significant on the intervention group than on the control group (P=0.001 and &lt;0.001, respectively). Model 328-based peer education intervention can significantly reduce the level of anxiety and depression in adolescents and improve their sleep quality.

The purpose of the current study is to investigate individuals' health anxiety and emotion regulation during the period of COVID-19 outbreak in Turkey in relation to some variables. The study also aims to explore the relationship between emotion regulation and health anxiety. The study was conducted on 874 individuals reached online through the google e-forms. The participants were administered the \"Health Anxiety Scale and Emotion Regulation Scale\" to collect data. In the analysis of the collected data, Mann- Whitney U Test, Kruskal Wallis-H Test, Spearman Correlation Coefficient were used. In the current study, healthy anxiety scores of the participants were analyzed depending on some variables. Health anxiety was found to be higher in women, 18-30 age group, singles, students, and groups with physical and mental health problems. The research also found that there is a low and negative relationship between health anxiety and cognitive reappraisal. It is understood that men's suppression scores are higher than women. There is no significant difference between suppressing emotions and health anxiety. It was found that educators received the highest scores in terms of cognitive reappraisal. The cognitive reappraisal level of the group without mental disorder was found to be higher than the other group. According to the results of the research, more supportive services should be provided for the groups with the higher health anxiety. Considering that especially students and young people are affected more, it can be said that mental health preventive services should be included more in these groups. At the same time, the fact that men have higher emotion suppression scores than women shows that this situation should also be taken into consideration in mental health services.

A cross sectional online study was conducted with non-clinical educated Pakistani citizens. Self-structured questionnaire comprising close and open ended questions was used for data collection from different cities of Pakistan. N=317 participants (men=121, women=196) were the sample for this study. Demographic information was also sought. The age range of sample was 18 to 50+ years. Most of the participants fall in the category of age group 23-28 of sample. All the participants were educated from Intermediate till PhD but majority of participants had 16 years of education. SPSS 22 was used for quantitative data analysis. Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis and content analysis. Results yield significant age wise and profession wise difference in existence of COVID fear. Nine major themes were extracted regarding nature of fear i.e. Corona Fear, Loss, fear of isolation or quarantine, religion related fear, death, consequences of COVID-19, Under developed country, Psychological component of fear and empathy. Those who denied fear were asked the reasons and six major themes were extracted here i.e Religion, Inevitability of death, Precautions, Belief in self, Myths or misinterpretation of disease and Avoidant approach. Age and profession significantly influenced fear of COVID-19. Gender-wise exploration of themes yields interesting insights. Participants reflected positivity and empathy in crisis situation.

Therefore, it is likely that individuals with chronic diseases may worry during this pandemic to the detriment of their mental health. This study compares the mental health of Bangladeshi adults affected by chronic disease to a healthy, matched control group during the COVID-19 pandemic. A matched case-control analysis was performed with data collected from 395 respondents with chronic diseases and 395 controls matched for age, gender, and residence. Inclusion criteria for cases were respondents who self-reported having asthma, cardiovascular disease symptoms and\/or diabetes. Respondents were recruited using an online survey, which included the DASS-21 measure to assess symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression. Chi-square test, t-test, Fisher's exact test and a conditional logistic regression were performed to examine associations among variables. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms and depression symptoms and the level of stress were significantly higher among cases (59%; 71.6%; 73.7%, respectively) than among controls (25.6%; 31.1%; 43.3%, respectively). Chi-square and t-test showed significant associations and differences between having chronic diseases and mental health outcomes. A conditional logistic regression showed that respondents with asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease symptoms, or any combination of these diseases had higher odds of exhibiting symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression than healthy individuals. These results underscore a subpopulation vulnerable to mental health consequences during this pandemic and indicate the need for additional mental health resources to be available to those with chronic diseases.

The modified Mental Health Scale: R S CL-90 Symptoms Check List was used, which was developed by Derogatis, Lipman, and Linocovi, it included (74) items divided into seven dimensions: physical symptoms, obsessive-compulsive disorder, reactive sensitivity, depression, anxiety, enmity, and fear anxiety, after modifying it for the purposes of the study. The results showed that the level of mental health of the sample as a whole was very high. The results also showed that the level of mental health was low for females when compared to males. The second-year students were less in the level of mental health compared to the rest of the levels. For students who were less than twenty years old, the level of mental health was low compared to those over twenty years old. No differences were found in the level of mental health among students of scientific and human colleges. As for the social situation, the level of mental health among single students was low compared to married people.

We described the functioning mode of two Day Hospitals for Early Intervention and Psychotic Disorders at Psychiatric Hospital \"Sveti Ivan\" during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. We tried to find ways to ensure the necessary continuation of treatment and to provide continuity in times of uncertainty. The vulnerable group of people treated for mental illnesses faced exceptional psychological demands and was in need for care in these moments. Telemedicine, more specifically telepsychiatry, through online therapy and telephone communication made it possible for people treated for psychotic disorders not to feel isolated and rejected. Health care professionals, in a state of distress themselves, should understand, support, be able to reduce anxiety, and provide stability and constancy. The psychotherapeutic approach and the capacity for mentalization allowed us to turn challenges into opportunities.

This current review is one of the few kinds of research, which has sought to check the effect of the coronavirus on mental health issues and the need for psychological well-being in the standard population and patients in response to the global wake of the epidemic and its effects in Pakistan. This study has utilized the data on coronavirus patients from the Ministry of Health, National Institute of Health Pakistan. The age of the confirmed coronavirus patients ranged from 12 to over 80 years, including international and local transmitters. Recorded data delivered by the National Institute of Health, Pakistan has quantified that the outbreak of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) entered Pakistan through international travelers. They carried the virus after they visited different countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, the USA, China, and European countries. By April 30, 2020, there were 16,473 confirmed cases of coronavirus. Total deaths are 361, with a mortality rate of 2.20%, and ultimately recovered cases reported 4,105 with a percentage of 24.90%. As of October 24, 2020, there were 327,063 confirmed cases of the COVID-19 in Pakistan, which posed vast social, economic, health, and environmental problems in the society. The epidemic has affected individuals across the country and confirmed patients in the country increased rapidly. The government officials had initially estimated over 50,000 corona patents by April 30, which would be a great challenge; however, the situation remained under control because of suppression and smart-lockdown strategies by the Government.

The changed environment or new world 2020 after COVID-19 pandemic demand high quality protection in all arena of life. The most important arena that require significant changes have been divided into four categories. First of all, the high mental health issues and low mental health services in Pakistan are not sufficient to control the mental health problem ratio. There is a need to develop more mental health services with trans-formative changes to mitigate the obnoxious post-pandemic effects. Secondly, the implementation of online therapeutic interventions must be available prior or after pandemic situation. Thirdly, as the pharmacy and mental health services in Pakistan are not capable to meet the international standards to provide patient care. Therefore, the advanced researchers are needed to investigate the fractures and gaps in social, economic and health care systems. Fourthly the provision of mental health support for children is a key area that needs considerable attention after pandemic or crises.

Different studies have shown that students are particularly vulnerable to PIU. Given the paucity of information on PIU in our country, the aim of this paper was at investigating the characteristics of PIU amongst Italian University students. A self-assessment questionnaire, referred by the acronym QUNT (\"Questionario sull'Utilizzo delle Nuove Tecnologie\"), composed by 101 items grouped together to identify a series of factors, was developed and sent through e-mail invitation to several students from three Italian Universities. The returned questionnaires were 3324, out of a total of 51,304 sent, with no difference between the two sexes. On the contrary, the distribution of the QUNT factors was different in the two sexes, in people living alone and in overweight subjects. Men resulted to be more involved in online recreational activities, whereas women seemed more attracted to instant messaging and generally to social networks. PIU was significantly more present in men than women. The comparisons of QUNT factor scores in the four BMI categories showed that the greater the BMI the greater the score of some factors. The findings of the present study indicate that the use of Internet through new technologies may exceed its real utility amongst Italian university student, with some sex-related differences. Men seem more prone to use Internet for passing time and women for social relationships. Men are also at risk of developing PIU.

Moreover, the role of negative parenting in the lack of forgiveness within narcissistic pathology has not been explored thus far. The aim of the current research was to investigate the complex relations among pathological narcissism, negative parenting, and interpersonal forgiveness in psychiatric outpatients. A sample of 250 adult psychiatric outpatients (61% female; mean age 39.15 years) were enrolled in this study. The participants filled out the Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI), the Tendency to Forgive Scale (TTF), the Measure of Parental Styles (MOPS), and the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales (DASS21). Narcissistic grandiosity and narcissistic vulnerability were positively correlated with mothers' and fathers' negative parenting, but this association was significantly stronger in the case of narcissistic vulnerability. Only narcissistic vulnerability was related to interpersonal forgiveness. In the mediation analysis, negative parenting was not directly related to interpersonal forgiveness, however, this association became significant after introducing narcissistic vulnerability. Narcissistic vulnerability served as a full mediator of the mothers' and fathers' negative parenting - interpersonal forgiveness relationships. Narcissistic vulnerability seems to be more strongly related to negative parenting and interpersonal forgiveness than narcissistic grandiosity, while it also represents one of the underlying mechanisms of the negative parenting - interpersonal forgiveness relationship. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed in relation to pathological narcissism and lack of forgiveness.

We enrolled 106 adult SP and 63 healthy controls. Demographic and clinical data were collected and statistically analysed for all included subjects. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was acquired on a 1.5 T scanner. SP were grouped according to the number of PE into a group with up to 3 PE (SCHG-1) and with 4 or more PE (SCHG-2). SCHG-1 was further subdivided into two groups regarding to disease duration (DD). Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analyses were performed between SP groups as well as between SP groups and the healthy controls group (HCG). No relevant GMV differences were detected between SP groups. Comparison between HCG and SCHG-1 showed only 3 regions with reduced GMV, while multiple regions with reduced GMV were detected when comparing HCG and SCHG-2.

In the BD group, serum valproate level was a significant positive predictor of thickness in the right macular inferior outer, left macular nasal outer region, right RNFL inferotemporal, left temporal and inferotemporal regions. Since the retina consists of neurons, morphological or functional examination of retina may be beneficial for the evaluation of the effects of psychopharmalogical treatments in schizophrenia and BD. The outcome of this study implies that valproate has neuroprotective effects on the optic nerve and macula, and this finding is consistent with the literature implying neurotrophic effects of valproate. ","526":"The comorbidity of bipolar disorder (BD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is widely known. The overall rate of association between BD and OCD is very high and varies, depending on the authors, from 11% to 18%, with peaks of 21% in primarily bipolar patients. Vice versa, about 60% of patients with OCD have a second psychiatric diagnosis, which in 23% of cases turns out to be BD. The differences between the BD patients with and without OCD were so numerous and important (e.g., different onset of mood episodes, history of suicide attempts, seasonality, rapid cycling and impulsivity) that the comorbidity between BD and OCD may represent a distinct form of BD, similar to cyclothymic BD for psychopathological features. However, the comorbidity does not seem to have any impact on cognitive performance, such as there is no specific difference between patients who first develop BD and then OCD or vice versa. Anyway, the detection of the neurocognitive profile of these patients at the time of the first clinical evaluation could have clinical implications also in the therapeutic and rehabilitative management of this type of patient. Indeed, it would be desirable to develop a new model of rehabilitation that is less differentiated for both BD and OCD or for their comorbidity, also to make cognitive rehabilitation faster and less expensive. The purpose of this mini-review is to update the knowledge currently available on the impact of BD and OCD comorbidity on neurocognitive profile.","527":"The prevalence of the three main eating disorders (EDs) anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder (BED) is increasing, and a growing number of patients with EDs is seeking professional help. Thus, there is a need for additional treatment strategies in EDs. The aim of this review was to summarize the literature on the benefits and risks of music as well as the evidence for its therapeutic application in people with EDs. Following the PRISMA guidelines, we performed a systematic literature review on scientific studies on the effect of music in people with or at risk for EDs using PubMed and the Web of Science database. The search terms used were: \"music\", \"music therapy\", \"eating disorders\", \"anorexia nervosa\", \"bulimia nervosa\" and \"binge eating disorder\". 16 out of 119 identified and screened articles qualified as scientific studies involving a total of 3,792 participants. They reported on the use of music or music therapy in individuals with or at risk of AN and BN, but not BED. In inpatients with AN, listening to classical music was beneficial to food consumption. Singing in a group reduced post-prandial anxiety in AN inpatients and outpatients. Vodcasts which also included positive visual or autobiographical stimuli helped BN patients with anxiety and body image perception. Songwriting and sessions with a Body Monochord helped with the processing of therapeutically relevant topics in AN. Watching music videos, however, reinforced body dissatisfaction, drive for thinness, bodyweight concerns, preoccupation with physical appearance in pre-teenage and teenage girls, and drive for muscularity in adolescent boys. These findings suggest that the therapeutic application of music may be beneficial in patients with AN and BN. However, the availability of studies with a rigorous randomized controlled trial (RCT) design is scarce. ","528":"Major depressive disorder is the greatest burden of developed countries in the context of morbidity caused by mental disorders. Until recent, ketamine has been mostly used for anesthesia, analgesia, sedation and treatment of chronic pain syndromes. However, unique pharmacodynamic properties of ketamine have increased interests in it's use for treatment of depression. It is assumed that ketamine reverses synaptic chronic stress pathology within one day of administration by postsynaptic glutamate activation, providing synaptic connectivity restoration that last for days or weeks. Potential glutamatergic agents, in context of treatment of major depressive disorder are not entirely novel phenomenon. Considering the aforementioned, current neurobiological view of depression as a solely monoaminergic phenomenon should be reassessed in order to prompt discovery of putative antidepressant drugs of novel generation. Acute side effects, such as increased salivation, increase in heart rate, systemic arterial pressure and intracranial pressure necessitate careful monitoring during intravenous administration of ketamine, even in subanesthetic doses. However, major burden of ketamine administration lies in it's ability to produce psychotomimetic side effects and emergence delirium. Esketamine nasal spray has now been widely approved and is considered safe in terms of acute side effects, tolerability and consistent therapeutic benefit.","529":"From January 2022, the WHO member countries shall start implementing the mortality and morbidity statistics (MMS) version of the eleventh revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). Regarding mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorders, there are substantial changes from ICD-10 to ICD-11. The subchapter for schizophrenia or other primary psychotic disorders has changed due to a revised structure, new diagnostic criteria, and the introduction of dimensional elements (i.e., course and symptom qualifiers). The aim of this manuscript is twofold. First, we review changes from ICD-10 to ICD-11 in the classification and diagnosis of schizophrenia or other primary psychotic disorders, including findings from recent field studies. Second, we provide an overview of approaches to the implementation of ICD-11 in clinical practice. Critical elements for transition from ICD-10 to ICD-11 include the use of digital tools, education and training, stakeholder involvement, national adaptations, and continuous evaluation.","530":"","531":"","532":null,"533":"In a view of sex work being a sexual behavioural activity, the main objective of our research was to explore the sexuality of sex workers in Serbia regarding to intensity of their sexual arousability. The research was conducted on 30 sex workers and 30 controls of randomly selected social and demographic characteristics, without any signs of psychiatric morbidity. For the evaluation of the intensity of sexual arousability, SAI (Sexual Arousability Index) questionnaire was used. The analysis of the main total scores of the SAI for the sex workers and control participants showed no statistically significant difference in the overall intensity of arousability (p&gt;0.05). However, item by item analysis of the questionnaire showed qualitative difference in sexuality between sex workers and controls, related to certain aspects of sexuality. These findings allow the space for further research in the way of identifying origins of qualitative issues in the sexual profile of sex workers, in correlation to women who are not sex workers, i.e. whether they had been result of potential biological, specific psychodynamic factors, or have been formed as a result of the direct influence of the sex work.

The aim is to determine the topography of toothlessness within the population of Mostar, according to Kennedy classification. The aim is to connect measures of socioeconomic status with the appearance of the toothlessness. To develop a model that includes a form of toothlessness and the socioeconomic status of the patients in Mostar. The study was conducted at the Health Center in Mostar and the Regional Medical Center in Mostar. The research was cross-sectional study. It included 800 patients who regularlyoccurred to the dental ambulance because of the toothlessness and because of the prosthodontics treatment. The measurement was conducted by the dentist based on the anonymous research cardboard at the first examination of the patient. The dentist will determine the topography of the toothlessness according to Kennedy classification and the etiology of the toothlessness. In the total sample of respondents, the toothlessness was significantly higher represented (P&lt;0.001). The manifestation of thetoothlessness was significantly higher among temporary employees and the retirees (P&lt;0.001). In the total sample, toothlessness affected the sociological status of a higher percentage of the respondents (P&lt;0.001). In our study, in a total sample of respondents, toothlessness was significantly higher represented (90% of respondents).

The aim of this study was to asses LUTS in this group of patients. This cross-sectional study was carried out in a tertiary healthcare centre. 111 participants were included (81 women and 30 men, age 23-78 years), with BMI&gt;30 kg\/m2. LUTS were evaluated using International consultation on incontinence questionnaires (ICIQ) investigating symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB) and urinary incontinence (UI): ICIQ-OAB and ICIQ-UI Short Form (SF). We evaluated also some of the questions on the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. On ICIQ-OAB patients most often reported:UI (46.85% (N=52)), nocturia (42.34% (N=47)) and increased frequency of urination (34.23% (N=38)), and on ICIQ-UI SF: UI when coughing and sneezing (44.44% (N=32)), urgency UI (43.06% (N=31)) and UI during exercise\/physical activity (22.22% (N=16)). Women were found to be more significantly affected by OAB symptoms (p&lt;0.05). Significant correlations were found between the overall results on ICIQ-OAB and hypertension (r=0.32). The results of this study confirm that obese patients in Croatia experience LUTS as well. A higher incidence of LUTS was found among women and gender-independent among hypertensive obese patients. ","537":"Psoriasis is a chronic and stigmatising disease with significant and hard to meet clinical needs in patient management. Psoriasis is a relatively common disease, affecting up to 2% of the population. The impact of psoriasis on quality of life is significant given its chronicity and visibility. Psychological stress is a well-established systemic triggering factor in psoriasis. It has been associated with initial presentation of the disease as well as exacerbations of pre-existing psoriasis. The purpose of this study is to assess the psychological, social and financial implications of psoriasis. 51 patients participated in this study. After dermatological examination and determination of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score, patients were referred to a psychological consult. Assessment was done through questionnaires concerning quality of life, depression, anxiety, illness perception, financial domain and personal data. Results of our study indicate that psoriasis has a strong impact on patients' life. It influences working habits, poses a significant financial burden, but most of all, significantly impairs their quality of life and psychological status. Psoriasis poses a substantial threat to several dimensions in patient's quality of life. Patients feel that the current treatment, although often effective, does not provide a satisfactory long-term solution. Thus, long-term psychologic support for patients with psoriasis is desirable. ","538":"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic and disabling disease with a great impact on the quality of life (QOL). The aim of this study was to assess QOL and health in RA patients treated with biological disease-modifying drugs (bDMARDs) as opposed to those treated with conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs). We analysed four domains of QOL: physical health (D1), mental health (D2), social relationships (D3) and one's surroundings (D4); as well as general quality of life (W1), general state of health (W2), and disease activity and physical disability. Seventy-seven RA patients (group A=29 on bDMARDs, group B=48 on csDMARDs) were enrolled in the study. QOL was evaluated using WHO questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF), disease activity using Disease Activity Score 28C-reactive protein (DAS28CRP) and functional status using Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). There was no statistically significant difference of mean values in the four domains of QOL, nor in the general QOL, between groups A and B. There was also no statistically significant difference regarding RA activity (3.51 vrs 3.54, p=0.56). However, we have found that the variable of the general state of health domain was statistically significantly higher in group B (2.66 vrs 2.89, p=0.001), while HAQ was statistically significantly higher in group A (1.19 vrs 1.07, p=0.018), as well as the duration of RA (6.25vrs 3.75 years, p=0.0006). Statistically significant correlation was found between HAQ and W2, disease duration and D3 in group A and DAS28CRP and D1, D2, W2 and HAQ and D1 and D2 in group B. These findings suggest that the inclusion of bDMARDs in the treatment regimen was overdue, with RA already advancing with developed functional disability, which prevented the achievement of the primary goals of treatment: low disease activity or remission and the improvement of patient's QOL. ","539":"Chronic hepatitis C was until recently treated with a combined therapy of interferon and ribavirin. More recently, direct antiviral agents (DAA), are being introduced. They are more tolerable and have fewer side effects, with better treatment results. In the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina we have started using this new therapy, with a limited financial opportunity. Large numbers of patients with chronic hepatitis C are former or current addicts, some of them treat their addiction with methadone or buprenorphine. These patients often formerly have a depression disorder and during treatment of chronic hepatitis need supervision of a psychiatrist, due to one of the side effects of interferon being deterioration of depression. Using this research we wanted to valorize the depression disorder of our patients, to indicate the effects of interferon on depression deterioration and the need for a new therapy protocol. Examinees were patients with chronic hepatitis C on interferon therapy, which we divided into three groups: those who were never addicts, then the group of patients who were earlier addicts and have a long abstinence and patients who treat their addiction with a replacement therapy of methadone or buprenorphine. All patients completed Beck's test, which determines the level of depression, before and after interferon therapy. Patients who used to be addicts or were on replacement therapy had mild or moderate depression before interferon treatment in a large number. After interferon therapy, there was a statistically substantial increase of patients with serious depression, which was not noted before the therapy. Interferon therapy deteriorates depression in patients with chronic hepatitis C and there should be a strive for new therapies with less side effects in treatment. No patients stopped therapy. That is a result of community work and supervision over patients from both hepatologists and psychiatrists. ","540":"Pediatric survivors of childhood cancer are at increased risk of poor quality of life and social-emotional outcomes following treatment. Aim of the research was to examine the possible predictors of quality of life, that is, to examine the impact and relative contribution of post-traumatic stress symptoms, post-traumatic growth, the effects of treatment and social functioning on quality of life. Participants were 83 pediatric cancer survivors at age 16 to 29 who were off-therapy for more than one year. They filled out the Impact of Event Scale-Revised Questionnaire (IES-R), Quality of life scale (QOLS) and Social Adjustment Scale (SAS-SR). Demographic data including child health status information were also collected. Findings indicate a significant association between quality of life and social adjustment, posttraumatic growth, health consequences and posttraumatic stress disorder. Regression analysis showed that posttraumatic growth, social functioning and treatment consequences are significant predictors of quality of life in pediatric cancer survivors. The findings highlight the importance of key factors associated with quality of life in pediatric cancer survivors. Interventions aimed at strengthening social support and highlighting positive changes following trauma of cancer treatment could improve quality of life of pediatric cancer survivors.

Personality has impact on the perception of someone's life situation and interacts with psychosocial variables and coping strategies. The vulnerability to stigma is still under-researched. The aim of this study was to investigate this vulnerability by examining the associations between stigma and personality dimensions (i.e., temperament and character traits). Seventy six (76) inpatients of the two teaching hospitals with the diagnosis of non-small-cell lung cancer were consecutively included in the study. Patients were assessed with self-reporting scales: Cataldo Lung Cancer Stigma Scale (CLCSS) and Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI). Sociodemographic and clinical data were also collected. Personality dimensions Self-directedness and Persistence showed to be significant predictors of stigma in the linear regression (R=0.519; F=3.104; P=0.007). Stigma and personality dimensions were not associated with age, gender, tumor stage and smoking status. Stigma is associated with particular character (i.e., Self-directedness) and temperament (i.e., Persistence) dimensions. Given the negative clinical outcomes of stigma in lung cancer patients, personality should be taken into account during screening and treatment planning phases.

Mental health is impacted by MS and different psychiatric conditions significantly impact QoL. We have conducted prospective non-interventional study among MS patients. Aim was to measure and compare MS patients QoL by generic and disease-specific instrument at baseline and after one year and to identify potential correlation between these two types of measurements and to assess mental health scores among MS patients in Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&amp;H) and other countries. Study included 62 patients diagnosed with MS and treated at Neurology clinic in Sarajevo from April 2016 to May 2017. Study was approved by Ethical Committee. QoL has been measured by EQ-5D and MSQoL-54. Measurement has been performed at baseline and after 12 months. Average utility score measured by EQ-5D at the baseline and end of the study were 0.688 and 0.639 respectively with no significant difference (p=0.850). EQ-5D utility and MSQoL-54 score showed high correlation at baseline; rho=0.873 p=0.0001 for physical health and rho=0.711 p=0.0001 for mental health.

Similar MS impact and loss of QoL found in B&amp;H and other countries. Both instruments can be used in measuring QoL but disease-specific are preferred since they capture broader symptoms impacting MS patient QoL. Using QoL instruments could drive clinician decision and patient-centric care as well as reimbursement and policy decision by recording treatment outcomes.

This study investigates the role and frequently negligible importance of ambulatory cardiac rehabilitation (ACR) in improvement of quality of life (QoL), anxiety and depression at patients with various cardiac pathology. This prospective study included subjects treated for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), those with performed elective revascularization, and OTHERS (after valve replacement, implanted pacemaker or other device, with stable heart failure and coronary artery disease). Their anxiety (State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire), depression (Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) questionnaire) and QoL data (Short Form Health Survey-36 (SF-36) questionnaire, for physical and mental QoL components) were collected initially and after 3-month of ACR. ACR underwent 170 patients, aged 59 (53-66 years), predominately males (74.7%). At both genders, median duration of ACR was 12 weeks, with reduction of anxiety and depression scores and improvement in almost all components of QoL (P&lt;0.05), except in mental health and bodily pain in males and females, respectively. After ACS (63.5%), ACR lasted 12 weeks, with reduction of anxiety and depression scores and improvement in all components of QoL (P&lt;0.05). After elective revascularization (14.1%), ACR lasted 12 weeks, with reduction of anxiety score and improvement in almost all components of QoL (P&lt;0.05), except mental health.

The aim was to assess and compare attitudes toward the elderly among undergraduate nursing students in Croatia and Slovenia and identify factors associated with positive\/negative attitudes. This was a cross-sectional survey conducted between September, 2017 and July, 2018 among undergraduate nursing students at five higher education institutions: three in Slovenia and two in Croatia. The following data were gathered: age, sex, year of study, previous education, employment status, previous education in gerontolgy, desired professional role after graduating, previous experience with the elderly. Kogan`s Attitude Towards Old People Scale (KATOPS) score was the primary outcome measure. Pairwise comparisons were conducted between Croatian and Slovenian students. KATOPS score was dichotomized with values above the 3rd quartile considered excellent - the dichotomized score was used as the dependent variable in a binary logistic regression model. Overall, 825 students completed the questionnaire, 85.5% were women, 417 from Slovenia, 408 from Croatia, and 80% were under 22 years of age (80%). The average score on the KATOPS was 127.4, 95% CI 126.6-128.2. Variables associated with excellent scores on the KATOPS, based on the binary regression were: studying in Slovenia (OR=2.05, 95% CI 1.39-3.03), age group 28-32 years (OR=3.9, 95% CI 1.53-9.98); previous education gerontic nursing (OR=2.45, 95% CI 1.34-4.47), and full-time study (OR=2.12, 95% CI 1.38-3.55). Variables not associated with excellent scores were: being married (OR=0.44, 95% CI 0.22-0.92) and having previous experience in working with the elderly (OR=0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.86). Attitudes toward old age are mildly positive in Slovenian and Croatian nursing students. Slovenian students have significantly more positive attitudes toward old age and these differences are most probably due to marked differences in undergraduate nursing curricula between the two countries.

High dependency departments such as critical care units are very stressful environments, and this can lead to a greater incidence of burnout, especially of emotional exhaustion and poor personal accomplishment. Nurses are the largest group of healthcare workers, and so it is reasonable to expect they would have a high prevalence of burnout. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of burnout in critical care nurses in Croatia and explore its association with demographic features. A cross-sectional study of 620 nurses was conducted in several university hospitals, using convenience sampling. The Maslach Burnout Inventory was administered, together with questions about the socio-demographic and work characteristics of the participants (age, gender, length of work in ICU, education, type of ICU). The majority of the sample were female nursing staff (87.7%), aged 26-35 (38.9%). The results showed that approximately every fifth nurse (22.1%) expressed a high emotional exhaustion (EE), with lesser burden of a high depersonalisation (D) in 7.9%, yet every third nurse (34.5%) scored low on PA. Male nurses reported more depersonalisation (p=0.045), yet neither EE nor the PA dimensions differed by gender.

Besides blocking admission to mental health services, it was found associated with terminating appropriate treatment. As well as relatives, neighbours or friends, it is shown that patients face stigma from psychiatrists. The aim of this study is to evaluate stigmatizing attitudes of psychiatrists and to find out its relationship with burnout and psychological flexibility. 256 psychiatrists all along Turkey were participated and age, gender, duration that spent as a clinician and psychotherapy training have been recorded. Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II, Maslach Burnout Inventory and Mental Illness: Clinicians' Attitudes (MICA) Scale were used to evaluate participants' psychological flexibility, burnout level and stigmatizing attitudes respectively. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was used to assess direct and indirect influences on stigma. There were statistically significant differences between residents and senior psychiatrists in all three scales. Psychotherapy training was found significantly associated with lower levels of stigma. Stigma was found to be predicted by duration, age, and burnout levels. In SEM analyses psychological flexibility was found to predict stigma indirectly via burnout. Increasing contact with the stigmatized and education are two widely used methods against stigma. In years their effects were found limited and temporary. Burnout in clinicians is an important parameter in many aspects as well as its relation with stigma. There are limited data to decrease burnout in psychiatrists. There are some evidence that shows Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is effective to decrease burnout and stigma in clinicians. In the means of additional ways when dealing with stigma, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy can be a powerful tool while it targets to increase psychological flexibility.

Aim of research was to investigate possible differences in satisfaction with life and work between 3 groups: emigrants psychiatrists (EP), emigrants physicians of other specialties (E), and psychiatrists currently working in Croatia (C). Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI), Work Ability Index (WAI) and some qualitative research questions were used in an anonymous online survey which was conducted in autumn 2019. Link to the survey was shared on different social networks, while 138 physicians were approached directly by e-mail. Response rate: 87% for EP group (representative sample for group of psychiatrist emigrants from Croatia), 48% for E group, and 28% for C group. In total, 62 physicians, 44 of them emigrants (20 EP and 24 E). This study was voluntarily led. Psychiatrists from our sample emigrated mostly to Scandinavia in 65% of cases and to West Europe in 30% of the cases. Other physicians emigrants from our sample emigrated to Middle Europe in 29%, to West Europe in 25%, and to Scandinavia in 42% of the cases. Satisfaction with standard of life, future security and life achievements are significantly higher in EP than in C. Satisfaction with integration in community and satisfaction with close relationships are significantly higher in E than in EP. WAI score of the 3 groups placed them all in the same category \"good work ability\". For all emigrants and their family members, major challenges after emigration were found to be communication (language), integration into the community, and loss of friends and family connections. 70% of emigrants plan to return to Croatia in the future, depending on better living conditions (income), change in the political situation in Croatia (reduction of corruption), and change in people's mentality. This voluntary study showed high satisfaction with life and good work ability among psychiatrists who emigrated from Croatia, together with some challenges for them and their family members with language, work, integration into the community, and loss of friends and family connections.

","552":"The results of the previous research imply that persons with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are at an increased suicide risk. Suicidality is more probable when PTSD occurs in comorbidity with other psychological disorders. The studying of potential differences and the fundamental social and physiological characteristics of suicidal and non-suicidal persons with PTSD has so far failed to produce consistent results. The objective of this article is to examine whether suicidal and non-suicidal persons with PTSD differ by demographic characteristics, the presence and the type of comorbidity with other psychological disorders and the type of traumatic experience. The study included 147 participants from Bosnia and Herzegovina, 91 men and 56 women, who have been diagnosed with PTSD under the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Based on the suicidality status (suicidal\/non-suicidal), the sample was divided into two sub-samples. For the purpose of data collection, a clinical interview and a socio-demographic questionnaire was applied during psychological clinical assessment at a psychiatric ward. It has been established that suicidal and non-suicidal persons with PTSD differ by demographic characteristics, such as the educational and employment status, the presence of a history of suicide in the family, the presence and type of comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders, and the type of traumatic experience. In terms of age, gender, marital status and psychiatric heredity, no significant differences have been found relative to the suicidality status. Suicidal persons with PTSD more frequently have low education, they are unemployed and have a history of suicide in the family, and they are diagnosed with comorbid psychiatric disorders, dominated by mood disorders and personality disorders, with multiple comorbid disorders combined, and with war, civilian and mixed trauma being equally present in these persons. Based on the established demographic and clinical characteristics of suicidal patients with PTSD, it is possible to improve the psychological and psychiatric assessment of suicidality in persons with PTSD, which enables adequate and timely identification of the suicide risk in this population.

Clinical manifestations may not be indicative at first, and difficult to differentiate from different situations during operation and anesthesia. Colloids represent a group of fluids often used during perioperative period that, among other adverse reactions, have an allergic potential. Albumin is a natural colloid that has the lowest incidence of these reactions. However, it is found as an additional substance in other blood products, and, therefore, has to be taken into consideration if anaphylaxis occurs. Dextrans cause the most severe reactions due to dextran reactive antibodies. Pretreatment with Dextran 1 may inhibit the reaction. Gelatins have the highest incidence of anaphylaxis among colloids. Patients with history of allergy to some food, vaccines, cosmetics containing gelatin are at greater perioperative risk for anaphylaxis. Not to forget, gelatins are also a part of topical haemostatic agents used in surgery. Testing for colloid allergies is limited due to their pathophysiologic mechanism, so the clinical assessment is usually essential. Treatment of anaphylaxis caused by colloids is the same as for any other cause.

Likewise, many reports show that the onset of tinnitus occurs at the time of high stress or after a period of stress. It is also common for existing tinnitus to become worse during exposure to stress. However, in clinical practice the association between tinnitus and stress is often neglected. Extensive search of the Web of Science database has shown a low ratio of scientific articles about coexistence of stress and tinnitus compared to other stress-related conditions. Specifically, there are about sixteen times more articles investigating comorbid stress in chronic pain, about six times more in chronic fatigue, and about four times more in fibromyalgia. Previous studies of biological markers of stress in tinnitus patients showed normal diurnal levels of stress hormone cortisol. However, experimental studies of tinnitus subjects showed a blunted reactive cortisol response after a psychosocial stress test, exposure to noise in the laboratory and a dexamethasone suppression test. In addition, tinnitus subjects showed increased sympathetic tone, and weakened sympathetic response after exposure to mental arithmetic task. In tinnitus subjects oxidative metabolism shows imbalance with shift from antioxidant enzyme preponderance towards oxidative stress predominance. Relaxation therapeutic programs reduce stress-sensitive immunological parameter tumor necrosis factor alpha. Although existing data indisputably proves existence of comprehensive connections between tinnitus and psychological stress, there is still no empirical evidence to show whether stress as a etiological, or just contributing factor. Further research should give the ultimate answer on this subject.","557":"The diagnosis and treatment of cancer represents an experience that is potentially psychologically traumatizing for patients. However, cancer can contribute to the experience of positive psychological changes, namely posttraumatic growth. We conducted a review of empirical studies (n=44) on posttraumatic growth in cancer patients. We focused on the relations of posttraumatic growth to socio-demographic, medical, and psychological adjustment correlates. Results from forty-four reviewed articles indicated that age, gender, and ethnicity were consistently associated with posttraumatic growth in cancer. Regarding illness-related factors, the majority of relationships were positive and were found between subjective severity of cancer, chemotherapy, and experienced growth. The review revealed inconsistent relationships between indicators of psychological adjustment (emotional distress, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and quality of life) and perceived positive changes in the case of the cancer patients. Longitudinal studies might resolve this inconsistency by showing that posttraumatic growth has benefits for later psychological adjustment, as other studies have already documented.","558":"The use of violence and aggression on civilians during the war has become one of the most prominent military events of the 20th and 21st centuries, resulting in an increasing number of refugees and displaced persons in the midst of regional and tribal conflicts. We are witnessing a daily increase in the number of migrants when people are fleeing from their homes because of human rights violations, persecution, poverty, and conflict. When found in \"host\" countries, they often encounter bad conditions, with uncertainty and instability. Many come to Europe in search of economic and personal opportunities for progress, where they face different types of process of acculturation. 'Place loss', acute and chronic trauma, family disorders, and family reunification issues became more and more important issues. Refugees, asylum seekers and irregular migrants have a higher risk for certain mental health disorders, including posttraumatic stress, depression and psychosis. In addition to being exposed to various risk factors for mental disorders, migrants often face barriers to access to adequate health care to address these issues. Some of the biggest challenges for migrant populations within \"host\" countries include: lack of knowledge of health care rights and health systems; poor knowledge of the language; different belief systems and cultural expectations of health care; and the general lack of trust in experts and in government. The rates of depressive and anxiety disorders usually increase over time, and poor mental health is associated with poor socioeconomic conditions - particularly with social isolation and unemployment. Acculturative stress often implies a high discrepancy in the acculturation between parents and their children. This dislocation of families in new conditions has been caused by the different degrees of acceptance of \"new culture\" by children and parents, which causes serious difficulties, especially in bilingual terms.","559":"Addiction is not solely \"substance dependence\". Diminished control is a core defining concept of psychoactive substance addiction. Several behaviors, besides psychoactive substance ingestion, produce short-term reward that may engender diminished control over the behavior. Growing evidence suggests that behavioral addictions resemble substance addictions in many domains, including phenomenology, tolerance, comorbidity, overlapping genetic contribution, neurobiological mechanisms, and response to treatment. This similarity has given rise to the concept of non-substance or behavioral addictions, i.e., syndromes analogous to substance addiction, but with a behavioral focus. The type of excessive behaviors identified as being addictive include gambling, use of computers, playing video games, use of the internet, exercise, and shopping. Behavioral addictions have been proposed as a new class in DSM-5, but the only category included is gambling disorder. Internet gaming disorder is included in the appendix as a condition for further study. The ICD-11 included also the definition of a new disorder, gaming disorder. To present actual knowledge about behavioral addictions in childhood and adolescence. Analysis of data in available literature in data basis and textbooks. Some behavioral addictions are becoming more common in children and adolescents. Dominant are gaming and gambling addiction that are also best researched. Behavioral addiction becomes an epidemic in children and adolescents. ","560":null,"561":"The problem of peer violence is increasingly discussed. It is noticeable that it is not sufficiently researched and there is no sufficient information about its prevalence, forms, prevention methods, repression and coping with the problem and its consequences. It seems that it gets discussed more intensively only in case of a traumatic incident whose consequences cannot be denied and if they make a large impact on the entire society. To show the prevalence and manifestation of peer violence as well as problems in the prevention and addressing consequences of peer violence. Data are collected from several studies on peer violence conducted in Bosnia and Herzegovina and worldwide. Collected data indicate that the peer violence ranges from 15% to 50% depending on the development of the country where research is conducted. It is necessary to identify peer violence on time and respond in a timely manner. Any claim of a child needs to be taken seriously, because timely response prevents the child who experienced some form of violence to revenge or become violent. It is important to start raising awareness among children from their early age and train them on techniques of non-violent communication, forms of violence, the ways of expressing violence and its effects on victims and observers of violence and why it is important to talk about it. They need to know where to report violence and what the duties of relevant institutions are. In addition to children, it is important to raise awareness among parents, teachers, politicians as well as mental health professionals. The entire society needs to be involved in the prevention of peer violence. ","562":"Although family should be the basis for the development and formation of a child's personality, violence is mostly done in the family, and remains undiscovered for a long time. The real number of abused children is much more than that displayed in the registered cases. The secrecy of the problem is an important feature of this phenomenon. Families in which abuse takes place are mostly isolated. Social isolation does not come about by chance; secrecy is usually encouraged by an abuser to control over famoly members. In most cases, social reaction to violence is late, inadequate and focused on the consequences, but not on the causes. \"Abuse implies an act of execution that directly inflicts damage, while neglect implies an act of non-fulfillment of something that is necessary for the well-being of a child\". The most common forms of domestic violence are physical, emotional abuse in the presence of violence against the mother, and in a lesser extent sexual abuse. In addition, there is physical, emotional, educational and medical neglect. The presence of violence against the mother and the feeling of impotence leave the same consequences as the endured violence. It is considered that children living in violent families are likely to live under cumulative stress. Traumatic responses include a wide range of conditions from acute stress reactions through post-traumatic stress disorder to complex long-lasting, repeated trauma syndrome. All children will not react to this kind of experience in the same way, with the protective and risk factors in developmental psychopathology having a significant role to play. Because of their developmental vulnerability and dependency, children are at greater risk of violence than adults. Researches point to the need for a multidisciplinary approach to treatment and prevention of child abuse, with greater interaction between health institutions, relevant centers for social work, police, court, government and non-governmental sector, and the existence of adequate family and criminal laws.","563":"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a spectrum disorder whose symptoms show psychological, neurobiological dysregulation and poorer functionality of a person on the social plane. PTSD characteristics are symptoms from four clusters: symptoms of intrusiveness, avoidance, negative changes in cognition and mood and changes in excitability and reactivity. Traumatic experiences of war veterans can have an impact on the development of psychopathology in their children's lives. The impact of posttraumatic stress disorder of war veterans is negatively manifested in a broader sense through secondary traumatization and is manifested differently in relation to the period of childhood and adolescence. The period of childhood and adolescence represents a delicate and dynamic period that requires adaptation and functionality in adulthood. The epidemiological studies so far indicate the link between the post-traumatic stress disorder of war veterans with the mental problems of their children.","564":"The establishment of the United Nations after World War II raised hopes of a new era of peace. This was over-optimistic. Between 1945 and 1992, there were 149 major wars, killing more than 23 million people. Recent developments in warfare have significantly heightened the dangers for children. During the last decade child war victims have included: 2 million killed; 4-5 million disabled; 12 million left homeless; more than 1 million orphaned or separated from their parents; some 10 million psychologically traumatized. Researches indicate that children do develop PTSD after experiencing very stressful, life-threatening events such as happen in war. Wars of 21st century are often guerrilla-type civil wars in which women and children are not only the main victims, but are deliberately targeted. Thousands are displaced both internally and across borders. Wars at the end of nineties of 20th century in the region of ex Yugoslavian countries brought all the cruelty of war vivid again on European ground. Population were exposed to death, threatened death, actual or threatened serious injury, or actual or threatened sexual violence. During the War in Bosnia and Herzegovina 1992-1995 there were about 100 000 people killed (20% woman and 3.5% children) and about 18 000 children were orphaned because of war. Children are not capable to regulate their emotions and hyper-arousal on their own. It depends of the way how their parents (caretaker) regulate her\/his own emotions. During the war weak child's ego is paralyzed with intensive stimuli and floating anxiety, it does not manage to make constructive solution for traumatic experiences in such a short time. Mothers with small children are especially vulnerable group during the war time: they are supposed to take care about children and feel happiness, what is almost impossible Severe war experiences could cause depressive symptoms in mothers, what reduce their emotional disposability and could lead in different form of the child's neglecting. PTSD symptoms were lasting longer in children if their mothers have had functioning problems. Traumatization of mothers is connected with different behavior problems in their children. Wars are continuing all over the world and there is a continuity of researches about their consequences on children. Any programs that intend to mitigate the psychological effects of such trauma need to adopt a public health approach aimed at reaching many thousands.","565":"Divorce is a life event with a high level of stress for the entire family. Research shows that the number of divorces is on a steady rise. Family is very important for development of the children and changes within the family, after the divorce, could make consequences on them. Children are dependent on parents and disadvantaged during divorce because it is out of their control. They cannot predict how long will it take and what will be the outcome of divorce which includes separation from close family members, school change, change of home, change of life style and so on. Children often lack information and skills to overcome the challenges that the divorce carries. Conflicting relationships between parents make up the biggest obstacle that makes it difficult for a child to successfully deal with changes in the family. Even though parents deal with heavy feelings, it is desirable to put them the child and his interests in the first place. In order to stabilize the family system it is needed 2 up to 4 years. Children differ from one another in the reactions to the divorce, but there are some emotional reactions that are characteristic for most children of divorced parents, and the most often children reactions are of depressive symptoms, anxiety, anger, lower self-esteem and so on. The emotional reactions of children during the divorce can vary relative to the gender and age of the child. However, the divorce of a parent does not necessarily have to be so negative for children, especially if parents behave in an adequate way and they endeavor to act in such a way to make this process as painless as possible for children.","566":"Sexual abuse in childhood is associated with many adverse consequences for survival during their lifetime. Numerous research studies clearly show the link between sexual abuse of children and the spectrum of unfavorable mental, social, sexual, interpersonal and behavioral as well as physical health consequences. Current research shows the strongest link between sexual abuse of children and the presence of depression, alcohol and abuse of other psychoactive substances and nutritional disorders in surviving women and anxiety-related disorders in male survivors. There is also an increased risk of re-victimization, especially for girls. Negative effects of mental health in children with sexual abuse include posttraumatic symptoms, depression, helplessness, negative evaluation, aggressive behavior and behavioral problems. Recent research links sexual assault on children with psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia and dysfunctional disorders, as well as personality disorders. Sexual abuse of children involving penetration is specifically identified as a risk factor for the development of psychotic and schizophrenic symptoms. Many studies have shown that sexual victimization in childhood is a significant risk factor for suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviors.","567":"The scientific and clinical interest in children with mentally ill parents increased in the last years. Those children belong to a high risk population so that prevention is urgently indicated. Due to genetic influences and partly to an impairment of the parent-child interaction because of the parent's illness there exists a higher risk for child abuse. They show a three to five time increased risk to develop mental problems which require treatment over the course of their lives. They show abnormalities in social, cognitive and emotional areas. Untreated mental disorders and associated behavioral problems in children often chronify and lead to permanent impairment of the emotional, social and also intellectual development. Early detection and treatment are indicated and of high relevance.","568":"Early neglect and abuse are a major societal problem, with negative consequences for the victim. There is clear evidence that early neglect and abuse are related to an increased prevalence of mental health problems. On the other hand there are children that show resilience towards negative influences in early childhood. In this paper I will describe results of empirical studies that reveal the negative consequences of adverse childhood experiences (ACE) as well as studies on resilience. Studies relevant for the topic are reviewed. In many individuals adverse childhood experiences lead to impaired functioning of neural structures that increase the risk for later psychopathology and maldaptive functioning. However, according to one of the major principles of developmental psychopathology we see multifinality of outcome as some individuals show signs of resilience. Efforts to prevent adverse influences on children early in life are urgently needed to prevent long-lasting negative consequences that go along with subjective suffering and enormous societal costs. More research is needed to understand the mechanisms of vulnerability and resilience. ","569":"Child neglect is one of the most prevalent forms of child abuse. Neglect can be defined as a lack of sufficient attention, responsibility and protection that matches the age and needs of the child. There is no theory that fully explains why neglect of children happens. Three different causal models of neglect are given: parental deficit model, ecological deficit model and ecological-transaction model. Exposure to neglect in childhood may have a negative impact on the development of the child and cause short-term and long-term health, emotional, cognitive, academic and social difficulties. The aim of this paper was to provide a comprehensive theoretical overview of neglect of children causes and consequences. In this paper, we used review articles and meta-analyzes about child neglect causes and consequences published on Medline. Child neglect has a relatively high prevalence rate compared to other types of child abuse. Several studies suggest that the impact of neglect on the health and development of the child is just as negative as the impact of other types of abuse. Children who experience neglect in early childhood are more likely to have health, cognitive, emotional and social consequences in later life. A significant number of studies suggest the existence of a link between child neglect and risk factors related to parents, the child and the environment. Child neglect is determined by multiple risk areas and is considered as the result of a complex interaction of risk factors present in children and in their care environment. Neglect may have long-term consequences for all aspects of the health and functioning of the child. ","570":"The war in Bosnia and Herzegovina (1992-1995) was an extremely hard traumatic event with different losses, separations of people, injuries, hard physical and psychical suffering of everyone. Children were especially in difficult conditions. One of the most remarkable things about children, as anyone who works with them soon finds out, is their resilience. While children are vulnerable to psychic damage and, if the damage is deep enough, to delays in emotional and even physical growth, they also have an astonishing capacity to bounce back. This is one of the most rewarding things about treating traumatized children. For many children, it takes very little, perhaps only some words of understanding, to help them tap into their own ability to heal. Taking care of child war psycho-trauma was a difficult task for me, as the war-time head of Department of psychiatry, without enough knowledge in child psycho-trauma and as person with a high responsibility, to organize together with other psychological caretakers of children, especially refugee children. This presentation will be some kind of my remembrance of period of 20-25 years ago when we, I think did good work of what we could and what we knew.","571":"The paper gives an overview of the spatial conditions, human resources and development course of child and adolescent psychiatry as an independent profession. The beginnings of the development date back to 1959, when the Department of children and youth is opened in Sarajevo at the Neuropsychiatric Clinic, which continues without interruption even today. After that was opened same department in Banja Luka and after a certain period of outpatient work, and stationary departments in Tuzla and Mostar. Over time, as the world's developed and improved understanding of the needs of treatment of mental disorders, and as the trends of professional approaches changed from time to time, the same set of guidelines were followed by the professional work of staff members in the departments. As the material opportunities allowed, in all localities there is a clear tendency to improve spatial conditions. However, personnel capability has improved at a slightly faster pace, so by the war time in Bosnia-Herzegovina (BH) between 1992 and 1995, in BH were mostly trained professional teams. In meanwhile, the need for psychiatric assistance has largely exceeded the human resource capabilities. The situation of war has changed dramatically in the present situation, departments are empty, and there is a paradoxical situation that the patient in the hospitals does not exist, but the reason is bizarre, since because of the war, physically, patients are not able to access to hospitals. This situation also contributes to the departure a large number of staff, which is in the child psychiatry, and so was insufficient. Despite this, during the war in Sarajevo, the Psychiatric Clinic conducts research on psychiatric morbidity and evaluation of population trauma due to war stress in the city of Sarajevo, and included the population of children and adolescents who remained in the city. The project is implemented only in the city area, because Sarajevo was city, three and half years under the total military siege. Further on, the paper elaborates the status of spatial and human resources capacity in the post-war period up to the present day. There is an evident expansion of the psychological assistance service throughout the territory of BH, which has been largely on the initiative and all the necessary assistance of the international community through non-governmental organizations, but with the involvement of the remaining domestic staffs. They were also stated the government projects, in the last two decades, on the professional training of staff working in Mental Health Centers across the country. In the latest age of the last ten years, a number of private psychological counselling centers have been opened that, beside the psychiatrists, are led by certified psychotherapists, psychologists, pedagogues, and teachers. This fact is very important for the future, because this is a good part solving the current lack of professionalism to provide psychological assistance to the population in developmental age. All professionals involved in the human psyche were aware of how important the timely recognition and provided expert assistance, when it comes to developmental age. In the post-war period, certain scientific researches on the psychological trauma severity of the population are being carried out, and the results of some of these researches are mentioned in this paper. The paper concludes with the statement that the current state of development of child psychiatry in the country is satisfactory in relation to the conditions that we had the past decade, but with the suggestion that a long way to furthering this profession and its affirmation at the global level is in the future.","572":"The eleventh revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) is planned to be published in 2018. So called, \"beta version\" of the chapter of mental and behavioral disorders (ICD-11) is already available and it is considered that there will be no significant deviations in the final version. The DSM-5 was released in 2013. Changes related to mental disorders in child and adolescent psychiatry have been made in both of these classifications. To identify changes in the classifications of mental disorders in childhood and adolescent age in beta version of ICD-11 and DSM-5. Review of mental disorders in childhood and adolescent age and their classification in ICD-11 and DSM-5. For disorders that are classified as \"mental retardation\" in ICD-10, a new term \"intellectual development disorders\" has been introduced in ICD-11, ie \"intellectual disabilities\" in DSM-5. Hyperactivity disorders and attention deficit is a separate entity in relation to ICD-10, in which it is classified as a hyperkinetic disorder. Asperger's syndrome, which is isolated from autism spectrum disorders in DSM-5, does not appear under that name in ICD-11 either. Elimination disorders are in a separate block MKB-11 and DSM-5. Speech and language disorders are classified as communication disorders in the DSM-5 classification. Selective mutism and anxiety separation disorder in childhood are in the block of anxiety and fear-related disorders in ICD-11, and among anxiety disorders in DSM-5, respectively. Reactive emotional disorder and disinhibited attachment disorder of childhood are classified as stress-related disorders in ICD-11 and DSM-5. The new classifications (ICD-11 and DSM-5) classify mental disorders in child and adolescent psychiatry somewhat differently from their antecedents. New entities have also been formed.

Although often transient, and in many cases unaccompanied by visual dermatological responses, sensitive skin affects the quality of life. The aim of this survey was to assess the prevalence of sensitive skin and collect clinical data on sensitive skin in the population of Herzegovina-Neretva County. The survey included a total of 73 participants, 45 female and 28 male, aged 20 years and above, with a diagnosis of sensitive skin syndrome (SSS) confirmed by physicians. A dermatological exam assessing skin type, phototype and skin sensitivity was performed. The survey collected an assortment of information including demographics and included customized standardized questionnaires that closely examine skin sensitivity and the burden of sensitive skin. Findings concurred with existing evidence that individuals with sensitive skin represent almost half the examined population. The prevalence of perceived sensitive skin was significantly higher in females than in males. The main skin symptom was itching, followed by prickling, warmth and numbness. Our results clearly show that there is a burden of sensitive skin. This study investigated the prevalence of sensitive skin and the burden of sensitive skin in the population of Herzegovina-Neretva County. It is the first to focus on sensitive skin among Herzegovina-Neretva County population. Further studies are needed to bolster epidemiological data and physiological pathways of sensitive skin syndrome. ","576":"The different personalities of alcoholics are expressed in the way they manifest certain traits of their personality. In addition to knowing the general and common characteristics of alcoholics, it is even more important for clinical practice to know the differences between them, thus allowing a personalized approach to each patient, as a unique personality. The division of the personalities of alcoholics may be viewed through the prism of seven perspectives: the disease perspective, the dimensional perspective, the cognitive-anxiety perspective, the behavioral perspective, the spiritual\/transcendent perspective, the narrative and the systemic perspective. Each of these perspectives more clearly represents part of the personality of the alcoholic; together they give a clearer picture of the problem and accordingly offer different treatment options.","577":null,"578":"Bullying is an aggressive, intentional act carried out by a group or an individual repeatedly and over time against a victim who cannot easily defend himself or herself. However, with the advent of electronic communication via the internet and mobile phones has led to appearence of a new form of violence, i.e. cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is define as \"willful and repeated harm inflicted through computer, cell phones and other electronic device\". The aim of this paper is to point to the growing problem of cyberbullying. Review the research and theoretical literature. Bullying through the Internet tends to occur at a later age, around 14 years, when children spend more time on their mobile phones and social networking sites. Estimates indicate that between 15% and 35% of young people have been victims of cyberbullying and between 10% and 20% of individuals admit to having cyberbullied others. Perpetrators of cyberbullying have a degree of anonymity not possible in traditional bullying, and the potential exposure and embarrassment of the victim is on a larger scale. It is possible to victimize a peer within their own home or elsewhere at any time of day or night, and should they remove themselves from the site, the messages often accumulate. Victims of bullying often have mental health problems, including depressive symptomatology, self-harm and suicidal behaviors. This presents new challenges for individuals, families, schools, professionals, researchers, and policy makers. ","579":"Approximately 20% of the European labour force is involved in some type of shift work, with nurses being on the forefront. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, a specific work scheme is pervasive in the health care arena, where all nurses involved in shift work are committed to eight night shifts per month - unlike other European countries that restrict the number of night shifts. Accordingly, we aimed to investigate whether such shift work significantly affects psychosocial functioning and the quality of life of hospital nursing personnel in this country. A comparative cross-sectional study design was applied on a total of 157 hospital nursing professionals at the University Clinical Hospital Mostar during 2019. Subjects were divided into two groups: a total of 51% study subjects worked in specific shifts (12-hour day shift \/ 24 hours off \/ 12-hour night shift \/ 48 hours off), while 49% subjects worked in accordance with the regular 7-hour daily schedule. Standard Shiftwork Index (SSI) questionnaire was used, alongside comprehensive socio-demographic and quality of life appraisal. Descriptive and inferential statistical methods were applied, and statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05. This study demonstrated increased amounts of stress, reduced coping abilities and reduced levels of life enjoyment in shift work nurses in comparison to day work nurses. Furthermore, increased anxiety, stress, psychoorganic symptoms and sleep disturbances were significantly more common in shift work hospital nursing staff. In our study, nurses that worked in shifts have experienced negative externalities such as decreased social functioning, as well as reduced family and leisure time. Conversely, significantly higher satisfaction rates with shift work were only shown in regards to compensation. Our results reveal many detrimental effects of shift work and contribute to the field of research that is still laden with gaps in understanding its exact impact on the overall health of nursing personnel. Going forward, prospective (and even interventional) studies will be needed to disentangle the exact interplay between work-related factors in various health care systems and subsequent psychosocial disorders in health personnel.

Examine the correlation of religion with the quality of life and psychological symptoms in oncology patients. The cross-sectional study included 100 oncology patients in the test group and 80 internal medicine patients in the control group. A sociodemographic questionnaire was specifically designed for this study, the Duke University Religion Index, the Symptom Check List 90, and the WHOQOL-100 quality of life assessment were used to collect the data. The average score in oncology patients was significantly lower on the subscales for physical health (p&lt;0.000), social connections (p&lt;0.002), and intrinsic religiousness (p&lt;0.046) in comparison to internal medicine patients. On the psychological symptoms scale, the average score was higher in oncology patients with the largest difference observed on the psychoticism subscale (p&lt;0.078). Oncology patients are statistically less religious and are not satisfied with the quality of life in comparison to internal medicine patients. Psychological symptoms are more pronounced in oncology patients but the difference is not statistically significant. A lower level of religiousness is statistically negatively correlated with a higher severity of psychological symptoms.

The fundamental opinion is that the dance has the affect on the body and the psychical health of the people. To explore if the dancers have their less-expressed psychical symptoms and higher self-esteem. The examination was performed on the sample of 310 examinees, mostly of the young life age and who identified themselves as the dancers or non-dancers. For the requirements of the investigation there were used the socio-demographic question-form, the psychical symptoms estimation scale (RCL-90-R) and the Rosenberg self-esteem scale (RSES). The dancers show the smaller appearance of the psychical symptoms and that almost in all sub-scales, but their difference is not statistically significant. The statistically significant difference among the men and the women was recorded in the subscales of the somatisations, then the interpersonal vulnerability, the depression, the anxiety and the phobias. The dancers possess their higher self-esteem then the non-dancers, but statistically their difference is not significant. Comparing the results against the sex, the persons of the female sex possess the higher self-respect than the persons of the male sex. The dancers possess less of the psychical symptoms and their higher self-esteem than the non-dancers, but the difference within the results is not significant statistically.

Examine mental health and self-esteem of active athletes. The subjects of the study are active athletes from Herzegovina and students of the Faculty of Health Studies in Mostar. Mental health and self-esteem were measured by a sociodemographic questionnaire, The Symptom Checklist-90 and the Satisfaction With Life Scale. There is a statistically significant difference in the frequency of exercise, active athletes have the highest percentage (100%) and state that they exercise often (almost every day) while university students have a significantly lower percentage (20%).Students scored significantly higher on the subscales for somatization, obsessive - compulsive symptoms, interpersonal vulnerability, depression, anxiety, aggression, phobia, and paranoia than active athletes. Active athletes have statistically higher scores for almost all the claims of the subjective assessment of life satisfaction. Active athletes showed significantly less psychological symptoms and better mental health, greater life satisfaction and higher self-esteem than students of the Faculty of Health Studies in Mostar. ","583":"Working as a team with patients who are also recreational runners and managing a running school in the City of Mostar had made us thinking on how recreational running affects the mental health in individuals. Previous literature is pretty old dated, so we found this even more interesting. We have wondered why there is no more recent literature on this subject. So, while working on this mini review and discussing on this subjects we came up with an idea on a research about self esteem and life quality of individuals pre and post running school experience. Previous studies show that consistent running results in a number of positive psychological changes among diverse populations. In a study of Kenneth E.C. ordinary nonprofessional runners were surveyed about the psychological aspects of running. Many of the respondents had started running to improve their health, and almost all noted mental and emotional benefits including relief of tension, improved self-image, and better mood. Considering therapeutic effects of running Greist et al. define running as not expensive, and unlike sorne other treatments, it has beneficiai physical side effects. Their results compare favorably with those of patients in psychotherapy and have persisted for at !east one year in follow-up. Taking in mind all of the previously published research it can be concluded that running can be a therapeutic tool for a sereies of negative psychological conditions, such ass depression, anxieta, tension, mood changes, low self esteem etc. Although, these research are a few decades old there is still no recipe or dosage for running, especially in the area of physical ilness prevention. There is much to research and to be discovered in this field.","584":"Resilience is a relatively new concept that lacks clarity although it is increasingly used in everyday conversation and across various disciplines. The term was first introduced into psychology and psychiatry from technical sciences and afterwards thorough medicine and healthcare. It represents a complex set of various protective and salutogenic factors and process important for understanding health and illness, and treatment and healing processes. It is defined as a protective factor that makes an individual more resilient to adverse events that lead to positive developmental outcomes. Resilience is a positive adaptation after stressful situations and it represents mechanisms of coping and rising above difficult experiences, i.e., the capacity of a person to successfully adapt to change, resist the negative impact of stressors and avoid occurrence of significant dysfunctions. It represents the ability to return to the previous, so-called \"normal\" or healthy condition after trauma, accident, tragedy, or illness. In other words, resilience refers to the ability to cope with difficult, stressful and traumatic situations while maintaining or restoring normal functioning. The higher the resilience, the lower the vulnerability and risk of illness. Resilient individuals tend to be optimistic, have a tendency to see everything as a useful experience, focus on personal strengths and qualities, use constructive criticism, develop close relationships with others, have developed social skills, and are emotionally conscious. Good resilience aggravates and prevents the onset of disease, provides good heath, facilitates and accelerates healing, and provides productive life and a sense of well-being despite chronic illness. Resilience experts believe that anyone can strengthen their resilience and thus contribute to the advancement of health and, if ill, ease the illness, accelerate and facilitate healing.","585":"A study of COVID-19 infected patients was conducted regarding to organic and psychological characteristics. The findings of the study indicate that in the period of the pandemic in 2020, a total of 78 infection cases were confirmed in West Herzegovina Canton. Of the total number of infected, 55.1% are women and 44.9% are men. Of the infected population, 16.7% were hospitalized. By monitoring the COVID-19 disease in West Herzegovina Canton, we conclude how all manifestations of the disease were represented, from asymptomatic, through mild respiratory to the most severe clinical picture with fatal outcomes. The mortality rate in West Herzegovina Canton is 5.1%. The study showed that a total of 28.2% of COVID-19 positive patients before infecting with virus, were most likely to suffer from hypertension, diabetes and malignancies. Furthermore, it is important to emphasize that a total of 71.9% of those infected are without underlying diseases. Also, the results indicate that people with COVID-19 in addition to the characteristic symptoms of the disease (fever, fatigue, cough, etc.) had certain mental ailments such as decreased general mood, increased anxiety, panic attacks, acute stress disorder and others.","586":"","587":"","588":"Mental disorder is known to be as a loss of existential paradigm; individual's functioning is lacking in all areas. Therefore, it is difficult to point out what the patients exactly need because their needs are set on a broad range of a difficult boundary. The level of care that follows will be complex and multifactorial because nursing will challenge the interaction with the individual as a whole: behaviors and relations with family members. At this stage exploring interpersonal conflicts, with past and present aggression behaviors will be crucial. Aim of this paper is to investigate the professional experience in a work context where the patient's clinical condition poses a daily challenge from a physical and emotional perspective. Narrative investigation is performed here in order to explore the psychological load of the professional's psychological experience and its implication in facing aggressive situations. Moreover, this investigation highlights the importance of some professional and personal resources that can be made available to the operator. These tools could improve the understanding of the subjective experience of acute events guiding the individual through an exploration of the phenomenology of what happened decreasing the intimate stress load. A constant updating, the knowledge of de-escalation techniques and sharing the experience in dedicated settings could be important allies in the management of risk events. ","589":"Gender is a crucial factor in the development of mental illnesses, with an essential influence on clinical characteristics and not only on the prevalence of each disorder. Gender differences in cannabinoid-related disorders are highlighted by different research fields (preclinical, clinical, socio-demographic studies), but few studies focused on differential symptom expression in cannabinoid-induced psychosis. This study aims at investigating qualitative and quantitative gender differences in specific psychopathological domains in a clinical sample of subjects affected by cannabinoid-induced psychotic disorder, without psychiatric comorbidity. The study was carried out at the Psychiatric Inpatient Service of General Hospital of Perugia (Italy). In this cross-sectional gender study, 28 inpatients were enrolled, 14 males (M) and 14 females (F). Participants were administered a psychometric battery consisting of 7 tests (PANSS, NDS-I, YMRS, HAM-D, HAM-A, AQ, SSI) in order to investigate 7 psychopathological domains (Psychosis, Dysphoria, Mania, Depression, Anxiety, Aggressive Behaviour and Suicide Ideation). Scores obtained at each test were compared between male and females by using Mann-Whitney U test (p&lt;0.05). In this study, we observed that males present higher severity of psychotic symptoms, with prominent scores in PANSS positive and general psychopathology scale (p&lt;0.001), and an important expression of aggressive behavior (p&lt;0.001) compared with females. Female sample, instead, shows a greater expression of dysphoria and depressive domains (p&lt;0.001) and a lower, but statistically significant, prevalence in the anxiety domains expression (p=0.01). By these observations, we could assert that in male group thought disorders are prominent. On the other hand, in female group affective disorder are prominent. This study confirmed how gender influences the phenomenic expression of psychiatric disorders. In line with the precision medicine paradigm, a further clarification of different clinical profiles based on gender would allow the choice of a personalized treatment plan with better efficacy and accuracy indices. ","590":"G.B., 21-year-old patient of Albanian origin suffering from acute psychotic burning on schizotypal personality disorder induced by substance abuse, was admitted to the Psychiatric Service at Perugia' General Hospital, Italy. On admission, antipsychotic therapy was set up which had the role to reduced delusional and hallucinatory symptoms but the suspiciousness, the presence of magical thought and the closure towards surrounding world that characterize it, combined with the presence of intrusive images, consequently increased the anxiety experiences and negatively affects the establishment of a therapeutic relationship with the operators. During the hospitalization, daily support interviews were carried out: G.B. showed clear difficulty in expressing his own thought contents in presence of more than two operators emerged jointly with the tendency to project different emotional experiences based on the gender of the operator. Following these observations, with the aim to carrying out an intervention that could integrate a psychological approach to the pharmacological therapy in place, a specific personalized support setting was set up, consisting of a female and a male operator. This setting was structured coherently with the therapeutic goals to be achieved: creation of a therapeutic alliance, the integration of the patient's emotional experiences and containing the splitting through the transference analysis. By means of this setting, the patient has obtained a substantial improvement of the splitting framework allowing a better integration of his emotional experiences. At the end of the sessions, G.B. showed more confidence with the medical staff and showed himself to be more aware of his pathological and non-pathological mental states and consequently more adherent to taking drug therapy and to the continuation of post-discharge psychological therapy.","591":null,"592":"The aim of this paper is to explore the network structures of alexithymia components and compare results with relevant prior literature.

However, the risk of developing an alcohol use disorder could increase after Roux-en-Y bypass. The purpose of this review is to emphasize the further research needed in this area. Pubmed and Sciencedirect databases were searched. Articles written in another language than French or English as well as abstracts, conference presentations, editorials and expert opinions were excluded. Most of studies included in this review show an increased risk of developing an AUD (alcohol use disorder) after gastric bypass surgery. Male sex, younger age, smoking, regular alcohol consumption, AUD, recreational drug use, lower sense of belonging and undergoing a RYGB (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass) were identified as risk factors. There is an alteration of alcohol metabolism after gastric bypass. Gut hormones could also play a role in the development of AUD. The hypothesis of an addiction transfer is still controversial. The risk of developing an AUD seems to increase after surgery. Long term follow-up, after the second post-surgery year, is needed. Further researches are needed to understand the mechanisms that underlie the development of AUD. ","594":"Social networks are taking over teenagers' lives and altering the way they relate to others. They are creating their own and changing culture. Which is a cause for concern for adults, who do not understand it. Moreover, usage peaks at a pivotal time in life: adolescence. Therefore it seems important to understand these new habits, and the reasons why social networks are such an important part of the life of adolescents. Furthermore, we looked into the question if virtual relationships have an impact on real-life relationships, and vice versa. This literature review examined studies published between 2008 and September 2019. Twenty-five articles were selected from PubMed, Scopus, PsychINFO and Cochrane databases. Above all, teenagers are motivated to use social networks because they can develop an identity based on an idealized profile. This profile must be at least as good as those of their peers, in order to obtain the latter's approval. This is notably the case in a context where changes to the family structure give a greater weight to the opinion of peers. Young people are driven to seek refuge on the Internet by a lack of family support, and parents who are less emotionally present. This effect could be limited by encouraging communication between teenagers and their parents. Finally, romantic relationships are impacted by the availability of pornography. Viewing pornography is increasingly seen as a normal stage of development and is linked to poorer attachment to peers and family. The Internet seems to support a gradual detachment from family life and a move towards greater inclusion in the peer group. This is all the more evident in a context where family structures are changing. ","595":"Video game has become the preferred form of play among youth. Substantial research has mainly examined problems related to potential negative effects of video games ranging from sedentary screen time, exposure to violence, and excessive or problematic gaming. However, over the past two decades, the use of video games in psychotherapy has become increasingly popular with a lot of applications. After a review of the use and the effectiveness of commercial video games in the psychotherapy framework, we will share our experience in the use of video games in a child and adolescent psychiatric unit. We will illustrate it with the presentation of specific case reports. As video games are highly popular among children and adolescents, they are also interesting tools in the psychotherapeutic work with them. It's a new kind of play therapy, considering the setting, the psychological material that expresses during the game, the interpersonal relationships between gamers, the projective representation within the avatars, the cognitive strategies within the game. Video games represent an essential tool in taking care of child psychiatric patients because of their popularity. They contribute greatly to build the patient\/psychotherapist relationship. They help to approach cognitive, emotional and social patient's functioning, and also psychopathologic understanding and then psychiatric diagnosis.

We hypothesized interactions between epigenetic processes, inflammatory response and gut microbiota with family surroundings or environmental characteristics. We searched in literature interactions between epigenetic processes and psychiatric disorders with a special interest for environmental factors such as traumatic or stress events, family relationships and also gut microbiota. We searched on Pubmed, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES and Sciencedirect articles with the keywords psychiatric disorders, epigenome, microbiome and family relationships. Some gene polymorphisms interact with negative environment and lead to psychiatric disorders. Negative environment is correlated with different epigenetic modifications in genes implicated in mental health. Gut microbiota diversity affect host epigenetic. Animal studies showed evidences for a transgenerational transmission of epigenetic characteristics. Our findings support the hypothesis that epigenetic mediate gene-environment interactions and psychiatric disorders. Several environmental characteristics such as traumatic life events, family adversity, psychological stress or internal environment such as gut microbiota diversity and diet showed an impact on epigenetic. These epigenetic modifications are also correlated with neurophysiological, inflammatory or hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulations.

This population encounter specific issues and challenges regarding their mental health particularly when they have attained age boundaries and deal with the issue of transition from child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) to adult mental health services (AMHS). Many key questions regarding how to sustain continuity of mental health care for ATYA during transition remain. The aim of this paper is to review recent literature in the domain to identify dimensions that should be considered to improve ATYA transition from CAMHS to AMHS. A qualitative literature review was performed in Scopus-Elsevier database using the PRISMA method as reporting guidelines. Only papers discussing dimensions involved in the transition process from CAMHS to AMHS were considered. We restricted the review to researches published between 2010 and 2020. We identified 85 potential researches, after filtering; only 10 articles were finally included in the qualitative synthesis of the literature. Five main dimensions were identified: patient, professional, organization, policy, and ethic related. Those dimensions should be considered in order to improve ATYA transition process out of CAMHS to AMHS. This work contributes to identify principal dimensions that should be considered by mental health professionals and organizations in order to improve ATYA transition from CAMHS to AMHS.

A report regarding the translation procedure into French and its preliminary results has been previously published. We here describe the finalization of the translation process and cultural validation. The translation process followed guidelines established by the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcome Research (ISPOR) and the World Health Organisation (WHO). The process included two forward translations, one backward translation, a review by a panel of expert and cognitive debriefing interviews with patients. The 26 scales of the BODY-Q were translated and adapted into French. Each step of the process allowed to make changes leading to a conceptually and culturally equivalent French version. Backward translation comparison to the English version led to the identification of 16 differences necessitating re-translation. Overall feedback from patients over the final version was excellent. The BODY-Q proved to be a reliable and suited PRO for bariatric and body contouring patients. The thorough method of translation and cultural adaptation allowed us to achieve a conceptually and culturally valid French translation of the BODY-Q.

On a European level, only 8% of the people who can be characterized as having Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) would have consulted professional assistance in the past year. In this context, the KCE (Belgian Health Care Knowledge Centre) has addressed multiple recommendations to health professionals to reduce the \"treatment gap\" concerning the patients' care: (1) encourage screening and preventative interventions, (2) promote the acquirement of communicational and relational competences (3) develop collaborations between professionals. The objective of this article is to better understand their functioning. We format a non-systematic literature review concerning these recommendations. The implementation of these Brief Interventions programs in primary care is relevant due to the moderately positive impact on the frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption but both the quality of the therapeutic relationship and collaboration with the care network would optimize Brief Interventions. The quality of the therapeutic relationship alone appears to have an impact on therapeutic outcome. Training concerning patient-professional relationship is necessary to maximize the effectiveness of BIs.

In Qatar, the situation is dire with reports there is one psychiatrist per 170,000 people in the population. A one-day, student-led mental-health conference was held in Doha, Qatar under the auspices of the World Psychiatric Association with the aim of increasing interest in psychiatry as a career. In this single-arm, pre-post comparison study, a questionnaire assessing interest in psychiatry as a career was administered on participants before and after attending the conference. Demographic information was obtained and response items were on a 5-point Likert scale. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-sample t-test with a significant p-value set at &lt;0.05. The conference was attended by 102 individuals. Fifty-four attendees completed the pre-conference survey (53% response rate) and 36 participants completed the post-conference survey (35% response rate). Data for the 36 matched pre-post responses were included in our analyses. The average age of respondents was 22 years and 81% were female. There was improvement in post-conference results however these changes were not statistically significant. To the best of our knowledge this is the first intervention study on increasing interest in psychiatry as a career carried out in Qatar. It is likely that psychiatry enthusiasts attended the conference and therefore their interest in this medical specialty was already high as corroborated by the favorable pre-conference survey results. This might explain why there was a lack of statistical significance in comparison to post- intervention scores. We recommend that such an event be integrated into the medical school curricula throughout Qatar to include students with low baseline interest in psychiatry. Further research in this area with more robust methodology is urgently needed to help narrow the pervasive treatment gap. ","604":"Mental health problems are over-represented in doctors and medical students. However, stigma and 'a culture of shame' are formidable barriers to mental health services and consequently many doctors and medical students with mental health difficulties continue to suffer in silence despite the availability of effective treatment. Indeed, a recent study on over 2100 female physicians who met the diagnostic criteria for a mental disorder revealed that 50% were reluctant to seek professional help due to fear of exposure to stigma. Left untreated or undertreated, mental health problems in doctors can result in impairment of occupational functioning, compromise patient safety and place considerable strain on the economy (by increasing the amount of sick leave taken). Moreover, the consequences of mental health stigma in the medical profession can be fatal. Dr Daksha Emson, a psychiatrist with bipolar affective disorder, tragically killed herself and her baby daughter during a psychotic episode. An independent inquiry into Dr Emson's death concluded that she was the victim of stigma in the National Health Service. The mental health of medical students and doctors, in all of its aspects, must therefore be addressed with the urgency that it demands. Stephanie Knaak and colleagues conducted a data synthesis of evaluative studies on anti-stigma programmes for healthcare providers and identified six key ingredients one of which was a personal testimony from a trained speaker who has lived experience of mental illness. In this paper we outline a study protocol with the aim of answering the following research question, 'Does attending an anti-stigma programme comprised of a medic with first-hand experience of a mental health condition cause immediate and sustained reductions in mental health stigma from medical students and doctors towards their peers with mental health difficulties?'","605":null,"606":"Neuropsychiatric disorders are closely associated with a persistent low-grade inflammatory state. This suggests that the development of psychopathology is not only limited to the brain, but rather involves an additional systemic aspect, accounting for the large body of evidence demonstrating co-presentation of mental illness with chronic inflammatory conditions and metabolic syndromes. Studies have shown that inflammatory processes underlie the development of neuropsychiatric symptoms, with recent studies revealing not only correlative, but causative relationships between the immune system and psychopathology. Lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise may influence psychopathology, and this may occur via a bidirectional relationship. Mental illness may prevent health-seeking behaviours such as failing to maintain a balanced diet, whilst adopting a 'healthy' diet rich in fruits, vegetables and fish alongside nutritional supplementation correlates with a reduction in psychiatric symptoms in patients. Obesity and the gut microbiome have proven to be further factors which play an important role in inflammatory signalling and the development of psychiatric symptoms. In a related paper we focus on the role of exercise (another significant lifestyle factor) on mental health (Venkatesh et al. 2020). Lifestyle modifications which target diet and nutrition may prove therapeutically beneficial for many patients, especially in treatment-resistant subgroups. The current evidence base provides equivocal evidence, however future studies will prove significant, as this is a highly attractive therapeutic avenue, due to its cost efficacy, low side effect profile and preventative potential. By promoting lifestyle changes and addressing the limitations and barriers to adoption, these therapies may prove revolutionary for mental health conditions.","607":"A growing body of research suggests that neuropsychiatric disorders are closely associated with a background state of chronic, low-grade inflammation. This insight highlights that these disorders are not just localized to dysfunction within the brain, but also have a systemic aspect, which accounts for the frequent comorbid presentation of chronic inflammatory conditions and metabolic syndromes. It is possible that a treatment resistant subgroup of neuropsychiatric patients may benefit from treatment regimens that target their associated proinflammatory state. Lifestyle factors such as physical activity (PA) and exercise (i.e. structured PA) are known to influence mental health. In turn, mental disorders may limit health-seeking behaviors - a proposed \"bidirectional relationship\" that perpetuates psychopathology. PA is renowned for its positive physical, physiological and mental health benefits. Evidence now points to inflammatory pathways as a potential mechanism for PA in improving mental illness. Relevant pathways include modulation of immune-neuroendocrine and neurotransmitter systems, the production of tissue-derived immunological factors that alter the inflammatory milieu and neurotrophins that are critical mediators of neuroplasticity. In this paper, we will focus on the role of PA in positively improving mental health through potential modulation of chronic inflammation, which is often found in individuals with mental disorders. In a related paper by Edirappuli and colleagues (2020), we will focus on the role of nutrition (another significant lifestyle factor) on mental health. Thus, inflammation appears to be a central process underlying mental illness, which may be mitigated by lifestyle modifications. Lifestyle factors are advantageous as first-line interventions due to their cost efficacy, low side-effect profile, and both preventative and therapeutic attributes. By promoting these lifestyle modifications and addressing their limitations and barriers to their adoption, it is hoped that their preventative and remedial benefits may galvanize therapeutic progress for neuropsychiatric disorders.","608":"Mechanisms of cortical psychoses are approached by complementing big data-driven genetics and imaging with a putatively subverted neurovascular \"reverse plumbing\" by arteries. The \"cortical spread\" of grey matter loss in schizophrenia and the mid-pericallosal \"congestion\" in fMRI of periodic catatonia - treatable electromagnetically along arteries - are interpreted in terms of the fastest interstitial outflow through the Cerebral IntraMural Reverse Arterial Flow-engine (CIMURAF, Treviranus 2018-19) draining \"waste\" via arterio-adventitial lymphatics to the neck. Such repetitively sliding segments of CIMURAF are wrung downstream by muscles likely steered by the neurovascular pterygopalatine ganglion. At the pericallosal artery, along its ideal long straight segment, this likely happens diverging from the mid-callosum towards the front and the back. In the case of a convergent inversion a mid-callosal clash will result, which is observable in psychoses as a mid-callosal high-flow-spot simultaneously with hyper-perfusions of branches and \"backwatering\" of pial vessels with reactive waste - till date interpreted psycho-mathematically. CIMURAF might also accelerate the perivascular intrusion of MCs by flushing autocrine signals (of which electro-magnetism moves the dipoles) through a putative periadventitial counter-current. Psychoses plausible occur through tryptase-mediated attacks operated by mast cells against oligodendrocytes' cytoskeleton (Medic 2009) and probably via complement-4 (Schizophrenia WG, 2014) against neurons. Usually MCs are essential long-lived \"orchestrators\" of homeostases and immune or barrier defences interacting with nerves, immunocytes, organs, and routes. MCs after somatic programming as to \"destination &amp; destiny\" (Treviranus 2017a, 6.2., 2018) rapidly intrude also into the brain's parenchyma, first within the lymphatics and then putatively by crossing-over to extraluminal arterial routes. MCs transverse the BBBs, while macrophages only trespass in \"disease\" (Faraco et al. 2017). Both can be \"subverted\" by a list of microbes (and putatively blown up by COVID-19 within walls). Enuresis and MCs' reactions to clozapine add to the interactive support from (epi-)genetics and imaging.","609":null,"610":"The morphological transformations that occur during adolescence with rapid rhythm have an unprecedented psychological resonance and it is of fundamental importance to understand the way in which they are lived, perceived and elaborated.These fast body changes and the related social pressures make young people paying more attention to their physical appearance. Among the changes that the adolescent must face are: accepting their own body, acquiring a social role, establishing new relationships with peers,achieving emotional independence from parents. All of this is not always easy and many times they face a so difficult path that can produce the onset of some mental pathologies. Typical disorders that adolescents can face are the ones related to food. In these pathologies there is an isolation of the soul which corresponds to an alienation from the body: what remains in this loneliness is the gap between the idealized body and the objectified body. In this process of identity determination the idealized body is not able to relate to the real body (Cuzzolaro 2017). The dimension of their own body and the ability to meet the other bodies in the world are compromised; the only possible knowledge is represented by the impoverishment of their own subjectivity and by the attempt to recover it at an abstract level. Adolescents live in a condition of temporal suspension: the future is compromised and the past is demonized; what remains is a present moment made eternal by an indefinitely suspended instant (Juli 2018). Too fat for the anorexic, repulsive for binge eating; Merleau-Ponty already in 1945 expressed the concept of corporeality by using the following simple and very effective statement: \"I am my body\".

The GHA project (Genius Handling and Academy) was born with the aim of increasing the quality of the professional commitment made by airport professionals, preparing them to adequately face not only the technical-operational challenges but also the psychological ones underlying a complex and particular environment. such as the airport one. The year 2018 has been the starting point of this training project, the bettering of professional qualification has been the goal during the year 2019, up to the first part of 2020 (March). The headquarters of the pilot project was the 'Leonardo Da Vinci' Rome International Airport. The sample was composed by 25 employees of the 'Genius Handling' , a company operating inside the airport. The results collected at the end of the training period recorded a 37% increase in the quality of professional performance compared to the previous period in which no training activity was carried out. When the airport world had to stop in order to take the restrictive measures for containing contagion, the importance of the airport reality in everyone's economic and professional life has become immediately evident.

Medical records of subjects with BDs admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit over a 5-year period of time were retrospectively reviewed and clinical data were extracted into an electronic dataset. \"Revolving Door Subjects\" (RDS) were defined as those who presented three or more \"Revolving Door Hospitalizations\" (RDH) during twelve months. Features of RDH were compared with non-RDH in order to identify characteristics associated with RD phenomenon and possible risk factors for readmission. To explore predictors of RDH, a stepwise backword logistic regression model was built, including the variables that were significantly associated with RDH in the bivariate analyses. In our sample of 176 subjects affected by BDs, 53 (19.9%) RDH were identified. In the RDH group, a higher prevalence of mixed episodes (p=0.029) and medical co-morbidities (p=0.004) was detected. Subjects with repeated hospitalizations were more often committed to psychiatric residential facilities at discharge (p=0.002). Treatment features related to RDH were represented by a higher prescription rate of atypical antipsychotics (p=0.030), benzodiazepines (p=0.001) and antidepressants (p=0.048).

","616":"Seafarers are usually exposed to many stressors that are related to different duties on board. Several notable researchers have argued that stress is a transactional phenomenon between the individual and the environment that is largely dependent on the meaning given to the stimulus by the perceiver. One of the many causes of stress are poor communication skills. The aim of the study was to xplain why respondents drop out of research. The project was originally supposed to take place over a period of two years and involve a minimum of 30 respondents per group (30 skippers and 30 seafarers) who would take part in the research for at least four weeks while on board, or during the skipper season. Activity was to be measured with the Polar A370 fitness tracker, worn as a wrist-watch or bracelet and used for 24-hour heart rate, bodily activity and sleep pattern tracking for every respondent. The other device used is TANITA MC780MA, which is a segmental body composition analyser. We contacted overall 146 seafarers, of whom: 40 (27.4%) skippers, 43 (29.5%) deck officers and 63 (43.1%) engine officers. Participation was refused by 18 (12.3% of all contacted) individuals and 108 (74.0%) respondents dropped out during the research. Due to group dispersal and a low number of respondents who reached the end of the research, the project will have to be prolonged. We believe that the reasons behind respondent dispersal can be found in their inability to recognize the state they are in and in poor communication skills, while at the same time being exposed to extreme and possibly precarious work conditions. This forms a closed loop that only continues to generate even higher stress levels. Further research is needed to look into this phenomenon.

Excessive consumption is assumed to lead to a sedentary lifestyle, psychiatric disorders, overconsumption of sexual content and suicidal behaviour. But are these assumptions valid?

Total consumption of different media (television, video games, internet) remained stable until 2010, and significantly increased in 2014. No parallel increase in sedentarity was reported. Controversy continues to surround the quantification of overconsumption, and the definition of 'problematic use'. Nevertheless, it appears that 5% of young people have unusual internet use, and 97.5% of these meet the criteria for a mental disorder. The risk of overconsumption is related to four factors: familial, personality, peer influence and supply. These general factors are supplemented by specific factors related to the abuse of sexual content and suicidal behaviour. For the latter, specific risk factors are the same as for suicidal young people who are not influenced by social media. Even if screen time is higher for Generation Alpha, these young people are no more at risk unless they accumulate risk factors. They are also exposed to challenges that researchers have not yet studied in any depth. One question relates to how they can manage their privacy if their parents published, without their consent, photographs of them as children? Another issue is their relationship to knowledge, given that everything they need to know can easily be found online. ","620":"Bruxism is excessive teeth grinding or jaw clenching. Several symptoms are commonly associated with bruxism, including hypersensitive teeth, aching jaw muscles, headaches, tooth wear, and damage to dental restorations.

Awake bruxism is generally treated by dentists and maxilla-facial surgeons through several treatment modalities such as, counselling about triggers, relaxation, occlusal splints and botulinum toxin type A injections. We will present the case of a 21-year-old woman presenting mood swings with a high level of anxiety and concentration difficulties since childhood. She also complained of awake bruxism.

A 10-year retrospective review of the activities of a university audiophonology centre with 166 patients who consulted for disabling chronic tinnitus and who underwent a Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. The diagnostic criteria used were those of the DSM IV. Our sample shows that major depressive disorders, somatoform disorders and sleep disorders were the most frequently encountered. Alcohol misuse was also seen as the most common substance-related disorder. Thirty (30%) had prior psychiatric or psychological monitoring, and 60% were previously treated with at least one psychotropic drug. The systematic approach of liaison psychiatry appears to be essential in the treatment of disabling chronic tinnitus, given the associated psychiatric comorbidity. Beyond the detection of unrecognized or untreated disorders, patient education to attentional mechanisms and hypervigilance, which reinforce an unpleasant perception of tinnitus, as well as the management of stress and somatizations and sleep hygiene, is recommended. ","622":"Infanticide is not a new concept. It is often confused with child murder, neonaticide, filicide or even genderside. Each of these concepts has to be defined clearly in order to be understood. Through time reasons for infanticide have evolved depending on multiple factors such as culture, religion, beliefs system, or attempts to control the population. It was once seen as a moral virtue. So what has changed? Between January 2020 and May 2020, a literature search based on electronic bibliographic databases as well as other sources of information (grey literature) was conducted in order to investigate the most recent data on infanticide and child murder, especially the newest socio-economic and psychiatric considerations as well as the different reasons why a mother or a father ends up killing their own child and the Irish situation. Recent works on the subject demonstrate how some new socio economic factors and family considerations impact on infanticide. Mental illness, especially depression and psychosis, is often part of the picture and represent a very high risk factor to commit infanticide and filicide. Fathers and mothers do not proceed the same way nor for the same reasons when they kill their offspring. Neonaticide and infanticide are almost always committed by women. A recent case in Ireland (2020) proves how filicide remains an actual problem. Filicide is a relatively rare event, and therefore particularly impact both the public and the press when it occurs. Infanticide does not result from a unique cause, but from multiple factors (some being well known, some remaining hypothetical). Psychopathological and socio-economical parameters associated to peculiar family grounds are currently prevalent. To help and prevent infanticide, screening for psychiatric disorders and risk factors and treating or offering assistance to parents at risk should be implemented. ","623":"Tobacco use is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality amoung patients suffering from psychotic disorders. The association between severe COVID-19 and tobacco use is still debated. The aim of this paper is to enhance the importance of providing up to date informations about nicotine and tobacco use in connection with the SARS-CoV-2-related conditions. We present 3 cases of sudden tobacco use cessation in 3 long-term heavy smokers receiving mental health care for chronic psychotic disorders. Fear of severe form of COVID-19 was their principal motivation. Nicotine replacement therapy and quitline counseling were provided and no major withdrawal symptoms were declared. As mass media later wrongly presented tobacco use as a protective factor regarding COVID-19, all three patients resumed smoking. Rigorous counseling took advantage of psychotic symptoms to correct false informations and finally promote tobacco use cessation. The COVID-19 pandemic might paradoxically represent a great motivational factor to quit smoking, espacially when considering patients suffering from severe mental health disorders. Beyond the terrible suffering it causes, we illustrate with a case serie that this opportunity must be exploited by mental health professionals to improve quality and life expectancy of their patients.

The study is based on a non-clinical sample. The ad hoc questionnaire measures people's readiness to search for, publish and distribute humorous material during lockdown. It investigates the intentions behind sending content via social media (WhatsApp or similar) and the emotions experienced on receiving such content. The responses have been analyzed quantitatively, and using Excel's IF function they have been analyzed qualitatively. In the present sample of 106 Italian respondents, searching for content was less common than publishing it (yes 44.34%, no 54.72%). Positive emotions were more frequently the motivation (total 61.32%). A high percentage sent amusing content via social media or SMS (79%). Responses demonstrating a desire to lessen the situation's negative impact or a desire for cohesion were common. Receiving material was similarly associated with positive emotions and a sense of being close to others. humorous material appears to have served as a means of transmitting positive emotions, distancing oneself from negative events and finding cohesion.

The current pandemic is having a profound effect on all aspects of society, including mental health and physical health. In a previous study we showed interaction between compassion fatigue, burnout and workload. In our study, we have evaluated stress levels in 102 healthcare workers recruited in different rehabilitation departments (psychiatric and multidisciplinary). In particular, we evaluated the fatigue of compassion, vicarious trauma, burnout and hope (hopelessness) in the first two months of lookdown due to the COVID-19. The results obtained after the administration of the following evaluation scales: sCFs, CBI, Pro QOL, HBS, showed an overall increase in the scores in all professional figures. Significant compassion fatigue and burnout percentage is present in several groups. The highest levels of hopelessness in some professional figures, while higher educational levels can protect workers from the risk of developing high levels of work stress.

No statistically significant differences in the scales of depression, anxiety, and stress were found between nurses and physicians, but differences were found on Escape-Avoidance and Positive Reappraisal subscales. Nurses use significantly more avoiding coping style and positive reappraisal than doctors. Seeking social support is more pronounced in those over 40 years old, while those under 40 use more avoidable stress management techniques.

The current study was conducted on a total of 518 people over the social media through the Google e-forms. In the study, the \"Short Psychological Resilience Scale\" and the \"Beck Depression Scale\" were used to collect data. In the analysis of the collected data, t-test, One Way Anova, Mann-Whitney U Test, Kruskal Wallis-H Test, Pearson Correlation Coefficient were used. In the current study, psychological resilience and depression were investigated in relation to different variables. Psychological resilience was found to be higher male participants, educators,university graduates and groups with not mental health problems. Depression was found to be higher females, university students, high school and lower graduates,with mental health problems. When the relationship between psychological resilience and depression was investigated, it was found that there is a medium and negative correlation between them. Moreover, the cut-off point for the depression score was set to be 17 and the rate of the people having 17 points or higher scores was found to be 16.6%. In light of the findings of the current study, it can be suggested to offer more mental health care services to those having higher levels of depression.

A theoretical framework is required in order to understand this impact and strategies to mitigate it. In this paper, individual and community responses to COVID-19 are discussed from the point of view of attachment theory, a psychological theory which examines the formation and disruption of attachment bonds across the life-span from an evolutionary perspective. The contributions of this perspective to individual psychological disorders such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress, as well as to social responses such as interpersonal violence and stigmatization, are discussed in the light of findings from attachment research. Proposals for incorporating the knowledge derived from attachment theory into therapeutic strategies, as well as in developing community resilience in the face of COVID-19, are discussed based on the available evidence.

SARS-CoV-2, has a high level of sequential similarities to the SARS-CoV-1 and uses the same receptors when it enters the human body (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2\/ACE2). COVID-19 is respiratry infection that is primarily transmitted via respiratry droplets. Typical symptoms of COVID-19 infection can be very moderate (infected can be even asymptomatic) to very severe, with severe respiratory symptoms (bilateral severe pneumonia), septic schock, and fatal outcome.

Finger pointing, blame games and scapegoating are associated with creation of binaries that identify agency as good or bad, right or wrong, moral or immoral. The scapegoat is expectedly always bad, wrong and immoral, commonly black evil. The detrimental effects of the COVID-19 blame games are seen in a lack of cohesion and coherence in the anti-COVID-19 solving strategies.

In the first step of the WHO classification system for body weight status, adjusting for the potential effects of confounding factors, the multinomial logistic regression model revealed that underweight was significantly associated with greater rates of bradykinesia and muscle rigidity, and a lower rate of gait disturbance. In the second step of the Asia-Pacific obesity classification, adjusting for the potential effects of confounding factors, the multinomial logistic regression model revealed that underweight was significantly associated with a higher rate of muscle rigidity. Findings of the present study consistently revealed that underweight was associated with a greater rate of muscle rigidity in a stepwise pattern among Asian patients with schizophrenia.

Binge eating comorbidity was also investigated. The relationship between eating attitudes, impulsivity and anger was explored and the factors contributing to disordered eating attitudes were analysed. The participants were divided into three groups; 56 with atypical depression, 36 with non-atypical depression and 32 healthy controls for comparison. Clinical assessment was carried out using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, Multidimensional Anger Scale, Eating Attitude Test, and Hamilton Depression Scale. Deteriorated eating attitudes, increased anger symptoms and motor impulsivity were observed more in participants with atypical depression compared with participants with non-atypical depression. The frequency of binge eating was statistically significantly higher in participants with atypical depression (50%) than in participants with non-atypical depression (8%). A positive relationship was identified between deteriorated eating attitude, anger, and impulsivity. Behaving anxiously as a reaction to anger was found to be the significant predictor of disordered eating attitudes in participants with depression.

The sample consisted of 632 participants: 385 in the healthy control group and 247 MDD, the latter comprised of patients in their first diagnosed episode or recurrent. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) was used to measure symptom severity. Beck's Depression Inventory was administered when depression symptoms had lessened, establishing it as minor when filling out the personality questionnaire (NEO-PI-R). The results indicate a broad difference in personality between the healthy control and the MDD groups. High neuroticism and low extraversion, accompanied by low scores on openness and conscientiousness, were the most important personality dimensions in understanding distinctions. While agreeableness did not indicate any important role, it did significantly influence the understanding of gender differences within groups. Females were found more agreeable in both groups, but those from the healthy group were also more open and conscientiousness than healthy males. Females from the MDD group were found to be also higher on neuroticism than males of the same group. A general conclusion from the study is that personality dimensions are more important in understanding vulnerability to depression in comparison to gender differences in personality within groups. As females in the MDD group tend to self-report higher levels of agreeableness and neuroticism than do males in the same group when the level of their depression is categorized as equal MDD-severe type, this may influence practitioners to unequally diagnose depression in males and females.

Similarly, mean difference for CGI-S was -0.36 (95% CI -0.41, -0.30), YMRS -5.64 (95% CI -6.86, -4.43), MADRS -1.43 (95% CI -1.88, -0.99) and HAM-D -1.52 (95% CI -2.28, -0.76). The risk ratio (RR) of discontinuing due to adverse events was 1.18 (95% CI 1.01, 1.38) meaning risk increased by 18% in cariprazine group with RR for EPS related side effects 2.82 (95% CI 2.47, 3.22) reflecting an increased risk of experiencing EPS related side effects by 182%. Cariprazine was also associated with an increased incidence of side effects such as akathisia, nausea and insomnia. Cariprazine demonstrates significant improvements in symptom intensity control in patients suffering from psychiatric conditions including schizophrenia, bipolar disorders and depression and is considered well-tolerated with similar rates of trials discontinuation; however, cariprazine was associated with a higher risk of EPS side effects. These findings will guide psychiatrists and pharmacists in their clinical role for supporting psychiatric patients care.

COVID-19, a virus caused by the novel coronavirus that was initially identified on December 2019, in Wuhan city of China is currently affecting 146 territories, states and countries raising distress, panic and increasing anxiety in individuals exposed to the (actual or supposed) peril of the virus across the globe. Fundamentally, these concerns ascend with all infections, including those of flu and other agents, and the same worldwide safeguards are compulsory and suggested for protection and the prevention of further diffusion. However, media has underlined COVID-19 as rather an exclusive threat, which has added to panic and stress in masses which can lead to several mental health issues like anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder which should be contained immediately in its initial phases.","682":"Deep emotional traumas in societies overwhelmed by large-scale human disasters, like, global pandemic diseases, natural disasters, man-made tragedies, war conflicts, social crises, etc., can cause massive stress-related disorders. Motivated by the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic, the article provides an overview of scientific evidence regarding adverse impact of diverse human disasters on mental health in afflicted groups and societies. Following this broader context, psychosocial impact of COVID-19 as a specific global human disaster is presented, with an emphasis on disturbing mental health aspects of the ongoing pandemic. Limited resources of mental health services in a number of countries around the world are illustrated, which will be further stretched by the forthcoming increase in demand for mental health services due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health challenges are particularly important for the Republic of Croatia in the current situation, due to disturbing stress of the 2020 Zagreb earthquake and the high pre-pandemic prevalence of chronic Homeland-War-related posttraumatic stress disorders. Comprehensive approach based on digital psychiatry is proposed to address the lack of access to psychiatric services, which includes artificial intelligence, telepsychiatry and an array of new technologies, like internet-based computer-aided mental health tools and services. These tools and means should be utilized as an important part of the whole package of measures to mitigate negative mental health effects of the global coronavirus pandemic. Our scientific and engineering experiences in the design and development of digital tools and means in mitigation of stress-related disorders and assessment of stress resilience are presented.

This can be achieved by conscious reliving of the trauma and by activating new, transformative roles to guide the protagonist on his way to recovery.","684":"The coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak was labeled a global pandemic by the WHO in March of 2020. Understanding how crisis influence an individual's reactions to stressful events (and vice versa) is important in order to create meaningful and effective interventions. Our literature search have revealed lack of the papers related to psychodynamic approach to recent crisis. Psychodynamic places a large emphasis on defense mechanisms and unconscious mind, where upsetting feelings, urges, and thoughts that are too painful for us to directly look at are housed. Even though these painful feelings and thoughts are outside of our awareness, they still influence our behavior in many ways. Optimal application of psychodynamic approach offers the frame for acceptance of psychological stress in a more positive way and benefits psychological growth. We believe that including psychodynamic approach in the national public and mental health emergency system will empower Croatia and the world during (and after) COVID-19 pandemic crisis.","685":"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic emerged in Wuhan, China and has spread all over the world and has caused huge threats to health and lives.

It is defined as a chronic ischemic rest pain, ulcers or gangrene, attributable to proven arterial occlusive disease. Intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (IA DSA) still represents the gold standard for the evaluation of steno-occlusive lesions, but it has greatly been replaced with non-invasive multi-detector computed tomography angiography (MDCTA). The purpose of this prospective study was to compare diagnostic performance of MDCTA versus DSA in treatment planning in patients with CLI according to TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus Document on Management of Peripheral Arterial disease (TASC II). The study was designed as prospective; it was conducted from March 2014 to August 2016, and included 60 patients with symptoms of CLI, Fontaine stage III and IV. MDCTA of the peripheral arteries was performed first, followed by DSA. The lesions of aorto-iliac, femoro-popliteal and infra-popliteal regions were classified according to the TASC II guidelines, and inter-modality agreement between MDCTA and DSA was determined by using Kendall's tau-b statistics. Inter-modality agreement was statistically significant in all three vascular beds, with excellent agreement &gt;0.81 in aortoiliac and femoropopliteal regions, and a very good agreement &gt;0.61 in infrapopliteal region. Treatment recommendations based on MDCTA findings and DSA findings were identical in 54 (90%) patients. In one patient (1.7%), CTA was not interpretable.

Stress of the medical staff has been investigated in recent years by the medical institutions of different countries. The aim of this study was to examine the stress levels in medical staff of Department of Cardiac Surgery and Center of emergency medicine (CEM) in the Clinical settings, and to compare them. We conducted a cross-sectional study which included 55 patients between 21 and 50 years of age. The study group consisted of 30 employees from the Department of Cardiac Surgery of Mostar University Clinical Hospital, while the control group comprised 25 employees from the CEM. Research instruments were the Occupational Stress Questionnaire for Hospital Health Care Workers (OSQ-HHCW), General Health Questionnaire (GHQ 28) and a Stress MGMT-TEST A. The subjects from the control group had significantly higher stress experience in \"bombing\" with new information (p=0.028), unavailability of literature (p=0.039), poor communication with superiors (p&lt;0.001), conflicts with patients (p=0.042) and inappropriate public criticism (p=0.007). The highest stress level showed F1 group of stressors, concerning the organization of work and funding. CEM employees had statistically significantly higher level of stress on public criticism and lawsuits compared to the study group (p=0.013), as well as higher score on the anxiety\/insomnia subscale (p&lt;0.001), social dysfunction scale (p=0.002) and on the depression subscale (p&lt;0.001). Stressors from the group of organizational factors have proven to be the most common stressors in both groups. However, in some areas within the impact of workplace stress, CEM employees had significantly greater vulnerability compared to employees of the Department of cardiac surgery. Further studies are needed to establish the frequency and intensity of stress among health professionals, and to clearly determine the risk factors for its development.

The sample consists of members of the multidisciplinary teams of the Institute for Addiction Disorders of Canton Sarajevo (45 in total), of which 11 are physicians, 26 nurses\/medical technicians, 4 psychologists and 4 social workers. Employee Attitude Questionnaire (16 questions examining level of information, feelings of insecurity, fatigue, teamwork and job satisfaction) and EMAS-S which has two subscales (for measuring cognitive worry factor and autonomic-emotional anxiety state factor) were used. From baseline, 32 (71%) of respondents have the opportunity to apply their knowledge and skills at workplace, which is proportional to their job satisfaction, reduction of anxiety and uncertainty. A large proportion of respondents 36 (80%) stated that they felt more responsible in their work compared to the beginning of career, which was followed by a decrease in the score on EMAS cognition and emotion subscale, what reflected positively on work efficiency. The degree of satisfaction at the end of the work day, often and almost always, has 60% of respondents.

Obesity is associated with non-allergic asthma phenotype, but this relation could be influenced by gender. The aim of our study was to determine the relationship between BMI and asthma and to explore possible gender differences. Study included 149 patients with asthma (examined group) and 153 healthy blood donors (control group). Data from the medical records of patients with asthma were used, and all included subjects had their BMI calculated using standard formula. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics methods. Data with non-parametric distribution were analysed with Mann-Whitney U test and showed through medians with corresponding interquartile ranges. Statistical significance of BMI differences between non-allergic asthma, allergic asthma and control groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance - ANOVA. The results were interpreted at a significance level of P&lt;0.05. The comparison between median BMI values of two groups shows that examined group of patients with astma has significantly higher median BMI value in comparison with control group (P=0.035). Correlation was stronger for women than men (P=0.002 vs P=0.898). Incresed BMI of the examined group of patients with asthma was not asociated with non-allergic asthma (P=0.085). However, when stratified according to gender, there was a strong association of increased BMI with non-allergic asthma in women (P&lt;0.001). Patients with asthma in our study have higher BMI in comparison to healthy individuals, which contributes to hypothesis that BMI is a risk factor for development of asthma. We found that possible effect that BMI has on asthma is stronger in women, since there was a strong association between increased BMI and non-allergic asthma only in women.

Mature DMs are associated with adaptive functioning. Immature and neurotic DMs are associated with maladaptive functioning. Our goal was to determine the intensity of the most frequently used immature, neurotic and mature ego DMs in patients with epilepsy. We examined 50 patients with epilepsy, using a Defense Style Questionnaire (DSQ-40). We measured the intensity of individual DMs. Mature DMs: sublimation, humour, suppression and anticipation; neurotic DMs: undoing, pseudo-altruism, idealization and reactive formation; and immature DMs: projections, passive aggression, acting out, isolation, devaluation, autistic fantasies, denial, displacement, dissociation, splitting, rationalization and somatization. The control group consisted of 36 healthy subjects. Groups are equal in age and level of education. Patients with epilepsy use neurotic (p=0.0290) and immature (p=0.0155) defensive styles significantly more. Individually, they most intensively use acting out, humour and sublimation, and statistically significantly more they use displacement (p=0.0161), denial (p=0.05) and somatization (p=0.0019). Patients with epilepsy use the neurotic and immature styles of ego defence more intensively. As such, they are less adaptable to new situations. Our knowledge can be useful for planning future interventions for people living with epilepsy. ","699":"Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS) are an unpleasant and sometimes painful examinations. Pain can reduce patient's compliance and have a negative effect on the examination results. Different studies report that music affects pain perception by acting as a distractor, by inducing positive emotional valence or through the concept of convergence of different sensory modalities. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of music and different environmental and sociodemographic factors on pain perception during EMG and NCS. Sixty patients with suspected neuromuscular disease were randomized into music and control group. Specific questionnaire assessed sociodemographic characteristics, medical history, examination waiting time, examination extent and biometeorological forecast. The numerical rating scale was used for the evaluation of pain. The examiner evaluated patient's compliance after the examination. NCS was less painful for patients in the music group (p=0.03), as well as for more cooperative patients (p=0.011). For patients who previously underwent EMG\/NCS, present NCS was more painful (p=0.001), regardless of the music intervention (p=0.019). EMG was more painful for older patients (p=0.041). Patients with lower level of education reported lower pain during NCS (p=0.026). Gender, financial satisfaction, biometeorological forecast, diabetes, depression or malignant disease, use and dosing of analgesics or antidepressants, symptoms, examination waiting time and the examination extent had no effect on pain perception. Music significantly decreased the perception of pain associated with NCS, but not the EMG portion of the examination. During EMG pain level was not significantly reduced, but the median of pain was still lower. Generally, the pain level during NCS, unlike the one during EMG, was affected by patients' compliance, level of education and painful predetermination. We propose using music during EMG\/NCS because it can make the examination more comfortable for the patient and thus contribute to better quality of this examination.

After invasive EEG monitoring and the invasive neurosurgical treatment (resective surgery) there are possible complications (intracranial haemorrhage, cortical lesions and infections), however there are possible neuropsyhologic outcomes such as memory outcomes, language outcomes and psychiatric outcomes. The quality of life in epilepsy (QOLIE-31) scale is a self-completed questionnaire which contains seven subscales which address the following aspects: emotional well-being, social functioning, energy\/fatigue, cognitive functioning, seizure worry, medication effects and overall quality of life. Our study aimed to examine the quality of life in patients with drug resistant epilepsy who had undergone invasive EEG monitoring and resective neurosurgical treatment through the application of the QOLIE-31 scale. The study included 9 patients with drug resistant epilepsy who had undergone invasive EEG monitoring followed by resective neurosurgical treatment in the period from 2010 to 2016, and the control group of 15 patients with drug resistant epilepsy who had not undergone neurosurgical procedures. Clinical variables of interest for this study were obtained through phone contact, and the QOLIE-31 scale was applied. In the domaine of seizure worry, patients in the examined group were more concerned about the seizures (54.7) compared to the examined group (80), as well as in the overal quality of life (examined group 57.5; control group 77.5). Patients in the control group complained more in the domain of antiepileptic therapy (score 70.7) than patients in the examined group (score 100). In the other domains: emotional well-being, energy\/fatigue, cognitive functioning, and social functioning there were minor deviations between the examined and control groups. There was no statistically significant difference between individual QOLIE-31 questionnaires, as well as between the two groups of respondents.

PTSD remains a substantial problem in Croatia, nearly three decades after the beginning of the Croatian Homeland war. In this paper, we present results of our original research about impact of PTSD on the self-perceived health-related quality of life and social support in Croatian Homeland war veterans. A total of 277 war veterans were included from all Croatian counties. 158 (57.03%) veterans has PTSD and 119 (42.47%) are without PTSD. Strucured questionnaire was designed for socio-demographic data and information about combat experience and health problems. SF-36 was used in the estimation of health-related quality of life and Multidimesional Scale for Perceived Social Support for estimation of social support. Research was performed from June 2017 till November 2017. Main results of the study suggest that Croatian veterans with PTSD have lower health-related quality of life in almost all doimains, and that they perceive less social support from family, friends and significant others in comparison to veterans without PTSD. The results of this study reiterate strong impact of PTSD on quality of life and perception of social support. The research speaks in favor of the need to develop person-centered interdisciplinry health-care programs for this population, with special emphasis on their overall quality of life.

The aim in ours study was to evaluate the differences in the exposure of the population to benzodiazepines (in period from 2014-2018) between Serbia, Slovenia and Croatia, the three countries of the Southwestern Balkans with varying degrees of socioeconomic development. A academic investigator initiated, pharmacoepidemiological difference-in-difference time series analysis of population exposure to benzodiazepines between the three, geographically close Balkans countries (Slovenia, Serbia, Croatia) with varying degrees of socioeconomic development has been carried out. Study was conducted as academic investigator initiated, in a retrospective manner on monthly basis international data set from January 2014 to December 2018. At the annual level, during the study period from January 2014 to December 2018, compared to Slovenia, Serbia and Croatia had higher DIDs, from 5 fold (Croatia) to 6 fold (Serbia), for all benzodiazepines in total. By analyzing the differences-in-difference, we have shown that influence of both time (month) and country on DIDs is significant as well as their mutual interaction (the country x month) for all benzodiazepines in total. Serbia and Croatia must implement explicit measures of reducing benzodiazepine prescription in health primary care based on evidence-based recommendations in the indications where general medicine practitioners\/family doctors most commonly prescribe these medicines. Without providing a realistic supplement\/alternative to benzodiazepines such as increasing the availability of psychotherapy and improving the structure of psychiatric professionals in healthcare settings, implicit measures are not recommended for reducing prescription, implementing accountability measures for prolonged prescription of benzodiazepines, and in particular for \"masked\" somatic diseases. All this comes to the fore by raising economic development and socioeconomic stability. ","703":"Anaphylaxis is an unanticipated systemic hypersensitivity reaction which can produce deleterious effects, even death, if not treated promptly. Preventive approach implies taking a thorough anamnesis with the emphasis on previously diagnosed allergies. If an allergic reaction occurred during previous surgery, a detailed documentation of administered anaesthetic agents and drugs would be crucial for the following anaesthesiologic management. Preoperative planning and avoiding cross-reactivity with drugs commonly used during anaesthesia are the key points to prevent an anaphylaxis. In case of emergency surgery when the exact identification of allergens is not possible, premedication prophylaxis should be considered. General measures for prevention of anaphylaxis could be undertaken as well, such as the choice of anaesthesiologic drugs and techniques in the operating theatre adequately equipped for the management of predictable anaphylaxis.","704":"Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus is a chronic steadily progressing disease. Nowadays a vital and acute socially significant problem still has not been solved. The etiology and pathogenesis of this disease remain so far poorly understood. Variable clinical manifestations, as well as difficulties in differential diagnosis with other neurodegenerative diseases - lead to underdiagnosing of the illness that causes a significant decrease in patient's quality of life and even results in disability. The number of patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus has been steadily increasing. That is why, the coverage and a full study of this problem is of great interest for a broad circle of medical professionals.","705":"A tic is a sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic motor movement or vocalization. Motor and phonic tics in a course of over 1 year that first occured before 18 years are the main features of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS). Psychogenic\/functional (P\/F) tics were considered as a diagnosis made per exlusionem in lack of agreement of diagnostic criteria. Recently, emphasis is in rather highlighting positive signs when making diagnosis of P\/F tics. Several features in clinical course are important to differentiate GTS from P\/F tics. Some of them are acute onset in adulthood, precipitation by physical event, absent family history of tics, variable, complex and inconsistent phenomenology, suggestibiity, distractibility. Premonitory urge, feeling of excessive energy and being 'wound up' prior tic, is a usual feature of GTS unlike in P\/F tics. If present, such premonitory urge have different qualitative and quantitative marks. Another possible diagnostics tool could be the beireitshaftspotential, an event-related electrical potential associated to initiation of movement which is divided in two phases, early (B1) and late (B2) phase. Early phase, whose occurence in some papers has been reported prior P\/F tics, is absent prior performed tic in GTS. In everyday clinical practice differentiating GTS from P\/F tics is often very challenging but taking proper medical history, paying more attention to positive signs and possibly using electroneurophysiology tests could contribute in making the right diagnosis.","706":"In this paper the authors present neuroanatomical and neurophysiological arguments against the microvascular compression in the root entry zone of trigeminal nerve nerve as an ethiopathogenetic factor of ITN. Clinical experience has proven that compression of mixed sensorymotor nerve (peripheral or central one), cannot provoke paroxysmal neuralgic pain. The authors conclude that the well known fact that dental pulp has only pain sensory modality brings up the question what might be consequence of tooth extraction where neural fibers are broken in the innervation areas of maxillar and mandibular nerve. The answer could be only one. If exclusive algophoric deafferentation hypersensitivity after tooth extraction exceeds a certain threshold, patients will experience paroxysmal neuralgic pain. Broken neural fibers develop pathological ephaptic communication with other trigeminal sensory modalities through supraspinal central structures responsible for the transmision of dental pulp pain. This can explain trigger phenomena and latency between the touching of circumoral areas and onset of neuralgic paroxysm, which is a central epileptic phenomenon. In conclusion, the so-called idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (ITN) is the expression of algophoric deafferentation hypersensitivity after tooth extraction.","707":"Early recognition of mental disorders and psychological crisis is essential for successful therapy and good outcome of affected persons.

The objective of this study is to explore when students and professionals consider a person with dementia in need of palliative care and to compare their opinions in three South East European countries. An anonymized questionnaire was used based on van Riet Paap et al. (2015) case-vignette. A sample of 1287 participants (student nurses, professional nurses, psychology students, professional psychologists, student doctors, professional doctors, and students and professionals from other non-relevant to medical and social care sciences) was examined in Greece, Bulgaria and Romania. The open responses to the \"when\" question revealed the categories: after her diagnosis\/after the first symptoms; when she and her family cannot cope; at the advance of symptoms; all the time; when she behaves aggressively; I am not sure\/there is no specific point. Unexpectedly, age, professional status and field of studies were not found to be significant predictors, but only the country of origin was found to contribute to the differences in the participants' answers regarding the start of palliative care. Although professional-student status and relevancy of subject did not predict opinions, the country of origin predicted controversies for the proposed time point of considering a person with dementia in need of palliative care.

In the current article we used the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 to examine burden due to mental and substance use disorders in Romania. For each mental and substance use disorder included in the GBD 2016 we reported the yearly estimates for YLL (as a measure for non-fatal burden), YLD (fatal burden) and DALY (summing years lived with disability and years of life lost to give a measure of total burden). Mental and substance use disorders were the third leading cause of non-fatal burden in Romania in 2016, explaining 13.53% of total years lived with disability, the ninth leading cause for fatal burden explaining 0.84% of total years of life lost, and were the fifth leading cause of total burden, accounting for 5.52% of total disability-adjusted life years. Among MSDs, depression, anxiety and alcohol use disorders have the highest rate. Starting 1997 there has been a slow decrease of age-standardized disability-adjusted life year rates, with no significant change in the last 5 years. Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 found that mental and substance use disorders were the fifth leading contributors to disease burden in Romania, with anxiety and depressive being the most prevalent.

A total of 3175 subjects living in Isfahan participated in this cross-sectional population-based study (SEPAHAN) and completed self-administered questionnaires about demographic, life style, gastrointestinal disorders, personality traits, social support, and psychological problems. Data was analyzed using bivariate multiple binary logistic regression in R Free statistical software. The results indicated high scores of neuroticisms increase the risk of anxiety and depression after adjustment for the potential confounders in total sample (OR (95% CI): 1.22 (1.19-1.24) and 1.19 (1.17-1.21), respectively) as well as in both male and female. In contrast, joint inverse associations were found between anxiety and depression with high extraversion (OR (95% CI): 0.90 (0.88-0.92) and 0.91 (0.89-0.92), respectively), agreeableness (0.93 (0.91-0.96) and 0.94 (0.92-0.96) respectively) and conscientiousness scores (0.95 (0.93-0.97) and 0.95 (0.94-0.97) respectively) as well as in both male and female. Furthermore, higher scores of openness had significant inverse association with depression in male. The present study indicated that higher scores of neuroticism, however lower extraversion, conscientiousness and agreeableness scores are risk factors for both anxiety and depression in Iranian adult population.

At the same time, some of these women were raped by the offenders that were previously known to them. The average length of detention was 141 days among the seventeen victims (range of 7 to 395 days), while the average time from the first day of imprisonment to the first day of testimony was 311 days (range of 30 to 889 days). Based on the narrative descriptions of the events acquired from these testimonies, our analysis showed that these expressions differed when the offender was known to the victim, contrasted to the situation when the offender was completely unknown. This finding has a significant implication in victim's testimony at judicial hearings. Specifically, women that were raped by unknown perpetrator(s) were often unable to provide persuasive testimony and their recollection of the events was deemed insufficient for the further prosecution. Testimonies in these cases substantially lacked in vividness and were devoid of visuospatial determinants of the rape event. Consequently, this often resulted in the case's dismissal. The unusual and problematic expression of these traumatic memories might indicate that these events were not properly stored in the conceptual form of memory. Ultimately, victims could not make any coherent recollection or reconstruct the cascade of events by using perceptual information. We argue that this could be due to an aberrant mechanism of memory storage and difficulties that emerge on the level of sensory input. This problem needs to be further examined and correspondingly accounted for since it can exert significant influence on judicial outcomes in the domain of sexual assault cases worldwide. ","715":"To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been conducted in order to assess the correlation of these factors with the self-esteem in Lebanon. Therefore, this study aims to assess risk factors associated with self- esteem among a representative sample of the Lebanese population. A cross-sectional, conducted between November 2017 and March 2018, enrolled 789 participants. Self-esteem was measured using the Rosenberg scale. An exploratory factor analysis was executed to detect patterns of risk factors associated with self-esteem from our sample. A cluster analysis was then performed with the identified factor scores to identify the different profiles of the participants. Relationship management (Beta=0.117), emotional awareness (Beta=0.074) and personal accomplishment (Beta=0.064) were associated with a higher self-esteem, whereas high depression (Beta=-0.102), alexithymia (Beta=-0.077), burnout depersonalization (Beta=-0.078), suicidal ideation (Beta=-0.391) were associated with a lower self-esteem. Factor 1 (High emotional intelligence &amp; low depersonalization) (Beta=1.819) was associated with increased self-esteem, whereas Factor 2 (High suicidal ideation, high alcohol dependence, high depression and anxiety) and Factor 3 (High burnout, high stress and high alexithymia) were associated with decreased self-esteem (Beta=-1.380 and Beta=-0.751) respectively. Being widowed (Beta=-2.332), belonging to cluster 1 (People with emotional dysregulation) (Beta=-2.850) and cluster 2 (People in distress) (Beta=-3.660) were significantly associated with decreased self-esteem. Depression, anxiety, burnout, stress, low emotional intelligence, alexithymia, suicide ideation, alcohol dependence and many other factors can be prevented, or reduced, by interventions that improve self-esteem. ","716":"Adolescence is a period characterized by high frequency of mental health problems. Loneliness, in particular, is a common psychological problem. This study aims to explore the effects of psychological capital on adolescents' loneliness and the mediating effects of perceived social support. A total of 694 adolescents from six regions in Hunan Province, China were selected. The survey was conducted using the Perceived Social Support Scale, Loneliness Scale, and Psychological Capital Questionnaire. The study analyzed the correlations between perceived social support, psychological capital, and loneliness among adolescents and the mediating role of psychological capital in the relationship between perceived social support and loneliness. Significant correlations were observed between adolescents' total scores in perceived social support, psychological capital, and loneliness and between each dimension. The following observations were made: a significant negative correlation between perceived social support and loneliness (r=0.440, P&lt;0.01), a significant positive correlation between perceived social support and psychological capital (r=0.493, P&lt;0.01), and a significant negative correlation between psychological capital and loneliness (r=-0.303, P&lt;0.01). Psychological capital plays a statistically significant mediating role on the relationship between perceived social support and loneliness (P&lt;0.01). Perceived social support and psychological capital can reduce adolescents' loneliness and perceived social support can alleviate loneliness by enhancing psychological capital.

The aim of this study is to estimate the connection between the aforesaid weather changes and a committed suicide along with the suicide attempts. We conducted a retrospective study in Osijek-Baranja County in the period from 2000 to 2011. Meteorological, demographic and epidemiological analysis was performed on 569 suicides and 478 suicide attempts (total of 1047 events). We analyzed the values of the above-mentioned meteorological parameters at the exact time when the event had happened, as well as three days before the event and one day after the event, comparing it with the monthly mean values. The results showed that the changes of temperature and pressure were significantly related with the suicides i.e. suicide attempts in general, while by separating genders, a connection with all examined meteorological factors was found by woman whereas men expressed significance only in the matter of temperature changes. Despite the fact that suicidality is caused by numerous factors, this study confirms that a sudden change of weather in the days preceding the suicide can be a trigger to suicidal behaviour. The study also suggests that in the matter of suicidal behaviour, female population is more susceptible to sudden weather changes. ","719":"The suicide rate of the youth in South Korea has been increasing, and suicide of the youth still has been the most common cause of death since 2007. We aimed to determine the trends and the regional risk factors of youth suicide in South Korea from 2001 to 2010. We used the data from the National Statistical Office to calculate the standardized suicide rates and various regional data including population census, employment, and labor. To calculate the effect of individual risk factors, we used the data from the fourth Korean Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey (KYRBWS-VI). Conditional autoregressive model for regional standardized mortality ratio (SMR) using inter-regional spatial information was fitted. Suicide rates of adolescents aged 12 to 18 was from 3.5 per 100,000 people in 2001 and 5.3 per 100,000 in 2010. There were no significant gender difference in suicide rates, however, the number of suicides among adolescents aged 15-18 accounted for four times than those of adolescents ages 12-14. High proportion of late adolescents, higher number of recipients of national basic livelihood, and higher number of adolescents who treated with depression were related to elevated suicide rate of adolescent. Total sleep time of adolescents and regional unemployment rate were negatively associated with the suicide risk of respective regions. Age distribution, economic status, total sleep time, and the number of adolescent patients with depression were different between those in low and in high adolescent suicidal regions in Korea. Our findings suggest that preferential appliance of adolescent suicide prevention program for regions by considering those factors may be important steps to reduce adolescent suicide in Korea. ","720":"Suicide is a major global public health problem with significant impact on society. According to the World Health Organization, every year about 800.000 people commit suicide, while at the global level suicide accounts for 50% of all violent deaths among men and for 71% among women. Suicide is a complex phenomenon which cannot be attributed to a single causal factor, but to a combination of simultaneous effects of multiple factors which are expressed in the form of psychological, biological and sociological indicators. Analysis of epigenetic mechanisms (methylation of the DNA, modifications of histone proteins and (networks of) miRNA), which link the interaction between genes and the environment, could importantly contribute to better understanding of suicidal behaviour. Recent studies on suicidal behaviour and DNA methylation show differences in DNA methylation pattern, with numerous sites among suicide victims. Using next generation sequencing, genome-wide studies helped identify novel candidate genes while studies of already known candidate genes (such as glucocorticoid receptor and BDNF) gave us better insight into the interplay of genetics and epigenetics. Epigenetic studies importantly contribute to elucidation of new biomarkers for suicidal behaviour. However, present studies are very different in design and often performed on very small samples, and these limitations could be overcome with more careful study preparation.","721":"Despite the intensive globalization and an attractive idea of human cosmopolitism the world is still divided into rival nations and religions, with confronting ethics and many war conflicts across the globe producing and perpetuating huge mental health problems.

They participate in many cellular processes, such as ageing, transcription, apoptosis, inflammatory processes, post-translational modification of proteins, gene transcription silencing, activation of DNA repair mechanisms, and regulation of many metabolic processes. The aim of this paper is to verify the statistical hypothesis assuming the difference in expression at the level of mRNA in genes for sirtuins 1-7 between patients with recurrent depressive disorders (rDD) and patients from the control group, and the hypothesis assuming the relation between the expression at the level of mRNA for these genes and clinical variables in the course of recurrent depressive disorders. A total of 198 individuals took part in the study (rDD gropup, N=99; control group, N=99). SIR-1 and SIR-6 expression at the mRNA level was significantly higher among the people with rDD as compared to the subjects from the control group. A reversed relationship was observed for SIR-2, SIR-3, SIR-4 and SIR-5. Statistically significant correlations were observed only in the case of SIR-1 and the number of depression episodes (negative relationship), as well as SIR-5 and the severity of depression measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (positive relationship). Expression at the mRNA level for selected sirtuins is a factor that significantly differentiates people with depressive episodes from healthy ones. SIR-1 and SIR-6 expression at the mRNA level was significantly higher among the people with depression as compared to the subjects from the control group. A reversed relationship (also statistically significant) was observed for SIR-2, SIR-3, SIR-4 and SIR-5.

Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) is a developmental and behavioral model of intervention for toddlers with ASD which has already shown very interesting outcomes on the development of children with ASD in various studies with different settings. However, it is not possible with the current research to agree on the best setting. Thus, we implemented an ESDM program according to our context where children are often pre-schooling early from 30 months old. This therapy was applied by a multidisciplinary team working in close collaboration with parents and other partners. A prospective observational study including 19 toddlers with ASD was conducted. We evaluated improvement on the cognitive level of toddlers with ASD receiving therapist-delivered ESDM intervention for 12 hours per week. Significant improvements in verbal and nonverbal cognitive skills at the Mullen Scale of Early Learning were obtained after 10 months of intervention in our sample. The largest improvement was in receptive language development quotient with a mean improvement of 19.6 points. We also observed promising outcomes in daily adaptive behavior, with a slight improvement in communication at the Vineland Adaptive Behavioral Scale. These outcomes, when compared to the conclusions of previous studies, are leading us to the need for a therapy duration beyond 10 months. Our outcomes were very encouraging even with low cognitive and nonverbal children. These outcomes may be confirmed in a multicenter randomized controlled trial that is ongoing. ","733":"Despite much attention in the clinical literature, research on alexithymia in the treatment setting has only recently gained traction. While several reports indicate limited benefit from therapy amongst patients with high alexithymia, this seems to be less so in the context of group therapy. This study considers a specific aspect of the group therapy process - family re-enactment - in facilitating improvement in overall quality of life for patients with high levels of alexithymia. Family re-enactment was examined as a potential mediator of the relationship between alexithymia and change in quality of life among 50 patients who completed treatment in an intensive, integrative group therapy programme. Patients completed three self-report measures: Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 (baseline), Quality of Life Inventory (baseline, post-therapy), and Therapeutic Factors Inventory-Short Form (week 8). Regression with mediation analysis was employed using the change score for the QOLI as the dependent variable, alexithymia scores as the independent variable, and the family re-enactment score as the mediator; baseline quality of life was included in the model as a control variable. Family re-enactment emerged as a significant mediator of the relationship between alexithymia and treatment outcome, implicating it as a contributing mechanism of change for alexithymic patients who participate in group therapy. Patients with higher levels of alexithymia (in particular, difficulty identifying and describing feelings) were more likely to positively endorse aspects of family re-enactment during group therapy, which in turn were significantly associated with greater improvement in patients' overall quality of life.

When heritably excessive, each of these traits may become a mechanistically fundamental biogenetic trait vulnerability for personality disorder. The other main risk factor for personality disorder is environmental, notably abuse, neglect, and psychological trauma. The emerging concept of mechanism-based pharmacotherapy aims to activate the brain's homeostasis as the only available delivery system to re-calibrate complex neurophysiological participants in each of the temperament traits. In a positive feedback, a homeostasis-driven improvement of excessive temperament is expected to facilitate maturation of neocortical networks of cognition, most reliably in expert psychotherapy (Part I of this paper) and, ultimately, thereby improve top-down cortical control of subcortical affect reactivity. As an emerging concept informed by neuroscience and clinical research, mechanism-based pharmacotherapy has the potential to be superior to traditional symptom-based treatments. Such mechanism-based approach illustrates what the pharmacological treatment of Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) might look like.","737":"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a complex mental disorder whose neurobiology, including epi\/genetics, is still elusive. The South East European (SEE)-PTSD study has conducted an impressive amount of research on molecular mechanisms of PTSD. The results of the study make obvious the need of coordinated pluralism and transdisciplinary integrative approach in research on molecular mechanisms of PTSD and other stress-related disorders. The development of PTSD is influenced by a tangled and complicated interaction of inborn or acquired predisposition or vulnerability and environmental adversity which alters gene regulation producing effects on neurons and brain systems and inducing changes in cognition, emotion and behavior. There are still no identified objective biomarkers or tests which could confirm the trauma exposure or identify the real presence of PTSD. The puzzle how brain function enables the resilience to adversity and how brain dysfunctions lead to vulnerability to stress and development of PTSD and other stress-related disorders is still awaiting reliable explanation. Discovery of PTSD associated epi\/genetic factors might provide reliable markers for pathogenesis, what could result in getting novel therapeutics and\/or objective stratifying patients for research.","738":"Gender differences in the prevalence, experiences and presentations of mental illnesses are well-known and are reflected in research findings, clinical practice, society and popular culture.

The aim of this survey was to identify staff and patient attitudes to Springbank Ward. Previous research has not addressed the question of patient and staff perception of these therapeutic approaches. We used a qualitative open-ended semi-structured survey of staff and patients (n=2+4, respectively). We gathered information on the perception of the unit, staff, safety and the positive and negative aspects of the ward. Interview transcripts and participation notes were coded and categorised for emerging themes. The four main themes were: views on the unit: 'safe space', 'opportunity', 'community'; views on the programme: 'successful', 'skills-based', involving patients in their own recovery; views on staff: important part of the therapeutic process by delivering elements of dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT); views on safety: patients and staff feel safe in the context of positive risk-taking. The long-term therapeutic programme offered at Springbank is perceived positively by both patients and staff. Involving patients actively in their recovery remains a powerful tool. The delivery of DBT by nursing staff contributes significantly to the positive perception of the unit. Positive risk-taking is perceived to be a good and safe strategy. ","740":"Doctors play an important role in a multidisciplinary team, however therapeutic relationships are not limited to between a doctor and a patient. In Community Mental Health Teams, patients are allocated a care coordinator - usually a community psychiatric nurse or a social worker - and they usually become the healthcare provider the patient is most regularly in contact with. Similarly, a practice nurse in General Practice may be the healthcare professional a patient is most familiar with. In these instances, the patient-provider relationship may be stronger than the doctor-patient relationship. Non-doctor and patient relationships play an increasingly important role in improving the patient experience and contributing to information gathering, shared-decision making, and establishment and adherence to treatment plans. Care coordinators may be in a more superior position than doctors to accurately recognise the ongoing and changing needs of a person with mental illness. Patients value continuity of care, compassion, and mutual trust and respect: these qualities can potentially all be provided by any trained healthcare professional. In this paper, we will review the literature on the emerging role of the care coordinator and other healthcare professionals in the management of chronic mental illness in the community.","741":"A recent meta-analysis including data from 22 studies including 2.9 million patients found that anxiety and depression are more prevalent in patients with dry eye disease (DED) than in controls. DED is a common disorder of the tear film which can cause ocular irritation, foreign body sensation and visual disturbance. However there is often a great discrepancy between signs and symptoms of DED, which the symptoms often being more associated with non-ocular disorders such as depression and PTSD than to tear film parameters. In this way it could be considered as more of a psychiatric than ophthalmic complaint. DED and depression feedback on one another in a synergistic manner. Severity of DED is associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression. Treatment of DED could help reduce depression symptoms, but also effective management of depression could help alleviate symptoms of DED. Complicating this however is the evidence that SSRIs can exacerbate DED. This makes the management of these comorbidities more difficult, however there are putative therapeutic targets which may be a source of future treatments for DED-associated depression. In conclusion, it is clear that DED and depression are closely linked and influence one another in ways that drastically affect patients' lives. Collaboration between psychiatrists and ophthalmologists could be beneficial in the management of those with DED.","742":"The psychological and physiological interaction between anorexia and the pregnant state has a large intrapartum and postpartum impact on mother and baby. Current research has attempted to discern the short and long term effects of eating disorders (EDs) on pregnancy as well as mother and baby-related sequelae; however little is understood about which management strategies are likely to prove most successful in mitigating these risks. The incidence and effect of low pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) on obstetric outcomes, and possible health complications in the future child, has attracted widespread attention. Especially concerning is the fact that it has long been known that the incidence of EDs in women of childbearing age is not only the highest out of all age categories but also is on an increasing trajectory. This paper aims to highlight the recent evidence underpinning the management of pregnant women with EDs in the light of the discussed short and long term effects of the disorders on mother and baby. We shall focus on those women who have a previous diagnosis of an ED prior to being pregnant. Particular attention will be paid to those studies considering anorexia nervosa. We argue for the use of early intervention strategies for the management of pregnant women with eating disorders, and for the use of a multidisciplinary approach in the treatment of these patients with complex problems.","743":"Paternal Post Natal Depression (PPND), although becoming more prevalent, is still poorly recognised. Unfortunately, its effects and negative outcomes have not been as widely researched as that of maternal postnatal depression. PPND can affect the fathers parenting style and lead to a negative effect on their child's behaviour and social development. Furthermore, depressed fathers may feel unsupported and this can lead to problems with the marital relationship and be associated with concurrent maternal postnatal depression. Moreover, support services and interventional therapy come at a cost to the health service and therefore treating PPND can impact the economy. Identifying the effects PPND has is important as implementing reliable screening measures and better education may prevent negative outcomes.","744":"Schizophrenic patients have traditionally suffered from high rates of cardiovascular disease and early mortality. NICE guidelines suggest that several physical health measures be monitored regularly in these patients, and particularly those on antipsychotic medication, which has a wide side-effect profile that may potentiate the risk of cardiovascular disease and other comorbidities. This general practice audit aimed to determine the rates of physical health monitoring in primary care in patients on antipsychotic medication for over a year for psychotic symptoms or schizophrenia. The search was conducted in three different general practices in March 2019, yielding 19, 8 and 30 patients respectively, with a total of 57 patients. This audit aims to record and analyse rates of monitoring of a range of physical health measures recommended by NICE guidelines over the past year. The results demonstrated that physical health monitoring was poor amongst all the practices audited, especially that of prolactin and waist circumference. We recommend that these rates of monitoring be improved, through implementing templates or the delivery of targeted education to general practitioners and nurses.","745":"Communication is a huge difficulty in researching Deafness in psychiatry and in practically assessing and treating deaf patients.

Long-term relapse prevention in bipolar disorder is challenging, with a significant number of patients relapsing following the initial stabilisation of mood. Initial treatment of the condition is complex and usually occurs in secondary care. Whilst there is no known cure for bipolar disorder, several therapies have been found to be effective in both managing acute episodes and sustaining long-term remission. The key pharmacological therapies in bipolar disorder are lithium salts, antiepileptics and antipsychotics and these will be the focus of this review. This review seeks to outline the key common pharmacological therapies used in the treatment and relapse prevention of this condition. A MEDLINE search was performed, and the available literature was subsequently analysed, including meta-analyses, reviews and original clinical trials. Management strategies can be subdivided into treating acute presentations of mania and depression and maintaining long-term remission. The extensive side effect profile of several antipsychotics means that there are certain patient groups for whom they may be intolerable or contraindicated. Lithium emerges as a highly efficacious maintenance therapy but retains the burden of therapeutic drug monitoring. Antiepileptics play a crucial role in maintaining remission but are linked to serious, albeit rare, side effects. Despite the efficacy of the medications discussed in this article, their underlying mechanisms of action remain to be fully elucidated. Nonetheless, these key therapies continue to be essential tools in the management of bipolar disorder. ","747":"Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a rare monogenic disorder caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene.

However, psychiatric manifestations which mainly include mood disturbances have also been reported in CADASIL. Manic symptoms and bipolar disorders are rarely documented in CADASIL and existing reports generally lack detailed descriptions of the psychiatric evaluation. We discuss a case of Bipolar Affective Disorder (BD) in a British woman with a family history of CADASIL. This case provides insight into the diagnosis and management of BD as well as the possible underlying aetiologies that should be considered. The similarities between BD and CADASIL in terms of imaging, genetic, and therapeutic aspects raise the possibility of common dysfunctional pathways. BD in CADASIL may warrant greater consideration by both psychiatrists as well as non-psychiatric specialists and further studies are required to understand the pathological significance.","748":"Ketamine is an anaesthetic and analgesic agent that demonstrates the antidepressive effect in major depression. Several administrations routes, dosing schemas and esketamine are investigated in basic and clinical research with particular focus on treatment-resistant depression (TRD) where drug demonstrates its efficacy where very limited alternatives are available. The majority of ketamine studies in TRD treatment reported no serious adverse events regardless the administration route or regimen. However, the most commonly observed adverse events following ketamine administration in antidepressive doses include general, psychotomimetic, dissociative and hemodynamic ones. The side effects are mild or moderate, well-tolerated and transient. This paper discusses the risks regarding cardiovascular safety in MDD patients in short-term ketamine administration with particular focus on the effect on blood pressure and adverse drug reactions mitigation measures. The increase in systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure is dose-dependent and begins shortly after administration peaking at around 30 to 50 minutes with SBP and DBP rise from 10% to 50% above predose values and resolving at approximately 2 to 4 hours after the dose administration. These changes generally are primarily asymptomatic. The elevations in SBP and DBP are observed on each dosing day with multiple administration schema. The treatment with ketamine and esketamine is contradicted in subjects at risk of an increase in blood pressure or intracranial pressure. The current evidence indicates the blood pressure should be assessed prior to dosing with ketamine and hypertensive individuals shall receive effective lifestyle\/pharmacologic management prior to treatment. Blood pressure should be monitored after dose administration until blood pressure returns to acceptable levels. If blood pressure remains elevated acute blood pressure management shall be delivered. In patients experiencing symptoms of hypertensive crisis immediate emergency care must be provided. The unmet need for improved pharmacotherapies for TRD means the use of ketamine and esketamine is warranted therapeutic option in patients who fail to achieve a sustained remission of depressive symptoms with drugs with monoamine-based mechanisms of action. Adequate safety measures must be applied when using ketamine\/esketamine in TRD subjects with particular focus on somatic comorbidities as the transient drug effect on cardiovascular system is demonstrated and of clinical significance.","749":"Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is an interesting disorder in which depression should occur at a particular time of a year, each year and it should disappear at a specific time of the year. While the prevalence of SAD among generally healthy individuals is well known, the information about the prevalence of this disorder among the blind and visually impaired patients is very limited. The aim of the study was to investigate the prevalence of SAD among the blind and people with serious visual impairment in polish population. 250 blind or seriously visually impaired individuals and 258 healthy controls were assessed with the usage of Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ). In research group survey was conducted with the Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) technique. In control group the questionnaire was distributed via Internet.

The results revealed that among people suffering from SAD there is statistically significant difference in SPAQ scores between completely blind and seriously visually impaired people. The study shows that is the control group age is negatively correlated with score in SPAQ score, while in the study group age is positively correlated with SPAQ score. The data show that there is a difference in occurrence of SAD between men and women. The study has shown a significant difference in occurrence of SAD between study and control groups.

It is considered as one of the most important predictors of success, quality of relationships, and overall happiness. Dynamically changing environment of the youth and young adults in recent years may influence their EI development, affecting their lives significantly. The purpose of this study was to analyse the way how the Internet is used by high school students, to determine the amount of time they spend on the Internet, identify the level of EI and to explore if there is any correlation between those factors. 1450 high school students from Katowice, at the age from 18 to 21 years took part in an anonymous survey consisting of three parts: The Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire - Short Form (TEIQue-SF), Internet Addiction Test and authorial test giving information about the way of spending time online. The questionnaires were collected from May 2018 to January 2019. 1.03% of the respondents fulfilled the Internet addiction criteria. Students at risk for addiction (33.5%) turned out to be a larger group. A statistically significant correlation between TEIQue-SF and Internet Addiction Test score (P&lt;0.0001, r=-0.3308) was observed. Another significant correlation was found between TEIQue-SF score and amount of time spend on the Internet (p&lt;0.0001, r=-0.162).

We assumed that chronic disease like Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), when producing the long-term distress, may greatly influence sexual functioning. The aim of this study was to determine whether the severity of IBS influences sexual functions of women and take into consideration other factors like Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) comorbidity and duration of IBS. Study patients were recruited by contacting IBS patients at Gastroenterology Ward of Clinical University Centre in Katowice. The survey consisted of 3 parts. The first part were socio-demographic questions. The second part was polish translation of Female Sexuality Functions Index (FSFI) questionnaire. The third part consisted of questions about the patient condition, pharmacotherapy and Irritable Bowel Syndrome Severity Score (IBSSS) questionnaire. 307 women were included in the study and completed the questionnaire. 143 participants were diagnosed with IBS. The mean age of participants was 27 (IQR=23-33). 29% of the patients (n=41) had severe, 47% (n=68) moderate and 24% (n=34) mild IBS. The prevalence of sexual dysfunctions was greater in women with IBS (48%) than in healthy control group (23%) (p&lt;0.001). The median of FSFI was: 30.1 (26.3-32.8) for healthy control group, 30 (23.5-32.6) for mild IBS, 26.2 (22.2-31.6) for moderate and 24.4 (20.1-28.9) for severe. IBS decreases all domains of women sexual activity. Severity of sexual dysfunctions relate to intensity of IBS symptoms. All physicians treating IBS-patients should take sexual dysfunctions into their clinical consideration. ","753":"Bipolar depression (BD) is among the most severe psychiatric disorders. A significant number of patients do not achieve an entirely symptom-free state and experience residual sub-syndromal depression. Most of the treatment options approved for bipolar depression give no rapid symptom improvement.

Due to its unique way of action, ketamine seems to be crucial for the treatment of anhedonia. This review paper aims to provide an overview of the efficacy of ketamine infusions in bipolar depression with a focus on anhedonia Literature suggests that intravenous ketamine 0.5 mg\/kg over 40 min weekly could be useful in the treatment of bipolar depression with prominent anhedonia, but there is still a small number of studies that examine the efficacy of ketamine infusions in BD.

Although noncompliance represents a serious concern in long-term schizophrenia treatment, a detailed information on the factors that impair compliance is still limited. The present study aims to assess the factors related to noncompliance with antipsychotics agents, in long-term treated chronic paranoid schizophrenia patients. Two groups of such patients (total number n=162) were analyzed and compared: 1). patients with symptomatic remission on haloperidol (n=32), clozapine (n=40) or olanzapine (n=45), and 2). drug resistant patients (n=45). The mean duration of the disease was 19.3 years. Altogether, in our patient sample, a better drug attitude was found in the olanzapine and clozapine groups. Our findings have also revealed that worse attitude toward antipsychotics correlated with an earlier onset of schizophrenia, younger patient age, shorter duration of the disease, higher burden of symptoms, treatment with a typical antipsychotics, and higher severity of akathisia. Our results suggest that detecting factors that influence the patient's attitude toward medications might be helpful for designing targeted educational strategies in chronic schizophrenia patients (particularly those with the high risk of noncompliance), and further trials are warranted to explore this topic. ","756":"Poland is a democratic, sovereign state in Central Europe, member of the European Union. The healthcare in Poland is delivered to patients mainly through a public contributor called the National Health Fund, supervised by the Ministry of Health. The care for people with disabilities, including intellectual disabilities in Poland is coordinated by the Governmental Program on Activities for People with Disabilities and their Integration with the Society. The system of care for people with intellectual disability in Poland is constitutionally guaranteed. The aim of this review was to analyze the different forms of care for persons suffering from intellectual disability and mental health problems in our country. Analysis of available documents on the policy and organizations of systems of services for this group of patients was performed. Non-governmental organizations play an important role in taking care of people with disabilities. In Poland there are no special psychiatric services dedicated for patients with intellectual disabilities. The comorbid psychiatric disorders are treated in general psychiatric wards or hospitals or in outpatient settings. Offenders with intellectual disabilities in the penitentiary system are referred to therapeutic settings in wards for convicts with non-psychotic mental disorders and intellectual disabilities. Training of medical students and young doctors offers only very limited basic knowledge on intellectual disability within psychiatry curriculum. The is no separate specialty in mental health in intellectual disability within psychiatry. The main conclusion of this review is that the specialist working with persons suffering from intellectual disabilities in Poland face many challenges regarding the need to introduces positive changes in this field. ","757":"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a recurrent, incapacitating psychiatric illness which will be the second most disabling disease worldwide by the year 2020. There is a rising promise in a N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, ketamine, which may be used in the treatment of resistant depression. Many of the studies are in favor of the drug, even in single dose application, with effects appearing in minutes to hours from administration. However, there is a need to evaluate the benefits and risks regarding psychomimetic, psychiatric, neurologic, and cognitive adverse effects of ketamine administration. The most distressing symptoms which appear most frequently during ketamine administration are dissociative symptoms, which can be quantified as a CNS adverse drug reaction. Results generally show that a single infusion of ketamine is efficacious and well-tolerated, while dissociative symptoms tend to abate within 2 hours after ketamine administration. As studies show single doses of ketamine should be definitely considered as an option in TRD patients with\/without suicidal thoughts, even though it could not provide remission, or the effect could be temporary, but improving patients' quality of life by reducing depressive symptomatology should be a major asset while considering this particular procedure, particularly in inpatients.","758":"Environment and culture are shown to be an important factor influencing characteristics of psychotic symptoms. Content of hallucinations and delusions is a projection of internal processes on external world. Religion plays a central role to lives of many people, but in schizophrenia religious experience and spirituality is confounded by psychotic symptoms. The aim of this study was to find how content of hallucinations and delusions interact with cultural conditions, that were changing over the decades. 100 of case histories from 2012 were randomly selected. From the medical record, content of hallucinations and delusion was extracted and categorized. Data from 2012 was compared with previous study by the authors, obtaining perspective of 80 years of history in the one hospital. Religious content of delusions and hallucinations appeared in 26% of patients. Diversity of the religious and spiritual themes in schizophrenia has been gradually decreasing. Many minor religious entities and figures such as \"saints\" and \"angels\" disappeared in 2012. Although, occurrence of contact with God and other religious figures was similar as in previous years, number of \"visions\" abruptly decreased. All of the religious content was culture-specific. Religious topics express general plasticity over a time, following cultural changes in society. ","759":"Major depressive disorder is one of the most important psychiatric issues worldwide, with important prevalence of treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Non-monoaminergic agents are currently in the spotlight. Objective was to explore for information about mechanisms of action of ketamine, its connections with copper and possible importance for TRD treatment. There are at least few possible pathways for ketamine action in depression in which copper and other divalent ions may show a vital role. There is urgent need for more studies to gather information about correlation between ketamine, copper and antidepressive features of these agents.","760":"In the literature we can find evidence that sex hormones are involved the alterations of cognition in schizophrenic patients. Another factor, which may have an impact on cognitive domains in this clinical group inflammatory processes. The objective of this review was to explore studies, in which the role of both immunological factors and sex hormones on cognitive functions in schizophrenia are analyzed. The search of papers covering this topic in PubMed and Google Scholar was performed. Endocrine factors like: testosteron, estrogen, as well as immunomodulatory are observed to play a role in cognitive functioning in schizophrenia. More studies are necessary to confirm these possible co-relations. ","761":null,"762":"The present retrospective case-control study is aimed at evaluating the presence of childhood traumatic factors and the difficulty in regulating emotions, within a sample of patients with eating disorders compared to the group of healthy controls. We included 65 people assessed for eating disorders, 40 patients and 25 healthy controls, who were given two tests: the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ-SF) to investigate the presence of traumatic events and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) to assess the emotional regulation. People with eating disorders showed higher average scores, and therefore greater severity than the control group, in all the domains explored, both considering traumatic experiences and emotional dysregulation. The domain emotional neglect showed the closest correlation with eating disorders (average scoring 15.9 vs 9.9 of healthy controls), followed by emotional abuse (12.2 vs 7.8), physical neglect (8.2 vs 6.6), physical abuse (8.3 vs 6.6) and sexual abuse (7.2 vs 5.6). In the same way, the emotional dysregulation was greater among people with eating disorder than healty controls, concerning every items explored by DERS, as clarity (average scoring 14.8 vs 11.4), awareness (17.1 vs 11.7), goals (16.3 vs 12.9), strategy (22.0 vs 14.7), non acceptance (17.4 vs 12.1) and impulse (16.5 vs 11.4). Childhood traumatic experiences and emotional dysregulation result significantly higher in people with eating disorders than healthy controls.

The purpose of this article is to increase curiosity and broaden the reflection on the use of humour in the psychotherapeutic relationship. The first part is dedicated to a short review of the main theories on the origins of laughter. The second part will examine those studies reporting a beneficial effect of humour on physical well-being, while the third part will review those studies describing how humour can help improve psychological well-being. The fourth part will further explore the clinical effects of humour in the therapeutic relationship. Both the positive and negative effects of humour in the therapeutic relationship will be discussed. In addition, some brief examples are included.","764":"A link between abnormalities in circadian rhythms and the development of eating disorders was extensively hypothesized, mainly in consideration of the influence of the circadian clock on eating behavior. The present review is aimed at summarizing the evidence about biological rhythms disruptions in eating disorders, possibly clarifying their impact on the psychopathological profile of such patients. Electronic database MEDLINE\/PubMed\/Index Medicus was systematically searched for original articles examining the prevalence of circadian rhythms disruptions in eating disorders (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder). Studies included in the review confirmed the hypothesis of a high prevalence of circadian disruptions in eating disorders. The analyzed research mainly focused on sleep-wake cycle, rest-activity abnormalities and hormonal secretion, whilst literature about other circadian rhythms was scanty. Altered biological rhythms presented higher association with specific psychopathological features, but such relationship was assessed in few studies. Circadian rhythms disruptions were confirmed to be relevant aspects in the context of eating disorders. Further research is needed in order to clarify the role of biological rhythms in such illnesses, in the attempt to address adjunctive treatment strategies with the possible focus of circadian abnormalities. ","765":"Differentiating Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) from Bipolar Disorder (BD) represents a very difficult challenge for clinicians. Dysphoria could be a possible key to differentiate these disorders. We currently define dysphoria as a complex and disorganized emotional state with proteiform phenomenology, characterized by a multitude of symptoms. Among them irritability, discontent, interpersonal resentment and surrender prevail. These dimensions can be detected using the Neapen Dysphoria Scale - Italian version (NDS-I). Dysphoria role in BPD has been highlighted by the recent theorization of the Interpersonal Dysphoria Model, according to which dysphoria could represent the \"psychopathological organizer\" of the BPD. On the other side, dysphoria role in BD has not yet been established. This is simply considered as an aspect, and not fundamental, of the symptomatology characterizing BD, especially in mixed states patients. The phenomenological analysis of the dimensional spectrum of dysphoria within BPD and DB could provide a valuable aid in the differential diagnosis between BPD and BD. The aim of this paper is to verify if the dimensional spectrum of dysphoria differs between Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and Bipolar Disorder Spectrum (BD) through an observational comparative study SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In this study, 65 adult patients, males and females between the ages of 18 and 65, were enrolled from the Psychiatric Service of the Santa Maria della Misericordia Hospital in Perugia (PG), Italy, from January 1st 2018 to April 30th 2019. We have formed 2 groups. A BPD group composed of 33 patients (19 female patients, representing approximately 57.6% of the sample) and a BD group composed of 32 patients (18 Female patients, representing approximately 56.2% of the sample). Patient's comorbid with BD and BPD have been excluded from the study. After a preliminary assessment to exclude organic and psychiatric comorbidity, and after at least 72 hours from hospitalization, we administered them the Neapen Dysphoria Scale - Italian Version (NDS-I), a specific dimensional test for dysphoria. Starting from the dataset, with the aid of the statistical program SPSS 20, we have carried out a comparison between disorders groups selected and their NDS-I total score and subscales (irritability, discontent, interpersonal resentment, surrender); For this we have used the Mann-Whitney U test, a nonparametric test with 2 independent samples, by setting a significance level p&lt;0.05. This study allowed us to explore and analyze dysphoria dimensions expressions in BPD and BD. Despite the small sample analyzed, the results show a significant different dimensional spectrum expression of the dysphoria between the two disorders. In particular, Irritability and Interpersonal Resentment dimensions show greater interest in BPD than BD spectrum. Further studies with a larger and stratified sample are needed to confirm these results. ","766":"Mixed states are often underdiagnosed, with important consequences in terms of worsening prognosis, frequent admission to the hospital, higher suicide risk and poorer quality of life. For this reason, we analyzed retrospective data from patients admitted in the Psychiatric Hospital from January 1st to April 30th 2019 to identify clinical features of the mixed states by administering the G.T. MSRS scale. Within the 90 subjects of the sample, the large majority (75%) met criteria for mixed state. Of those only 16 were discharged with a diagnosis of Affective Disorder, however 26 (30.9%) were prescribed a mood stabilizer. This study shows that there is a high prevalence of mixed states in the inpatient unit admission, which is demonstrated both from the prescription of mood stabilizers, and confirmed by the diagnosis of mixed states rated with the scale. The scale can be a useful instrument to detect early in the course if the hospitalization the presence of mixed state, in order to guide a tailored psychopharmacological treatment, and improve prognosis.","767":"Several studies highlight that many students feel negative feelings about mathematical learning and that the mathematics anxiety seems to play a central role in mathematical performance. More specifically students with higher level of maths anxiety are less efficient in mathematical tasks. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between specific mathematics anxiety as assessed by AMAS, trait and state anxiety as assessed by STAI-Y, and mathematical skills assessed through the ABCA tests in a sample of 83 adolescent students (78.3% males) without diagnosis of dyscalculia and cognitive disorder attending their first year of secondary school. Results showed that 38% of the students referred high level of maths anxiety. Independent T-test revealed that female students referred a higher level of maths anxiety as well as of trait and state anxiety than male ones, while there were no differences in the mathematics performance. The simultaneous multivariate linear regression analysis showed that maths anxiety was influenced by trait anxiety and in its turn has an impact on the high level mathematics performances (i.e. arithmetic facts). Understanding the relationships between maths anxiety and maths learning and performance may have relevant implications in clinical, educational and didactic practice.","768":"Vesico- sphincter and bowel dysfunction have been frequently detected in Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients, but to date no consistent information exist on adults affected by the disease. We evaluated the prevalence and types of bladder and bowel disfunction (BBD) in young and adult patients affected by ASD. Twenty- seven adults and 20 children\/teens with ASD and a matched group of typically developing subjects were enrolled. Daily pads use and episodes of urinary incontinence (UI) were recorded in a 3- day voiding diary. Patients underwent also the measurement of post-void urinary residual volume and 3- day bowel diary. In addition, type and duration of the pharmacological agents assumed by the patients were accurately recorded. Any type of UI was observed in 85.1% of adults and in 90% of children\/teens. In adults, nocturnal enuresis (NE, 62.9%) and diurnal intermittent UI (37%) were the most frequently observed bladder dysfunction while in children\/ teens were NE (75%) and diurnal continuous UI (40%). In all patients was demonstrated a significant relationship between urinary symptoms and pharmacological agents, particularly NE and clotiapine (p&lt;0.004) and periciazine (p&lt;0.008). Young and adult patients with ASD present with a high prevalence of BBD and concomitant antipsychotic medications could to play a contribution in induction and\/or maintaining of BBD. ","769":"Music is a very important factor in everyday life, involving mood, emotions and memories. The effect of music on the brain is very debated. Certainly, music activates a complex network of neurones in auditory areas, mesolimbic areas, cerebellum and multisensory areas. In particular, music exerts its effects on the brain of patients with epilepsy, having a dichotomous influence: it can either be seizure-promoting in musicogenic epilepsy or antiepileptic. Several studies have shown that seizure-prone neural networks may be stimulated by certain periodicities while other frequencies may prevent seizure activity. There are a lot of data in the literature about the so-called \"Mozart effect\" (Rauscher et al. 1993). In previous studies we observed that in institutionalized subjects with severe\/profound intellectual disability and drug-resistant epilepsy, a systematic music listening protocol reduced the frequency of seizures in about 50% of the cases. In this study we are conducting a survey on the observation of what happens to the brain of patients suffering from drug-resistant epilepsy through electroencephalographic investigations, brain MRI and behavioural analysis before and after six months of listening to Mozart music (Sonata K.448). The first step is to present the data of the first patient under investigation.","770":"Individuals with multiple disabilities can have a wide range of characteristics depending on the combination and severity of the disabilities, such as intellectual disability, mobility issues, sensorial impairment, language issues and brain injury. New technologies can help therapists find an alternative way to engage and interact with clients by opening a communication window and starting to build the therapeutic relationship. The need to use more customized technological tools led us to develop the Painteraction system, an intuitive tool based on Augmented Reality that allows clients to be immersed in their own images. Just by moving their bodies individuals are able to make drawings and receive visual feedback, both from themselves and their therapists, as it appears on the screen. The pilot testing of Painteraction was performed on 21 inpatients at Istituto Serafico (Assisi, Italy) with severe\/multiple disabilities in order to explore and assess reaction and responsiveness in a semi-structured art therapy setting. The sample was formed by 14 males and 7 females (N=21) between the ages of 7 and 35. All participants attended three twenty-minute individual art therapy sessions which were approximately one week apart. Through direct and indirect (video recordings) observation of the sessions, it appeared that the specific Augmented Reality tool introduced in the art therapy setting was easily accepted by most of the clients involved and generally allowed the development of an interpersonal therapist-client relationship. The present study therefore gave us the opportunity to test new digital tools in the challenging setting of severe\/multiple disabilities and observe the huge potential of new media to empower clients to express themselves and their creativity, and ultimately overcome mental and physical barriers. We propose that Augmented Reality tools are particularly well-suited to art therapy and create an equally suitable therapeutic environment to address specific client needs.","771":"Complex disability is very difficult to manage. It usually subtends very serious clinical pictures, because it affect several body systems, or because it is associated with intellectual disability and behavioral disorders. Often affected patients are unable to communicate their basic needs. All these factors combine to make the management of these patients very complex, and those who care for them realize how important it is to find a way to detect their state and to identify their potential capabilities. Developing appropriate rehabilitation programs for these patients requires additional effort and an assessment capacity that is as objective as possible. Few scales cited in the literature are capable of evaluating these aspects in patients with complex disabilities, among them the Barthel Index (Mahoney &amp; Barthel 1965) and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior scale II (Sparrow et al. 2005). The majority of these scales often tend to depict the data regarding the disease to a degree of severity that precludes adequate individual rehabilitation program development. There is a dire need for a more appropriate instrument, an observational grid that is capable of identifying the potential of this patient population and evaluate the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions provided. The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of rehabilitation interventions in a group of patients with IQ &lt;32 (determined by the Vineland II scale) using an evaluation tool created ad hoc called D-Rubrics, designed with the intent to identify \"micro-differences\" between baseline (T0) and post-rehabilitation (T1). The goal is part of a more long term-term objective which involves developing an effective assessment tool for patients with complex disabilities. Such an assessment tool should be practical, easy to administer and useful in both clinical and research settings.","772":"\"Before convincing the intellectual part of the mind it is necessary to touch and prepare the heart\", an aphorism by Blaise Pascal (Vozza 1995), refers to one of the most important functions of strategic training, not only being successful in making communicative messages correctly and rationally understood, but also involving its addressee, above all by making one enter into emotional syntony with the communicative content. To understand the precious wealth of knowledge that has over time brought the necessary skills to do strategic training, it is necessary to find its roots by taking a step back in time. It is necessary to go as far as the fifth century BC, with Protagoras and its persuasive efficacy, with a rapid historical excursus passing by Aristotle and his Sophistic communication techniques to arrive at about 2000 years later, passing through social psychology, up to the Palo Alto strategic school. Among its various activities, the Genius Academy Centre for Research and Psychological Studies has decided to push two strategic training projects aiming to increase the level of well-being perceived by the addressee and encouraging the desired change. One of the two strategic training projects, A \"Journey\" in a journey, conceived by the writer, started in 2013. The educational and therapeutic value are amplified by optimizing the suggestions and stimuli of the journey. Another strategic training project for future aeronautical professionals, which gives a great contribution to the traditional technical training, is an innovative psychological programme specifically designed to prepare, not only for technical operational challenges, but also for numerous psychological challenges deriving from working in a particular environment such as the airport. It is specifically designed to study and improve the travel experience of people in airport transit and aims to raise the level of traveller's well-being, through a series of highly innovative interventions in specifically provided areas with the use of digital reality in coping and helping with anxiety and fear of flying.","773":"Not only philosophers, but also artists and scientists have always struggled to find a universal definition of beauty. Not even Darwin could find an answer to the question: are there any parameters of beauty that we can apply to every species. Nobody can give a valid definition for the perception of beauty in others. Can a definition in subjective terms be achieved? If I say something is beautiful, it only means that it is beautiful for me, but it does not mean that is necessarily beautiful for everyone else. Beauty is a subjective experience, but it is not only a perceptive experience! According to the Treccani Dictionary of Italian Language, beauty can be defined as: something capable of pleasing the soul through the senses and become an object worthy of contemplation. Developmental biologists say that when people talk about how beautiful a person is, they tend to highlight those qualities that make them more or less attractive. These qualities can be, for example, if and how much I look like their father or mother. Does this mean there can be universal parameters of beauty for the human species? According to Professor Semir Zeki, there are universal parameters of beauty and the easiest way to define them is in a negative way. This means that whoever has his eyes in a different position, compared to where the eyes are placed in a nation or race, cannot be called beautiful. According to this, could there be a model of beauty in our society? Today's society gives a considerable importance to appearance, it is even thought that being \"beautiful\" can achieve happiness, love and success. Mass media show icons of perfection and ideals of beauty almost unattainable and makes us to believe that achieving them would make us feel fulfilled; therefore underestimating other values such as happiness, family, friendship and beauty. There is less and less space for self-acceptance and developing other qualities, whereas we invest more into treatments of various kinds to change our body, considering it as an object we can manipulate, or as a tool to achieve goals. Particularly young people, today, are conditioned by the myth of beauty and by the canons imposed by newspapers, TV and the media, which demands virtual beauty without originality. According to this canon, women must always be slim but firm and sinuous, with flowing bleached hair, perfect make-up, smooth skin, full lips and long nails. On the other hand, men are forced to resemble the football players: muscular, but not too much, without a belly and marked abdominals muscles, tall, well-shaved, fragrant, or even shaving their whole body. According to Charmet: \"We live in a continuous casting, with boys feeling inadequate and ugly\". Adolescence is then considered a period full enthusiasm but also of torment, such as long struggles in front of the mirror with the different ways of \"decorating\" a suddenly new body. This is a particularly fertile ground for the onset of pathologies such as depression, dysmorphophobias, eating disorders and other pathologies. They become 'mutants', because they change and adapt to the current fashion; nowadays these changes affect not only women, but also men. Pathologies are also in the rise among increasingly younger people, aged 10 to 20 years old. In addition, there are new pathologies, such as orthorexia (the obsession for healthy eating) or drunkorexia (a combination of fasting\/binge eating with alcohol abuse). Often, these are associated with other psychiatric disorders or serious physical complications. However, only a small percentage of people suffering from these conditions ask for help.","774":"Psychopathy is a personality disorder defined by a specific set of behaviours and personality traits evaluated as negative and socially harmful. The modern conception of Psychopathy was introduced by Clerckley in \"Mask of Sanity\" (1941), and refined by Hare with the construction of the PCL (1980, 1991), a gold standard instrument for the evaluation of the disorder. Manipulation, deception, grandeur, emotional superficiality, lack of empathy and remorse, impulsive and irresponsible lifestyle, persistent violation of social norms and expectations (Cleckley 1976, Hare 2003) are some behavioural aspects that characterize psychopathic subjects. With this work we intend to study in depth the causes, the traits, in particular the so-called callous-unemotional and risk factors that lead a teenager to become a psychopathic subject. The diagnostic tools useful for the assessment and for the possibilities of intervention that can be put into practice will also be described.","775":"People, who assist patients with chronic health problems for work, voluntary or for family reasons, may be affected by burnout. This is defined as an excessive reaction to stress caused by one's environment that may be characterized by feelings of emotional and physical exhaustion, coupled with a sense of frustration and failure. A person who assists a suffering person, beyond the professional role, is indicated generally by the term \"caregiver\". The definition of Burnout in families is fairly recent, because the psychology of trauma has ignored a large segment of traumatized and disabled subjects (family and other assistants of \"suffering people\") unwittingly, for a long time. The burnout of secondary stress is due to one's empathic ability, actions trough disengagement, and a sense of satisfaction from helping to relieve suffering. Figley (1995) claims that being a member of a family or other type of intimate or bonded interpersonal relationship, one feels the others' pain. Closely associated with the suffering of the family caregiver is the concept of compassion fatigue, defined as a state of exhaustion and disfunction-biologically, psychologically, and socially - as a result of prolonged exposure to compassion stress and all that it evokes. In families, this can be the cause of serious conflicts and problems, quarrels, verbal and physical aggression, and broken relationships. The intervention on families requires practice and effectiveness approaches performed by experienced professionals. Some approaches focus more specifically, such as those that adopt a cognitive\/behavioural technique with direct exposure, implosion methods, various drug treatments and family group psychotherapy. One of the most common models of intervention is based on the principle that the observation unit for the understanding of the disorder is not the single individual but the relationship between individuals.","776":"The notion of \"mixity\" of the dysphoric phases of the bipolarity includes the most insidious symptoms of the bipolar spectrum of mood disorders: the overlapping between depression-restlessness-irritability-grief-tension-anxiety can cause worsening of the mood disorders and in the most acute phases may cause increased risk of major behavioural disruption including murder and suicide. The early utilization of the rating scale on mixed states, \"GT-MSRS\", which can demonstrate the level of \"mixity\" of the mood disorder, can prevent this.","777":null,"778":"Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID), at the cross roads of eating and feeding disorders, is sometimes called an \"umbrella diagnosis\" as it covers a certainly large and rather heterogeneous list of eating symptoms. It came with the DSM5 (2013) but still, there are no clear guidelines re diagnosis and treatment. Through this case, we aim to report not only a presentation of ARFID, but also how this relatively new and emerging diagnostic category has been identified and managed on a Pediatric Ward, in a General Hospital. This study reports the case of a 12y old girl Irish girl with ARFID treated by a multi-disciplinary team on a Pediatric Ward in a general hospital. A literature review regarding ARFID was concomitantly carried on, in order to consider the current therapeutic options recommended. 3 admissions on a pediatric Ward were necessary for this patient with ARFID, who was successfully managed with a partial hospitalization model, Family Based Treatment (FBT) and Mirtazapine. The dynamic around the management of this condition is the occasion to discuss the other therapeutic options suggested these days, and more specifically the different pharmacological molecules that have also been used in young patients with ARFID and the importance of involving a multi-disciplinary team. ","779":"A reformation of psychiatry was set up in Belgium with the establishment of mobile crisis teams. We performed a retrospective analysis of the patients referred to the mobile team \"Pharos\" in the period between December 2013 and December 2018. The number of patients is growing over the years and the most common referral reasons are suicidal thoughts and depressive mood. We have a high percentage of inclusions, maybe because the main referrers are GPs. Alcohol withdrawal at home is feasable and safe. Many psychiatric crisis situations can be managed at home with support of mobile teams, but further research is needed to provide evidence on outcome and cost effectiveness. ","780":"We wanted to investigate the patient's expectations on the general practitioner's (GP) responsibilities in screening and follow up of disturbed eating behaviour. Then, we looked for remediation for some of the mentioned shortcomings in family medicine. We also examined if online aid (offered by the non-profit organisation \"Eetexpert.be\") is already known and used. Anonymous patient questionnaires were gathered at 4 treatment centres for eating disorders or were collected with help of the Flemish patients organisation for eating disorders (Vlaamse Vereniging Anorexia Nervosa en Boulimia Nervosa). Later, online enquiries were sent to Flemish GPs. Out of 123 patients responding to the questionnaire, 44 found their GP to have had an important supportive role in their healing process. Active listening and targeted referral were among the most appreciated interventions by those patients. 71 GPs replied the online enquiry. Only 1 out of 5 knew about the free online assistance of \"Eetexpert.be\". Responders suggested several additional barriers to care. In Flanders there is a contrast between expectations and needs of patients on one hand compared to the services provided by GPs on the other. Reassuringly, all responding physicians were open to more education and support regarding eating disorder treatment.

Many researches show interest in measuring this impact using generic instruments that unfortunately are not specifically oriented toward bariatric or surgery patients. The BODY-Q is a new patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument designed to measure patient perceptions of weight loss and\/or body contouring. In this article, we describe the methods used to translate and culturally adapt the French version of the BODY-Q. We followed the recommendation for translation process established by the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcome Research (ISPOR) and the World Health Organisation (WHO). This process included two forward translations, one backward translation, a review by a panel of expert and cognitive debriefing interviews with patient. Our aim was to ensure a conceptual and culturally valid translation. This translation process led to a conceptually and culturally equivalent French version of the Body-Q. Backward translation comparison to the English original version led to the identification of 16 differences necessitating re-translation. The expert panel offered support to identify inadequate expressions and proposed changes to the translations. The cognitive debriefing interviews with 15 patients contributed to minor changes in the translation. This thorough method of translation and cultural adaptation allowed us to develop a conceptually and culturally valid French translation of the BODY-Q. ","783":"Teenage pregnancies occur frequently in developing countries and are associated with social issues, including poverty, lower levels of health and educational attainment. Although frequent in European countries in the 20th century today, teenage pregnancies account for only 4% of first children. These pregnancies are usually unplanned and they are considered a vulnerability factor during the pregnancy and the postnatal period, both for the mother and the child. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the evolution of mothers and children of teenage pregnancies, several years after childbirth and to identify factors which may protect or increase the patient's vulnerability. We conducted a retrospective search in our patient database in order to identify all teenage pregnancies between 2010-2014 at CHU Brugmann Hospital. Outcome date data were obtained from the medical files. Mothers were contacted by phone and asked to complete our questionnaire which focused on maternal and paediatric care; and infant and child development after hospitalization. Out of the 342 patients identified, 84 patients were contactable and only 72 patients completed the full questionnaire. With only 4 patients originating from Belgium, our population was largely immigrant. Despite this, obstetrical, maternal and paediatric outcomes were remarkably favorable when compared to other published studies. Our study suggests that some migrant teenage mothers may have a dual advantage in terms of the wealth of a developed country in which have settled and the low social stigma related to their country of origin. More research needs to be done to further investigate this hypothesis.

The purpose of this literature review is to examine current situation regarding asylum seekers' psychiatric healthcare. This research was conducted using a keyword search on Medline, PubMed and Google Scholar. The literature on the management of the mental health of asylum seekers focuses on the issue of post-traumatic stress disorder. There is little data on other forms of mental illness in this population. The prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder among asylum seekers is higher than in the general population and its clinical expression is varied and often complex because it involves various vulnerability factors. Guidelines for post-traumatic stress disorder recommend cognitive behavioral therapy with, in some cases, the use of pharmacotherapy. Given the specificities of the asylum seekers' population, in many cases it is not possible to set up such therapy immediately. Asylum seekers face a number of challenges in accessing mental healthcare. Management of the mental health of asylum seekers requires special attention and guidelines for the general population are not directly applicable to this specific population. The literature focuses on the issue of post-traumatic stress disorder. This review was not able to analyse the state of existing care offer in Belgium for managing the mental health of asylum seekers and the care pathways they take. ","785":"Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome (CHS) is characterized by cyclic vomiting and compulsive need to take hot showers in the context of chronic cannabis use. Physicians' lack of knowledge of CHS often results in a diagnostic delay of several years. The purpose of this article is to describe CHS in order to enable physicians, and more particularly psychiatrists, to diagnose it as quickly as possible and thus avoid unnecessary additional invasive examinations. Bibliographic search for scientific articles published between 2004 and 2019 in the Cochrane, Medline, PubMed, and Psycinfo databases. Key words used were \"hyperemesis\", \"cannabis\", \"cannabinoid\". CHS is associated with chronic cannabis use and typically manifests as incoercible cyclical vomiting, diffuse abdominal pain, and relief of symptoms by taking hot showers. Patients suffering from CHS generally visit emergency departments very regularly and undergo numerous additional examinations, both invasive and unnecessary. Since no organic cause can explain these symptoms, these patients are referred to the psychiatry department. The only curative treatment is the complete cessation of cannabis use. CHS is an under-diagnosed pathology because it is little known to physicians. This syndrome has unique clinical characteristics. Early recognition of CHS avoids repeated visits to the emergency room and unnecessary follow-up examinations. ","786":"Nowadays, anxiety disorders are becoming more and more important in our population. And if there is one category of people more vulnerable to this problem, it is the teenagers. In addition, more and more children and teenagers are diagnosed with an IQ greater than 130, causing all the stress and questions that it generates. In this project, we are comparing two groups of adolescents, one with an IQ over 130, the other with an IQ less than 130. We are wondering if there is any difference between these groups, in terms of phobia and other psychopathologies. A sample of 35 teenagers, from 12 to 16 years old, separated in two groups (IQ over 130 and IQ below 130), fulfilled the following questionnaires: the School Rehabilitation Assessment Scale-Revised (SARS-R), the \"Family Adaptability and Cohesiveness Evaluation Scale III\" (FACES III), and the \"Kiddie- SADS-lifetime\" (K-SADS-PL), and a social data collection questionnaire. At the end of this study, we can retain the following relevant elements: adolescents with IQs greater than 130 are statistically more likely to be the eldest siblings (Cochran Test F=9.159, p=0.010). They do not develop more phobias, but are more shy (t=4.375, p=0.036) than the control population. These high-potential and shy teenagers have a whole list of commonalities, such as being easily irritable, being easily distracted, ect... They have fewer friends in real life (t=2.255, p=0.033), fewer virtual friends (t=4.346, p=0.000) and fewer virtual relationships (t=2.431, p=0.021). Their families are very cohesive (Test t=0.004). There is no significant role of the socio-professional class of parents playing in the value of the IQ of their children (t=4.667, p=0.323). To conclude, being a teenager and having an IQ greater than 130 is not always a pleasure. Our results showed us that the majority of these young people consider themselves as shy, unsure of themselves and claim to have many fears. This is evidence of an increased anxiety component compared to the control sample. It seems important to insist on the need to be able and to know how to identify these young people as soon as possible, in order to propose appropriate therapeutic management. ","787":"Psychiatric disorders may be correlated with a low-grade systemic inflammation but the origin of this inflammatory response remains unclear and both genetics and environmental factors seems to be concerned. Recent researches observed that gut microbiota seems to have an impact on the brain and immune processes. We review recent literature to a better understanding of how microbiota interacts with brain, immunity and psychiatric disorders. We search on Pubmed, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES and Sciencedirect articles with the keywords \"gastrointestinal microbiota\" and \"mental disorders\" or \"psychological stress\". We showed links between gut microbiota and brain-gut axis regulation, immune and endocrine system activity, neurophysiological changes, behavior variations and neuropsychiatric disorders. Communications between brain and gut are bidirectional via neural, endocrine and immune pathway. Microbiota dysbiosis and increase gut permeability with subsequent immune challenges seems to be the source of the chronic mild inflammation associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. Repeated immune or stress events early in life may lead to neurodevelopmental disorders or sickness behavior later in life. Psychological stress impact gut microbiota with subsequent immune activation leading to neurodevelopmental disorders or sickness behavior and altering neurophysiology and reactivity to stress or lifestyle. ","788":"Mobius syndrome is characterized by a bilateral congenital paralysis of the facial and abducens nerves which leaves the subject with an expressionless \"mask-like\" face. Based on a literature review and a case discussion of an adult patient with Mobius syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder, initially undiagnosed and confused with a psychotic disorder, we will discuss the influence of Mobius syndrome in psychiatric evaluations. The lack of facial expressiveness and non-verbal emotional interactions may influence psychiatric evaluations and result in misdiagnosis and the inappropriate prescribing of antipsychotics. In the case analysis, we also observed other associated malformations such as renal atrophy, a bicuspid aortic valve and mitral valve prolapse. We feel that educating the patient about the communicative consequences of impaired facial expressions and facial interactions is a necessary prerequisite for any psychiatric or psychological evaluation in subjects with Mobius syndrome. We also recommend using caution when prescribing antipsychotics in patients with Mobius syndrome given the motor side effects secondary to a potentially pre-existing hypotonia. ","789":"In this paper we focus on adolescents in transition towards young adulthood (ATYA). We know from international studies that the transition process makes adolescents vulnerable to mental illness. However, little is known about Belgian ATYA mental-health status. Nor are risk factors associated with their mental illness understood, in particular with regard to depressive and anxiety disorder. The aim of this study is (1) to discuss evolution in time of prevalence of depressive disorder (DD) and anxiety disorder (AD) among Belgian ATYA and (2), to identify risk factors associated with these disorders among ATYA. Data was extracted from the Belgian Health Interview Survey (BHIS), which is a cross-sectional population survey, carried out in 2001, 2004, 2008, and 2013. Information about the population's background characteristics, health services utilization, health behaviours and mental health status were extracted and statistically analyzed. ATYA prevalence of DD and AD was higher in 2013 in comparison with previous years. These changes were significant only for DD (F=4.466, p=0.004). In contrast with younger adolescents, among ATYA odds of DD were 28.2% higher (OR 1.282, 95% CI 0.967-1.698, p=0.084) and, odds of AD were 55.2% higher (OR 1.552, 95% CI 1.137-2.119, p=0.006). For ATYA, a poor quality of social support was the most predictive factor of DD (OR 11.187, 95% CI 5.530-22.629, p&lt;0.0001) and AD (OR 6.238, 95% CI 2.845-13.676, p&lt;0.0001); whereas, having a paid job was the most protective factor with regard to DD (OR 0.282, 95% CI 0.169-0.470, p&lt;0.0001) and AD (OR 0.552, 95% CI 0.330-0.924, p&lt;0.024). Prevalence of mental illness among Belgian ATYA appears to worsen in time. In comparison with younger adolescents, ATYA are more vulnerable to anxiety disorders. Adverse and protective risk factors were identified and discussed in a way to improve access, continuity and mental healthcare pathways for Belgian ATYA.

Daily use of GHB\/GBL can lead to addiction and the possibility of withdrawal syndrome on cessation which results in tremor, tachycardia, insomnia, anxiety, hypertension, delirium, coma. To describe the baseline characteristics, treatment and retention in patients admitted for GHB\/GBL withdrawal management. A retrospective review of 4 consecutive cases of patients reporting GHB\/GBL addiction who were admitted for inpatient management of withdrawal syndrome. All patients were using GHB\/GBL daily, 1-1.5 ml per hour. One of them was using cannabis additionally, others were using alcohol, cocaine and amphetamine type stimulants. Psychiatric comorbidities as personality disorders, depression, anxiety and bigorexia were recognized. Patients were treated with benzodiazepines and\/or clomethiazole, atypical and typical antipsychotics and beta-blockers. Delirium was developed in two patients. One patient completed detoxification and finished the treatment program. One patient completed detoxification but stopped his treatment earlier, two patients did not completed detoxification and left the program. GHB\/GBL withdrawal can be severe and retention in program is poor. Polysubstance use, psychiatric co-morbidities and heavier GHB\/GBL use as possible predictors of poor treatment outcome need consideration in treatment planning. ","792":"Elder abuse and neglect can be defined as refusing or failing to fulfil a caregiver's obligation to meet the needs of elderly individuals in order to punish or hurt them. We aimed to explore perceptions of elder mistreatment of both caregivers and residents during long-term care, and highlight significant differences in the overall mistreatment perception regarding socio-demographic variables, as well as the type of care facility. The study involved 171 caregivers and 245 elderly individuals in stationary facilities. Two structured questionnaires were used - one for caregivers and the other for institutionalized elderly residents, whose initial validation concerning question and factor selection has been based upon exploratory factor analysis and discriminant validity. Parametric and nonparametric tests were employed in the statistical analysis, and statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05 (two-sided). We found significant differences in the perception of elder abuse and neglect between caregivers and elderly residents. More specifically, caregivers tend to recognize unnecessary or inappropriate medical\/care procedures as indicators of elder mistreatment, while the elderly residents emphasize the removal of their personal belongings and inappropriate physical contact. According to the care facility, residents reported abuse\/neglect more frequently in extended care units (21.4%), compared to the county-owned nursing home (11.4%) and private nursing home (12.1%) (p=0.001). Similarly, caregivers reported abuse\/neglect more frequently in extended care units (75.4%), in comparison to county-owned nursing home (24.6%) and private nursing home (0%) (p=0.039). Shift work was also a significant predictor, as the morning nursing staff perceived abuse\/neglect more frequently (p=0.011). This study has shown that residents and caregivers have contrasting vantage points in relation to elder abuse\/neglect perception, which underlines the need for evidence-based standardization of procedures to prevent any type of elder mistreatment. ","793":"Mental difficulties are common in the postpartum period. They can manifest in a mild form, but also as serious disorders which need to be treated in a timely manner. The most common psychological problem is \"Baby blues\" characterized by relatively short duration without consequences and treatment is largely unnecessary. Postpartum depression is characterized by a sense of sadness, loss of interest, insomnia, discomfort, loss of energy, reduced concentration. Postpartum psychosis is the most serious disorder but is also rare and may have serious consequences for the mother and child. Important factors in the postpartum mental problems\/difficulties are genetic factors, situation of unwanted pregnancy, a feeling of discomfort with the role of motherhood and sudden hormonal changes. to investigate the frequency and type of mental problems in postpartum period, as well as possible type of help needed by the women in postpartum period. One hundred (112) respondents participated in the survey. The survey was conducted from November to December 2017 through a \"google docs\" application. The survey was placed on different social networks, and the participation in the survey was voluntary and anonymous. A series of 14 questions with the offered answers was used in the survey. The results of the survey have shown that psychological difficulties and disturbances in the postpartum period to be common problems encountered by almost 50% of women (44.46%). The most common difficulty is Baby blues, followed by postpartum depression and anxiety disorders. Age and the mode of birth did not affect the emergence of changes, while social factors such as family support had a great impact. The provision of information to the mothers can help, but inaccurate information can do the opposite. Thus, the role of health care professionals is important for helping mothers in that period to prevent certain difficulties as well as in identifying and referring mothers to seek help in a timely fashion. ","794":"Academic learning is the most important source of stress among young students worldwide and appears to be quite severe in eastern countries. We aimed to examine the relationship between academic stress and depression among adolescents. A cross-sectional study was conducted among adolescents in United Arab Emirates using the Perceived Stress Scale - 14 (PSS-14) and Educational Stress Scale (ESS) for Adolescents (English and Arabic versions). The overall PSS was high in 186 (20%) of the respondents, and moderate in 695 (76%). A multiple regression model of predictors of the PSS showed statistically significant correlations between the total PSS-14 scores and age (p&lt;0.0004), gender (p&lt;0.0001), and grade (p&lt;0.001). A multiple regression model of the PSS-14 questionnaire as predictors of the ESSA revealed that Four variables on PSS-14 were statistically significant predictors of the ESSA: history of depression (p&lt;0.0001), content with academic achievement (p&lt;0.0001), high academic expectation of parents (p&lt;0.003), and a believe capable of meeting parental expectations (p&lt;0.0001). Adolescents with severe academic stress need to be identified early. We suggest that an interdisciplinary team in the schools including student advisors and counselors be developed to further address stressors. In addition, students should be taught different stress management techniques such as cognitive behavioral skills to improve their ability to cope with school demands. The identification of stressors may lead to strategies that might address the quality of teaching and mental health evaluation among adolescents.

Eye-tracking paradigms have been utilized to provide greater ecological validity, and directly capture the detailed sequence of processes in perception and attention, while quantifying classifiers in mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders. Saccadic eye movements serve as an endophenotype for various mental health disorders. Patients suffering from post-concussive syndrome and mental health concerns performed saccadic eye movements that were quantified for amplitude, velocity, latency and accuracy before and after Head-Eye Vestibular Motion therapy (HEVM). HEVM therapy is associated with statistical and substantive significant improvements in mental health and in saccadic metrics. Oculomotor dysfunction is related to the symptom dimensions of mental health disorders that may be treated with physical rehabilitation modalities. We feel it reasonable to suggest that psychiatrists and others involved in the treatment of mental health disorders quantify eye movements and use them as biomarkers in the evaluation of the outcomes of varied therapies. ","797":"A recent study commissioned by the Scottish Government on the prevalence of mental disorders in Muslims in Scotland revealed that over 50% of the sample met the diagnostic criteria for a mental illness. Stigma is a major barrier to mental health services and despite the availability of effective treatment, many Muslims in Scotland with mental health difficulties continue to suffer in silence. The Federation of Student Islamic Societies (FOSIS) Scotland branch organized a mental health conference in Glasgow to improve Mental Health Literacy and challenge mental health related stigma in the Scottish Muslim community. The conference was comprised of: A counsellor with a background of Islamic psychology, a psychiatrist and an Imam (a Muslim religious leader). We conducted a single-arm, pre- post- comparison study on Muslims who attended the FOSIS mental health conference in Glasgow, Scotland. Validated psychometric stigma scales measuring knowledge (Mental Health Knowledge Schedule (MAKS)), attitudes (Community Attitudes towards the Mentally Ill (CAMI)) and behaviours (Reported and Intended Behaviour Scale (RIBS)) were administered on participants before and immediately after exposure to the programme. 34 out of the 55 participants who attended the conference responded (response rate 62%). 34\/34 (100%) of the respondents were Muslim and the mean age was 22.7 years (Std. Dev. 6.04, min. 18, max. 49). There were no statistically significant changes in stigma across the domains of knowledge, attitude and behaviour in respondents following exposure to the event. Previous FOSIS anti-stigma conferences in England and Ireland featuring an Expert by Lived Experience were associated with statistically significant reductions in mental health related stigma. The results of the FOSIS Glasgow study supports the, 'Power of contact' with an Expert by Lived Experience at reducing mental health related stigma in the Muslim community. More robust research in this area is urgently required. ","798":"Mental health related stigma is a pernicious phenomenon that permeates and pervades our world.

Studies have shown that teaching on global mental health can improve attitudes toward psychiatry in medical students. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been published hitherto that evaluate if a brief teaching session (i.e. 60 minutes in duration) on global mental health improves perceptions of psychiatry and increases interest in this specialty as a career. We conducted a single-arm, pre- post- comparison study on participants who attended a King's College London Global Health Society event on Global Mental Health. Participants completed a survey before and after exposure to the event. Our aims were to detect and measure if there were any changes in perceptions of psychiatry and if a brief teaching session on global mental health would increase interest in pursuing psychiatry as a career. 71 out of 90 participants responded (77.8% response rate). Following exposure to the event, there were statistically significant improvements in the scores for, \"Psychiatry is interesting\" (pre-event score 4.41, post-event score 4.66 p value &lt;0.001), \"I would talk positively about psychiatry to other people\" (pre-event score 4.02, post-event score 4.48 p value &lt;0.00001), and, \"I would consider psychiatry as a career\" (pre-event score 3.24, post-event score 3.72 p value &lt;0.001). The results of our pilot study suggest that a brief lecture on global mental health may improve perceptions of psychiatry and increase interest in this specialty as a career. We recommend that global mental health be introduced into the medical school curriculum since this may help to increase recruitment into psychiatry. ","801":"Mass gatherings occur in different situations and settings around the world. A mass gathering can range in size from thousands to millions and in nature from recreation (i.e. concerts) to religious festivals (i.e. the Hajj pilgrimage). Such mass gatherings can result in high rates of morbidity and mortality from communicable and non-communicable diseases, 'accidents' and, over recent years, terror attacks. Disproportionately lower consideration has been given to the mental health and wellbeing of people during mass gatherings compared to that given to physical health during such events. Hajj is a religious pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia that all Muslims are Islamically obliged to fulfil at least once in their lifetime. With up to 3 million pilgrims attending Hajj annually, it has been described as, 'The largest and longest-standing mass gathering event on Earth'. Although Hajj is a spiritual experience that is considered enlightening by many pilgrims, it can also be highly stressful which can have adverse effects on both physical and mental health. Few studies have been published hitherto on the impact that Hajj has on the mental health of pilgrims. This review article provides a narrative summary of studies conducted on Hajj and the relationship that this mass gathering has with the mental health of pilgrims.","802":"Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder (EUPD) causes significantly impaired personality functioning to include feeling of emptiness, lack of identity, unstable mood and relationships, intense fear of abandonment and dangerous impulsive behaviour including severe episodes of self-harm. The vast majority of EUPD patients are managed in the community, and have less contact with specialist psychiatric services when compared to patients with other mental illnesses. Despite the burden of this condition on primary care, the academic literature focuses on EUPD in psychiatric inpatients. This paper therefore aims to redress this balance through, first, establishing the key themes present in the available body of work on EUPD in the community, and second, highlighting areas for future research. Further, in the spirit of reducing stigma surrounding mental illness, the authors present a novel and non-pejorative toolkit for the recognition of EUPD in primary care.","803":"Anxiety and depression contribute to a substantial burden of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease-related morbidity by impairing quality of life and by reducing adherence to treatment. The identification of COPD patients with comorbid depression or anxiety symptoms is vital, as it is estimated that only a third of patients with these co-morbidities are receiving appropriate treatment. The aim of this audit was therefore to identify whether current methods of anxiety and depression screening in elderly patients (over the age of 65) with severe COPD (FEV1 &lt;50% at most recent spirometry reading) are adequate by assessing how frequently anxiety and depression is reported as \"discussed with patient\" in COPD review appointments across two practices. SystmOne was used to identify a total of 83 patients, and the recording of depression and anxiety discussions in this cohort's review appointments was analysed and compared with the incidence of QOF-coded depression and anxiety in the patient notes. The results show that both the rate and the quality of depression and anxiety reporting in these review appointments is highly heterogeneous, and has led to 'missed' patients suffering from comorbid mental health issues. Additionally, this audit identified a number of patients with depression or anxiety directly related to their COPD, and it highlighted a trend among this cohort towards more frequent appointments with their General Practitioner, and towards related presentations at the Emergency Department. The results of this audit suggest there is room for amelioration of the current practice, such as the implementation of a structured screening tool into System One's COPD review appointment template.","804":"Neurostimulation techniques are potential methods of treating ADHD, involving stimulation of brain areas showing abnormal activity in ADHD.

","805":"Schizophrenia can be interpreted as a pathology involving the neocortex whose cognitive dysfunctions represent a central and persistent characteristic of the disease, as well as one of the more important symptoms in relation to the impairment of psychosocial functioning and the resulting disabilities. Given the implication of cognitive functions in everyday life, they can better predict the degree of schizophrenia. The study proposes to use Machine Learning techniques to identify the specific cognitive deficits of schizophrenia that mostly characterize the disorder, as well as to develop a predictive system that can diagnose the presence of schizophrenia based on neurocognitive tests. The study employs a dataset of neurocognitive assessments carried out on 201 people (86 schizophrenic patients and 115 healthy patients) recruited by the Neuroscience Group of the University of Bari \"A. Moro\". A data analysis process has been carried out, with the aim of selecting the most relevant features as well as to prepare data for training a number of \"off-the-shelf\" machine learning methods (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbor, Neural Network, Support Vector Machine), which have been evaluated in terms of classification accuracy according to stratified 20-fold cross-validation. Among all variables, 14 were selected as the most influential for the classification problem. The variables with greater influence are related to working memory, executive functions, attention, verbal fluency, memory. The best algorithms turned out to be Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Neural Network, showing an accuracy of 87.8% and 84.8% on a test set. Machine Learning provides \"cheap\" and non-invasive methods that potentially enable early intervention with specific rehabilitation interventions. The results suggest the need to integrate a thorough neuropsychological evaluation into the more general diagnostic evaluation of patients with schizophrenia disorder.

Numerous therapeutic interventions to reduce suicide risk in psychiatric disorders are effective in long-term suicide prevention, but there is necessity of sufficient, rapid pharmacological treatment of suicidal risk in MDD. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, has been reported to have rapid antidepressant effect. Depressive symptoms, anxiety, hopelessness, suicidal ideation had decreased within hours after ketamine infusion. Ketamine's rapid symptoms relief and reduction of suicide thoughts has aroused growing interests in psychiatric association.","807":"Major depression is one of the most frequent psychiatric conditions. Despite many available treatment methods, more than 30% of patients do not achieve remission, even after trying several antidepressants and augmentation strategies. S-enantiomer of ketamine, well-known anesthetic and analgesic, has been recently approved by Food and Drug Administration in the intranasal form as a new generation antidepressant. However, the mechanism in which ketamine reduces depressive symptoms in treatment-resistant depression patients is still not completely understood. There are several theories explaining how ketamine might reduce depressive symptoms, which have been described in detail; one of them is immunomodulatory effect of ketamine, according to the inflammatory theory of depression. In the review authors present and summarize studies showing ketamine effect on human immune system ex vivo and in vitro, including changes in cytokine levels, number, ratio and activity of various immune cell population and the correlation with clinical improvement in depressive symptoms. Most of the results confirm the anti-inflammatory effect of ketamine. There are only a few studies in the population of patients suffering from depression receiving ketamine, focused on correlation between immunological changes and clinical outcome of the therapy; further studies of that area are neccesary for understanding the immunomodulatory effect of ketamine in depression.","808":"The prevalence of personality disorders (PDs) in black people has consistently been reported as significantly lower than in their white equivalents. If this result is accurate, then it may reveal important clues as to the aetiology of personality disorders, which could provide invaluable insights as to how we should support these patients. However, if this result does not reflect the truth, then important questions must be answered as to why black people with personality disorders are under- represented. There has been limited investigations into what may cause a discrepancy in the PD prevalence between ethnicities. This review aims to determine whether the lower prevalence of PDs in black people is likely to be accurate, and if it isn't, explore some of the potential causes for the difference. This is an important issue to address as may reveal pertinent inequalities in healthcare.","809":"Psychiatrists play a multifaceted and critical role in improving the lives of people with mental illness. However, despite how rewarding, important and thrilling a career in mental health is, there continues to remain a shortage of psychiatrists in Low-, Middle- and High-Income Countries. There has been resurgence in interest in improving the image of psychiatry over recent years and several initiatives have been launched to increase recruitment into the specialty at Sixth Form level in the UK. We conducted a single-arm, pre-post, comparison study with Sixth Form students at an inner-city school in London. Students were invited to complete a survey before and after exposure to an assembly on mental health that was delivered by an Expert by Personal and Professional Experience (EPPE). Our aims were to detect and measure if there were any changes in perceptions of psychiatry and if there was an increase in interest in pursuing this profession as a career in this group. 63 out of 123 participants completed the before and after survey (51% response rate). Following exposure to the assembly, there were statistically significant improvements between the pre- and post- intervention means for, \"Psychiatry has a positive impact on peoples' lives\" (p value &lt;0.0001), \"People with mental illness can achieve success and be the best at what they do\" (p value &lt;0.0001) and, \"I would consider psychiatry as a career\" (p value &lt;0.0001). Notwithstanding the limitations of this pilot study, our findings suggest that an assembly on mental health delivered by an EPPE (i.e. 'Wounded Healer') might be effective at increasing interest in psychiatry as a career at Sixth Form level. We suggest that assemblies on mental health and psychiatry be delivered by 'Wounded Healers' in schools and colleges nationwide to help drive recruitment into psychiatry. ","810":"In a two-year study, we compared the efficacy of noradrenergic and serotonergic antidepressants with and without the addition of 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in subjects suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD). In this article we examine the influence of the health locus of control, family relationships and personality traits on the progress of MDD. 40 people with MDD (MDD group) were randomly assigned to the different treatment groups. They were followed in parallel with a group of 20 'healthy' subjects (HG). At the beginning of the study, sociodemographic data were collected, and patients were asked to complete the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC) scale, the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI), and the Family Adaptation and Cohesion Scale (FACES III). During the study subjects were regularly assessed using the Hamilton Depression Scale (HDS), the Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) and the Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI). Regardless of the type of treatment, physical health is the best predictor of variation at two years in the MDD group; 45% of variance is explained by a linear regression model that includes three variables from the MHLC, FACES III and NEO-FFI scales. Similarly, 40% of CGI and 24% of HDS variance is predicted. These explanatory variables are statistically less powerful in the MDD group than the HG group. While drug treatment is a determinant in changes on the HDS, CGI and SF12 scales, factors such as family relationships, MHLC or personality are important covariates of these changes. The question remains whether we can influence these covariates to improve the response to antidepressants.

The aim of this study was to assess anxiety and depression associated with such conditions and their psychophysical predictors before and after HCT. We conducted a longitudinal study using self-descriptive tools. The questionnaires: LOT-R, AIS, Mini-Mac, CECS, RSCL and HADS were filled by 60 patients with acute leukaemia before and after HCT. Anxiety and depressive symptoms correlated positively with psychological symptom distress. The correlation with depressive symptoms was weak, however, with anxious symptoms was moderate. In both cases, the higher was a level of psychological symptom distress, the higher level of anxiety and depression was observed in patients. The results indicated the weak, positive correlation between onerousness of physical symptoms and a level of anxiety. The greater was the severity of physical symptoms, the higher was the level of anxiety. The negative predictor of anxious symptoms was control of anxiety but it was weakly associated with a lower level of the explained variable. The negative predictor of anxious symptoms was also dispositional optimism whose high level accompanied the lower severity of the explained variable. However, the positive predictor of anxious symptoms was the variable of onerousness of symptoms whose high level accompanied the higher severity of anxious symptoms in the examined group CONCLUSION: Patients with acute leukemia who are hospitalized for HCT require detailed monitoring of their psychological distress to introduce the proper psychological and pharmacological interventions that reduce anxiety as well as boost \"dispositional optimism\" and mechanisms of control. ","812":"Today, the concepts of health and illness require a global vision of man; the suffering of the person places the entire environment in great difficulty: health professionals, family, society. It is important not to simplify the response to a purely health-focused view of the disorder, because fragile people possess a deep need to feel welcomed, listened to, understood and accepted. Service provision that is respectful of the dignity of the person is an important challenge both for those who are responsible for providing services to individuals and their families as well as for the entire community. Therefore in providing care the human qualities of the health professional and not only his technical skills come into play: blending together science and humanitarian ethos. The provision of care therefore \"forces\" us to broaden our horizons and requires us to face the challenge of responsibility towards the Other, the human condition of being-for. However, ethical capacity cannot be born solely out of sharing standards or adhering to regulations and respecting prohibitions: it stems from high and unconditional moral values and meanings. The ME-YOU relationship represents the primary ethical factor of the human being: my responsibility towards the Other is unconditional. In the book of Genesis when the Lord asks Cain: \"... where is Abel, your brother?\" He responds with another question: \"Am I my brother's keeper?\" In this biblical passage Cain kills Abel: the rejection of brotherhood and the care of the other only leads to the death of the Other. \"Where is your brother?\" This question is crucial in today's day and age and must be taken seriously: it is the decisive question that forces us to decide how to place ourselves in relationship with the other and with the world: do we choose proximity or distance, connection or indifference?","813":"Both Vitamin D deficiency and magnesium deficiency have an increased prevalence and have been associated with an increased risk of and increased severity of symptoms in both depression and schizophrenia (Boerman 2016, Tarleton &amp; Littenberg 2015). This effect appears more pronounced in younger populations and is often apparent from the time of initial diagnosis and is present with adjustment for confounding factors. Thus, the evidence suggests that Vitamin D and magnesium deficiency reflects not only dietary or somatic aspects of health but also may have a role in the pathophysiology of depression and schizophrenia. A single site audit of serum Vitamin D and magnesium levels in patients at an Acute Day Treatment Unit was carried out. Blood tests were performed on admission and analysed in house. Data were collected between April - June 2019 and was analysed subsequently, as described below (n=73). Our data show that our psychiatric day treatment unit cohort (n=73) had a higher proportion of vitamin D deficiency (52%) than the general population (40%), although due to the limited sample size this was not significant (p=0.22, Chi-squared test). The percentage of patients who were magnesium deficient was 78.6% (n=22\/28). However, the F60 subgroup of patients with personality disorders showed a high prevalence of vit D deficiency (p=0.07), highlighting a trend towards significance despite the limited size of this subgroup. We carried out a single-site audit of serum vitamin D and magnesium levels in a psychiatric day unit population in order to assess the extent of vitamin deficiency in such patients. These data indicate that that the proportion of patients with vitamin D deficiency is higher than in the general population. Further larger analysis is needed to establish the statistical significance of these data and whether treatment with vitamin D supplementation improves outcomes.

These include, eating healthy food, greater physical activity, cessation of smoking, avoidance of alcohol and illicit substances. Additional lifestyle factors for healthy living include, safe and peaceful environment, optimal sleep, de-stressing and enjoyable activities, social connections\/support and healthy mental activities. Physicians from the ancient times, through the middle ages to the early 20th century have recommended adoption of healthy lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise to manage medical and psychiatric disorders without really understanding their scientific basis. In this short paper, we discuss the important role lifestyle factors play in morbidity and mortality related to many important and common medical and psychiatric diseases.

PTSD lifetime and PTSD current subjects were analyzed separately, each of them were analyzed in a Case\/Control design, as well as regarding BSI and CAPS within cases only. 719 (487 male, 232 female) participants who had experienced war-related trauma between 1991 and 1999 in Bosnia and Hercegovina, Kosovo and Croatia were included in the study. Sociodemographic questionnaire, Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) were used to collect clinical data. The DRD2 rs1800497 variant and a variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) located in exon three of DRD4 were investigated for association with PTSD. In case control analyses we did not identify any significant associations. Within the PTSD current patients, we identified an association of DRD2 rs1800497 with BSI in the genotypic and the recessive model with the T allele as the risk allele. Our findings suggest that rs1800497 of DRD2 gene is involved in pathogenesis of PTSD.

The Sociodemographic questionnaire, Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.), Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) were used to collect clinical data. The SNPs rs6295 (HTR1A), rs11178997 and rs1386494 (TPH2) were investigated for their association with PTSD and comorbid psychopathology. A nominal significant association was found between the BSI total score in Lifetime PTSD with the SNP rs6295 of the HTR1A gene. The best result was seen in the dominant model (P=0.018), with the minor allele (C) being the risk allele. Several BSI subscores were also associated with the minor (C) allele in Lifetime PTSD. No association was found for the TPH2 SNPs rs11178997 and rs1386494 in relation to PTSD or comorbid psychopathology. Our findings suggest that rs6295 in the HTR1A gene may contribute to the psychopathology of PTSD.

Several genetic studies suggest that gene encoding proteins of catechol-O-methyl-transferase (COMT) may be relevant for the pathogenesis of PTSD. Some researchers suggested that the elevation of interleukin-6 (IL6) correlates with major depression and PTSD. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the single nucleotide polymorphisms COMT rs4680 (Val158Met) and IL6 rs1800795 are associated with PTSD and contribute to the severity of PTSD symptoms. This study comprised 747 participants that experienced war between 1991 and 1999 in the South Eastern Europe conflicts. COMT rs4680 (Val158Met) and IL6 rs1800795 genotypes were determined in 719 participants (369 with and 350 without PTSD). The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.), the Clinician Administrated PTSD Scale (CAPS) questionnaire and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) were used for data collection. Regarding the COMT gene polymorphism, the results of the regression analyses for BSI total score were significant in the lifetime PTSD group in the dominant (P=0.031) and the additive allelic model (P=0.047). Regarding the IL6 gene, a significant difference was found for the recessive model predicting CAPS total score in the lifetime PTSD group (P=0.048), and indicated an association between the C allele and higher CAPS scores. n the allelic, genotypic and rezessive model, the results for BSI total score were significant in the lifetime PTSD group (P=0.033, P=0.028 and P=0.009), suggesting a correlation of the C allele with higher BSI scores. Although our nominally significant results did not withstand correction for multiple tests they may support a relevance of the COMT (Val158Met) and IL6 rs1800795 polymorphism for aspects of PTSD in war traumatized individuals. ","820":"Previous research showed inconsistent results concerning a possible association between solute carrier family 6 member 3 (SLC6A3) gene polymorphisms and dopamine symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Several studies also indicate that the myelin basic protein (MBP) gene is of importance in the etiology of several psychiatric disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the relation of distinct SLC6A3 and MBP gene polymorphisms with PTSD and whether SLC6A3 and MBP genotypes contribute to PTSD symptom severity. The study included 719 individuals who had experienced war trauma in the South Eastern Europe (SEE). Genotypes of variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism within the SLC6A3 gene were assessed in 696 participants, and the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs12458282 located within the MBP gene region was genotyped in a total of 703 subjects. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, the Clinical Administrated PTSD Scale (CAPS) and Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), were used for data collection. No significant differences concerning the investigated SLC6A3 and MBP polymorphisms was identifiable between PTSD and non PTSD participants. Also we could not detect significant influence of these distinct SLC6A3 and MBP alleles on the severity of PTSD symptoms (CAPS) or BSI scores. However, the results of MBP rs12458282 within the patients with lifetime PTSD may point to a possible correlation of the major allele (T) with elevated CAPS scores. Our results do not support an association of the analysed SLC6A3 and MBP gene polymorphisms with PTSD in war traumatized individuals. We found that there is a possibility for a correlation of the T allele rs12458282 within the MBP gene with higher CAPS scores in lifetime PTSD patients which would need to be tested in a sample providing more statistical power.

Reactions to these events are highly heterogeneous and seems to be influenced by genes as well. Some individuals will develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), while others will not. In this study, our aim was to analyze the correlation between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene (rs53576 and rs2254298), the RAR-related orphan receptor A (RORA) gene (rs8042149) and the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR1) gene (rs1049353) and PTSD. All candidate genes have been previously associated with stress related disorders and the reaction to traumatic events. Participants (N=719) have been exposed to war-related trauma during the war in South-Eastern Europe (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Kosovo). We correlated the presence and absence of current and lifetime PTSD as well as PTSD severity (Clinician Administered PTSD scale (CAPS)) and current psychopathology (Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) score) with the mentioned SNPs. DNA was isolated from whole blood and genotyped for OXTR rs2254298 and rs53576 following previously published protocols, for RORA rs8042149 via PCR-RFLP and CNR1 rs1049353 via KASP. Nominally significant results were found for OXTR rs53576 in connection with the CAPS and BSI scores within lifetime PTSD patients. The additive allelic model indicated that G allele carriers achieved lower CAPS (p=0.0090) and BSI (p=0.0408) scores than participants carrying one or two copies of the A allele. These results did not withstand correction for multiple tests. No significant results were observed for OXTR rs2254298, RORA rs8042149 and CNR1 rs1049353 although the results for RORA showed a slight tendency that rs8042149 may influence the level of BSI scores in current PTSD patients.

Genotyping of the MAOA VNTR and SLC6A4 tandem repeat polymorphism in combination with rs25531 was done in 719 participants: 232 females and 487 males. Among them, 369 have had current or lifetime PTSD and 350 have had no PTSD symptoms. For psychometric approach we used the Clinician Administrated PTSD Scale (CAPS), the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), the adapted Hoffman-Lazarus Coping scale and a basic socio-demographic data questionnaire. There were no significant intergroup (PTSD versus non PTSD) differences in the genotype distribution of MAOA and SLC6A4 gene polymorphisms. The primary finding of our study was that the MAOA short allele (MAOA-S) was nominally significantly associated with the severity of PTSD symptoms in the total subgroup of participants with lifetime PTSD; males for symptoms of hyperarrousal and females with symptoms of re-experience and hyperarousal. In our research the male subsample with current PTSD and MAOA-S genotype had nominally significantly higher scores for some positive coping strategies compared to those carrying the long allele genotype (MAOA-L). There was no significant association between the severity of PTSD symptoms, BSI phenotype, coping scores and the SLC6A4 genotype. The present results support the notion that MAOA VNTR gene variation modulates development and recovery of posttraumatic stress disorder in a war traumatised population, but did not support a connection between SLC6A4 gene variations and war related PTSD.

Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), as one of the frequent consequences of war trauma, is often associated with the psychiatric and\/or somatic comorbidity. Therefore, PTSD results in impaired Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL). This study aimed to investigate the HRQoL in the Croatian Homeland War ex-POWs affected by PTSD, regarding the intensity of PTSD symptoms, sociodemographic characteristics and somatic comorbidity, and to identify predictors of poor HRQoL. The study sample consisted of two groups (45 participants each) based on whether they were POWs or not (control group). All study participants were diagnosed with PTSD according to the ICD-10 criteria and had combat experience as active participants in defence of the Republic of Croatia during the Homeland War. The subjects were evaluated using the sociodemographic questionnaire, PTSD self-report checklist (PCL-5) and Short Form (SF-36) Health Survey questionnaire. The data on participants' physical diseases were collected from medical anamnesis and medical records in the last five years. In relation to ex-POWs, the control group had significantly smaller number of retirees, more unemployed persons, smaller number of married subjects, and higher number of divorced persons. Low socioeconomic status and intensity of PTSD symptoms has been confirmed as a significant predictor of impaired HRQoL in both subject groups. The most commonly PTSD associated physical diseases were musculosceletal, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal diseases. Endocrine and metabolic diseases were more frequent in the ex-POWs' group. PTSD was associated with the HRQoL, whether the veterans were ex-POWs or not. The hypothesis that exposure of ex-POWs to the trauma of captivity experience impaired HRQoL to a greater extent, compared to the non-detained veterans, was not confirmed. Low socioeconomic status has proved to be the most significant predictor of poorer HRQoL.

Recently the proposed ICD-11 domains were partially validated in a sample of patients with major depression producing five domains: Detached, Anankastic, Negative Emotional, Antisocial and Borderline. The aim of our study was to attempt to cross-validate these findings in a sample of patients primarily diagnosed with personality disorder (PD). All subjects were assessed by Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV Axis II PD. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was applied on fifty seven DSM PD symptoms selected to represent the five proposed domains. SCID II data were collected from a total of 223 subjects. The EFA extracted five factors. The first factor labeled as borderline-internalizing constituted of borderline together with avoidant and dependent items, the second, labeled as disinhibited\/ borderline externalizing, incorporated narcissistic and histrionic items. The other three separate factors in our study labeled as antisocial, anankastic and detached, were less robust. In our study five personality pathology domains were partly replicated. The most robust findings support the existence of the two factors, borderline-internalizing and disinhibited\/borderline externalizing. However, the EFA was performed on a relatively low prevalence symptoms distribution, particularly for antisocial and schizoid factors.

A total of 738 enrolled patients, with 123 study subjects who had suffered from DCS, and 615 controls matched for sex and age, from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Databank from 2000-2010 in Taiwan, and selected from the National Health Insurance Research Database. After adjusting for the confounding factors, Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to compare the risk of developing psychiatric disorders during the 10 years of follow-up period. Of the study subjects, 10 (8.13%) developed psychiatric disorders when compared to 35 (5.69%) in the control group. The study subjects were more likely to develop psychiatric disorders (crude hazard ratio [HR]: 2.79 (95% CI=1.37-5.69, P&lt;0.01). After adjusting for sex, age, monthly income, urbanization level, geographic region, and comorbidities, the adjusted HR was 3.83 (95% CI=1.60-9.16, P&lt;0.01). Sleep disorders was associated with DCS with the adjusted HR as 5.74 (95% CI=1.04-31.56, P&lt;0.01). Hyperbaric oxygenation therapy was not associated with a lower risk of psychiatric disorders. Patients who suffered from DCS have a 3.8-fold risk of developing psychiatric disorders, and a 5.7-fold risk of sleep disorders. This finding is a reminder for the clinicians that a regular psychiatric follow-up might well be needed for these patients.

We assessed the differences between these two groups, as well as the changes between the acute phase of illness and subsequent remission among patients over 18-month longitudinal follow-up. The assessments were divided into four work packages (WP): WP1- psychopathological status, neurocognitive functioning and emotional recognition; WP2- stress response measured by saliva cortisol during a stress paradigm; cerebral blood perfusion in the resting state (with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and during activation paradigm (with Transcranial Ultrasonography Doppler (TCD); WP3-post mortem analysis in histologically prepared human cortical tissue of post mortem samples of subjects with schizophrenia in the region that synaptic alteration was suggested by WP1 and WP2; WP4- pharmacogenetic analysis (single gene polymorphisms and genome wide association study (GWAS). We expect that the analysis of these data will identify a set of markers that differentiate healthy controls from patients with FEP, and serve as an additional diagnostic tool in the first episode of psychosis, and prediction tool which can be then used to help tailoring individualized treatment options.

Asenapine is a new second-generation antipsychotic, available as a sublingual tablet, approved in Europe for the treatment of moderate-to-severe manic episodes in adults, and in US for manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder in adults and adolescents. In this review, we searched the available literature to appreciate the role of asenapine in the management of psychiatric conditions such as bipolar disorders and schizophrenia and describe its mechanism of action, efficacy and tolerability. Asenapine has demonstrated efficacy in the management of bipolar disorders and schizophrenia, while a possible role in the management of borderline personality disorder and agitation needs further research. Asenapine has favourable side effects profile and combining with other pharmacological treatment in post-traumatic stress disorder has shown promising results. Asenapine fulfils important requirements of efficacy and tolerability as an anti-psychotic.

Yet there is a dearth of reports on its use as an augmentation agent in therapy-resistant depression. We deal with this issue presenting case reports and a review of the literature. The addition of 50 mg amisulpride (AMS) to antidepressant therapy in seven patients with depression at different stages of treatment resistance, one of them a case of recurrent brief depression, is described in this report. Augmentation with AMS led to a profound improvement in psychopathology in most patients. The only side effects were elevation of prolactin levels and occasional weight gain. In most cases, improvement occurred early, after only 1-2 weeks of treatment. In some patients, reduction or cessation of AMS led to an immediate and intense recurrence of depressive symptoms that resembled a withdrawal syndrome. Further investigations into the clinical utility and the mode of action of AMS as an augmentation agent are warranted.","834":"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) polymorphism plays an important role in neural survival and was proposed to be related to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Genetic association studies of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism (rs6265) in OCD have produced inconsistent results. A meta-analysis of studies was conducted to compare the frequency of the BDNF Val66Met variant between cases with OCD and age-matched controls. Electronic databases were searched for eligible articles in English and ten studies on the association of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism with OCD were analysed. A total of ten studies involving 2306 cases with OCD and 4968 healthy controls were included. Findings indicated that the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism was not associated with OCD. But there was a marginally significant effect of the BDNF Val66Met variant on OCD in different ethnicity. Findings from this meta-analytic investigation of published literature provide little support for the Val66Met variant of BDNF as a predictor of OCD.

It is well known that fetal motoric activity is enabling the development of central and peripheral nervous system and the muscles. It is 4D US which enabled to investigate fetal movement patterns from the first trimester of pregnancy throughout the whole pregnancy. Based on the evaluation of fetal spontaneous motor activity by 4D US, a prenatal neurologic scoring test named Kurjak Antenatal Neurodevelopmental Test (KANET) was created. This test has been used to assess almost 2000 fetuses and our results have indicated that KANET has an ability to recognize normal, borderline, and abnormal behavior in fetuses from normal and abnormal pregnancies. The fetus is able to process tactile, vestibular, taste, olfactory, auditory and visual sensations. The fetus responds to painful stimuli with a wide spectrum of reactions. Important external signs of emotion are facial expressions. The existence of a wide range of facial expressions, including grimacing, smiling, crying, similar to emotional expressions in adults, has been revealed by 4D sonography in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy. It is questionable if mental, emotional and behavioral conditions of the fetus were covered in this paper and whether we are able to perceive the fetus as the patient who may develop communication or some other psychiatric disorders which we will be hopefully able to recognize prenatally.

The aim of this study was to examine the outcomes of the Day hospital treatment for early intervention on self-esteem, and quality of life, and to determine which patients benefit the most from the program. The study was conducted on 124 patients with an early phase of psychosis who were treated at the Day hospital. They filled out Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and WHOQOL-BREF upon the admission and again after three months of the treatment. Interaction effects were examined between their sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age, employment status), clinical features (first episode of psychosis or longer duration of illness), and results on applied questionnaires. After three months of the treatment, patients evaluated their self-esteem, overall quality of life and satisfaction with different QoL domains (physical and psychological health, environment) as significantly improved. Younger patients had greater increase in estimated self-esteem compared to older patients. No other significant interactions were found. Notwithstanding the limitations of this study, we may conclude that the findings are encouraging and may assist with development of more effective therapeutic approaches.

The aim of this paper is to explore the changes in self-esteem and loneliness of group members during the therapeutic process and whether the use of more mature defence mechanisms is the answer to the treatment of group psychotherapy. We followed three groups of 30 members (18 women and 12 men). At the beginning of inclusion in group psychodynamic psychotherapy and after 18 months of psychotherapy, members completed the following questionnaires: Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, short version of UCLA Loneliness Scale (ULS-7) and Lifestyle Questionnaire (LSI). The research results show a statistically significant increase in self-esteem, a significant reduction in loneliness, and significantly reduced use of defence mechanisms after 18 months of group psychotherapy. Research findings confirmed positive changes in family members who gradually feel better and safer, with less anxiety and fear, all positively reflecting on the family atmosphere, the ability to accept and understand the sick member, as well as his better quality of recovery. ","838":"This article reviews cognitive models of positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, as well as basic principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for hallucinations, delusions and negative symptoms. Cognitive models of schizophrenia posit that individuals' view of the self is influenced by a combination of genetic vulnerability, early childhood experience and environmental stressors later in the life, and that these factors determine how internal and external experiences are interpreted. Cognitive behavioural therapy for schizophrenia is based on the basic principles of CBT and establishes connection between thoughts, emotions and behaviour. Treatment focuses on the meaning the individual attributes to psychotic experience, his or her understanding of it and ways of coping with symptoms, and is intended to reduce the distress caused by psychotic experience and correct thoughts and assumptions that are incompatible with objective evidence. The latest contradictory data on the efficacy of CBT for schizophrenia point to the need to use protocols that are tailored to specific symptoms and subgroups of patients based on the stage of illness, level of neurocognitive impairment and severity of the disorder, and manual-based in order to ensure fidelity of implementation.","839":null,"840":"The influence of cannabis use on the occurrence, clinical course and the treatment of the first psychotic episode (FEP) is well documented.

The case study describes the clinical course of a five selected patients with a diagnosis of the FEP and positive tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) urine test who were hospitalized in a similar pattern of events. They all have a history of cannabis consumption for at least 6 years in continuity and were presented with severe psychomotor agitation, disorganisation, confusion and aggression at admission. Although the chosen drug to treat all patients was atypical antipsychotic and benzodiazepines, the course of the disorder and the clinical response to therapy were noticeably different in each patient. The clinical presentation of FEP in cannabis users can be atypical and highly unpredictable from mild psychotic symptoms to severe substance intoxication delirium. In clinical practice clinicians treating new onset psychosis need to be watchful for cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids induced psychosis.

However, increased prolactin levels (mlU\/L) were found in patients suffering from the first psychotic episode who were not receiving antipsychotic therapy. The assumption of this study is that the abnormality in the level of prolactin is associated with the effect and influence of the disease, not the therapy that is carried out. Study involved 54 female patients hospitalized in Psychiatric hospital \"Sveti Ivan\", whose average age was 33.9 years. All patients had been diagnosed with a psychotic disorder (according to MKB-10, F20-F29). 18 patients had their first psychotic episode, while 36 patients had relapses of psychotic disorder. The methods used were: PANSS scale and measurement of prolactin concentration (Immunoanalyzer ACCESS 2, CLIA method). Arithmetic mean, standard deviations, correlation coefficient, Mann Whitney U test and the chi-squared test were used. 75.5% of patients had prolactin values above the reference values (min 121, max 4192 ml\/L). In a sample of patients with first psychotic episode, 77.8% had elevated prolactin levels, while among re-hospitalized patients, elevated levels had 74.2%. Statistically significant results were obtained: patients with higher pronounced symptoms had higher prolactin values, especially particles on PANSS: P1 (delusions), N4 (Apathy), G15 (preoccupation) and G16 (active avoidance). Elevated prolactin in patients has been demonstrated regardless of antipsychotic therapy, therefore the question of etiology of hyperprolactinemia in psychotic disorders is questionable. The association of hyperprolactinemia with the severity of the clinical picture has also been demonstrated, higher prolactin values indicating a stronger clinical picture, which calls into question the protective role of prolactin in psychotic disorders.

While anhedonia might occur in healthy individuals, its prevalence and severity are much higher in psychiatric patients, particularly those with depression and schizophrenia. Anhedonia is a negative symptom, and presumably a trait marker in schizophrenia. Recent research confirmed that anhedonia is a complex construct, consisting of anticipatory, consummatory, and reward learning components. In general, schizophrenia patients show anticipation deficits, and a substantial portion of them have physical (PA) and social anhedonia (SA). The relationship between anhedonia and psychopathology appears bidirectional. While gene-environment interactions affect reward circuity, anhedonia modulates clinical features, such as suicidality and nicotine consumption. Future clinical research employing longitudinal designs may shed more light on the dynamics and treatment of anhedonia in schizophrenia.","844":"Depressive mood, anxiety, delusions, hallucinations and behavioral disturbances have been traditionally recognized as leading symptoms of mental disorders. However, cognitive symptoms went under-recognized or declined. Today there is robust evidence that cognitive dysfunction is present in the majority of mental disorders and is also related to impairments in the functioning of the persons with mental illness. It is proposed that aberrant brain neuronal network connectivity, arising from interplay of genetic, epigenetic, developmental and environmental factors, is responsible for cognitive decline. In schizophrenia, dysfunctions in working memory, attention, processing speed, visual and verbal learning with substantial deficit in reasoning, planning, abstract thinking and problem solving have been extensively documented. Social cognition - the ability to correctly process information and use it to generate appropriate response in situations, is also impaired. The correlation of cognitive impairment with functional outcome and employment, independent living and social functioning has emphasized the need for development of the treatments specific to cognition. It is considered that brain neuroplasticity allows for re-modulating and compensating the impairment process which could give opportunity to improve cognitive functions. Therefore, there is a need for comprehensive clinical assessment and follow-up of cognitive decline in mental illness. Implementation of specific treatment strategies addressing cognitive decline in mental illness, like new drugs, distinct cognitive-behavioural therapy, psychoeducation, social skills training and remediation strategies should be strongly indorsed targeting recovery and reduction of disability due to mental illness.","845":"","846":"","847":"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) represent a leading public-health problem given the rising age of the population.

Patients with AD exhibit EEG changes mostly in the form of theta waves, focal abnormalities and spike-and-wave complexes in frontotemporal regions with the reduction in the amplitude of alpha waves. SPECT in most patients exhibited hypoperfusion in temporoparietal regions with occasional unilateral abnormalities in frontotemporal region. EEG changes in patients with VaD are predominantly in the form of theta waves while SPECT findings show mostly \"patchy\" abnormalities. EEG readings are normal or exhibit minimal changes in the group of patients with MCI, while SPECT imaging exhibits mostly normal CBF. EEG and SPECT are diagnostic methods which show specific changes, especially in AD. EEG can be used to monitor the therapeutic effect and progression of AD as well as the possible transition from MCI to early stage AD. SPECT on the other hand, being a more expensive and less available method, can be utilized as an add-on method to increase the specificity and sensitivity of the diagnostic algorithm. ","848":"Both affective temperaments and seasonality impact on the illness course in bipolar disorder (BD). This exploratory study aims to investigate the link between seasonality and affective temperament in BD. Sixty-six euthymic patients with BD-I were recruited. The Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ) and Temperament Evaluation Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego-Autoquestionnaire version scale (TEMPS-A) were applied. The seasonal BD rate was 39.4% (n=26). Depressive and anxious temperament scores were higher in patients with seasonality. The SPAQ total scores were also associated with depressive, cyclothymic, and anxious affective temperament scores. Our findings warrant further investigation to understanding the complex interaction between seasonality, mood regulation, and temperament collectively moderating illness course in BD. This study implies that affective temperament may have some value in discerning the link between seasonality and illness course in BD. ","849":"Placebo responsiveness is highly variable across individuals and has been shown to be difficult to predict solely based on personality traits. The present study examined the interaction between a specific trait and state variable (disgust proneness and perceived effectiveness of a disgust placebo) on placebo responsiveness. We presented 145 participants with an inert pill, which was introduced as an effective anti-nausea drug. Disgust responses were elicited by a validated picture set, which was viewed once with and once without the disgust placebo. The results showed that the placebo was effective in reducing experienced disgust. When predicting placebo responsiveness, the results showed a significant interaction between perceived treatment effectiveness and disgust proneness. Specifically, effectiveness ratings were a significant predictor of placebo response only for individuals high in disgust proneness. The results suggest that the joint consideration of specific state and trait factors can be used to optimize placebo responsiveness.","850":null,"851":"The purpose of this study was to examine differences in attachment, emotional competence and coping strategies among women with BPD and a control group, and the contribution of the attachment dimensions to the emotional competence and coping styles. The group of women with BPD (N=30) and control group of hospital employees (N=47) participated in this cross-sectional study. Attachment, emotional competence and coping were determined by using self-evaluation questionnaires. The results showed that subjects with BPD more often had insecure attachment, lower emotional competence and ineffective coping strategies compared to controls. Higher levels of insecure attachment predicted lower levels of emotional competence and majority of ineffective coping strategies. The main findings of this study indicated the importance of insecure attachment to the maintaining of stress intolerance and, particularly, emotional incompetence, which has not been previously studied in the context of BDP. By improving emotional competence and developing more effective coping strategies during therapy, it is possible to contribute to better functionality across different life situations in women with BDP. ","852":null,"853":"Folate is important for the synthesis of serotonin the neurotransmitter which plays a main role in OCD. We, therefore, explored the efficacy of folic acid as add on treatment to fluoxetine in a double blind study among patients with OCD. A double blind, 12-week study comparing the efficacy of folic acid as add on treatment and placebo in patients with OCD was conducted on thirty six (36) patients. Patients were randomly assigned to folic acid (5 mg\/day) or placebo group in addition to fluoxetine (40 mg\/day). After the baseline assessment, on week 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 assessments were performed by using YBOCS, HAM-D, HAM-A and CGI-S. Serum folate, erythrocyte folate, serum homocysteine and B12 levels were measured both baseline and the end of study. A mixed model repeated measures ANCOVA on Y-BOCS scores were used to determine the difference between folic acid and placebo groups. No significant differences were found in the ratios of gender or in the mean age, serum folic acid level, erythrocyte folate level, serum homocysteine level and serum B12 level between the treatment groups at the baseline. Consecutively scores collected over six measurements on YBOCS, HAM-D, HAM-A and CGI showed non-significant differences between folic acid and placebo groups. None of the biological markers of one carbon metabolism were associated with the change in YBOCS scores. It may be assumed that there is no beneficial effect of folic acid addition to fluoxetine in the treatment of OCD. ","854":"The aim of our retrospective naturalistic observational study was to describe the use of maintenance electroconvulsive therapy (M-ECT) in chronic pharmacoresistant schizophrenia. We delineated 19 cases of chronic pharmacoresistant schizophrenia (females N=12) recently treated with maintenance electroconvulsive therapy at the Havlickuv Brod Psychiatric Hospital in the Czech Republic. Demographic, clinical and treatment variables were recorded. M-ECT, when applied weekly to monthly mostly over a period of several years, was of no benefit in the treatment of chronic hallucinations and\/or delusions. However, it did prove beneficial (p&lt;0.001) in removing chronic serious symptoms like suicidal or violent behavior, automutilation, refusal of food or liquids, stupor or catatonia. Even though almost all of our patients remained hospitalized, we were nonetheless able to transfer them to an unlocked psychiatric ward and let them out for walks or occupational therapy with almost no need for using restraint. No serious adverse side effects of M-ECT were found. Our study is limited by using only one simple standardized measurement (Clinical Global Impression - Severity) that was retrospective. Another limitation of our retrospective study was that the subjects had not been regularly tested for their cognitive functions. According to our results, M-ECT mitigates the impact of the disease and improves social functioning of the patients. M-ECT does not treat chronic schizophrenia but does make the lives of patients more tolerable. We suggest further research into M-ECT and its clinical application in chronic pharmacoresistant schizophrenia. ","855":"Some authors suggest that working memory may underlie most of cognitive deficits found in schizophrenia and contribute to the most salient features of the disorder. Many authors further believe that, despite the differences in magnitude, profile of cognitive impairment is quite similar across schizophrenia and affective psychosis. To test the hypothesis of profile similarity between SCZ and BPD compared to healthy individuals, we carried out a comparative study applying several working memory tasks. A total of 64 subjects participated in the study, 20 diagnosed with schizophrenia, 18 with bipolar affective disorder and 26 healthy controls. Groups were matched according to age, sex and education, and two clinical groups were also matched according to the number of hospitalizations. To measure working memory we applied se Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), STROOP task, Trail making test (TMT), Digit span forward and backward tasks. To test the size and profile similarities of the groups, we used ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests on individual measures and on factor scores. Most indicators of the WCST did not differentiate between the groups, but all of the remaining indicators indicated weaker working memory of the two clinical groups compared to the healthy controls. All applied measures could be reduced to two latent constructs provisionally named WM Attention and WM Capacity. Both clinical groups scored lower on the capacity component than controls, whereas the three groups could not be distinguished according to the attention component. Results provided no evidence of difference in either size or profile of working memory impairment in patients with SCZ and BDP. The current study determined impairment of WM in patients diagnosed with SCZ and BPD compared to healthy controls. However, no difference was found regarding either the size or the profile of impairment between SCZ and BPD patients. ","856":"The aim of study was to analyze neurocognitive profiles in patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) and patients with schizophrenia (SCH), and their correlations with other clinical features. We performed a multicentric cross sectional study including 100 FEP and 100 SCH recruited from three Croatian hospitals during 2015-2017. Assessment included a set of neurocognitive tests, psychiatric scales and self-reporting questionnaires. The main analysis was done by multigroup latent profile analysis. Multigroup latent profile analysis resulted in three structurally equivalent neurocognitive profiles (\"Best\", \"Medium\", \"Worst\"), with differences in the severity of neurocognitive deficits measured with successfulness in solving domain specific tasks. The \"Best\" profile was statistically significantly more prevalent in FEP and \"Worst\" profile in the SCH. Negative symptom score was the highest in patients with the \"Worst\" profile and the lowest among those with the \"Best\" profiles. Differences in neurocognitive profiles between FEP and SCH appear to be quantitative rather than qualitative nature, possibly reflecting a specific trait of illness that may progress over time. Defining neurocognitive profiles from the first episode of psychosis could help in tailoring individualized treatment options with focus on neurocognitive and negative symptoms and possible influence on patients' overall clinical outcome. ","857":"Body image concerns are associated with the poor prognosis of bipolar disorder, but it is unknown whether bipolar I (BD I) and II (BD II) types differ in these concerns and their associations with personality styles or affective states. We therefore invited 89 BD I, 91 BD II patients, and 159 healthy volunteers to undergo the tests of the Body Image Concern Scale (BICS), the Mood Disorder Questionnaire, the Hypomania Checklist - 32, the Plutchik - van Praag Depression Inventory, and the Parker Personality Measure. Both BD I and BD II displayed higher scores of ongoing affective states and of personality disorder functioning styles than healthy controls did. BD II scored higher on all six BICS scales than controls did, and higher on five than BD I did. The depressive measure predicted four, and Dependent style predicted three BICS scales in BD I; and the depressive measure predicted all six BICS scales, hypomanic measure predicted one, and Avoidant style predicted one in BD II. Body image concerns and their associations with the affective states and personality styles were different in BD I and BD II, suggesting different pathological mechanisms, clinical symptom severities and managements for the two types of bipolar disorder. ","858":"Attachment parameters have an effect on later relationship patterns and the development of parameters of self-concept and personality. In the current study the role of attachment parameters on personality dimensions was investigated, especially with respect to personality disorders. 134 psychiatric inpatients were examined on attachment and personality parameters using the schedule FEB as a questionnaire on the parental attachment and the SKI as a self-concept inventory. Regression and correlation analyses suggest positive influences of parental care and negative influences of parental overprotection on the development of ego-strength in adulthood. Patients with personality disorders reported to have experienced less maternal care during their childhood and showed a trend towards a reduced ego-strength in adulthood compared to patients with others mental disorders. Relationships of attachment parameters in childhood with personality dimension are explorable. This approach seems meaningful for a better understanding of the development of personality disorders. Clinicians should be familiar with attachment patterns when treating people with mental disorders in order to adequately include appropriate personality dimensions in the therapy. ","859":"Aripiprazole is an interesting psychoactive compound acting as a dopamine D2 partial agonist, serotonin 5-HT(1A) partial agonist and serotonin 5-HT(2A) antagonist. Aripiprazole possesses a well-documented efficacy in the treatment of both positive and negative psychotic symptoms. However, this medication may be rarely associated with the onset of hiccup. Here, we present the case of aripiprazole-induced hiccup in a young inpatient at his first psychiatric admission together with a review of the current literature about this topic. The possible etiology underlying the emergence of hiccups together with the clinical implications of this adverse event are discussed.","860":"Psychiatric consultation and evaluation is an important part of candidate selection for organ transplantation. Psychiatric assessment of patients undergoing transplantation procedure is done in pre- and post-transplantation periods, each one having its specifics. In the pre-transplantation period it is crucial to assess the patient's therapeutic adherence and the ability of understanding the treatment. The main prediction factor for short and long-term success is medical compliance for which thorough clarification of psychosocial support is needed. Symptoms of psychological exhaustion due to physical illness should be distinguished from psychiatric disorders. If a patient has a history of psychiatric illness, the risks of exacerbation or recurrence of a disease need to be evaluated. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics of psychotropic drugs resulting from to organ failure should be considered when deciding on treatment. Psychiatric assessment of the organ donor aims to clarify the psychological suitability and motivation. There are specific aspects of liver, kidney, heart and lung transplantation to keep in mind. Understanding psychosexual development is particularly important to children, before transplantation, as is the assessment of every family member. The consultation concludes with an overall evaluation of the patient's psychosocial strengths and limitations and recommended interventions to optimize the candidacy for transplantation. In the post-transplantation period potential psychological problems or psychiatric disorders must be identified and treated accordingly, in addition to psychiatric side effects of immunosuppressive therapy. The use of psychotropic drugs in the post-transplantation period requires knowledge of medication interactions. Overall, psychiatrists perform multiple roles in the transplantation team. The psychiatrists' goals are to meet the psychological needs of both patients and potential donors, evaluate candidates and to help other medical experts on the team with understanding underlying psychological mechanisms triggered by serious medical conditions and procedures. Finally, the most important purpose is optimal organ recruitment and recovery.","861":"This paper presents an integrative model of personality and personality disorder which incorporates psychoanalytic concepts with modern neuroscience. In addition, a dynamic, personalized, and context - and time-sensitive diagnosis of personality disorder is introduced. The authors cogently argue that all clinical variants of personality disorder share the same common deficit: fragmented basic units of experience at the nonconscious core of the mind (aka \"partial object relations\"). The fragmentation propagates through mental faculties (thought, motivation, emotion), as they self-organize into subsystems of personality, e.g., one's sense of self, identity, character, moral values, rendering them polarized into extreme and thus adaptively suboptimal. The syndrome of personality disorder arises as a nonconscious compensatory maneuver of the fragmented mind to organize itself through a defensive but unrealistic self-image (e.g., narcissistic, schizoid, antisocial, etc.), giving rise to a host of unique symptoms. Symptomatic pharmacotherapy of personality disorder is best organized around four empirically derived domains of symptoms, shared by all variants to a variable degree: i) mood and anxiety dysregulation; ii) impulsivity, aggression, and behavior dyscontrol; iii) emotional disinterest and detachment; and iv) cognitive distortions and brief reactive psychoses. Pharmacotherapy targeting the above domains is nonspecific, as medications affect multiple domains simultaneously. Modest empirical evidence and considerable clinical benefits continue to support the use of medications in the overall symptomatic treatment of personality disorder.","862":"","863":"This study was conducted with the objective of finding out the correlation between synovial inflammation measured histopathologically and subjective symptoms; anxiety and chronic pain, in knee osteoarthritis (OA). Thirty patients were included in the study. Ten of them were in a control group with meniscal injury, ten had early OA and 10 had late OA. Knee radiographs were graded using Kellgren-Lawrence classification. Synovial biopsies were taken during surgery or arthroscopy and synovitis score was measured by Krenns method. Anxiety was measured with Beck Anxiety Inventory and pain was taken as part of the WOMAC score (The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index). Krenn synovitis score was determined as: no synovitis, low-grade synovitis and high-grade synovitis. Group with low-grade synovitis had significantly higher pain score than high-grade synovitis group (p=0.011). No-synovitis group had significantly lower Beck Anxiety Inventory than low-grade synovitis group (p=0.014) and high-grade synovitis (p=0.008). There are no significant differences between low-grade synovitis and high-grade synovitis in anxiety score (p=0.912). Chronic pain is more present in late osteoarthritis, when synovitis is less pronounced. Anxiety affects patients who suffer osteoarthritis, but it is statistically the same regarding synovitis grade, i.e. whether it is early or late osteoarthritis.

Primary objective of this study was to determine frequency of developing anxiety and depression in patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in relation to gender, age and socioeconomic status and to evaluate possible differences between patients with and without high level of anxiety and depression and to find correlation between psychological aspects and disease itself. This study included a total of 120 subjects: 60 patients with asthma and 60 patients with COPD. Data were collected using a socio-demographic questionnaire for general information on subjects, standardized Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Significant difference was found in the anxiety level in these two groups. Average value for the patients with COPD was 43 (15) and for the patients with asthma 37.5 (15.7). Statistically significant difference was also reported for the depression level among females. In female patients with COPD that level was 13.5 (14.7) and in female patients with asthma 7.5 (11). There is a correlation between anxiety and depression in patients with COPD and asthma, especially among women. This study suggests that asthma and COPD are a significant stressor with a risk of developing anxiety and depression.

The research aimed to gain insight into the use of gerontology services for the elderly people, their availability, diversity of information, a range of services they provide, and impact of these services on quality of life. The study population is defined as persons residing in Zagreb, 65 years of age or older, with no physical disability or severe bodily, cognitive or mental illnesses who are users of the gerontology center. The survey was conducted using a customized questionnaire survey on a total sample of 103 respondents. The most significant number of respondents, since they use the facilities, feel satisfied (68%) and very satisfied (28.2%) in their life. More than half of the participants (52.4%) rated their quality of life as very good and excellent, 46.6% of respondents rated their quality of life as good. Issues that effect on quality of life point to the dissatisfaction of the respondents are their financial resources, inadequate health services, and the lack of a positive social network. Community services, such as gerontology centers, enable social network development, new learning, physical activity, which have an impact on physical and psychological health and thus on the quality of life of elderly people. The satisfaction of the respondents using these services was rated above the average (3.71), which indicates that the society is moving in the right direction, encouraging this form of care for the elderly.

The present study focused on the influence of medical professionals' contact with individuals with three mental disorders, namely, schizophrenia, depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in order to determine whether it is contact in general or specific contact with a certain disorder that reduces stigma. A total of 270 nurses, 30 medical doctors and 87 lay people (&gt;75% women) assessed 15 items for each of the mental disorders on a Likert-type scale. The stigma attached to PTSD was of a lower level than the stigma attached to schizophrenia, but higher than that attached to depression. Medical doctors attached the lowest level of stigma to mental illness, and lay people attached the highest. No correlation was found between stigma and age or gender. Those who knew a person with a particular mental illness attached less of a stigma to that condition, but not to the other two disorders. Contact with people with mental illness reduces the stigma associated with people with that same illness, but not that which is attached to other mental disorders.

They have a big influence on the outcome of medical treatment, but also on the cooperability, quality of life, safety of patients, teamwork, cultural sensitivity and fewer complaints to the doctor+s work. In this paper, we present results of our original research about attitudes of doctors and their perception related to the importance of communication between doctors and patients and person-centered approach. This cross-sectional study used a 28 items on-line survey to collect data from doctors in the period from 29 September 2015 till 23 November 2015 by using the Google forms. Total of 939 doctors from the entire Croatia responded. Main results of the study suggest that doctors are aware of the importance of communication between doctors and patients and that education about communication skills was not appropriate during their study. Doctors have undoubtedly expressed their desire for further development and learning about a better communication between doctors and patients and they have showed in this research that they love their job. The research unambiguously speaks in favor of the need of the significant strengthening of this segment within the program of the School of Medicine and support the current changes in the medical curriculum at the School of medicine University of Zagreb. ","871":"The paper in early history of pulmonary medicine deals with studies of hypocapnia as a result of hyperventilation. Hyperventilation hypocapnia provokes respiratory alkalosis, subsequent ion changes in blood may cause disorders of myocardium conductivity and excitability resulted in arrhythmiae and even heart failure. Besides, hypocapnia limits the cerebral circulation which may be manifested in euphoria and even loss of consciousness. It is dangerous component of high altitude disease. Earliest medical descriptions of hyperventilation hypocapnia and its cardiac consequences are traditionally related with publications by an American physician of XIX age J.M. Da Costa and British doctor A.B.R. Myers. There exists a generally accepted eponym of \"Da Costa syndrome\". Hereby the authors for the first time coin data that disorders related to hyperventilation were described more than 360 years prior to Da Costa - by an Italian polymath of Renaissance epoch Leonardo da Vinci and suggest new eponym of \"Leonardo da Vinci's syndrome\".

The biomedical researcher is the central figure in scientific investigation of biomedical phenomena. Both sides contribute to understanding of physiology of health and disease. In this paper, several epistemological, value-related attitudes, ethical and pragmatic differences between the two sides are outlined. Distinguished professional features stem out of differences in respective missions, education, methodology, ethical concerns and ways of reasoning. Clinical expertise is driven by benefits of the patient, whereas researcher expertise is driven by scientific curiosity towards more reliable knowledge. The eight operational and four cognitive\/epistemological differences of scientific versus clinical expertise are shortly discussed. Those pairs of differences are not necessarily reducible to each other. Better understanding of these standpoints may be important for closer communications of two sides and their contributions to applicative and cognitive advancements of human physiology.","873":"Adverse drug reactions (ADR) may be broadly divided into types A and B. Type A comprise the majority of reactions, can affect any individual, and are predictable from the known pharmacologic properties of a drug. Type B are less common, occur in susceptible patients and cannot be predicted. Allergic\/immunologic drug reactions are a group of type B ADRs. Based on the time of onset allergic drug reactions can be divided into immediate and delayed and based on their underlaying immunologic mechanism, they can be further subdivided into 4 groups: immediate and mediated by IgE (1), delayed and caused by antibody facilitated cell destruction (2), delayed and caused by drug immune complex deposition and complement activation (3) and delayed and T cell mediated (4). Physicians should always insist on obtaining a thorough patient's history regarding drug allergy as well as on ascertaining details regarding the medication used, its route of administration, dosage and the treatment duration in order to properly assess risk of drug allergies and suggest further work-up in that regard.","874":"Transplant-acquired food allergy is a well known phenomenon especially linked to liver transplants. Risk factors lie both in transplant recipient and transplant donor - age of recipient and the maturity of immune regulatory mechanisms, family history of atopy in recipient, young age of the donor and atopic history in donor. The exact mechanism has not yet been established and there are many different explanations of this pathophysiologic process. Transplanted liver is a large and well perfused organ, rich in pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells and donor's IgE antibodies that can alter immunological response in the host. Some studies suggest that post-transplant immunosuppression with tacrolimus is linked to an increased occurrence of IgE-mediated sensitization and manifestation of allergic disease. Research in the field of transplant-acquired food allergy is not important only for transplant patients and physicians involved but also for understanding the mechanism of food allergy development in general population and potentially reducing this global health concerning issue.","875":"Anaphylaxis occuring during pregnancy has a potential to cause devastating damage to the unborn baby and the mother. However, majority of adverse outcomes of anaphylaxis during pregnancy frequently affect the neonates rather than the mothers. The negative neurologic outcomes of the fetus are mostly due to delayed caesarean delivery or inadequate doses of adrenaline during anaphylaxis. Most of the current knowledge on this clinical scenario is based on case reports and very few review articles. This is a mini review of the causes, diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis occuring during pregnancy.","876":"Every agent used during the perioperative period may be involved and have the potential to trigger both allergic, IgE and non-IgE reaction as well as non-specific (non-allergic) reactions. In many cases, an allergic mechanism cannot be ruled out and systematic investigations should be tested of all drugs and agents the patient was exposed to prior to the reaction. The complexity of agents used for anaesthesia and surgery present challenges when attempting to identify the culprit drugs and select proper testing to better recognition of trigger. The diagnosis of preoperative anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reaction is clinical and based upon the presence of characteristic symptom and signs that begin suddenly and developed rapidly in most cases. Elevations of mast cell mediators such as tryptase and histamine in the blood can help to distinguish anaphylaxis from other disorders that present with similar clinical picture. The secondary investigations of adverse perioperative drug reactions are highly specialised and include skin testing, in vitro testing and in some cases challenge tests. Any suspected reaction during anaesthesia must be extensively investigated and these diagnostic tests should be done in specialised centres. The cooperation between anaesthesiologists and allergists is necessary to provide the necessary diagnostic tests to identify the responsible drug, to carry out prevention and to provide recommendations for future anesthetic procedures.","877":"JIA is the most common rheumatic disease of childhood and JIA-U is its most frequent and most devastating extraarticular manifestation. This form of uveitis is usually asymptomatic, chronic anterior uveitis, often accompained with complications. JIA-U is the main cause of vision loss and even blidness in childhood. Thus, screening for JIA-U in all JIA patients and early treatment is of prime importance. Over the last 15-20 years, ever since IMT has been used, studies generally show trends toward decrease of JIA-U onset, complications frequency, improvement of prognosis and remission achievement. Despite evident improvements, over 20% JIA-U patients still develop complications in long-term follow-up. Moreover, about 50% JIA-U patients continue to have active uveitis in adulthood. Therefore, JIA-U is still associated with high risk of late sequelae and visual acuity loss, functionally and structurally eye damage and quality of life impairment.","878":"Tobacco consumption is one of the most common preventable cause of premature deaths worldwide. Persisting effects of exposure to tobacco smoke on children and adolescents are apparent during pregnancy and in early infancy, passive exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in home and elsewhere, and active smoking during adolescence. While, lung development in these stages of growth is not complete, tobacco smoke puts children and adolescents in danger of severe respiratory diseases and may interfere with the growth of their lungs. Active tobacco consumption by adolescents may have immediate adverse health outcomes such as addiction, impaired lung growth or reduced lung function. Much of the current evidence comes from longitudinal and cross-sectional longitudinal observational studies and propose that the strongest associations with smoke exposure are in the pregnancy and early childhood. The association of nicotine with respiratory system among children and adolescents is less clearly understood and the evidence primarily comes from in vitro and animal studies.","879":"The use of intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, alteplase, at a dose of 0.9 mg\/kg is an effective treatment for patients with acute ischaemic stroke; this dose is also associated with high intracerebral haemorrhage rates. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the low-dose alteplase treatment is as effective and safe as the standard-dose regimen. This was a retrospective, single-centre study, and data were collected from the Hospital Stroke Registry. Based on the severity of stroke and the risk of intracerebral haemorrhage, patients were divided into two groups according to the alteplase doses given; the low-dose (0.6 mg\/kg) group (n=45) and the standard-dose (0.9 mg\/kg) group (n=165). Ninety-day outcomes measured as modified Rankin score and National Institute for Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, as well as symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage and mortality rates were analysed. The standard-dose group had a slightly more favourable outcome (Rankin score 0-2) at 90 days after alteplase treatment than the low-dose group (64.24% vs. 53.33%), but the difference was not significant. The total intracerebral haemorrhage rate and mortality rate at 90 days were higher in the standard-dose group than in the low-dose group (21.2% vs. 13.3% and 6.1% vs. 0.0%, respectively), but these differences were not statistically significant.

Coping mechanisms and job satisfaction are associated with the incidence of burnout symptoms in a work context. The aim of this paper was to make a systematic analysis of the literature related to nurses' stress and the incidence of burnout syndrome in intensive care nurses, and also to determine the research into associations between coping mechanisms and job satisfaction on one side, and burnout on the other side. Appropriate databases (Scopus, PubMed) were searched with the aim of finding relevant studies and articles published in the last 15 years. The keywords were burnout, coping mechanisms, job satisfaction, nurses, and intensive care. Two independent reviewers carried out a selection of the studies. The literature review found 786 studies about burnout and its association with different variables. Twenty-nine original research papers were discovered in this review process. Open questions still remain concerning burnout and the associations between the considered variables. We also found that studies using a qualitative approach, which could provide better insight into the investigation of burnout, was insufficient in this area. Burnout syndrome is serious problem for healthcare systems and affects almost all profiles of healthcare workers. Although burnout is an evidence-based public health problem, there is still no systematic approach to prevention. Prevention activities to reduce stress and the incidence of burnout should be provided for nurses, especially those in very demanding posts. ","881":"Human physiology is a complex, nonlinear, self-regulated system, in which multiple functional subsystems act within the whole body reactivity. Understanding of physiology and pathophysiology requires integration of both clinical and basic factual knowledge and regulatory homeodynamic concepts. Two integrative methods have been developed to improve understanding of disease processes and natural development. Their features are here shortly presented. Matrix led algorhythmic analysis and re-synthesis puts together patients' clinical data along with a broad academic knowledge which may be relevant to it. Graphic representation enables outlining a multiple interconnections among etiopathogenetic components within the human body. The etiopathogenetic clusters (EPCs) are crossing points, the integrative hubs of disease pathways. Multiple diseases of triggered by independent etiologies often converge to a common EPC, and thus contributing to natural networking of physiological processes in health and diseases. Contemporary biomedical sciences have been daily producing copious amounts of data whose participation in integrative physiology is yet to be explored within the whole body reactivity. Graphic representation and active composition of pathophysiological processes stimulates a synthetic reasoning as a subroutine intellectual habit, critically relevant to both physicians and biomedical researchers. Integrative pathophysiology facilitates anchoring of a whole body and local etiopathogenetic mechanisms.

The task and final goal of education in medicine is to coach students into professionals, effective and ethical practitioners of medicine, giving them the best available knowledge, skills and attitudes and providing them with a professional identity so that they are able to think, speak, act and feel like medical doctors. During the life course human beings organize their experiences into a meaningful narrative that involves their personal, private, public and professional selves. The self can be defined as a distinct principle of identity, as a narrative construction and as an experiential dimension. The aim of this paper is to address the actuality and vitality of the hodegetic approach in medical education and professionalism. By cross-sectional study authors of the paper searched on-line scientific data-bases and analyzed references about Medical hodegetics subject. Drawing on the literature on psychology of self, identity formation and personality styles as well as on own experience in medical education, the authors stress the increasing importance of medical hodegetics, very useful, but almost completely forgotten discipline. Medical hodegetics which involves all evidence-based medicine, values-based medicine, narrative medicine and person-centered medicine can significantly improve the quality of medical education. The identity of any person in any moment reflects its three domains: individual identity, relational identity, and collective identity, all relevant to medical education. The concept of professional identity formation has recently emerged and attracted great attention in literature on medical education and professionalism. Hodegetics, as a discipline that trains it, seems to us that the essential part of life and what every person should follow. Medical hodegetics is an important pillar of the triad of medical deontology as well as it could be an important discipline in medical education and professional identity formation. ","883":"The relationship between the art forms of photography and poetry and mental wellbeing is described, both for the psychiatrist and for the patient. These, as well as other art forms, improve the experience of human persons interior life. It is suggested that these art forms, as well as music and dance, can be helpful in the treatment of Depression.","884":"Neurodevelopmental disorders often result in disabilities associated with auto- and \/ or hetero-aggressive behaviors, that can be defined as \"problem behaviors\" (Lacy 2007). Therapeutic interventions are mainly directed towards the use of neuroleptic drugs or benzodiazepines, to ensure a rapid and significant sedation in most of cases. These pharmacological devices exposes the patient to clinical risks and\/or long-term management difficulties. The main problem of the chronic use of benzodiazepines is the development of tolerance and dependence; furthermore benzodiazepine withdrawal or their abrupt reduction may lead to rebound effect. Regarding the long-term effects of neuroleptics, it is necessary to focus on extrapyramidal effects, motor restlessness and akathisia, anticholinergic effects, as well as endocrine and metabolic alterations. Several studies have shown that the reduction of serotonergic receptor activity is associated with the appearance of aggressive behavior (Farnam et al. 2017), especially impulsive behaviors (Manchia et al. 2017, Takahashi et al. 2012). The dynamics that subtend these data are still not fully clarified, however there are evidences that the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) is helpful in the treatment of aggressive behavior in mental disabilities (Sterke et al. 2012, Janowsky et al. 2015). In this study we observe the behavioral response to sertraline, for minors, and to vortioxetine, for adults, considering that the literature shows significant evidence of modulation of synaptic neuroplasticity (Waller et al. 2017). To support the observation we used behavioural scales to collect the data, before the administration of the drug, during the course of treatment, at 3 months from the start of the administration. We detected the improve of behavioral disorders with the less use neuroleptic drugs and benzodiazepines.","885":"Autobiographical and clinical accounts of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have highlighted that these individuals experience several difficulties during the decision making process. A review of the experimental based studies assessing performance in decision making tasks compared to controls emphasizes key differences including altered risk preferences, decreased sensitivity to social rewards, increased deliberative reasoning and atypical integration of emotional cues. Despite several attempts to devise cognitive theories to explain these differences, none so far can account for all the differences seen. However, one key observation, consistent with clinical accounts, is elevated levels of anxiety in populations with ASD. Whilst this has traditionally been considered a bi-product of the decision making process, I argue that increased anxiety may directly influence decision making in individuals with ASD, through 2 main routes. Firstly, elevated anxiety overwhelms Type 1 (intuitive) fast processes (within the Dual Process Model), leading to a decision making style biased by Type 2 (deliberative) processes. In addition, heightened anxiety decreases cognitive flexibility, leading to a more logic based, deliberative decision making style. This is superimposed on pre-existing cognitive impairments which altogether may account for the differences seen. Therefore, anxiety must be considered as a key variable in cognitive models of decision making in ASD. Specific recommendations for future research exploring the role of anxiety are discussed.","886":"Scars can result from a range of causes: accidents, surgery, and even acne. The resultant change in appearance can negatively affect body image and self-confidence. Scarring is stigmatised in society because of the premium placed on beauty - disfigurement or unsightly features are still used to portray evil in horror films, comic strips, and fairy tales. Patients describe scars as living with the trauma and sufferers can feel devalued by society. Scars are inflexible and cause functional impairment which may prompt a change in career and have financial repercussions. Those with scars undergo a remodelling of their emotional state and are more prone to the development of depression and anxiety; feelings of shame and aggression can follow. This creates strain in social interactions, resulting in stunted communication, reduced intimacy, and avoidant behaviours. There is limited treatment available to address the psychological burden in this subset of patients. Additionally, doctors often lack training in recognition and management of psychosocial issues. Steps must be taken to relieve the physical, emotional, and psychological marks caused by scars.","887":"With only half of individuals prescribed medication actually taking it, the reasons behind non-compliance warrant a thorough understanding. This paper reviews the factors behind medication non-adherence with a special interest in the link between depression and non-compliance. Whilst this link has been evidenced, we propose that non-compliance could be a presenting sign of underlying depression. Implications of the role of depression as a cause of non-compliance - in particular, why a patient might suddenly stop taking their medication - are discussed; further, early intervention to circumvent a major depressive episode could be implemented if recognition of sudden non-compliance is used by clinicians as a diagnostic tool to alert them to screen the patient for depression.","888":"The orthogonal axes of Thought (T), Action (A), and Mood (M) span a phase space which corresponds e.g. to the three medial thalamic areas related to three resonating cortico-subcortico-thalamo-cortical loops. The above three of several loops constitute an \"appropriative engine\", since within that space, as hinted to via Fig. 228 by Emil Kraepelin to illustrate bipolar mixed states, circular waves of appropriative functioning - from need via action to e.g. satisfaction - reflect a spectrum of temperamental to anxio-affective signatures of sequential appropriation waves. This neo-classical \"dyn4TAM\"-model also posits that a prime (thalamic) motivating system of Uncertainty-orientation (R. M. Sorrentino) regulates the temperamental balance between only 4-dimensional (D)-\"Thought\" (G. Halford) about effort-sparing models and high-D-\"Action\" (G. Rizzolatti) meaningfully related to movement. In fact the exchange across this \"complexity divide\" - between \"grasping\" action-related high-D-modules and \"calculating\" 4D-modules of brains - even concerns the grounding of symbolic relational \"concepts. \" It thus expands on the Franco-Kraepelinian \"TAM\"-System (FKS) which suffered a distortion by Kraepelin and the eliminative eugenicist Wilhelm Weygandt, unfortunately carried on in the \"bipolar spectrum\" current. Because the above loops are independently segregated they generate true dimensions. Furthermore the phenomena they jointly create become patterns, i.e. independently filled slots. Now these are irremediably destroyed at acquisition by Galtonian statistics which is detrimental to conceiving dimensional topics. Here we posit that preponderantly \"uncertainty-oriented\", calculating academics unless depressed, are attracted by 4D-Thought and repulsed by intuition. They thus avoid bio-psychologically the \" comprehension\" of patterns. New research initiated by dyn4TAM confirmed, that the homologous rodent sign-tracking depends on mast cells modulating the ACC-loop for \"Action.\" The \"complexity divide\" warrants more attention in clinical and pure cognitive sciences and should include a \"psychology of statistics\". ","889":"In this paper we identify some of the critical factors that contribute to the ongoing shortage of psychiatrists in the UK. We discuss initiatives that have been launched to try and encourage more medical students and trainee doctors to choose psychiatry as a career. We describe the innovative anti-stigma Wounded Healer programme that was pioneered in the UK with the aim of improving the image of psychiatry and psychiatrists and that was subsequently scaled up and rolled out to over 65,000 medical students and doctors in 14 countries in five continents worldwide. We conclude, with some suggestions that we believe will help recruitment efforts into psychiatry.","890":"Deliberate self harm is the strongest predictor of completed suicide. Primary care is often the entry point for those presenting with self harm and suicidality and so the primary care follow-up of such patients should include risk assessment for repeated self harm and completed suicide. This is of particular importance in patients at high risk for suicide, such as those with Bipolar Affective Disorder. This audit makes recommendations for the average UK GP Teaching Practice based on standards from the NICE guidelines relating to the prevalence, timing and content of follow-up in primary care of those patients who present with self harm or suicidality in the practice population.","891":"Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are front-line pharmacotherapies in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), a disorder characterized by a persistent low mood, anhedonia and feelings of worthlessness. Since their formulation over 40 years ago, there have been several conflicting studies exploring the efficacy of these highly prevalent drugs. The nature of their therapeutic effect has also remained elusive, with several hypothesises pertaining to neurotransmitter and endocrine modulation proposed. While the medications are better tolerated than their predecessors, the tricyclic antidepressant family (TCAs), the side effect profile of SSRIs is not insubstantial and novel cases have highlighted adverse effects enduring past the cessation of drug treatment. Data gathered from clinical practice also highlights that the prevalence of these side effects is often underestimated, leading to patient frustration and non-compliance. This report will seek to outline the rise of SSRI usage in the last half century while exploring possible avenues of pharmacotherapeutic action, with a particular focus on the side effect profile of these drugs.","892":"Dignity therapy was administered to ten prisoners in a detention center. The Beck Depression Inventory was administered before and after the intervention. The results obtained from the Beck Depression Inventory have highlighted dimensional changes in all the prisoners.

There is a connection between the artist and the viewer. This is so with famous artists, but also with patients who create artworks. This link between artist and viewer can be used in therapy to explore the artist\/patient's interior self. This understanding between artist and viewer can , in therapy, become an expression of caring.","894":"Music Therapy can be broadly described as the use of Music in a therapeutic context in order to help improve mental health. Music Therapy does not simply imply the playing of music to patients, relaxing though this may be, but in fact it does involve more active involvement of the patient, so as to use the power of music in order to help improve the mental health of patients and in order to treat mental health conditions. We review the evidence for the effect of Music Therapy on Depression, Anxiety, Schizophrenia, Sleep Disorders, and Dementia. Encouraging singing appears to be a good adjunct to treating all of these conditions, and it also seems to help bonding between mothers and children within families. Music appears to be beneficial to both the individual, and also to the improvement of social cohesion. The reasons for this must reside in the nature of music itself as an art form which supports human interactions within society.","895":"Present knowledge about the neurobiology of music is discussed and summarised. Music playing, reading and listening are all complex processes requiring co-ordination of various parts of the brain in hierarchically structured sequences. The involvement of the right hemisphere of the brain in musical functions is well established, however in fact both hemispheres are involved. Plasticity is heavily involved in all functions of the brain related to music. The role of mirror neuron systems of the brain appears to be of great importance and parallels exist in the development and functioning of language and music.","896":null,"897":"Depression is one of the most frequent mood disorders. The spectrum of its meanings is very complex. Symptoms of depression can be felt at every stage of life. Depressed mood states can, as for intensity, show the clinical picture that varies from mood changes to psychotic states. In this presentation, it is described a case of the patient who since early childhood showed the symptoms of ADHD that was showing as a comorbidity feelings of depression, which have significantly hindered the emotional maturation of the person. This etiological clarification has led to effective treatment, including the psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic approach.","898":"Through the analysis of \"Luigi Alfredo Ricciardi\" the main character of detective series by Maurizio De Giovanni, the structuring of a normal melancholic constitution, which we term the depression-prone style of personality, is reconstructed.","899":"It is reasonable to affirm that madness is inborn with the human spirit and that only in lunacy it is possible to be creative, being the intellect a system of rules that make possible to live with the least conflict possible, as masterfully said by Umberto Galimberti. To understand madness we must glean our lunacy and put aside the reason which relates to the non contradiction principle thus being not capable to comprehend madness that does not respond to the rational principles, whereas as Schopenhauer says, is the essence and the strength of the will to live.","900":"Multidrug-resistant epilepsy is a pathological condition that affects approximately one-third of patients with epilepsy, especially those with associated intellectual disabilities. Several non-pharmacological interventions have been proposed to improve quality of life of these patients. In particular, Mozart's sonata for two pianos in D major, K448, has been shown to decrease interictal electroencephalography (EEG) discharges and recurrence of clinical seizures in these patients. In a previous study we observed that in institutionalized subjects with severe\/profound intellectual disability and drug-resistant epilepsy, a systematic music listening protocol reduced the frequency of seizures in about 50% of cases. This study aims to assess electroencephalography as a quantitative (qEEG) predictive biomarker of effectiveness of listening to music on the frequency of epileptic discharges and on background rhythm frequency (BRF).","901":"Syphilis is a complex disease, which can lead to General Paralysis of the Insane if left untreated. Before antibiotics this was the natural progression of the disease, with many people being admitted to mental asylums with the diagnosis of GPI, and going on to die there. Diagnoses however, were difficult, as it was difficult to distinguish between GPI and other mental conditions such as bipolar disorder. We can use the works of the classical composers Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann and Smetana, who all suffered from mental illness, to gain an insight into what it is like to live with these conditions. All these are potential cases of GPI, highlighting how a sexually transmitted disease can end the life of such talented and influential people. With antibiotic resistance becoming a growing concern, it is key that we continue to recognise and treat syphilis in an appropriate manner, so as to limit the future of this disease.","902":"The geniuses Robert Schumann and Vincent Van Gogh show striking similarities both in the longitudinal nature of the progression of their illnesses, and the symptoms they experienced. There have been physiological explanations posed for both men, including Meniere's disease, tertiary syphilis, acute intermittent porphyria, terpenoid and lead poisoning, intracranial masses, temporal lobe epilepsy and dementia caused by vascular hypertension. The evidence for these physiological explanations is assessed. Schizophrenia and Bipolar disorder have also both been postulated to explain the symptoms of the two men, but neither man perfectly fits the diagnostic criteria for either. Schizoaffective disorder is a term used to describe patients who experience symptoms from both the psychosis of Schizophrenia and the mood disorders of Bipolar disorder. This paper aims to explain why Schizoaffective disorder explains the symptomology of these men better than either Schizophrenia or Bipolar disorder does alone. Schizoaffective disorder, however, did not exist as a diagnosis when Van Gogh and Schumann were alive, and so was not considered by their physicians.","903":"It has been argued that aesthetics, or the appreciation of beauty, can be used in therapy. We explore this concept from the point of view of new findings in neurobiology which give us an understanding of the mechanisms by which we experience beauty and creativity. We argue from anthropological perspectives that the experience of beauty is common to all cultures, and leads to the experiencing of important abstract concepts which enhance our lives, but which may be described differently in different cultures. We are beginning to understand how these abstract concepts are perceived, but this does not mean that the concepts themselves do not exist. Indeed, a Thomistic view of the human person will predict that there will be a mechanism within the body to express every bodily function. Based on this we argue that doctors should encourage their patients to appreciate beauty itself, as they understand it, because experiencing it can be therapeutic.","904":"Music therapy and attachment is an expanding field and the number of studies addressing the theoretical work is slowly growing. There are both qualitative and quantitative approaches to studying the effect of regular music therapy sessions on parent-child interactions and these cover a range of patient populations including: children at risk of neglect, parents with a trauma history, children coping with bereavement and a large number addressing the disability population, including autism spectrum disorder. These studies suggest that music therapy benefits the parent-child relationship through the improvement communication, especially non-verbal communication, and so increased the feeling of closeness and understanding. Following a review of the available literature, a pilot study is described using transcripts of video recordings of music therapy sessions, and subsequent colour coding and conversion of the data into pie charts provides a potential method of analysis that produces an \"interaction profile\" of each parent-child dyad. Preliminary results of this method of analysis suggest that music therapy sessions might be able to improve interactions through therapists addressing the power dynamics within a relationship. The new method developed in this pilot study to visualise and study the parent-child relationship in music therapy sessions was effective and could be used and developed by music therapy researchers in the future.","905":"In this article we wish to discuss recent work on neurobiology and visual arts, with impact on human pleasure, wellbeing and improved mental health. We wish to discuss briefly our model of the Human Person and apply it to Visual Art, and we wish to discuss our view of how empathy has been suggested as an important factor in how visual art can impact the human person, with its links with neuroscience and anthropology, and thus how Visual Art can put Human Beings in touch with their deepest feelings and even with the ineffable.","906":"Many young patients who are cyberbullied maintain communication with their harasser, despite the fact that this behaviour perpetuates the harassment. Numerous studies describe coping strategies adopted by cyberbullied adolescents. None describe what motivates adolescents to continue to communicate with their harassers. We conducted a literature review of cyberbullying, taking into account the challenges of adolescence. We used several search engines (Scopus, PsycINFO, Cairn and PubMed), using the following keywords: cyberbullying, teens, behaviour, coping strategies, social network, Facebook, counterpart. Our search returned 526 results, which were subsequently sorted as a function of their relevance. We also consulted reference books on adolescent psychology. The adolescent, whose identity is being rebuilt, seeks a peer group, but also a relationship with a counterpart. This search is replayed on social networks and can lead adolescents to meet a counterpart harasser. Studies show that adolescents who suffer from cyberbullying are more likely than others to be in search of new friendships, and use social networks to make up for a lack or absence of fulfilling social relationships. They have fewer friends, have more difficulty maintaining social ties, and have fewer communication skills. In addition, cyberbullied adolescents have poorer relationships with their parents and teachers than their peers. Narcissistically fragile adolescents are at greater risk of being unable to stop communicating with their cyberbully. If the adolescent has no other relationships that enable him or her to develop their identity, they will be unable to put an end to this harmful counterpart relationship. It would be interesting to supplement this review with an experimental study, and to consider the development of new, secondary prevention strategies in the adolescent population. ","907":"Anorexia is a frequent pathology; not only does it cause major changes in patients' quality of life, but also the mortality rate is high. This mortality mainly affects young people. However, care remains controversial. The aim of this literature review is, therefore, to review current guidelines. A review of the literature published between 2006 and 2017, from articles contained in the Cochrane, PubMed, Scopus and PsychINFO databases. Keywords were 'anorexia nervosa', 'adults' and 'management'. Patient management must be multidisciplinary and prioritise weight gain. For this to happen, outpatient monitoring must include a gradual normalisation of eating habits. This always involves psychotherapy and sometimes prescription medication. However, no specific therapy or psychotropic drug has demonstrated statistical superiority in the management of anorexic patients. Cognitive behavioural therapy remains the most effective therapy in preventing relapse, and family therapies for the treatment of young patients who are still living with their families of origin. Hospitalization is sometimes necessary and must then include gradual and closely monitored refeeding to avoid the potentially fatal refeeding syndrome. The management of anorexic patients is complex but always involves reaching a normal weight. The best prognosis is found in young patients with the least chronic disease. ","908":null,"909":"What is the meaning of piercing and tattoo in sixteen years old? What are the deep reasons, affective and relational, that explain the explosion of this \"fashion\" among teenagers? The recent spread of these practices among young people and very young people offered the opportunity to reflect on the value attributed to the body manipulation in teenager growth context. Inked bodies, pierced, and other similar manipulations, express a communicative intention, whose strength is proved by the violence of these practices. The sense of the message, however, risks remaining obscure to adults, who lack the tools to decode it. Self-injury begins as a general expression of a lack of integration between oneself and the alienation of one's own body, resulting in conflicting and split feelings. Many manifest a behavior of disrespect, disapproval, devaluation of the bodily ego, whose self-injurious gesture would represent a particularly dramatic expression. The variability that characterizes the manifestations of self-injury prevents one from applying to a universal definition, valid under any circumstances. Instead it reveals the conceptual flexibility of self-injury that appears itself as a peculiar product in the current historical time. In a society that increasingly accepts various forms of transformative intervention on the physicality of each, where piercing and tattoos, once considered barbaric practices, now these become ordinary practices, a distinction between ornaments and self-injuries becomes necessarily confused (Levenkron 1998). The ego leak is unnecessarily buffered, occluded, braked trough any means (food, alcohol, substances, self-injury, shopping, kleptomania) because the bets are not really the shape of the body but the possibility to escape the dissolution of the Self. Self-injury and eating disorder have many common factors: impulsive, ritualistic, hidden behavior characterized by shame and guilt. These are experiences that use the body to resolve psychological conflicts and feelings of tension, anger, loneliness and emptiness. The two syndromes report a distorted image and a deep disdain of their body, lived as an enemy to fight, punish and anesthetize. The body that gets sick is very often of a teenager. The food and the obsession with the shape of the body have a primary value because they validate the identity structure, precarious, shaky, of personality in progress. The adhesion to the symptom is understandable only from this point of view, this self-destructive research, carried out to the bitter end, would not otherwise be explained if underneath there was not the fear of the disagreement of the ego. The body becomes the refuge, the theater where you can experience the emotions that you cannot tolerate in life. The problem that revolves around the emotional life is just that: we feel that we cannot control our emotions, and unable to support them from within, we try an external control. All teenagers experience pubertal transformations in a problematic way, as accepting them requires the cognitive integration of one's body into a positive image.","910":"In our society that sets high standards of perfection to be ok and wins, the depressed is commonly considered as an outsider, a marginalized person unable to be in line with standards and rhythms fast and competitive of the time we live. So the social stigma against people who suffer from mood disorders is a very powerful factor that negatively affects the healing of patient. He is often isolated from the others for the fear of being judged \"fool, crazy or dangerous\" or discriminated and emarginated for his mental health problem. For this reason, a cornerstone of depression rehabilitation is the bringing out of the patient from his isolation, the reintegration of user in the social context with the increase and the improvement in the quality of interpersonal relationships in the family and in the external context. So in this way is possible an increase in the tone of mood and a reduction of the symptoms of depression. The method used in our project is the dance movement therapy. In particular, dancing the \"Bachata\" and later more spontaneous dance becomes a rehabilitation tool to express emotions through the body and to open to the world, on the territory, overcoming the fear of being judged by others, the prejudice and the social stigma about mental illness. This work presents the results of a case report of a depressed patient treated with dance movement therapy.","911":"The reality of social networks in recent years has taken on new and enriching scenarios, to learn more about the problems and complex dynamics of life that surround the generations of preadolescents and adolescents. This work has matured over several years, interacting with schools in the Campania region (southern Italy), meeting and talking with teachers, parents and students, observing the reality that surrounds them. The territory of Naples and its province was the one in which the activity was mainly carried out. It has been found that the new frontiers of youth language find their maximum form of exposure in sharing, exhibition, media \"exposure\", through the channel of the narration of their daily life \"live\" (most of the time), often it implies a high probability of incurring dangers and dangers that are difficult to manage, as \"children\" of an age in which to exhibit is in conformity with the historical moment. The definition given by the experts is \"Digital Natives\", \"Digital Immigrants\" are adults, who have a different and less fluid approach compared to the reality of youth. Dangers, pitfalls and others are amplified through the simple sharing of one's own experiences. This work benefited from the help of various professional figures, which made sure that some difficult aspects and contexts could emerge. Some problems of this reality linked to social networks are distinguished in a more specific and authentic way.","912":"Exposure to traumatic events has been a part of human existence since the beginning of time; however modern lifestyles and developments mean that the majority of the population are spared the affliction of extreme trauma. The military, however, are one subgroup of individuals who are actively and repeatedly exposed to terrifying events on a regular basis, putting them at risk of developing \"Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder\" (PTSD). Despite this, the prevalence of PTSD reports in the UK military remains lower than its international allies, suggesting this value may be an underestimation of the true prevalence. Wider investigation of the potential causes of this has highlighted the stigmatization of mental illness in the military as the key barrier to the help-seeking behaviours. However, the effect of national de-stigmatization programs on PTSD help seeking is unclear. This review aims to determine the prevalence of PTSD within the UK military in the context of other international powers and examine how stigmatization of mental illness in military may contribute to this. The international value of de-stigmatization programs will be debated and future directions for research suggested.","913":"Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) fell out of favour towards the end of the 20th century with the advent of effective and well-tolerated antidepressants. It is now experiencing somewhat of a 'renaissance' in England, with an 11 percent increase in the number of ECT treatments carried out in 2015-16 compared with 2012-13, which represents approximately 2,000 additional treatments. This paper seeks to examine clinical trials comparing the efficacy of real ECT with simulated ECT in treatment-resistant depression (TRD) to determine whether the resurgence of ECT in recent years is justified. A PubMed search was performed to identify clinical trials comparing real ECT with simulated ECT. 6 trials met the inclusion criteria. These were then analysed, and their methodology assessed. 5 out of the 6 trials found real ECT to have a greater antidepressant effect than simulated ECT. The trial that showed no significant difference used a unilateral electrode placement. Analysis revealed significant weaknesses in the trials. There is clear evidence that real ECT has a greater antidepressant effect than simulated ECT when a bilateral electrode placement is used, despite the weaknesses identified in the trials. Continued use of ECT to treat TRD in England and other countries should be encouraged. Further research is needed to better understand its mechanism of action and refine the techniques used. ","914":"Among asylum seekers (AS), mental health conditions are highly prevalent. However this population group has poor access to adequate services and frequently incurs discontinuity of mental healthcare. Many factors explain discontinuity of mental healthcare for asylum seekers. The aim of this study is to evaluate if facilitation of care for AS decreases healthcare provider stereotypes of this population and improves their continuity of care. General practitioners (GPs) and mental health professionals (MHPs) were invited to participate in a vignette study, presenting an AS patient manifesting post-traumatic stress symptoms. We randomly manipulated the context of the clinical vignette to create two experimental conditions: facilitated care versus non-facilitated care. In each condition, we measured participants' stereotypes and continuity of care. There was a significant effect of participant's type of stereotypes on continuity of care (F=2.87, p=0.035). However, we found no effect of condition (facilitated vs. non facilitated care) on stereotypes (F=0.11, p=0.95), nor on continuity of care (F=0.35, p=0.55). Furthermore, there was a significant effect of profession (GPs vs MHPs) on continuity of care (F=11.43, p=0.001). Participants' number of consultations per week (F=10.33, p=0.002) and their gender (F=3.69, p=0.030) both have a significant effect on continuity of care. Among healthcare providers, we found that \"admiration\" stereotypes were associated more with continuity of care. Paradoxically, continuity of mental healthcare was better among GPs compared to MHPs. Thus, improvement of continuity of mental healthcare for AS among MHPs should be investigated in further studies. ","915":"The number of forced hospitalizations has increased across Europe. One way to reduce these is to set up mobile crisis teams. A reform of psychiatry in Belgium allowed the creation of these mobile teams. These offer an alternative to forced hospitalization. 196 situations were referred to the mobile crisis team located east of Brussels in 2017. We examined the orientation of these requests according to the applicants and the reasons for them. It appears that the health sector has the best indications for using the mobile crisis team. Access to psychiatric care is of major importance in Western societies. The creation of mobile teams increases this accessibility and should reduce the need for forced hospitalizations. These observations must be confirmed. ","916":"The present retrospective study is aimed at assessing the clinical and psychopathological correlates of violent behaviors in a sample of acute involuntary committed inpatients. Involuntary inpatients were retrospectively assessed for the presence of violent behaviors. Patients with and without overt hetero-aggressive behaviors were compared according to socio-demographic, clinical and psychopathological features. A stepwise backward logistic regression was performed in order to assess the variables most associated with the perpetration of violent acts. The sample of violent patients was then divided in two subgroups on the basis of the presence\/absence of a serious mental illness (SMI). Bivariate analyses were performed between SMI and non-SMI violent patients. In the present sample of 160 inpatients, 88 (55%) perpetrated violent acts. Subjects who performed violence presented a higher rate of mood stabilizers prescription (p=0.038). The PANSS-excited component was positively associated with violent behaviors (p=0.027, Odds Ratio (OR)=1.14, Confidence Interval (CI) 1.01-1.28), whilst the PANSS-depressed\/anxiety factor displayed a negative association (p=0.015, OR=0.78, CI 0.64-0.95). Violent inpatients diagnosed with SMI presented higher rehospitalization rate (p=0.009), longer length of stay (p=0.005), more frequent long-acting injectable antipsychotics prescription (p&lt;0.001) and a higher positive symptoms severity as measured by the PANSS-positive factor (p=0.049). The clinical population of acute psychiatric inpatients performing violent behavior represents a specific and heterogeneous subgroup of patients for which prevention and treatment strategies should be addressed. ","917":"Major depressive disorder (MDD) represents one of the main diagnosis of admission to the inpatient psychiatric unit, because of the frequent comorbid suicidal behavior. It is a clinically heterogeneous diagnostic category comprising a various array of symptoms presentation. This clinical heterogeneity can represent a challenge for treatment, and patients are often discharged with substantial residual symptomatology that still impacts functioning1. Characterizing subtypes of major depressive disorder ad admission could possibly help tailoring treatment and improving outcomes. The aim of the study was to detected clinical signs at admission for tailoring treatment (that includes pharmacotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, individual psychoeducation) in order to prevent suicide, improve quality of life and reduce re-hospitalization. Tailored treatment was routinely implemented in a sample of patient with a major depressive episode consecutively admitted to an inpatient psychiatric unit from 1st april 2018 to 31st august 2018. Results showed that, at 5 months follow up, it was associated to symptoms reduction, improved quality of life and reduction of hospitalization. The limited sample size, the absence of a control group and the naturalistic structure of the study, limit the generalizability of those results. However, those preliminary findings could provide a blueprint for a larger study and a longer follow up.","918":"The prejudices about mental illness and the related social stigma are still present in the population. People suffer from both the disease and the marginalization behaviors implemented by the \"so-called healthy\" towards them and their relatives. Even psychiatric professionals can get sick and suffer for the same reason. The authors of this multicentric study have focused their attention on the presence or absence of groups of psychiatric pathologies among the \"insiders\". The most frequent pathologies encountered were the mood and anxiety disorders, in a percentage similar to that of the general population. To continue the research on the stigma begun in a previous study, the authors asked themselves if there could be prejudices and\/or stigma among psychiatric professionals towards sick colleagues, how they relate in the workplace and how they react to the behavior of colleagues. The stigma questionnaire has been used on psychiatric professionals, and 130 Italian colleagues were tested in the provinces of Avellino, Brindisi and Trento. The data were compared with those of the research on the stigma \"Thinking of Psychiatric Disorders as\" Normal \"Illness\" (Tavormina et al. 2016) and it emerged that among the attending professionals there are no statistically significant behaviors of marginalization, exclusion or stigma against sick colleagues, even if there is a certain discomfort in working together. Above all, it emerged that 80% of the interviewees, who have had work experience with sick colleagues, have replied that the latter can treat those who are also sick of their own disease, thus showing esteem and confidence in their work, in analogy with the Jungian thesis of the \"wounded Healer\" in the myth of the centaur Chiron.","919":"The links between psychiatry and immune dysfunctions are well known. By contrast, there are few studies that evaluate the link between neuroelectrophysiology and immune system disturbances. We retrospectively included 31 patients hospitalized between 2011 and 2012. They completed a sociodemographic questionnaire and were assessed using DSM IV TR on Axis 1. Event-related potentials were performed. Lymphocyte subtypes were quantified using flow cytometry. In terms of P300 latency, there are correlations with the absolute value of leukocytes: for P3a component, we find a correlation in frontal derivation Fz (r=0.405*), in central derivation Cz (r=0.438*), in parietal derivation Pz (r=0.403*) and for P3b component, there is a correlation in Fz (r=0.414*), in Cz (r=0.402*) and in Pz (r=0.425*). In terms of P300 amplitude, for P3b component, there are correlations with CD3 lymphocytes percentage in all derivations (Fz (r=-0.621**); Cz (r=-0.567**); Pz (r=-0.499**)) and with CD19 lymphocytes percentage in all derivations (Fz (r=0.469*); Cz (r=0.466*); Pz (r=0.430*)). For P3a, it is correlated with CD3 percentage (in Fz (r=-0.539**); Cz (r=-0.406*)) and with CD19 percentage (Fz (r=0.364*); Pz (r=0.357*)). With respect to the relationship between mismatch negativity (MMN) amplitude and natural killer (NK) cells percentage, there are correlations in left temporal derivation T3 (r=-0.426*), in Cz (r=-0.401*) and in right temporal derivation T4 (r=-0.427*). A correlation is found between the contingent negative variation (CNV) amplitude and the lymphocytes percentage in Fz (r=-0.471**). There is a link between lymphocyte-related immunity and electrophysiological disturbances in psychiatric patients. Further studies would be needed to evaluate this relationship more specifically, particularly prospectively and by pathology. ","920":"Given the poor efficacy of disease modifying treatments and evidence that Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathophysiology begins in middle-age, efforts to reduce the substantial disease burden have shifted towards preventative intervention in midlife. Up to a third of all AD (the commonest cause of dementia) is attributable to modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. A tool for predicting risk of future dementia using only cardiovascular risk factors has been validated and the effect of lifestyle modification on future cognitive decline is under investigation. In the UK, the QRISK3 risk calculator is used to quantify 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease. Lifestyle changes and lipid modifying therapy are recommended to patients based on their risk score. We will compare the emerging evidence for dementia risk assessment and risk reduction using cardiovascular risk factors with the evidence used to support the implementation of QRISK3 for cardiovascular disease risk assessment and intervention. This will guide future research to determine whether cardiovascular risk assessment can also be used to inform patients of risk of future dementia and advise on risk reduction strategies, in a primary care setting.","921":"The United Kingdom National Screening Committee (UKNSC) defines screening as \"the process of identifying individuals who may be at higher risk of a disease or condition amongst large populations of healthy people\". Building on foundations laid by Wilson and Jungner in the landmark paper in 1968, the UKNSC states that \"Once identified, those individuals can consider further tests, and healthcare providers can offer them interventions of benefit. A screening programme needs to offer more benefit than harm, at a reasonable cost to the NHS\" (gov.uk 2014). We will consider the ethical issues surrounding some of the UK's screening programmes and other methods used to assess and communicate patients' risk of disease. We will discuss the appropriateness of candidate dementia biomarkers in order to inform research into developing such a biomarker or series of biomarkers.","922":"An increasing number of human behavior scholars are redirecting their professional curiosity towards studies carried out with innovative research and intervention methods, far from the obsolete and reductive systems of analysis of the past. As part of these studies, aimed at the individual's bio-psycho-social betterment, the fascinating perspective of using the opportunities offered by a trip as a catalyst for important changes, has an important place. A sort of 'Journey' in the Journey, in which the suspended space-time of a travel can be the frame for innovative and interesting situations of parallel discovery of one's inner world. According to Hippocrates, therapy was not just a question of medicine and diet, in fact the cure he gave to his patients included also a trip to an island in order to temporarily move away from their environment, and therefore from the context that, somehow, had contributed to the emergence of the disease. Furthermore, the journey in itself, produces extraordinary beneficial effects. According with another study, for example, conducted by the Global Commission on Aging and Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies, in partnership with the U.S. Travel Association, women who vacationed every 6 years, or less, had a significantly higher risk of developing a heart attack or a coronary death, compared to women who vacationed at least twice a year. Similarly, another study showed that men who did not take an annual vacation had a 20 percent higher risk of death and 30 percent greater risk of death from heart disease. (www.globalcoalitiononaging.com, 2013) As regards the therapeutic value, the idea of facing a fascinating \"Journey\" in a Journey, could prepare the individual to enter in a sort of a suspended space, in which, according to many authors, the travel can induce both psychophysical and psychosomatic beneficial changes. For this reason, Body and Mind project, prepared by the Genius Academy Research and Psychological Studies Center, started in 2015, thanks to a protocol of intervention which includes associated psycho-physical inductions, with the aim of demonstrating the increase in the level of well-being (from the 30% to the 60% ). The research, continued in 2016\/17 with the objective of raising the level of well-being perceived and measured, has shown a further health improvement. This improvement was evaluated and compared to data expressed by measurement of heart rate, blood pressure, hours of night time sleep, headache, sense of anxiety recorded an increase in well-being of 67% by stimulating the organisms affected by a specific suffering such as depression in the oncological patient. As the results of three years of study have been so encouraging, it was decided to continue the research by making the necessary changes to contextualize the Body and Mind project within a travel situation. The project a \"Journey\" in the Journey, which for the last five years optimizes the opportunities offered by a trip to promote the psychological growth of individuals through prescriptions, work shops, seminars, drinking and talking, social dreams, has therefore widened the research space, also bonding the objectives of the Body and Mind project. A \"Journey\" in the Journey in the places of Body and Mind, develops along two main directions: 1) the places of Body and Mind; 2) the Body and Mind project. But the red thread that binds and unites the study and research initiatives we have talked about is always the same: the innovative strategic approach where the individual is at the center of the scene, in contexts where life is live and where it is always the person to have the role of leading actor.","923":"Sleep disorders are commonly studied from the psychiatric and neurological point of view, leaving aside other aspects such as genetic component. Despite the limited literature regarding this field, different genetic variants have been proposed to be associated with sleep disorders. In this review, we summerize the experimental research that has brought to light the pivotal genetic influence in the development of these pathologies.","924":null,"925":"Personality disorders are a class of mental diseases characterized by inflexible and maladaptive patterns of behavior, cognition, and inner experience, involving several areas of functioning, such as affectivity, impulse control, ways of perceiving and thinking and reaction to stress factors. In the literature, personality disorders have always been described as stable patterns of long duration, and their onset can be found during adolescence or early adulthood. These patterns are associated with significant distress or impairment in a patient's life in which a main element affects every aspect of living, and in which no biological or other pathologies exist to assist in its identification. Therefore, they often lead to comorbidities such as dysfunctional anxiety, drug abuse, major depression and suicide. We present a case of a 37-year-old man, who came to the outpatient department needing support to quit smoking. During the follow up, he described some transitory changes in his personality while watching football (soccer) games. These episodes were characterized by inappropriate anger crises, rapid and dramatic shifts in emotional tone, dysphoria and superstitious and magical beliefs with paranoid elements; connecting himself, his family and friends to players in the match and to the unfolding of the game. Every manifestation was induced by the football match, and there were no signs of difficulty in handling impulses and in managing relationships, or any superstitious beliefs, outside of it. The combination of all the symptoms led us to think about a diagnosis of the borderline personality disorder. There was a lack of managing impulsivity, intense uncontrollable emotional reactions, and episodes of psychotic decompensation with unreal and paranoid connections made between the patient's entourage and the results of the match. With this case, we propose to consider the personality disorder, not just as a stable and inflexible pattern, but also as a transitory dysfunction induced by stress factors, as in this case, a football match, introducing therefore a new entity: transient personality disorder. ","926":"The physical and mental health of a population is based, in particular, on its quality of life and its access to health care. Given these determinants, Greece's population has greatly suffered due to the sharp cuts in the budget for social benefits and health care (some measurable evidence is the recent increase in the suicide rate). Starting January, the 1st of 2015, unemployment benefits in Belgium have been eliminated for all recipients who do not have a full-time year of work over the last three years. Therefore, we must ask whether there will be similar psycho-medical consequences for Belgium's population. Open study over a year (01\/07\/14 - 30\/06\/15) of emergencies admitted to the University Hospital Center of Mont-Godinne including a psychopathological motif. In addition to general socio-demographic data, psychic disorders are measured, as well as different types of crises (familial, professional or couple crisis), familial support and its dynamic (FACES III of Olson) and finally social integration (social isolation scale from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP)). These patients are compared with those admitted during the six months preceding the Act modifying the unemployment benefits. Between July the 1st of 2014 and June the 30th of 2015, we saw an increase in the number of admissions to the psychiatric emergency department by 2.5% in six months, despite a decrease in the number of admissions to all-cause emergencies. Our study also shows a degradation of social network quality characterized by a more pronounced social isolation of our patients. At last, an alteration of cohesion in the patient's origin family was highlighted. Although we cannot establish a direct causal link between this law and the results of this study, these may suggest a weakening of the population mental health due to difficult socio-economic context. As a result, we are faced not only with a public health problem but also with one concerning health care organization. ","927":"The Precision Psychiatry is a new emergent topic in Psychiatry, and is \"an approach for treatment and prevention that takes into account each person's variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle\". It promises to be even more transformative than in other fields of medicine, because the psychiatry has not yet benefited from the advanced diagnostic and therapeutic technologies that now form an integral part of other clinical specialties. It may be an epistemological change in the field of psychiatry. This paper briefly highlights the story, the features, and the future of the Precision Psychiatry. Indeed, this approach is becoming a reality with the availability of massive data (derived from physiological recordings, brain imaging, 'omics' biomarkers, environmental exposures, self-reported experience).","928":"The relationship with the environment is one of determinants of the health status of the human population. Many aspects of today's society negatively affect the environment and, consequently, human health. In particular there seems to be a prevalence of diseases, linked to environmental pollution, which affects the female gender, almost to assume a role of gender pathogenicity. But the female gender is also the promoter of changes; in fact, women are more sensitive to environmental health and adopt more appropriate behavior to prevent environmental damage. It is precisely in the balance between these two aspects that we can see a factor promoting behaviors to combat the effects of environmental pollution on the mental health of Man.","929":"The importance of maternal care for a harmonious development of the child has been at the center of the interest of child psychology since the second half of the twentieth century. Great scholars such as Lorenz, Harlow, Spitz and Bowlby have asserted that love for mum does not have its roots in satisfying the need for food, but in the need for protection and if there is a lack of care the consequences are extremely negatives. Nowadays, epigenetics is finding the biological basis of the effects of maternal care, if they are present and affectionate, and even if they are lacking or absent. A report of 5 cases helps to understand the importance of maternal love.","930":"In Wexford and Waterford, an \"out of hours\" child psychiatric service has been developed, in order to provide help when the regular Child Psychiatry services (CAMHS) are not accessible. Providing a service for under 18 years old patients with mental health issues presenting in the Emergency Department (ED) of a General hospital, it functions with extremely limited resources (a consultant psychiatrist and a doctor in psychiatric training), and therefore needs an efficient triage procedure. The purpose of this article is to review the literature about existing triage tools, and especially the 2016 Irish Children's Triage System (ICTS) and to discuss how to optimise triaging our specific patients in this new 'out of hours' CAMHS cover for Waterford \/Wexford area. CONCLUSION: A post triage tool and some clinical changes could improve the service.","931":"Denial of pregnancy is an issue that is often discovered a posteriori with sometimes dramatic complications. Denial of pregnancy is considered partial when the woman becomes aware of the pregnancy after the fifth month before delivery. The populations studied were heterogeneous, which made it impossible to establish a standard algorithm of the treatment and support of a discovery of partial denial of pregnancy. Based on a literature review and a discussion of partial denial of pregnancy case and the consequential treatment with a five-year follow-up, the global management recommendations need consideration in the case of partial denial of pregnancy. The reported case confirmed the significance of the trauma caused by the discovery of pregnancy in a patient in denial, but also showed that this trauma can extend to caregivers concerned by the treatment. Continuous training of all caregivers for denial of pregnancy is essential even if the issue may be considered infrequent. Contraception, prevention of sexually transmitted diseases and the importance of gynecological follow-up must be systematically addressed in a medical consultation. A standard algorithm for the treatment of partial denial is difficult to establish, but the rapid mobilization of a multidisciplinary team or hospitalization is recommended for the announcement of the diagnosis as well as personalized support during ultrasounds. The establishment of a relationship of trust remains the major issue. ","932":"Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), which is linked to the use of antipsychotic medication, is a potentially lethal neurological emergency. The interest of our study is that NMS induced by the use of clotiapine has never previously been described. We present the case of a 61-year old man whose sleep disorders were treated with clotiapine 40 mg\/day. After 7 days of taking 40 mg clotiapine, the patient presented with a deterioration of his general health which had gradually taken hold, with altered consciousness accompanied by generalised muscle rigidity and hypersalivation. Laboratory blood tests revealed elevated levels of Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK) at 812 U\/l. The patient was diagnosed with NMS and treated accordingly. The mechanism that underlies the appearance of NMS remains largely unknown. Clotiapine is a second-generation antipsychotic, first released onto the market in the 1970s, and is available in a few countries, including Belgium. NMS is treated as a medical emergency due to the possibility of morbidity and death. The first step in the treatment of NMS consists in withholding the agent suspected of provoking the symptoms. NMS is difficult to diagnose due to a great variability in clinical presentations and the absence of specific tests and laboratory results. The use of clotiapine in treating sleep disorders can provoke NMS as a life-threatening side-effect. To our knowledge, this is the first time a case of clotiapine-induced NMS has been published. ","933":"Although physical restraint is still used in psychiatric inpatient settings, it sometimes causes serious side effects, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and resulting pulmonary embolism. The aim of this study was to review the literature investigating the incidence of the DVT in restrained psychiatric patients, to identify the risk factors of this condition and the effectiveness of routine prophylaxis. Studies investigating associations between deep vein thrombosis and restrained psychiatric patients were searched in the Pubmed database. More than 700 articles were sorted independently by two of the authors using predefined criteria. Only research articles, reviews and meta-analyses were selected for this review. 5 articles published between 2010 and 2016 were selected. Although antipsychotics and restrain are known to be thrombogenenic, in all retrospective studies, with anticoagulant prophylaxis for those restrained for more than 12 or 24 h, incidence of DVT in restrained psychiatric patients was almost not existent. Controversially, in a comparative study by Ishida, although deep sedation and physical comorbidities were associated with the occurrence of DVT, not using of anticoagulants was not associated with any increased incidence of DVT. DVT may be overlooked because psychiatric patients are often unaware of leg symptoms because of their psychiatric disease and induced sedation. Furthermore most DVT, in particular distal DVT are asymptomatic. When screened and assessed with more appropriate methods such as plasma D Dimer and ultrasound scanning the incidence of DVT reaches 11.6%. The incidence of DVT in restrained psychiatric patients was not low in spite of prophylaxis. These findings emphasize the importance of regular screening of and thorough assessments of DVT, especially in restrained psychiatric patients. ","934":"There are medico-psycho-social indications to apprehend the alcohol use disorder (AUD) as a chronic problem for which a continuous care is necessary. The perception of continuity of care is also associated with positive outcomes on the patient's health. Communication between caregivers is essential to maintain a good continual care. In order to put patients back into the center of care, we asked them the question: \"why should the psychiatric department (PD) and general physicians (GP) should communicate about AUD patients\"? After a week of hospitalization for alcoholic withdrawal, we used a qualitative approach with 4 open questions to explore AUD patients' point of view (N=17) about the best way of communication between psychiatrists and GP to improve care continuity. The data collection was carried out in the psychiatric department of the University Hospital of Mont-Godinne, Belgium. AUD patients consider that the GP is the first line actor that will be consulted after hospitalization and have a privileged relationship with him. These arguments justify him being informed. Concerning these patients, communication is useful to have a continuous treatment and project care, for purposes of symptoms' evolution follow-up and so as to help the GP to understand them better to follow the evolution of symptoms and to help the GP to understand them better. From AUD patients' point of view, communication between psychiatric department and the GP is useful for a perspective of continuity of care at discharge from the hospital. This communication seems to be at the service of the GP and his patient rather than for the psychiatrist himself. Mainly because of the GP's role as a privileged first-line care, but also thanks to the specific relationship relating him to his patient. ","935":"Many clinicians do not have adequate knowledge and interest in assessing cognitive deficits in psychiatric patients. However, these deficits are crucial and key symptoms, which can lead to impairment of quality of life, worsening of symptoms of disorders and difficulties in social, family and work relationships. Another limitation to the assessment of cognitive deficits is the poor maneuverability and practicality of the main cognitive assessment tools. Because there are no appropriate pharmacological approaches, new techniques have been developed to improve cognitive abilities in these patients. The most important techniques concern cognitive remediation (CR). In this article we summarize the main techniques of cognitive remediation.","936":"In a two-year study we compared the efficacy of noradrenergic (duloxetine D) and serotonergic (escitalopram E) antidepressants with and without the addition of 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in subjects suffering from a major depressive episode (MDE). The results showed that the D + ASA (DASA) group improved more rapidly than the E + placebo (EP) subgroup. In particular, Hamilton Depression Scale (HDS) scores improved as early as two months, Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scores improved at five months, and remission rates were better. In the course of this study, we also investigated the role of the therapeutic relationship (alliance) on both the progress of the MDE, and patients' mental and physical health. 40 people suffering from an MDE were randomly assigned to treatment groups. At the beginning of the study sociodemographic data were collected, and the Helping Alliance Questionnaire (HAQ) was completed. During the study, patients were regularly assessed using the HDS, CGI and the Short Form Health Survey (SF-12). Subgroup comparisons revealed that HAQ scores are not correlated with HAD scores, but a correlation was found with remission rates (r=0.316*). Similarly, at all times, HAQ scores were correlated with physical health (p&lt;0.05), which is in turn correlated with HDS and CGI scores. Physical health is linked to the level of depression. While the alliance with the patient is not directly correlated with the intensity of depression, is it correlated with their physical condition and its improvement. For patients, improving their physical health appears to be more important than improving their mental health. These observations must be confirmed. ","937":"The temperament is a key factor when assessing a patient within the bipolar spectrum. The temperaments are conditions in their own right within the bipolar spectrum, since they are 'soft' forms of bipolar condition within the spectrum: they can develop over time into a more clear bipolar condition, and hence are important in early diagnosis. Bipolar disorders are very often diagnosed late (approximately 25 year late, on average, from the beginning of the illness), in part because the temperaments of the patients have not been identified early.","938":"Deadly shark attacks, cancer from meat, toxic beer: Our health seems to be threatened seriousely all the time.

They may be characterized by prominent subjective suffering, frequent chronic courses of illness, increased rates of comorbid other psychiatric disorders and somatic diseases, a distressing amount of psychosocial disabilities, in all, a challenging high burden of disease. Anxiety disorders have principally to be conceptualized within a multifactorial biopsychosocial model. Various psychological and psychosocial approaches have contributed to a multi-layered understanding of various major predisposing, eliciting, and maintaining factors in the course of illness. Modern neurobiological research has significantly broadened and deepened the aetiopathogenetic complexity of anxiety disorders. The main focus of this short review is on neural fear- and anxiety circuits, neurotransmitter systems, neuroendocrine and inflammatory stress systems, genetics and epigenetics that characterize the general basis of fear and anxiety regulation and their dysregulation in anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorders may be effectively treated both by psychotherapeutic and pharmacological approaches. Basic principles and general guidelines in the treatment of anxiety disorders are being presented.","940":"The aim of this study was to assess subjective, human aspect of the medical condition, evaluate the quality of life (QOL) and level of depressive symptoms in patients with watery eye and compare it with patients with two most common causes of visual deterioration: cataract and macular region pathology. The results of this study may serve to raise awareness of watery eye impact on a large number of patients and subsequently promote their treatment in order to restore full visual and life quality necessary for normal human functioning. In this prospective, randomised, questionnaire-based study, we have surveyed three groups of patients with a total of 210 patients: group with the watery eye of different etiology (n=69), group with one pseudophakic eye and one cataract eye (n=73) and group with the unilateral pathology of the macular region (n=68). All three groups underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination. To examine the overall quality of life we have used a modified vision-related quality of life questionnaire (VR-QOL) and to evaluate depression level \"Beck Depression Inventory - 2\". The results were analyzed with statistical program STATISTICA 13. Compared to group with unilateral cataract eye and to group with unilateral pathology of the macular region, the results of this study show that patients with watery eye have significantly decreased quality of life in all daily activities, particularly in outdoor activities (F=125.80, df=2\/143, p&lt;0.01), during sports (F=36.67, df=2\/143, p&lt;0.01) and interpersonal relations (F=18.73, df=2\/143, p&lt;0.01). Results between three groups showed that group with watering eye expressed highest depression level and group with one pseudophakic eye and the other cataract eye the lowest (F=25.86, df=2\/207, p&lt;0.01). Watery eye has a significant impact on vision-related quality of life. Our research showed that patients with watery eye had expressed more depressive symptoms than other groups, but still without statistically significant value. Since it affects a large and heterogenic group of patients it is important to be recognized on time and treated etiologically in attempt to restore full function and life quality. The results of this study may serve to raise awareness of watery eye impact on a large number of patients and subsequently promote their treatment in order to restore full visual and life quality necessary for normal functioning. ","941":"Burning mouth syndrome is a condition of unknown etiology, characterized by burning symptoms on the otherwise clinically healthy oral mucosa. Central and\/or peripheral neuropathy is one of the proposed causes for this condition. Psychological component in these patients is also very present, as it is known that BMS patients exhibit high levels of pain, anxiety, and depression. The aim of this study was to evaluate anxiety and depression among patients with burning mouth syndrome and a control group. We also further review and discuss the literature available on this subject. A total of 93 subjects, divided into two groups, participated in this study. The group of patients with BMS included 43 participants, while the control group consisted of 50 participants. Self-reported STAI (State anxiety and Trait anxiety) and BDI questionnaires were used to evaluate anxiety and depression in subjects in both groups. BMS group had higher average total scores of state anxiety, trait anxiety and depression. The difference between the BMS group and control group was statistically significant for state anxiety scores and BDI scores. We might conclude that BMS patients are more anxious (state) and depressed when compared with the control group. However, they do not differ from the control group regarding anxiety as a trait. Thus we might conclude that feeling of anxiety in general starts after the BMS symptoms first occur and last for a longer period of time.

Its main focus is to explore the roles of different types of close relationships in these models. The sample consisted of 521 female students attending University of Rijeka and University of Pula (average age 21.21 years). The participants completed The Big Five Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory-II, Social Interaction Anxiety Scale, Social Phobia Scale, Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, Attitudes Towards Emotional Expression Questionnaire, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule - Expanded Form, Satisfaction with Life Scale, Quality of Relationship Inventory and Friendship Quality Questionnaire. The results were processed using the program LISREL 8. Two models have been tested. The first model includes the relationship between both types of social fears, beliefs about expressing emotions, emotional suppression, romantic relationship quality and the frequency of experiencing positive and negative emotions and life satisfaction. The second one included friendship quality, instead of romantic relationship quality. Both models are acceptable and draw out the powerful role of cognition in the aforementioned relations. This is achieved as a result of beliefs about the expression of emotions on other variables, and also confirms the mediatory role such beliefs have on social anxiety and emotional suppression. The models tested show the importance of the type of close relations we are following. The contribution of this research lies in the point that it offers a more detailed insight into the complex relation between social anxiety and the experiencing of emotions, as well as the quality of life in general. This is achieved in the way that structural modeling has captured a part of the mediator mechanisms that have a role in this relation.

The goal of this research was to analyze the relationship between socio-economic status, lifestyle and health status, availability of health-care, social capital, and satisfaction with life. Subjects were 1117 women aged 25-65 years divided in two groups. Group 1 consisted of women who receive public assistance (N1=591), while Group 2 consisted of women who do not (N2=526). The sample was stratified by random choice into multiple stages based on six regions of Croatia, residential area size, and the age of respondents. Visiting nurses surveyed the deprived population, while in Group 2 self-interviewing was conducted. A questionnaire entitled \"Inequalities in health\" was used. The respondents participated in this research voluntarily and anonymously. Socially deprived women consume spirits and wine more often (p&lt;0.001). There is no difference between groups regarding tobacco consummation. Working women perform significantly less strenuous physical tasks (p&lt;0.001). Deprived women are significantly less engaged in physical activities (p&lt;0.001). Health conditions in deprived women more commonly limit their physical activity (p&lt;0.001).

In this study convenience sampling technique was used, the sample consisted of 1000 young adults who were from the eight universities in two big cities; Istanbul and Ankara. Besides with demographic questionnaire, Inventory of Statements about Self-Injury and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire were used. The prevalence of NSSI was 28.5% and the most prevalent three self-injurious behaviors were wound picking, banging\/hitting and pinching self. There was not a gender difference in NSSI behavior frequency but in the type of behavior; males had significantly higher percentages of hitting and burning behavior. Examining the intrapsychic and interpersonal functions of NSSI, \"affect regulation\" and \"toughness\" functions were the most used ones among the participants. In terms of gender differences, \"revenge\" function was used by females more than males. Self-injurers had higher childhood abuse scores on sexual, physical, and emotional abuse and neglect subscales than non self-injurers, and males were significantly more abused than females. Accepting childhood abuse as an important predictor of NSSI behavior, screening and assessment of abused children and adolescents can help to prevent the onset of the behavior.

The aim of the study was to quantitatively present the trends in Google searches for the keyword \"suicide\" and to analyze its correlation with the number of suicides in Poland. We used the Google Trends tool to compile data for years 2004-2016. Statistical analysis was performed for annual, monthly, daily and hourly data. Official data on suicide in Poland were obtained from the Central Statistical Office and the General Police Headquarters of Poland. A gradual decrease in Google Relative Search Volume of the keyword \"suicide\" was observed in years 2004-2014, despite the significant increase of suicide rate in Poland (R=-0.24). Reverse correlation was also found between regional suicide coefficients and search volume (R=-0.22). The highest search volumes were recorded in winter months, first days of the week and at night hours (p&lt;0.001). Presented results may contribute to more effective suicide prevention programs.

","949":"Fascinating developments in big data technologies and unprecedented diffusion of social networking sites (SNSs) generate unseen opportunities for scientific fields, including psychiatry. This study focuses on the use of SNSs by adolescent psychiatric patients and the potential use of SNS-generated data to help medical practitioners diagnose and treat patients' mental health. Our objective is to understand and measure the psychiatric and individual conditions in which symptom-sharing occurs on SNSs and the frequency of these conditions. Based on literature, we hypothesized that the perceived value of social network sites positively affects adolescents' sharing of symptoms on these sites. An empirical test of this hypothesis was conducted with a survey of 224 adolescents admitted to a psychiatry clinic in Turkey. The hypothesis was tested using a hierarchical multiple regression analysis. The perceived value of SNSs explained an additional 37.8% of variation in symptom sharing on SNSs above and beyond the control variables, which are gender, age, type of disorder, and amount of internet and SNS use. The findings suggested that adolescents share symptoms on SNSs only if they attribute value to the SNSs that they use. We also found that 72% of adolescents in our sample shared their symptoms on SNSs. There is an attractive opportunity for information technology companies to develop, together with health professionals; data analytics that are able to detect symptoms to support psychiatric diagnoses and pave the way for big-data enabled personalized medicine.

Despite its advances, organized medicine is beset with inefficiencies and imperfections. The extent of burnout and stress for health professionals is documented in this scoping review. The impact on mental health is described and an approach based on a slower medicine is advocated.","951":"The authors discuss the issue of psychiatric care and patients during the second half of XX century in Albania, when the country was under an absolute regime of communism. Completely isolated from the rest of the world, the territory remained a prohibited area for scholars, and local authors due to censorship or self-censorship, offered very scarce information. The general feeling of the public was that of a denial of psychic disorders in total, combined with the fear that this kind of disorders has ever since provoked. Nevertheless, insanity defence was a formulation encountered with a certain frequency in Albanian judicial procedures, although forensic psychiatry was a peripheral part of an already neglected medical specialty. The entire system of psychiatric care was mainly hospital based, and shock therapies (electroconvulsive therapy, pyretotherapy, insulin coma) were normal part of the therapeutic armamentarium along with antipsychotics and social isolation. Some recently unclassified documents and some archival papers, whose exhaustive consultation needs further study, might shed light to the problems of a psychiatry, that are not substantially different from the ones encountered in the Eastern communist Europe of the same period of time.","952":"Different ways of thinking about policy-making for public and global mental health are constantly emerging. Turning patients into consumers and mental health into commodity may open the door for dystopic future of mental health care. Research has indicated that practicing love, kindness, and compassion for ourselves and others builds our confidence and sense of coherence, helps us create meaningful, caring relationships, increases individual and community resilience and well-being, promotes human rights, physical and mental health. Public and global mental health promotion may be predicated on the theory of salutogenesis and three key inter-related terms: empathy, coherence and resilience. The WHO Mental Health Action Plan 2013-20120 is based on the vision of a world in which mental health is valued, promoted and protected, and has four objectives: to improve leadership and governance, health and social care, promotion and prevention, and information and research. Practicing public and global actions that promote and educate empathy, coherence and resilience may significantly help achieving equality for mental health in the 21st century and improving public and global mental health.","953":"","954":"","955":"Network meta-analysis is a methodology for comparing different treatments or modalities including both direct comparisons and indirect comparisons based on a common comparator. While this provides a wealth of opportunities in psychiatric research, both designing a network meta-analysis and interpreting the same requires meticulous care. This brief reports lists key features of a network meta-analysis and highlights the importance of careful interpretation with a few examples from recent psychiatric research.","956":"Modafinil is a psychostimulant drug prescribed mainly for treatment of narcolepsy but is used as a \"smart drug\" by wide populations to increase wakefulness, concentration and overall mental performance. The aim of this study was to assess potential developmental toxicity of modafinil. Pregnant female mice were given either saline or modafinil (50 mg\/kg orally) from gestational day (GD) 3 to GD 10 and then a challenge dose on the GD 17. The male offspring were treated analogously at the age of 10 weeks. Changes in the spontaneous locomotor\/exploratory behaviour and anxiogenic profile in the open-field test were assessed in naive animals, after an acute and 8th modafinil dose and the challenge dose following a 7-day wash-out period. One month after completion of the behavioural study, the leukocyte phagocytosis was examined by zymosan induced and luminol-aided chemiluminiscence assay in vitro. The most important finding of this study was the immunosuppressing effect on leukocyte activity, hypolocomotion and increased behavioural response to modafinil-induced psychostimulation caused by prenatal exposure to the same drug. We did not detect significantly altered anxiety-related behaviour in any group disregarding the pre- and postnatal treatments. This is the first evidence of developmental toxicity of modafinil which needs to be taken into account as a potential risk factor when modafinil is administered to women who may become or are pregnant. ","957":"Various types of addictions often co-occur, particularly substance and behavioral ones, which affects the clinical course of mental health disorders as well as the efficacy of therapy and rehabilitation efforts. The present study aims to explore gambling activities and possible gambling addiction among alcoholics in an outpatient treatment in the city of Zagreb. Gambling activities were assessed in 140 members of alcohol addiction clubs in the City of Zagreb (Croatia). Participants were undergoing treatment after being diagnosed by their psychiatrist with alcohol dependence syndrome based on ICD-10 criteria. Intensity of gambling-related problems was measured using the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS), while intensity of alcohol addiction was assessed using DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for alcohol use disorder. All instruments were self-report forms and were completed using pen and paper in a group context during outpatient treatment. Pathological gambling was more prevalent in this clinical subsample than in general populations analysed in other studies. Alcohol addicts showing problematic or pathological gambling behaviors tended to play more highly addictive games (sports betting, slot machines, roulette). However, intensity of gambling-related problems did not correlate significantly with the intensity of alcohol addiction. These results confirm studies from other countries showing higher prevalence of problematic and pathological gambling among alcohol addicts than in the general population. Gambling behavior in our sample more often involved games with greater addictive potential. These findings suggest that alcohol addicts should be systematically screened for problematic and pathological gambling, which may improve therapeutic efficacy and rehabilitation, as well as reduce relapse in addictive behavior in general. ","958":"The purpose of the current study is to investigate the relationship of symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) to childhood trauma and personality characteristics among patients with the diagnosis of mixed anxiety-depression disorder. A total of 130 patients who were admitted to the psychiatry outpatient and were diagnosed with mixed anxiety-depression disorder were conveniently sampled in the current study. In order for the researchers to complete the assessment, the patients with a history of at least one traumatic experience (40.8%, n=53) were asked to complete a socio-demographic form, the Beck Anxiety Inventory and Beck Depression Inventory, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form, the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version, and the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire Revised\/Abbreviated Form. One hundred thirty patients participated in the current study. In the study, 40.8 % of the patients (n=53) reported that they had been exposed to at least one traumatic event during their lifetime. Patients with a history of at least one traumatic experience (40.8%, n=53) were separated into two groups: those with a diagnosis of PTSD (n=21) (39.6%) and those without PTSD (n=32) (60.4%) (cut off score is 50 and above). The mean comparisons concluded that the group with PTSD and the group without PTSD were significantly different from each other in terms of depression and anxiety symptom severity, neuroticism, and history of physical abuse and neglect. Spearman's correlation analysis revealed that PTSD severity was significantly and positively correlated with neuroticism, and with depression and anxiety symptom severity, as the scores were significantly and negatively correlated with extraversion. The two-step logistic analysis first revealed the severity of the depression symptom, and secondly, physical abuse significantly predicted PTSD in the PTSD group. In patients with anxiety and\/or depressive disorder, PTSD is one of the most frequently-observed comorbid psychiatric disorders. The current study revealed that a history of childhood trauma, neuroticism, and introversion can be considered risk factors for PTSD among patients with mixed anxiety-depression disorder in adulthood. Therefore, it should be taken into consideration that those neurotic and introverted patients with childhood trauma history could be more at risk for PTSD.

The aim of this study was to compare differences in erythrocyte parameters (red blood cell count (RBC), hematocrit (HCT), hemoglobin (HGB), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and red blood cell distribution width (RDW)) in patients with schizophrenia (SHZ), unipolar depression (UD) and bipolar disorder (BIP): bipolar depression (BD) and mania (BM). This was a retrospective, cross-sectional, naturalistic study of 2381 patients (SHZ n=1244; UD n=794; BIP n=343, BD n=259, BM n=84). There was significant difference for all red cell parameters between study groups (p&lt;0.001). Age and sex may affect various erythrocyte parameters. There are differences in erythrocyte parameters between schizophrenia, unipolar depression and bipolar disorder.

Positive correlations between age and MCV and RDW and negative correlation between other parameters and age were found in all study groups. ","961":"Suicide is a complex action of suicidal methods and peripheral factors with seemingly threatening components representing actual cause for the suicidal actions. It is especially those, apparently unimportant factors that represent a crucial milestone in the network of all the other, personal, cultural, genetic and biochemical factors, forming the method of action consequently deciding between life and death. Based on the Register of Suicides in the Republic of Slovenia kept by the University Psychiatric Clinic Ljubljana, we used a combination of attributes varying within a variable and between variables. Due to limited application of standard statistical methods and analyses in such cases, we used the Machine learning method, Multimethod hybrid approach, which allows combining of different approaches to machine learning (decision trees, genetic algorithms and supplementary vectors). The research included 56712 persons attempting suicide and 21913 persons committing suicide. We chose a form of a suicide action with both possible results: attempted suicide and suicide. Based on the analysis of machine learning, we defined attributes of the action regarding their lethal effect: attempted suicide and suicide commitment. The suicide register kept for the last 40 years shows hanging as the most commonly used suicidal method, used by men with the purpose of causing suicidal death rather than a suicidal attempt. On the other hand, use of medicaments is linked to the suicidal attempt and mostly used by females. All methods of suicidal actions cannot predict suicidal death, thus we examined different methods of suicide to most accurately predict the link between the method and its effect in terms of suicide attempt or suicide. The Machine learning method confirmed the attributes of suicide methods in connection with their different outcomes. This analytical method is useful in processing large databases since it enables one variable's intensity to affect other variables in terms of result and meaning. The identification of the most decisive risk factors for suicidal behaviour can serve as basis for planning an effective prevention strategies, timely identification and adequate proffessional help to the high risk persons.

Participants were assessed for depressive symptoms with the Beck Depression Inventory-II, for temperament\/character dimensions using the Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised, and for attention deficit\/hyperactivity symptoms using the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale. Counseling-seeking students were more likely to have attention deficit\/hyperactivity symptoms, scored higher on the Beck Depression Inventory-II and on the Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised Harm avoidance, and lower on the Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised Self-Directedness, compared to controls. Medical students applying for counseling should be carefully assessed for depressive symptoms, attention deficit\/hyperactivity symptoms, and temperament characteristics; depressive and attention deficit\/hyperactivity symptoms could be the focus of counseling interventions. ","964":"Behavioural investigation has become increasingly more focused on emotional intelligence as researchers strive to understand its influence on various social interactions. Recent research indicates that EI plays an integral role in adopting active and effective coping strategies. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between emotional intelligence and coping strategies in patients with schizophrenia. The research included 102 stable patients with ICD-10 diagnosis of schizophrenia. The sample consisted of 46 (45.1%) female and 56 (54.9%) male patients, in the 18-55 age range (M=35.54; sd=10.48). All the participants completed the Questionnaire of Emotional Intelligence and Competence (UEK-45) and the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS). Data were analysed using the correlation coefficient and linear regression analysis. The results showed that emotional intelligence correlates significantly with both task-oriented and avoidance-oriented strategies (including social diversion and distraction). Regression analysis revealed that emotional intelligence can be a significant predictor for these two coping strategies (task-oriented and avoidance-oriented strategies (including social diversion and distraction)). Patients with lower emotional intelligence mainly use strategies focused on coping with their own emotions. These results may prompt the devising of prevention and treatment programs for patients suffering from schizophrenia. Namely, numerous studies and research on emotional intelligence show that emotional intelligence can be enhanced through learning and behaviour modification at any age. ","965":"Dysfunction of social-cognitive abilities is one of the hallmark features of schizophrenia and is associated with neurocognition and social functioning. The Green and Nuechterlein model proposed that social cognition mediates the relationship between neurocognition and functional outcome. We tested this hypothesis in schizophrenia patients in the everyday clinical setting. Social cognition, executive function and social functioning were assessed in a group of 43 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder using a range of measures. Theory of mind was associated with executive functions and social functioning. Results of our mediation analysis suggested that the relationship between executive functions and social functioning was mediated by theory of mind. No relationships between emotion recognition and the domains of social functioning were found. In line with prior research, zero-order associations were found between theory of mind and social functioning. Theory of mind was a mediator of the relationships between neurocognition and social functioning. Our results suggest that theory of mind should be a potential target of interventions to improve social functioning. ","966":"When designing clinical trial or considering decision to take part in particular clinical trial as investigators, even before submission to responsible Central Ethic Committee, we always make certain private assessment about ethical justification of this clinical trial. When making assessment if any clinical trial is ethically justifiable, there should make no difference in which country this clinical trial will be executed. Physicians coming from developing countries must ensure that patient population of developing countries is not misused in any ethically questionable clinical trial. There must be careful assessment of clinical protocols by various independent local advisory committees (e.g. hospital review boards, hospital drug committees, hospital administration and whatever is applicable) to exclude the possibility that only one person or one group of people has concentrated power to make decisions for entire country. Many times physicians\/clinical researchers from developing countries are faced with the criticisms that they are not of the same quality as physicians from developed countries and that they can be easily bribed by sponsors, which are based on the prejudice that any clinical trial can be executed in developing countries, no matter of quality or risks for patients. Physicians coming from developing countries must ensure that patient population of developing countries is not misused in any ethically questionable clinical trial.","967":"Guidelines for the management of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) do not meet the criteria of evidence-based medicine and better-quality research is required to inform clinical practice. Current treatments of resistant depression remains largely empirical. There are no bench-mark antidepressants. Clear and justifiable rationale should be followed while initiating new treatment strategies; systematic planning and careful monitoring of progress implemented while new treatment components are added. Biological psychiatrists should give due importance to the non-biological aspects of depression and psychotherapists should not overlook the biological correlates. Unidimensional solution will not work for a complex illness like refractory depression and a single answer should not be sought as a cure because the aetiology of depression is multifactorial and the pathophysiology itself remains unknown. Psychopharmacological interventions are still the main stay of treatment of TRD. There are two major alternatives to pharmacotherapy: neuromodulation and psychotherapy. Alternative terminologies for TRD like MTR-MDD (Multiple Therapy Resistant-Major Depressive Disorder) are being introduced reflecting the frustrations of clinicians and patients with the conventional definition of TRD and treatment modalities.","968":"Traumata, by definition, refer to exterior events that expose a person to experiences of overwhelming threat and catastrophe and elicit feelings of death anxiety, panic, horror, helplessness, loss of personal control, and intractability. Most affected persons respond with at least some distressing symptoms of trauma-related memory intrusions, autonomic hyperarousal, dissociation, and depression in the acute aftermath. Fortunately, the majority of traumatized individuals succeed in coping with this major stress quite well during the following weeks and months unless the process of recovery is hampered by additional adverse psychosocial circumstances, psychological disposition or biological vulnerability. In a subgroup of persons a transition to acute and posttraumatic stress disorder or other major psychiatric disorders, e.g. depressive, anxiety, substance-related disorders may be observed. Posttraumatic stress disorders very often run a chronic course of illness enduring for many years or even life-long. The typical course of illness in PTSD is characterized not only by major psychiatric comorbidities contributing to a dramatically reduced health-related quality of life, to many deficits of psychosocial adaptation and a heightened suicide risk. It is also associated with a lot of major somatic health problems both in acute and long-term stages. The main focus here is on this special dimension of physical comorbidities in posttraumatic disorders. Empirical evidence underscores that trauma exposure, and in particular PTSD is significantly associated with major physical health problems in addition to well-known PTSD-related psychological, behavioural, and psychosocial impairments. Both self-report-based and objective assessments emphasized significantly increased rates of somatoform\/functional syndromes and physical comorbidities, premature all-cause and specific mortality rates, heightened medical utilization behaviours, major socioeconomic costs, and reduced health-related quality of life in the aftermath of trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorders, thus defining a major challenge to any medical care system. Complex psycho-behavioural-somatic and somato-psycho-behavioural models are needed to better understand both acute and long-term effects of a perpetuating stress system on physical health.","969":"Personalized or precision medicine is a relatively new promising concept which is gaining momentum in all branches of medicine including psychiatry and neurology. Psychiatry and neurology are medical specialties dealing with diagnosis, prevention and treatment of brain disorders which are the main causes of years lived with disability worldwide as well as shortened life. Despite a huge progress in clinical psychopharmacology and neuropharmacology, the treatment outcome for many psychiatric disorders and neurologic diseases has remained unsatisfactory. With aging, comorbidities are more the rule, than an exception and may significantly influence on the final treatment outcome. Epigenetic modulation, resilience and life style are key determinants of the health and very important issues for understanding therapeutic mechanisms and responses. There is a hope that epigenetic profiling before treatment could be used in near future to increase the likelihood of good treatment response by selecting the appropriate medication. The aim of this paper is to offer an overview of the main aspects of epigenetic modulation, resilience and comorbidities and their role in developing the concept of personalized medicine. While waiting for more precise and reliable treatment guidelines it is possible to increase treatment effectiveness in psychiatry and neurology by enhancing individual resilience of patients and managing comorbidities properly.","970":"Anxiety disorders are among the most common mental disorders. Anxiety disorders and neurotic fear cause significant disruption of the psychosocial functioning of the individual. In generalized anxiety disorder, neurotic fear appears in the form of fears, expectations, tension, with nothing specifically uncomprehendingly crying anticipation, worry, poor concentration, psychic and physical fatigue, irritability, restlessness, insomnia, sense of near accident etc. Traumatic events in the life of the individual are often referred to as potential relevant factors in the occurrence of psychological disorders. Exposure to long-lasting traumatic experiences in childhood leads to the prolongation and fixation of the emotional state of fear and sadness and the emphasized use of certain defense mechanisms that contribute to the structuring of specific clinical images of anxiety states.","971":"The deficit of mentalisation skills is a well-known phenomenon in schizophrenia. In our study, patients with schizophrenia underwent an 8-session training. The procedure was based on bibliotherapy, and we associated each basic emotion identified by Ekman with a short story that gave a striking description of that emotion. After we read the stories together, the participants were given a collection of face portrait photos and they were asked to pick the one that illustrated the emotional state of the characters. They were also asked to recall a personal memory when they felt the same way. We used the 'Reading the Mind in the Eyes' (RMET) test to assess the efficiency of our method. The one-sample t-test we performed to compare the pre- and post-training values detected a significant difference (p=0.000608&lt;0.05). The control group of patients with schizophrenia who did not undergo the training presented no significant difference between the two RMET tests performed 2 weeks apart (p=0.467). However, the two-sample t-test performed on the individual changes in RMET results in the study and control groups did detect a significant difference (p=0.000786&lt;0.005). Our results suggest that the mentalisation deficit of people suffering from schizophrenia can be decreased, therefore their communicative and adaptive skills can be developed or at least the deterioration of these skills can be slowed down.","972":"In the five thousand years of recorded history there is written evidence of various types of addiction. In recent decades scientists focus their attention on addictions without the immediate introduction of psychoactive substances into the organism or the so-called \"addictions without drugs\". Studies have revealed a number of similarities between drug addictions and addictions without drugs that also carry biological, psychological and social consequences in the form of addictive activity carvings, adrenaline alarm, dopamine and serotonin secretion, tolerance and abstinence syndrome same as classical forms of addiction. Although the physiological effect of addiction without drugs on the brain and nervous system is not yet sufficiently explored, scientists have found equivalent effects on addicts suffering from one or the other type of addiction. These addicts are almost generally dysfunctional persons who become prisoners of their own passions, and the consequences are numerous technological advantages offered by modern times and in some respects a punishment due to the civilization for forgetting the man himself. Considering that most people, so and many psychiatrist, often accept these addictions as a lifestyle and without any delay and awareness of the potential dangers they may pose, we can with certainty say that the so-called \"addictions without drugs\" are the scourge of the 21st century. With pathological gambling, which is as old as human civilization, in recent decades we meet the growing problems of internet addiction, gambling games, which are classified for the first time at DSM V in addictive disorder, uncontrolled shopping, food cravings, addiction to sex, weight loss, sports, work and many more, which are mostly true addictions, and not only the way of life. The aim of this paper is to point to the growing problem of addiction without drugs, which is becoming an increasing problem within our community.","973":"Connections between specific types of altered brain functioning and some mental disorders are still not fully clarified. However, there is a large number of evidence that indicates mental disorders are results of complex interactions of biological and environmental factors. When it comes to environmental factors, the main focus in the scientific literature has been particularly focused on early psychotraumatisation. Early psychotraumatisation is a multi-layered construct that essentially involves sexual, emotional and psychical neglect in childhood and emotional and psychical negligence, with about one-fourth of children experience a traumatic event before the age of 18. Although most children are resilient after traumatic exposure, some develop significant and potentially long-lasting psychiatric disorders. In addition, the high prevalence of trauma and neglect has been found in all types of psychiatric disorders. While early psychotraumatisation in patients with psychotic disorders was recently diminished or denied altogether, there is now strong evidence that the prevalence of childhood adversities in this population is exceptionally high. Regarding this, there is an increasing number of sophisticated studies that point out the fact that early psychotraumatisation has an important impact on development and clinical course of psychosis in adults. It seems that this relation is causal, especially when considering severity, frequency, and number of traumatic events. In addition, psychotic patients who experience psychotraumatisation at an earlier age along with their first psychotic episode are known to be hospitalized more often with their psychotic episodes lasting longer; further, they commit suicide more often and have more dissociative symptoms. These patients' is poorer such as their quality of life in comparison with patients without the experience of early psychotraumatisation. Moreover, this type of traumatic experience is very often an important determinant of phenomenology of psychotic disorder.","974":"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) significantly impact lives of affected individuals and their families. They confront daunting challenges and multiple demands in their daily life, when compared to parents of children with other disabilities or parents of typically developing children. Participants completed The Caregiver Needs Survey, the survey intended for parents or primary caregivers of children with a diagnosis of ASD. During the study, 231 parents were interviewed; 167 mothers and 64 fathers. Parents were recruited from the patient database comprised of families from the two largest cities in Serbia. All of them were contacted before the study, either via phone or at the child's regular check-in visit. Over 90 percent of the parents reported that additional support at schools, home, and improved relationships with service providers are necessary and important. The most important challenges related to care were child's communication difficulties, social interaction difficulties, and problems with daily living skills. The significant predictors of lower overall satisfaction were parent's higher education, having a first concern related to problems of the child's interaction with others or playing alone, and parent frustration with accessing services in the past 12 months. Greater overall satisfaction, on the other hand, was related to having an in-school tutor training or assistance in managing child's needs or implementing treatments, and having primary care doctor or pediatrician as a source of information on autism. Future efforts to develop ASD-related policies and services should also take the following into consideration: the low level of awareness among caregivers and health care providers about the early signs of autism; disparities in access to services; educational problems and significant levels of dissatisfaction with the overall care and stigma. ","975":"Many children and adolescents have mental problems that undermine their normal development and functioning. It is estimated that about 10% of children and adolescents suffer from mental disorders at a sufficiently severe level to cause some degree of damage and require treatment. The aim of this paper is to determine whether there have been changes in the diagnostic categories in developmental psychiatry in children and adolescents treated at the Department for Children and Adolescent Psychiatry for the last fifteen years. The survey includes 844 patients treated at the Department for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry of University Clinical Center of the Republic of Srpska in the period from April 2002 to September 2017, involving only children and adolescents who were hospitalized for the first time. The sample consisted of 453 female subjects (54, 67%) and 391 male subjects (46, 33%). Subjects were divided into three groups: group 1 - hospitalization in the period from 2002 to 2007; group 2 - hospitalization in the period from 2008 to 2012; group 3 - hospitalization in the period from 2013 to September 2017. Female subjects accounted for more than half of the subjects within each group, with a mild increase in the number of patients in the last 4 years. In the overall sample, adolescents, aged 13 to 18 (51.66%) were the most frequent, with the lowest number of subjects under 6 years of age (3.91%). In the overall sample, the most frequent are: psychotic disorders in 18.60% of subjects; behavioral disorders and emotions in 17, 42% of subjects; suicide attempt, in 14.34% of subjects. By comparing data by groups, there has been a decline in psychotic disorders, and since 2008, adapting disorders and behavioral and emotional disorders have been most frequently diagnosed. There is an increase in the number of respondents who come from incomplete families in the last few years. About one-third of the sample (33.89%) were exposed to one or more types of abuse. 43.13% of children and adolescents with poor socio-economic status. Comorbid diseases are present in 5.92% of children and adolescents. In 26.18% of the sample, psychiatric disorders are present in the family history. The abuse of psychoactive substances was observed in 2.61% of adolescents, and this number has been increasing for the last five years. Family dysfunction is present in 57.35% of children and adolescents. In our study, there was an increase in the number of children and adolescents with behavioral disorders and adjustment disorders, as well as an increase in family dysfunctionality and psychoactive substances abuse in adolescents. ","976":"Epidemiology shows that the major risk factors for suicide or attempting suicide are childhood adversities such as sexual and\/or physical abuse, neglect, mental illness of caregiver, and family or community violence. Suicide, whether attempted or completed, is a significant social, financial and emotional burden worldwide. Identification of risk factors and antecedents predisposing individuals to increased risk of suicide is hence imperative so as to afford prompt and appropriate monitoring and intervention. Using epidemiological data from the Survey of adverse childhood experiences (ACE) among young people in the Republic of Macedonia to examine their association with suicide attempt and to discuss possible mechanisms within the 'stress biology research'. A representative sample consisted of total 1277 students (58.6% female and 41.6%), aged 18 and above in year four of 664 secondary school and 613 first- and second-year university students. The data were obtained using Adverse Childhood Experiences Study Questionnaires (Family Health History Questionnaire) for collecting information on child maltreatment, household dysfunction and other socio-behavioural factors, applying WHO\/CDC-recommended methodology. Statistical significance was set up at p&lt;0.05. Emotional neglect, physical abuse and physical neglect were the most frequent abusive experiences students had. Overall, suicide attempts were reported by 3.1% of respondents (4.7% by females and 0.8% by males). Those respondents who had been emotionally abused were almost three times as likely to attempt suicide, physical abuse almost doubles the chances of attempting suicide, substance abuse in the family increased the chances 2.3 times for attempting suicide, violent treatment of the mother almost quadrupled them for attempted suicide, having a family member who had been in prison increased the odds of almost 3.5 times for attempting suicide. Attempted suicide was found to be 1.5 times more likely as the number of ACEs reaches 3 and 3.4 times more likely as the number of adverse childhood experiences reached four or more. Identifying and treating children, adolescents and young adults who have been affected by adverse childhood experiences may have substantial value in our evolving efforts to prevent suicide.

To be able to do so, professionals require to be, not only educated but actually properly trained and supervised in specially, among various skills, psychotherapy orientation. Unlike developed countries, psychotherapy services and professional career in psychotherapy in Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&amp;H) is relatively new primarily due to the recent historical developments and events in B&amp;H. Besides, there is scarcity of professional institutions in B&amp;H which could, not only establish structure for, promote but also educate mental health professionals, according to the European psychotherapy standards as well as accredit and certify psychotherapists, locally or internationally. The purpose of the present study is to show the role of International University of Sarajevo (IUS) as a local private educational institution in educating and training EMDR therapist in B&amp;H. The collaboration between EMDR HAP UK &amp; Ireland, Association of EMDR Therapists in Bosnia and Herzegovina (AEMDRTBH), Department of Psychiatry University Clinical Center (UCC) Tuzla and Psychiatry Clinic, Clinical Center of University (CCU) Sarajevo described with focus on the collaboration with International University in Sarajevo. Local institutions in B&amp;H can in a variety of ways make a significant contribution to the education and training of therapists in BiH in the following ways: providing rooms for realizing of education and training and\/or conferences (pro bono), promoting EMDR as a successful therapeutic method for treating of stress and trauma within relevant subjects and programs, providing scholarships for excellent students for EMDR education, and in collaboration with local and European EMDR therapists to offer EMDR specializations for professionals. Since 2010, one group of therapists has been educated and trained by EMDR HAP UK at Department of Psychiatry UCC Tuzla, two groups at the Psychiatric Clinic CCU in Sarajevo and one group at IUS. Thanks to EMDR HAP UK&amp;Ireland, EMDR therapists in B&amp;H are among the youngest yet very efficient and successful therapists who greatly contribute to improving mental health of fellow citizens. Collaboration between Association of EMDR Therapists in Bosnia-Herzegovina, HAP UK &amp; Ireland AP B&amp;H and local educational institutions such as IUS can significantly contribute to training efficient preparation of EMDR professionals in B&amp;H and help improve overall mental health and wellbeing of B&amp;H citizens. ","994":"Mental health services after the war 1992-1995 in Bosnia and Herzegovina (B-H) are primarily reduced to the public care, though, there are not enough professionals in existing conditions, and they are not able to respond to cover all the cases. This leaves the room to non governmental organizations (NGO) and private mental health care professionals in providing psycho-social services to vulnerable populations. Islamic Relief World Wide (IRWW), United Kingdom (UK) based humanitarian organisation, whose personal working within Orphans department, took part in this mission to contribute B-H citizens wellbeing. IRWW in B-H, since 2013 successfully provided psycho-social and EMDR psychotherapy services and help throughout its projects primarily designed for orphans, widows and socially endangered population. All EMDR therapies were delivered from the first author of this presentation. Our aim is to present socio demographic characteristics of clients seeking psychological support and help in IR WW B-H who were treated with EMDR therapy. We did overview of protocols for the clients to whom we helped by using standardised EMDR protocols. In the period from 2013 to 2017, we used EMDR protocols for 154 clients: 122 (79.2%) were females, 130 (84.4%) were adults (25-56 years old), 21 (13.6%) adolescents (13-25 years) and 3 (1.95%) school children. In terms of their socio-economic status 54 (35.1%) clients were employed, 42 (27.3%) unemployed and 19 (12.3%) from socially endangered category. There were 30 (19.5%) university students, 55 (35.7%) were with university degree, 63 (40.9%) with high school education, 5 (3.3%) with primary school. Therapy type (completed, ongoing, incomplete), primary complains or reasons for seeking therapy, diagnoses and number of EMDR therapy sessions offered, will be addressed too.

Amongst the 62 participants of two Istanbul EMDR trainings organised by HAP, 53% were Syrian. We felt it is a unique opportunity to assess the needs of Syrian refugees they are working with. We asked all the participants who are all mental health professionals to complete an Arabic translation of 'The Need for Trauma-based Services Questionnaire' in these trainings. The rest of the participants on the course were from Iraq (18%), Jordan (16%), Egypt (7%) and others from Palestine, Sudan &amp; Libya (6%). All participants completed questionnaires. The results of comparing the needs reported by Syrian mental health professionals showed higher prevalence of PTSD seen by the Syrian mental health professionals (72% compared with 56% in the clients seen by the rest of participants). Also, the Syrian mental health professionals could only meet 34% (SD=17.1) of the needs of their client who suffer from PTSD. The unmet need for trauma therapy was reported as 100% by these professionals. This study highlighted the high need for trauma mental health services of the Syrian refugees as reported by mental health professionals working in the neighbouring countries. The needs of the Syrian refugees, arriving to the UK because of the very difficult situations, these refugees are coming from, may be met with EMDR therapy.

Quality indicators can be used to measure the effectiveness of mental healthcare structure and process reforms. This project aims to develop quality indicators for mental healthcare systems in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Serbia to provide monitoring instruments for the transformation of mental healthcare systems in these countries. Quality indicators for mental healthcare systems were developed in a systematic, multidisciplinary approach. A systematic literature study was conducted to identify quality indicators that are used internationally in mental healthcare. Retrieved quality indicators were systematically selected by means of defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Quality indicators were subsequently rated in a two-stage Delphi study for relevance, validity and feasibility (data availability and data collection effort). The Delphi panel included 22 individuals in the first round, and 18 individuals in the second and final round. Overall, mental healthcare quality indicators were rated higher in relevance than in validity (Mean relevance=7.6, SD=0.8; Mean validity=7.1, SD=0.7). There was no statistically significant difference in scores between the four countries for relevance (X2 (3)=3.581, p=0.310) and validity (X2 (3)=1.145, p=0.766).

In order to address this problem, the effect of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) therapy on work stress and mental health of psychiatric nurses is investigated in this study. From August 2017 to November 2017, 100 psychiatric nurses, including 68 females and 32 males, were selected as participants from three hospitals in Hunan Province of China. They were randomly divided into the intervention and control groups, with 50 respondents in each group. MBSR therapy was used as psychological intervention in the intervention group. Before and after the intervention, the two groups were assessed with the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) scale, Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Nursing Stress Scale. (1) After the intervention, the SCL-90 score of the intervention group decrease significantly, and a statistically significant difference is observed with the figure before the intervention (P&lt;0.001). No statistically significant difference is found in the control group (P&gt;0.05).

Data suggest that BD patients with or without psychotic symptoms may differ from each other with regards to some clinical features of BD (e.g., age at onset, suicidality, psychiatric comorbidity, number of hospitalizations). However, the literature in this area is relatively scarce and not always conclusive. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to investigate whether the presence of psychotic symptoms is associated with clinical characteristics of patients with BD. We enrolled 365 hospitalized patients who were diagnosed with BD according to the ICD-10 criteria. After we excluded 196 patients without current psychotic symptoms but psychotic mood episodes in their medical history, our final sample consisted of 169 patients (i.e., 89 BD patients presenting with current psychotic symptoms and 80 BD patients who were hospitalized in the same period, but who did not have psychotic symptoms either currently or during their previous hospitalizations). Clinically available data were collected, systematized and statistically processed according to the aims of the study. Early age of onset, bipolar-I diagnosis, comorbid personality disorder, number of hospitalizations and suicidality were significantly more common in the psychotic group compared to the never-psychotic group. On the contrary, sedative\/hypnotics dependence was more frequent in the never-psychotic group. Our results support the notion that the presence of psychotic symptoms in the context of BD may be associated with various other clinical features of this disease.

CYP2D6 polymorphisms *3, *4, *5, *6, *1XN and DRD2\/ANKK1 Taq1A polymorphisms were genotyped in a cohort of 226 Caucasian schizophrenic inpatients. AP daily doses, hospital stay duration and AP treatment duration were taken from medical records. To compare mean daily doses of AP among CYP2D6 PMs, EMs, UMs and DRD2\/ANKK1 Taq1A carriers the actual AP doses were converted to chlorpromazine (CPZ) equivalents and DDD (defined daily dose). Significant correlation (p=0.004) between CYP2D6 metabolic activity and AP mean daily doses was observed only among DRD2\/ANKK1 Taq1A polymorphic allele carriers: 250.53 (95%CI: 154.90-346.17), 473.82 (95%CI: 426.99-520.64) 602.77 (95%CI: 469.65-735.88) CPZ equivalents in PMs, EMs and UMs, consequently. PMs with DRD2\/ANKK1 Taq1A CT genotype received significantly lower doses of AP comparing to CC genotype (p=0.02). Mean hospital stay duration of PMs+UMs was significantly higher comparing to EMs (66.4 days (95% CI: 56.9-75.8) vs 50.2 days (95%CI: 45.5-54.7); p=0.047). In a cohort of schizophrenia inpatients CYP2D6 metabolic activity affects mean AP daily dose only in the presence of DRD2 Taq1A polymorphic allele. CYP2D6 metabolic activity correlates independently from DRD2 Taq1A polymorphism with hospital stay duration.

","1011":"In schizophrenia patients the lateral ventricle enlargement has mostly been reported in relationship with smaller cortical and\/or subcortical brain volumes; and it has been observed that ventricular system growth may be a consequence of the smaller caudate nucleus volume. Bicaudate parameters have been used in the Alzheimer dementia and Huntington's chorea diagnosing in order to evaluate brain changes and the enlargement of the lateral ventricles. This study has been carried out on 140 patients out of which 70 patients (30 men and 40 women) who met the ICD 10 criteria for schizophrenia and 70 healthy controls (30 men and 40 women) matched on sex and age with the studied group. All of them underwent direct caudatometry and volume computation based on MRI scans. Except for the bicorporal line, for all the parameters were obtained the statistically highly significant differences between the examined and control groups. Significant correlation was established for the majority of bicaudate parameters and volumes of the caudate nuclei and lateral ventricles. Enlargement of the lateral ventricles is one of the most frequent MRI finding in schizophrenia patients. Ventricles are enlarging gradually and frontal horns are more affected than other parts. The increased volumes of the caudate nuclei signalized that ventricular enlargement is not the consequence of the caudate atrophy. Bicaudate parameters are reliable parameters for the quick orientation in order to assess the enlarged ventricles in schizophrenia patients. ","1012":"The gabapentinoids gabapentin and pregabalin have been related to addiction citing pharmacovigilance data, some case presentations and increasing reports mainly from methadone maintenance treatment programs or emergency medicine. Most of these reports were based on patients with another current or previous substance use disorder (SUD). According to the ICD-10 dependence criteria, physical dependence (withdrawal symptoms, tolerance) was reported most frequently alongside regular use of gabapentinoids. Far less patients showed key symptoms of behavioral dependence (craving, loss of control, or addictive behavior). Through a literature review, we found 2 and 13 case reports about gabapentionoid-seeking behavior or craving for gabapentin and pregabalin, respectively. Those patients without a history of another SUD, but being behaviorally dependent on gabapentinoids, deemed more appropriate to reflect the true addictive power of these drugs. We found solely 4 such cases, all referring to pregabalin and none for gabapentin. Taking into account that gabapentinoids have become widely distributed and easily obtainable via the internet or black-markets, one would expect many more of these cases, if gabapentinoids had considerable addictive power. Moreover, we are not aware of any patient who sought detoxification treatment owing to the misuse of gabapentinoids. Unlike for traditional psychoactive drugs, there is only very scarce evidence for gabapentinoids to be misused in a long-term manner and to be rewarding and reinforcing in animal experiments. Further, we assessed the hazardous potential of gabapentin and pregabalin in relation to that of traditional substances of abuse. Altogether, we support the view that gabapentinoids are quite rarely addictive in the general population. In patients with a history of SUD, however, gabapentinoids (notably pregabalin) should avoided or, if thought to be beneficial, administered with caution by using a strict prescription and therapy monitoring.","1013":null,"1014":"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common disorders in the world, but is generally refractory to antidepressant treatment. However, physical exercise has been demonstrated to improve MDD symptoms, though the mechanism through which this is achieved is not clear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to clarify whether physical exercise increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in patients with MDD to either establish or rule out this effect as a possible mechanism. We searched five electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, CHINAL, Cochran Library, and Japanese Central Review of Medicine) for interventional studies released prior to 24 October 2017, examining the effects of physical exercise on BDNF in patients with MDD that compared the experimental group with an MDD control group. Those studies meeting the inclusion criteria were subjected to a meta-analysis in which changes of BDNF from baseline to post-exercise were quantified, with a standard mean difference and random effect model. Five studies were eligible and included 199 participants. All articles included subjects with severe symptoms; three articles studied inpatient populations. All articles introduced aerobic exercise. We found no significant effect of physical exercise on BDNF levels (Z=0.32, p=0.75), and no heterogeneity (I2=0%). The risk of bias was moderate. We conclude that physical exercise does not significantly increase BDNF in patients with MDD. Thus, while increased BDNF has been shown to be beneficial in patients with MDD, physical exercise likely produces its benefits through a different mechanism. However, the small number of included articles and lack of multiple reviewers increase the risk of the result being a false negative.

This article reviews occurence of visual hallucinations in subjects with CBS by journals published in English in the Pubmed database in the period 1992-2018. Criteria for selection of appropriate papers were sufficient information and perspicuous view on pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical presentation and treatment possibilities of CBS. Most commonly, visual hallucinations in patients with CBS are complex, repetitive and stereotyped. Such individuals have preserved insight that those percepts are not real, and there is an absence of secondary explanatory delusions and hallucinations within other modalities. Seeing as the aforementioned percepts do not share all the characteristics of hallucinations, it remains unresolved how they should be referred to. Terms as release hallucinations, one that is reflecting its underlying pathogenesis, or confabulatory hallucinatory experiences have been proposed. Moreover, CBS has also been referred to as phantom vision syndrome and may occur in any ophthalmological disease. It is not particularly connected with loss of function along any level of the visual pathway. Although this syndrome is mostly associated with age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma and cataract, it could be related to almost any other ophthalmological conditions. The incidence of CBS alongside with mostly other ocular pathology is rising as population is ageing. Nonetheless, CBS remains commonly underreported, under recognized and\/or misrecognized. Albeit the treatment recommendations and guidelines are not yet fully established, it is important to raise awareness of this specific and distinct condition, which inevitably implicates many differential diagnostic deliberations.

Recent preclinical and clinical research has further investigated self-medication hypothesis, given that nicotine might alleviate cortical dysfunction. While prior research indicated some favorable effects of smoking on cognitive performance, particulatly on attention\/vigilance, recent studies did not confirm those findings. Lower severity of negative symptoms in smokers was not confirmed across studies. Cigarette smoking decreases clozapine and olanzapine concentrations. There is no consistent evidence of favorable effects of nicotine on symptoms in schizophrenia, but the evidence of detrimental effects of smoking on general health is highly consistent.

There is a continued focus on early interventions in prodromal states and early course of frank psychosis, aimed at ensuring faster remission, reducing relapses, achieving better long-term functioning, and preventing adverse outcomes linked to untreated psychosis and chronic psychotic disorders. A number of different specialized treatment models and services exist trying to close knowledge gaps and provide clinical interventions to first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients, but there is still no generally accepted standard of care informing our every-day practice. FEP and early-course psychosis specialized treatment model developed in 2004 in University Psychiatric Hospital Vrapce rests on integration of care across different organization units and clinical presentation acuity levels and patient needs (intensive care, FEP inpatient unit, FEP outpatient services including day hospital). Such integration of FEP services allows for flexible entry point on multiple levels, earlier structuring of therapeutic alliance for those requiring inpatient care, reduction of risks associated with FEP, quicker formation of long-term treatment plans, reduction of delay in accessing specialized services, and a more coordinated diagnostic process and recruitment of FEP patient population.

The first episode is a critical period in which individuals with psychosis, as well as members of their families, are confronted with the illness for the first time. Until nowadays, treatment of first psychotic episodes in Croatia has usually been provided in hospital setting. The day hospital provides comprehensive therapeutic approach that refers to early systematic application of all available and effective therapeutic methods in the initial phases of psychotic disorders, and aims to attain and maintain remission and recovery, as well as insight and adherence to treatment. The day hospital is a time-limited structured program that comprises diagnostic procedures, treatment and rehabilitation based on various group psychotherapy and socio-therapy approaches. It is cheaper than hospital treatment and preferred by patients and their families. The importance of involving family members along with patients in the therapeutic process is recognized. The aim of this paper is to present the first day hospital for early intervention and treatment of individuals with psychotic disorder, established within Psychiatric hospital \"Sveti Ivan\", Zagreb, Croatia.","1023":"Despite controversy, ECT has been recognized as significantly effective for the treatment of mental disorders since 1938, when Cerletti and Bini introduced ECT in clinical psychiatric practice for treatment of schizophrenia. In the next period, indication for ECT switched more toward depression and catatonia. ECT was even banned from psychiatric training in 1960's, due to the anti-psychiatric movement, which were fortified by Oscar winning movie \"One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest\". Due to its robust effectiveness, ECT revived in the early 1980's and today holds its position in clinical psychiatric practices around the world. Mechanism of ECT on brain and psychopathology is still not fully understood. Main theories have been neurotransmitter, post-receptor, neurophysiological and neuroendocrine theory. Regarding best clinical practices and evidence reported in the literature, ECT today is considered a treatment option for, traditionally, depression, suicidality and catatonia, and also schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, malignant neuroleptic syndrome, postpartal depression and psychosis, obsessive compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, dementia, etc. Recent evidence of ECT efficacy is growing stronger also in the treatment resistant cases, for depression and psychosis. Great advantage of ECT is lack of absolute contraindications. ECT in Croatia was introduced in clinical psychiatric practice in 1960's in four institutions. Mainly due to stigma, but also a tendency for shifting toward hypothesized action mechanism, ECT in Croatia has been re-named to electrostimulative therapy or electroneuromodulatory treatment. In recent decades, the Department of psychiatry in the University Hospital Centre Zagreb (KBC Zagreb), has continuously been practicing ECT. Our department is considered a regional leader, regarding number of patient cases and overall experience in homeland and neighbouring countries. In the 2016, Croatian expert group, selected by the Croatian Psychiatric Association, proposed national guidelines for the ECT.

Mental health professionals, psychiatrists included, display stigmatization of people with mental disorders mostly through social distance, even though they have \"politically correct\" opinions about their patients. Negative beliefs and attitudes in psychiatric profession should be opposed because of their important influence on public opinion, opinion of patients' themselves and of their family members. The \"disabling environment\" formed through discriminative practices in all society levels can be improved through mental health policy documents and plans that involve clear human rights protection premises, resource allocation and development priorities in line with international standards. Slovenia invests at least 80% of mental health budget in psychiatric hospitals and social care institutions, which employ 90% of psychiatrists.

He had to be treated psychiatrically for the first time because of exacerbation of psychotic symptoms. He was hospitalized twice in succession, because of the severity of the psychotic symptoms that included imperative auditory hallucinations that also led to a serious suicidal attempt. The prescribed psychiatric therapy had to be adjusted in type, dosage and especially the time of administration as his psychiatric status fluctuated every two days in sync with the wash-out of medication due to haemodialysis. The choice of adequate psychotropic medication in a haemodialysed patient is limited and the regime of the drug administration is also very important for the success of treatment and achieving remission.","1028":"The onset of psychosis is typically preceded by a prodromal phase that is characterised by the emergence of \"attenuated\" psychotic symptoms. This phase is described as ultra-high risk (UHR) or at-risk mental state (ARMS) of psychosis. Criteria have been established for identifying these young people who are at clinical high risk. People at ultra-high risk (UHR) of psychosis have about 30% chance of developing the illness within two years. This category was introduced with the goal of developing treatments for prevention of psychotic disorders. Recent research suggests that early interventions appear to be effective in delaying and even preventing the onset of psychosis. These treatments include antipsychotic medication, nutritional supplements such as omega-3 fatty acids and psychological treatment. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been tested as a potentially effective intervention in this group. Here we describe a case of a male adolescent with UHR psychotic symptoms with focus on challenges of assessing the UHR in adolescents and issues of providing effective age appropriate interventions.","1029":"There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that early and effective management in the critical early years of schizophrenia can improve long-term outcomes.

We performed a retrospective cohort study on the sample of 373 early-phase psychosis patients admitted to Psychiatric Hospital \"Sveti Ivan\", Zagreb Croatia: from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017. The primary outcome was time to relapse. Patients who were admitted to group psychotherapeutic program after the end of acute treatment had 70% lower hazard for relapse (HR=0.30; 95% CI 0.16-0.58). Patients who were included first in the psychotherapeutic program and then treated and controlled in the daily hospital had 74% lower hazard for relapse (HR=0.26; 95% CI 0.10-0.67).

","1030":"Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder increasingly recognized as a systemic disorder. In addition to the burden and suffering caused by the mental illness itself, individuals with schizophrenia have a high risk for physical illnesses. The life expectancy gap remains 13 to 30 years wider in people with schizophrenia compared to the general population. This premature mortality is caused largely by deaths due to cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes mellitus, and other natural causes, poor diagnosis and treatment, and insufficient prevention of modifiable risk factors. Although the links between schizophrenia and physical illnesses are well established, in clinical practice, physical illnesses in patients with schizophrenia are often overlooked, and the mortality gap between general population and people with schizophrenia continues to widen. The physical health of people with schizophrenia is commonly self-neglected but also ignored by people around them and by health systems, resulting in significant physical health disparities and limited access to health services. The root of the problem of insufficient healthcare appear to lie in interrelated contributory factors from illness, patients, and medical and mental healthcare system. Furthermore, a growing body of literature has been indicating the effect of the chronic physical illness on the treatment outcome of psychosis. Premature mortality and disability could be reduced if there was a greater focus on the implementation of strategies that effectively prevent modifiable risk factors from the first psychotic episode and enhance early recognition of physical illnesses, reduce the burden of physical comorbidity and lead to improved health outcomes. Ultimately, to improve treatment outcome and to reduce the suffering of people with schizophrenia, it is crucial to treat physical comorbidity promptly and assertively from the appearance of the first symptoms of the psychotic disorder. The integrative approach and collaborative care within all levels of healthcare providers should be the imperative in clinical practice.","1031":"This paper describes a new type of receptive music therapy which aims to build the patients' psychological resilience by increasing the levels of dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin in order to increase standard psychopharmacological treatment efficiency. Previous research concerning the musically induced production of the two neurotransmitters and a hormone is discussed and reviewed. Based upon the existent studies concerning the influence of music on dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin induction, a new design of specific music features for this purpose is proposed and elaborated upon. The music features are numerically described using Music Information Retrieval software in order to objectivise the otherwise intuitively chosen music elements such as event density (number of notes started in one second of time), tempo, harmonic rhythm (number of harmonies changes in one second), dynamics, key changes and roughness coefficient (level of sensory dissonance). Finally, the new concept of resilience enhancing therapy is proposed and defined using the music features described above.","1032":"Relative to other body-focused repetitive behaviors, skin-picking has received little investigation. In particular, its association with disgust has hardly been studied. This is surprising because one etiological model of skin-picking disorder (SPD) suggests that the excessive picking is a form of disgust-motivated grooming that aims at the removal of pathogens from the skin. This questionnaire study explored whether SPD patients (n=46) and healthy controls (n=36) differ in different facets of trait disgust (tendency to experience pathogen disgust, moral disgust, self-disgust, and disgust regulation ability). Moreover, a multiple regression analysis was calculated in order to investigate whether skin-picking symptoms can be predicted based on these components of trait disgust. Patients received higher scores on all disgust measures than controls. The degree of patients' skin picking (symptom severity, resulting impairment) could be predicted based on moral disgust (disgust experienced when confronted with moral transgressions) and difficulties in disgust regulation. This study provides evidence for the role of specific disgust components in SPD.

The association between old age and OT was only vaguely studied. Little or few is known on the effect of the OT hormone on the old body. Hereby, we present our preliminary results in the research on behavioral changes regarding the intraperitoneal administration of OT in aged rats.

Behavioral markers were assessed in some specific behavioral tasks, such as the Y-Maze test for short-term working memory, Open Field test, Elevated Plus Maze, and Forced Swim test for anxious and depressive behavior assessment, and Three-chambered Maze test for sociability assessment. Increased mobility and decreased anxiety behaviors were reported for the aged intraperitoneal OT-treated animals, as compared with controls, during FST and OFT, and respectively FST, EPM, and OFT. Also, decreased depressive-like behaviors were observed in the same animal group during FST and ST. Moreover, a decrease in anxiolytic behavior was observed as exposed to stressful stimuli (such as grooming behavior in OFT, and forced grooming behavior in ST), and as exposed to social stimuli (such as grooming behavior in TCT). Similarly, significant differences were obtained regarding the social behavior of the intraperitoneal OT-treated animal as compared to control group, the animals showing increased sociability and social preference for the stranger animal in TCT. However, no significant effects on the working memory (assessed as spontaneous alternation in YMT) were observed. Intraperitoneal administration of OT in aged rats has clear effects on anxious and depressive behavior, but no significant effects on the working memory. Also, several beneficial effects of OT on social preferences and sociability were observed. ","1041":"Pregnant women experience a set of biological and psychological disturbances. The aim of this study was to assess the appearance of depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts in pregnant women during the third trimester of pregnancy. A total of 110 pregnant women were included in the study. All of them filled out an anonymous questionnaire about sociodemographic data, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Study participants were between 18-46 years of age. 45.45% of the pregnant women were between 37 and 39 weeks pregnant. According to the EPDS, the risk for perinatal depression was observed in 29 (23.36%) pregnant women: 15 (13.64%) of them had a total score on EPDS from 10-12, and 14 (12.72%) had a total score of 13-20. A higher score on both Beck scales was characteristic for pregnant women with a higher risk for the development of perinatal depression based on the results on EPDS. The prevalence of suicidal thoughts was 2.73%. Perinatal depression is a state which should be given more attention. The recognition of perinatal depression during pregnancy allows health medical workers to observe pregnant women at risk and then to make preventive and clinical interventions. The risk for perinatal depression is higher in pregnant women with more expressed depressive and anxiety symptoms. Pregnant women with suicidal thoughts are more anxious and depressed. ","1042":"The main goal of this study was to analyse and show clinical characteristics and psychiatric comorbidity in 38 participants aged between 10 and 17 with DSM-IV diagnoses of Trichotillomania (TTM) that we were treating at Children's Hospital Zagreb from 2008 to 2017. We analyzed the data obtained from semi-structured interviews by the criteria of DSM-IV, Youth Self Report (YSR) (Achenbach &amp; Rescorla 2001) and survey that we created. From 38 participants 21 were girls. The activities during which the participants state that they mostly pull hairs are as follows: doing homework and learning, working on PC, in the toilet, watching TV etc. The most common sites on the body from which participants pulled hair were scalp and among nonscalp sites eyebrows and eyelashes. We found nail biting in more than a half of participants. In 22 participants one or more comorbid disorder has been found, of which ADHD (n=6) and tics (n=5) are most co-occurring disorders. The internalized and externalized problems were nearly evenly represented. Trichophagia was reported by two participants. The results indicate that more than two thirds of participants isolate themselves during hair pulling and half of them try to hide consequences. Median time from the first occurrence of the symptoms to the first visit to a child psychiatrist caused by TTM problem was 9 months (min 5; max 24) what we consider a very long period of time that increased the probability of complications. Knowledge about this disorder and cooperation among pediatric experts is extremely important for recognizing it at an early stage and starting the treatment especially considering habit-forming mechanism, the burden of an emotional distress and frequent comorbidity. Further research is needed.

The current study investigated excitement in relation to N200 in men who had recently experienced their first episode of psychosis. Twenty men who had recently suffered their first psychotic episode underwent a clinical interview and auditory oddball task. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that 58% of the variance in the excitement symptom cluster was explained by a positive association with frontal midline N200 amplitude and an inverse association with right frontal N200 amplitude. The latter was not apparent in the initial correlation, suggesting suppression by the midline activity. These associations were not explained by drug use, medication or negative symptoms. However, the correlation between excitement and midline N200 was stronger in drug users, and that between right frontal N200 and excitement was stronger in nonusers. Findings support the independent contributions to excitement of mechanisms reflected in midline and right frontal N200 amplitude respectively during the early stages of psychosis. ","1045":"Cloninger's psychological model of temperament and character confirms that the personality development is influenced by biological and psychological processes. The aim of this study is to examine personality dimensions and to determine which variable separates the healthy from the ill in the best way and could be a possible psychological marker for the presence of the illness. This research included 152 subjects, 76 patients with schizophrenia and 76 healthy controls, selected on the basis of medical interviews, random population sampling model from a wider social community using the independent T-Tests. The Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), which compared personality traits of the patients with schizophrenia and the healthy control group, was used. Dependence of variables in these categories was assessed using the Chi-square and Fisher's tests, and the impact of variables on schizophrenia was tested using univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression. The same method was used for making the mathematical model. Unlike the control group, patients with schizophrenia exhibited higher Harm avoidance (HA) and Self - transcendence (ST) scores as well as lower Self - directedness (SD) and Cooperativeness (C) scores. Multivariate binary logistic regression showed that Responsibility, Purposefulness, Resourcefulness, Cooperativeness and Compassion dimensions were significantly more present in the patients with schizophrenia. The new variable Model (area=0.896, p&lt;0.0005) is composed of five TCI parameters. It proved to be a reliable marker for separation the healthy from the ill ones (area=0.896, p&lt;0.0005). It has a good sensitivity (80%) and specificity (84%). Research has emphasized variables in the temperament and character inventory, which are the best markers for distinguishing between the healthy and the ill, thus making the mathematical model. ","1046":"the objective of this study was to examine the associations between Cloninger temperament and character dimensions with the DAT1 VNTR and COMT Val158Met polymorphisms. The study was conducted on 101 subjects, consisting of students of the Police College in Zagreb and staff of the Sestre Milosrdnice University Hospital in Zagreb. The Cloninger Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) was used to test personality traits. A main effect of the DAT1 VNTR polymorphism was found on the subscale self-directedness - SD2 (F=5.18, df=1, p&lt;0.05), where a higher result was detected in carriers of the 9\/9 genotype (M=7.33, SD=0.51) than those carrying the 10-repeat allele (M=6.02, SD=1.36). Also for the COMT Val158Met polymorphism, main effects were found on the subscales: NS3 (novelty seeking) (F=5.18, df=1, p&lt;0.05), where a higher result was found in carriers of the Val allele (M=5.03, SD=2.22) than in carriers of the Met\/Met genotype (MD=4.76, SD=2.37), SD3 (self-directedness) (F=5.18, df=1, p&lt;0.05) where a higher result was found in carriers of the Val\/Val genotype (M=4.50, SD=0.78) than in those carrying the Met allele (M=3.80, SD=1.31); C3 (cooperativeness) (F=5.18, df=1, p&lt;0.05), where a high result was found in carriers of the Val allele (M=5.68, SD=1.25) than those carrying the Met\/Met genotype (M=5.08, SD=1.11); and ST3 (self-transcendence) (F=5.18, df=1, p&lt;0.05), where a higher result was found in carriers of the Met\/Met genotype (M=3.46, SD=2.37) than carriers of the Val allele (M=2.69, SD=1.84). Two significant interactions were detected, on the subscale NS3 (novelty seeking) (F=5.18, df=1, p&lt;0.05), and on the subscale C2 (cooperativeness) (F=5.18, df=1, p&lt;0.05). Cloninger's (1987) hypothesis about negative relationship between novelty seeking and dopamine was confirmed on allele level, because higher novelty seeking was found in Val allele carriers comparing to Met\/Met genotype carriers. ","1047":null,"1048":"Patients with schizophrenia, nowadays chronic, frequently disabling mental disorder, get initial treatment after detection of a psychotic episode, seemingly late, potentially preventable stage of illness. As our knowledge about the nature of schizophrenia and other diseases of the spectrum is growing, so are the early interventions becoming more possible, and it is important to conceptualize the clinical, legal and moral issues emerging with new preventive treatments. Every intervention, especially in pre-clinical population, demands a careful risk-benefit assessment and having basic bioethical principles - primacy of patient's welfare, beneficience\/non-maleficience, autonomy and justice - in mind. We believe that pharmacological treatments, considering today's drugs safety and effectiveness profiles, should stay reserved for cases with higly probable negative outcomes to patient's wellbeing, and that all other low-risk interventions, like psychosocial treatments, should be considered for reducing the conversion to disorder, if possible, or relieving the distress in vulnerable persons, when such vulnerability gets detected. How to recognize persons at risk before the start of the disorder, without missing the majority of cases or burdening healthy persons with stigma, is another challenge and not only mental health professionals should be included in finding the solutions. The broadest public, and especially the experts that will build the safety-net for the at-risk individuals, should get best possible appropriate education about the schizophrenia in order to stigmatize less and help more.","1049":"It has been suggested that individual job characteristics have a significant impact on job burnout, and the process is subject to the regulation of demographic variables. However, the influence path of job characteristics on job burnout is still a \"black box\". On the basis of a systematic literature review by employing Pub Med, Science Direct, Web of Science, Google Scholar, CNKI and Scopus for required information with the several keywords \"Job burnout\", \"Emotion regulation\", \"Personality traits\", and \"Psychological stress\", in this study, an improved mine rescue workers-oriented job demands-resources (JD-R) model was put forward. Then, a novel analysis framework, to explore the impact of job characteristics on job burnout from the view of emotion regulation theory, was proposed combining the personality trait theory. This study argues that job burnout is influenced by job demands through expressive suppression and by job resources through cognitive reappraisal respectively. Further more, job demands and job resources have the opposite effects on job burnout through the \"loss-path\" caused by job pressure and the \"gain-path\" arised from job motivation, respectively. Extrovert personality traits can affect the way the individual processes the information of work environment and then how individual further adopts emotion regulation strategies, finally resulting in indirectly affecting the influence path of mine rescue workers' job characteristics on job burnout. This present study can help managers to realize the importance of employees' psychological stress and job burnout problems. The obtained conclusions provide significant decision-making references for managers in intervening job burnout, managing emotional stress and mental health of employees. ","1050":null,"1051":"Dyspnea or breathlessness is a term primarily used in respiratory medicine. Nevertheless, in the last fifteen years, studies from other fields focus on the affective component of this complex phenomenon due to the frequent observation that psychological states can cause or be caused by dyspnea. Research so far shows that besides the biological component, dyspnea has a strong emotional and psychosocial determinant. This means that apart from its biological factors, dyspnea and its intensity are affected by emotions, personality, anxiety and depression, etc. Individuals with psychiatric disorders, in the same conditions, will evaluate their dyspnea as more intense and disturbing compared to individuals without psychiatric comorbidity. Emotional states in healthy individuals can amplify the sense of dyspnea which is of extreme importance for clinical practice in order to consider the whole person and not just the symptom which is being presented. Also, dyspnea seems to be frequent complaint in some groups of patients with psychiatric disorders (e.g.panic disorder), where the fear of suffocation is presented as clinical symptom. Futher research of dyspnea as a complex, multicomponent phenomenon, can contribute to better treatment options and better differential diagnosis concerning possible psychiatric background of physical symptoms.","1052":"ADHD (Attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests itself during childhood with various combinations of symptoms, including inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. Research has shown that psychiatric comorbidities play an important role in the development of suicidal behavior and, recently, there has been a growing interest in a possible association between ADHD and suicide during both childhood and adulthood. Furthermore, some authors have shown a relationship between pharmacological treatments and suicide in patients affected by ADHD. We conducted a selective review of current literature to explore the factors which contribute to suicidal behavior and self-harm in those with ADHD. We performed a PubMed\/MEDLINE, Scopus, PsycLit, and PsycINFO search to identify all articles and book chapters on the topic up to 2017. Several studies have showed that ADHD may be correlated with an increased suicide ideation and attempts. Although differences in studies design and samples made the results difficult to compare and interpret, many studies indicate an association between ADHD and suicidal behavior. It remains controversial whether there is a direct relationship or whether the association depends on the increased prevalence of pre-existing comorbid conditions and individual and family dysfunctional factors. ","1053":"Mental illness stigma is still widely spread and present in all the cultures and nations. Even more, during the last half of century there hasn't been much change in the perception of mentally ill persons as \"incurable and dangerous individuals incapable of living on their own\". The significance of mental illness stigma is determined by the size of its negative effect on mentally ill individuals, their family members, and the psychiatric service as well as on the society as a whole. In order to reduce the negative effects of stigma on the life of mentally ill individuals as well as to provide equal lifestyle in the community, at the beginning of the 1990s the World Health Organization recommended a global and decisive fight against the mental health stigma and discrimination. Since then three effective methods proliferated in fighting the mental illness stigma. These methods consist of combining education, contact with stigmatized group representatives and protest. To achieve better efficiency of anti-stigma program, the fight should be led by citizens of all age groups, especially younger people, the media, health care providers involved in treating the patients, but also the patients themselves as well as their family members.","1054":"Most mental disorders begin during developmental age. Different misinformation about mental illnesses cause anxiety, create stereotypes and promote stigma. Stigma has been identified as a likely key factor in mental health services access and utilization, particularly under-utilization of existing services especially in children with mental disorders. Stigma is a problem with which parents \/ carers face child emotional and behavioral problems when they seek professional help. Very often they avoid to seek professional help due to existing stigmatized attitudes leading to lack of treatment. Poor mental health is strongly related to other health and development concerns in young people, notably lower educational achievements, substance abuse and violence. The paper presents influence of mental disorders in developmentale age and consequence of mental stigma on psychosocial function on children and adolescent.","1055":"Stigma and recovery \"from\" and \"in\" mental illness are associated in many various ways. While recovery gives opportunities, makes person stronger, gives purpose and meaning to their lives and leads to social inclusion, in the same time stigma reduces opportunities, reduces self-esteem and self-efficacy, reduces the belief in own abilities and contributes to social exclusion through discrimination. The recovery of a person with mental illness means to get and keep hope, to understand their own possibilities and impossibilities, active living, to be autonomous, to have a social identity and to give meaning and purpose of our own lives. The care system, recovery-oriented, provides help and support to people with mental disorders in his\/her recovery, which contributes to reduction of self-stigma, to the elimination of stigmatizing attitudes and beliefs in mental health services which consequently may have a positive reflection in reducing the stigma of mental illness in the community. It is important to look at the stigma and recovery from the perspective of individual experience of each person with a mental illness in the process of recovery. A support to the recovery concept and the development of a recovery-oriented system of care should be one of the key segments of any strategy to combat the stigma of mental illness. Also, the cultural and the social stigma aspects of stigma would be taken into account in the developing of the recovery concept and on the recovery-oriented care system.","1056":"Suicide is one of the major mental health problems in the world. It is estimated that one million suicide are committed per year and that after every suicide six people from the surrounding suffer or develop major life changes. After suicide survivors are at higher risk of developing major psychological changes and suicidal ideations as well. They go through the complicated process of grief which is specifically characterized by the felling of guilt, shame, denial and anger. The griefing process, more often than in other causes of death, doesn't integrate but is complicated with prolonged grief. This represents a very favorable state for perceiving stigma. Stigma is most often defined as a mark of disgrace or infamy; a stain or reproach, as on one's reputation. In suicide we talk about public and self stigma. Both forms of stigma can separately cause social isolation, demoralization, the felling of hopelessness and other consequences that interfere with the previous functioning. Because of the high incidence of psychological changes after stigma it is crucial for the bereaved to have close mental health services. But stigma is a barrier to treatment seeking. After suicide most survivors fell stigmatized but it is not yet known which factors modify the perception of stigma. Other causes of death like natural death are less related to stigma. On the other side traumatic death like an accident or homicide seem to be related to perception of stigma in the same way survivors perceive after suicide. Suicide and stigma are related in a two way direction meaning that suicide can cause stigma but stigma can lead to suicidal thoughts as well. Even suicide attempters fell stigmatized by colleagues, medical staff and their closest surrounding. There is a need for interventions. The effect of broad anti-stigma campaigns and targeted programs still have to be examines. In clinical settings, interventions that reduce self stigma, stigma-stress and shame might successfully reduce suicidality.","1057":"The authors presents their perspectives on the relationship between antipsychiatry and the stigma of mental illness. The present paper aims to provide a short review of the basic principles of the antipsychiatric movement, and to discuss the atitudes of its most important theorists. The authors searched recent literature, as well as drawing upon some of the basic antipsychiatric texts. Antipsychiatry dates from 18th century, and as an international movement it emerged during the 1960s as part of the historic tumult of the period rather than as a result of the evolution of scientific ideas. During that period psychiatrists began to see heredity as the cause of mental illness, became pessimistic about restoring patients to sanity, and adopted essentially a custodial approach to care that included use of physical restraints. Radical attitudes of antipsychiatry gave a significant incentive to review psychiatric theory and practice, especially with protecting the rights of mental patients and giving importance not only to somatic, but mental, social and spiritual sides of human existence. But, at the same time, they led to unwarranted attacks on psychiatry as a medical discipline, encouraged different views of its stigmatization and in a certain measure affected the weakening of social awareness about the importance of medical and institutional care for the mentally ill persons. After the 1970s, the antipsychiatry movement became increasingly less influential, due in particular to the rejection of its politicized and reductionistic understanding of psychiatry.","1058":"The stigmatization of mentally ill patients has negative labelling, marginalization and exclusion of people simply because they have a mental illness. Stigma has negative consequences for the individual and his family, as well as for psychiatry as a profession and the entire community. Stigma weakens the mentally ill, reinforcing a sense of alienation, which has negative consequences on the course of the illness. The media can inform the public about the treatment of mentally ill patients by conveying correct information, who can then act positively towards improving the quality of treatment. Stigma and self-stigma create a feeling of low self-esteem and fear of rejection, due to which mentally ill people avoid the media and very rarely speak publicly about their illness. The realization of information rights is very delicate and it is reflected through two opposing but substantially equivalent human rights: 1. Right to information, 2. Right to privacy. Which of the two rights will get advantage depends on the circumstances of each case and journalism ethics. The relationship of psychiatry with the media and especially the media with psychiatry must be extremely correct and professional, based on facts, and not on the pursuit of media sensationalism. The media can significantly reduce the current level of stigmatization of the mentally ill by adequate and correct reports, and thereby facilitate their role in family and society. Lack of knowledge and understanding of mental illness contributes to stigmatization. Education of patients, their families and journalists is crucial if we want to better understand people with mental illness and reduce stigma.","1059":"In psychiatry, stigma means negative marking of the person only because s(he) has a diagnosis of mental disease, and usually this refers to schizophrenia. Stigmatization is related to prejudice, i.e. negative attitudes that are deeply rooted on false beliefs that schizophrenia cannot be treated. In principle, stigma is caused by combination of ignorance and fear which represents the basis of the creation of entrenched myths and prejudice. From a historical point of view, schizophrenia as a disease remains for public, one of the medical areas that are related to fear, a sense of discomfort, prejudice and avoidance. A combination of difficult mental disease, discrimination and stigmatization can be devastating for mentally disabled patients. Throughout history, stigma played significant role in patient's emotional and social isolation from other people deepening their suffering. A common consequence of stigma is discrimination which represents violation of basic human rights. Mentally disabled patients are often unjustifiably seen as dangerous, incapable, irresponsible which causes their isolation, homelessness and economic collapse. Thereby, possibilities for normal life, work, treatment, rehabilitation and social integration are decreased.","1060":"The aim of this review is evaluate stigma seen among people suffering from psychiatric disorders. We will show the negative effects of stigma on psychiatric services and evaluate the importance of continiuous anti-stigma programs. It is encouraging that new anit-stigma programmes are developed. The aim of this program is the restoration of dignity to patients and institutions. Media play an important role in shaping the view of an average person on psychiatric patients and most programms use media as a mediator to promote a positive attitude to psychiatric disorders. Apart from ignorance, fear and hostility they have to deal with self-stigma, as well. Through anti-stigma programs, psychoeducation of patients and families about the disorder and treatment options we can give them an acitve role in the treatment, restore dignity, self-confidence, quality of life and reintegrate them into the society.","1061":null,"1062":"In Croatia, psychiatric disorders are the leading group of disorders by days of hospitalization and they are in second place according to the number of hospitalizations in the period of working age.

In this paper we determined the impact of compulsory education in psychiatry on the attitudes of medical students of the fourth year of the Zagreb school of medicine and Osijek school of medicine. We tested attitudes toward psychiatry, psychiatric treatment and attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help using questionnaires that were filled out twice, at the beginning of psychiatry placement and at the end of psychiatry placement. Questionnaires were completed by 239 students from the Zagreb school of medicine and Faculty of medicine Osijek (response rate 78.4%). After the placement, students had significantly more positive attitudes about psychiatry and psychiatric treatment, as well as the attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help. Attitudes towards psychiatry, seeking psychological help and attitude towards psychiatric medication and psychotherapy correlated with the evaluation of the quality of psychiatric education. Additional forms of education in psychiatry should be offered, in order to maintain and increase the impact of education on students' attitudes.","1063":"Chemo preventive and antitumor role of vitamin D is manifested through genetic and non genetic ways with a powerful antproliferatory and proapopoptic effect, which is proven by numerous epidemiologic studies. The genetic activity of vitamin D is determined through vitamin D receptors (VDR), a member of stero-thyreoidal family of nuclear receptors, which with vitamin D form a cell nucleus complex responsible for the chemo preventive and antitumor effect. VDR in tissue cells is present in the cytoplasm and the nucleus and manifests its genetic activity after transfer from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. The mechanisms for the transport and genetic control of the transport of VDR from cytoplasm to the nucleus in not yet completely understood. By using immunohystochemistry we are evaluating the correlation of cytoplasmic and nuclear expression of VDR during different stages of colorectal carcinoma: normal colorectal mucosa, hyperplasic polyp, low grade adenoma (LGD), high grade adenoma (HGD) and colorectal cancer. Our results confirm that the nuclear VDR expression is strongest in normal colorectal mucosa and in hyper plastic polyps, is gradually weakened in low and high grade adenoma while it is extremely weak or absent in colorectal carcinoma. At the same time the expression of cytoplasm VDR is weakest in normal colorectal mucosa and hyper plastic polyps while it grows during the adenoma stage and is most expressed during colorectal carcinoma. We conclude that vitamin D has a strong chemo preventive and antitumor effect in normal colorectal mucosa and hyper plastic polyps, while its antitumor and chemopreventive effect is progressively weakened and ultimately absent in colorectal carcinoma.

The study was performed at the Emergency Department of the University Clinical Hospital of Mostar on patients with abdominal pain which started less than 24 hours before, excluding patients under 16 years old, uncooperative patients and those with altered state of consciousness. The sample data were collected from February to May 2010. Hundred patients completed the questionnaire. Two patients, admitted to the Abdominal Surgery Department, were excluded. The patients were asked to sign the informed consent form and assess the level of pain on three scales (VAS, NRS, VRS). The NRS showed a significant difference in assessing the pain intensity in the observed time. By lapse of time, the patients were reporting lower pain intensity (P=0.017). VAS and NRS had high correlation coefficient values, indicating strong correlation and credibility. The NRS showed strong results correlation (r=0.784; P&lt;0.001). Inter-scale correlation was growing over time. Correlation between VAS and NRS was very strong, the strongest in the last measurement (r=0.950; P&lt;0.001). The NRS correlation with VRS (r=0.430; P&lt;0.001) was slightly better than with VAS (r=0.402; P&lt;0.001). The NRS proved to be the most sensitive to changes in pain intensity (SRM=0.305), whereas the VRS showed extremely low responsiveness (SRM=0.185). Having proved as the most useful, reliable and efficient pain assessment instrument, the NRS is hereby recommended as method of pain objectification and determining changes in pain intensity.

Anomalies of coronary arteries may be found incidentally in 0.3-1% of healthy individuals. The three types of coronary artery anomalies are anomalies of origin, anomalies of course and anomalies of termination. The purpose of our study was to estimate the frequency of CAAs in Canton Sarajevo, B&amp;H, and to deteremine the prevalence of origin, course and termination anomalies of coronary arteries. This was a retrospective analysis of 919 patients who underwent Coronary CT Angiography to determine CAAs in the period from 2013 to 2017. In our study, total number of CAAs have been found among the 130 patients (14.12%) out of which anomalies of origin are found at 14 patients (1.52%), anomalies of course at 115 patients (12.5%) and anomaly of termination in 1 patient (0.1%). Out of 14 cases in total anomalies of origin, anomalies of origin of the left coronary artery are observed among 11 patients (1.2%), and anomalies of origin of the right coronary artery among 3 patients (0.3%). From mentioned 14 cases of the anomalous origin of the coronary arteries, anomalies with clinical significance (interarterial, malignant course) of the coronary arteries are found among 6 patients (0.65%) and anomalies without clinical significance are found among 8 patients (0.87%). Coronary artery anomalies of origin with malignant course are devided in two groups: LMA from right sinus of Valsalva with interarterial course observed in 4 patients (0.43%) and RCA from left sinus of Valsalva, also with interarterial course in 2 patients (0.21%). We found 4 patients (0.43%) with separated origin LAD and LCX, without LMA. The preavlence rates of separate origin of RCA and conus artery, anomaly origin of the LCX from right coronary sinus, anomaly origin of the LMA from posterior coronary sinus and LMA from right coronary sinus without interarterial course were seen in 0.1% of patients. Among 115 cases of anomalies of course 111 cases (12.07%) belongs to bridging (37 cases to LAD; 25 cases to D1 and D2 and 49 to ramus intermedius), and 4 cases (0.43%) belongs to intraatrial course of RCA.

We also aimed to determine reference values of the assay and the possibility of fast ACS diagnosis using hsTnI. The study included 26 patients with ongoing chest pains and suspected ACS. ACS diagnosis was determined using electrocardiographic changes and international guidelines. Biochemical parameters were measured using standard tests which included Troponin I, hsTroponin I, CK, CK-MB and CRP. 10 (38.5 %) patients out of 26 were diagnosed with ACS. Median age was 63.92 years. Comparison of predictive values showed that hsTnI and TnI had an advantage before CK, CK-MB and CRP. hsTnI showed no significant improvements over TnI. With an perfect negative predictive value at admission, hsTnI is recommended for use as a rule-out method for ACS in patients with chest pain and suspected ACS on admission. hsTnI was superior to contemporary TnI assays only as a rule-out method for suspected ACS patients at admission.","1070":"The prospective study, which was made from Jan 1st 2009. till Dec 31st 2010. in the Clinic for Infectious Diseases within Clinical Hospital Mostar has been implemented in the areas of three southwestern cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We wanted to define the seroprevalence of the researched area using seroepidemiological testing of different groups of the population, based on the distribution by sex, age, education, residence and watersupply. The aim of this research was to prove the hypothesis that the decrease of seroprevalency of Hepatitis A has been directly related to the improvement of socio-economic conditions of life that at the end brought the decrease of the total prevalence in patients in younger age groups. The total of 420 examinees from the reasserted sample were analysed and they were classify into age groups. The first group was for the children up to 10 years. Then the group 11-20 follows and etc up to the last group, that complies examinees older than 60. In this way we have got seven groups of 60 examinees, from which the half of them was urban, and the other half was rural inhabitants. In every group analysed the half of examinees were females and the other half were males. The results we acquired with this research did not show any statistically relevant differences of seroprevalence of Hepatitits A between the urban and rural areas, between the sexes, nor between the populations which used different wattersupply objects. A statistically relevant difference was found between populations of different levels of education, but the most important difference was found between seroprevalency in different age groups. Seroprevalence in younger age groups was substantially low and increased in groups rising with age. Comparing this data to results from other similair researches from developed and undeveloped countries we concluded that the researched area, by the level of seroprevalency of Hepatitis A belongs to the category of developed countries.","1071":"To determine the frequency and type of complications in two cohort groups of preterm newborns. The research involved 100 preterm newborns divided into two groups according to their gestational age: newborns from 24 to 33+6\/7 weeks GA and newborns from 34 to 36+6\/7 weeks GA. Parameters which were observed with mother were: age, number of births, course and complications in pregnancy. Parameters with infant: gestational age, weight, newborn small for gestational age (IUGR), asphyxia, respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, hyperbilirubinemia, apnea, anemia, intracranial hemorrhage and metabolic disorder (hypoglycaemia, hypocalcaemia). Research criterion for exclusion was all preterm newborn infants with chromosome anomalies which cause death, fetal death during pregnancy (in utero) and newborns (born after full 37 weeks). After dividing exminees according to their gestational age into two groups, the group with higher gestational age (from 34 to 36+6\/7 weeks GA) had 76% and the group with lower gestational age (from 24 to 33+6\/7 weeks GA) had 24% of infants. The course of pregnancy was pathological in 68% of pregnancies and normal with 32% of pregnncies, the difference is statistically significant. 97% of pregnant woman had pathological course in the group of preterm newborns with lower GA. The most common perinatal complication was hyperbilirubinemia in 42% of cases, while sepsis was present in 1% of infants. The first group of infants (&lt;33 GA) had mostly combination of 3 or more complications in 46% of infants while the other group mostly had hyperbilirubinemia in 50% and combination of complications in 24% of infants. Perinatal complication occurence depends on premature birth and course of pregnancy. Larger number of complications and harder complications which may result with death are more common in patients with lower gestational age (24 to 33+6\/7 weeks GA) than in patients with higher gestational age (34 to 36+6\/7 weeks GA).

","1073":"The quality of life (QOL) of mothers who have children with cerebral palsy (CP) is significantly worse than in mothers with typically developing children. In available literature we have not found an approach which analyzes the correlation of mothers' personality traits with their QOL and health related quality of life (HrQOL). The study included 101 mothers of children with CP, aged 4 to 18 years. Mothers' personalities have been assessed by Eysenck EPQ - R questionnaire that determines three personality traits: neuroticism\/emotional stability, extroversion\/introversion and psychoticism. Maternal HrQOL was assessed by SF-36 questionnaire, Short Form, and their emotional well-being by WHO 5 well-being index. In addition, the influence of mothers' religiosity was also analyzed, using DUREL Religiosity Questionnaire. Motor assessment of children was performed using Gross Motor Function Classification System. The control group consisted of mothers of typically developing children of the same age. Participants with high levels of extraversion had better QOL and HrQOL, as opposed to those with high levels of neuroticism and psychoticism, who had worse physical and mental health. The degree of children's motor impairment and mothers' religiosity did not influence QOL. Regression analysis distinguishes the following predictors for better mothers' QOL: better their mental health, greater level of their vitality, extroversion, living with a partner, a lesser degree of children's motor impairment and better their QOL. It is vital to identify the factors that affect QOL of a mother and a child with CP. We consider it justified to regularly conduct mothers' professional monitoring and treatment simultaneously with children's treatment and we propose the protocol for the individual and targeted approach.

For example, cardio-respiratory symptoms may be due to the accompanying pharmacological effects of anesthetics and poor interpretation of the reaction during anesthesia. It is important to distinguish whether a real allergic reaction has occurred. Accidents with anesthetics and muscle relaxants are observed more often than we expect. Proper anaphylaxis rarely occurs during anesthesia (1: 20000). Muscle relaxants are the most common causes, followed by latex, chlorhexidine, antibiotics and opioids. To confirm the diagnosis it is necessary to perform a larger number of blood and skin tests. Targeted diagnostic approach and therapy allow avoiding more difficult events. Anesthesia should be selected for those medications that have been tested. Additionally, patients should be premedicated with antihistaminics and systemic steroids, as the emergence of intolerance is not completely excluded by negative testing. There is no gold standard for testing, even if every method is precisely performed; there are always false positive and false negative results. When anaphylaxis appears, urgent approach is needed to provide the patient with appropriate treatment. It is necessary to act according to the established algorithms and treatment protocols. Many anesthesiologists will not ever see such a reaction, and very few will see more than one during their work life. Awareness of allergy in anesthesia is still insufficient.","1076":"Depression is the most common psychiatric disorder in the world population and the most frequent mental disorder in a primary health care. Unrecognized and untreated depression is associated with a poor outcome of treated chronic diseases which co-exist with depression. Depression and cardiovascular diseases are bidirectional related conditions, risks are for each other, and they often co-exist. Depression is a common disorder in cardiovascular patients with a prevalence of 20% to 45%, which is much more frequent than in the general population. In cardiac patients with acute myocardial infarction, depression occurs three times more often than in the general population. Depression has a direct effect on the pathophysiological changes of various organ systems, changing the values of blood pressure, heart rate, vasomotor tone, vascular resistance, blood viscosity and plasma volume. The potential mechanism for developing heart disease in depressed patients includes hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal gland dysfunction, increased proinflammatory and prothrombotic factor activity, reduced omega-3 fatty acids, reduced heart rate variability, smoking, physical inactivity, reduced mood, self-esteem and self-efficacy.","1077":"Pathophysiology in Ukraine has rich traditions and achievements in the scientific areas, as well as in teaching academic discipline.

This leads to the appearance of BPSD (Behavioural and psychotic symptoms of dementia). There are guides to the therapy of cognitive deficits of dementia in existence, to use them within the EbM criteria. There exists only a little bit of information on the therapy of BPSD. Therefore I will talk in his article mainly about possibilities of therapy, that were found through medical experience. For those possibilities is only little evidence and are mostly off label, because the field of dementia patients has almost no studies, except pharmaceutical ones.

A better understanding of correlates of voluntary versus involuntary admission legal status is crucial to improve clinical decision-making and effectiveness of the overall mental health care system. We collected chart-review data pertaining to 848 patients, discharged between June 2011 and June 2014, from an Italian inpatient psychiatric unit. Diverse sociodemographic and clinical variables were collected. Bivariate analyses and binary logistic regression were performed to examine correlates of involuntary admission. Bivariate analyses showed that involuntary status was related to: the reason for hospitalization, not being on psychiatric medications at admission, and being admitted from another inpatient ward (in particular, from the emergency department). The final regression model identified four main variables independently associated with legal status: being admitted for psychotic features, suicidal behavior, or impulsive behavior, and not being on medication at admission (Nagelkerke pseudo R2=0.15, p&lt;0.001). A strong association with length of stay was also documented.

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine the association among AS and suicidal behaviour while taking into account the effects of potential third variables such as the presence of anxiety disorders and hopelessness in adolescents with major depressive disorder. Participants (n=101) completed self-report measures of depressive symptoms, AS, hopelessness and suicidal ideation severity. The presence of anxiety disorders and suicide attempt history were determined with psychiatric interviews. The association between psychiatric variables was evaluated using structural equation modelling. Results showed that AS cognitive concerns had a positive effect on suicidal ideation mediated by the severity of depression. AS physical concerns had a negative direct effect on suicidal ideation, but there was also a positive relationship among these variables through hopelessness, thus, the total effect of AS physical concerns was not significant. There were also positive relationships between hopelessness and suicidal ideation, and the presence of anxiety disorders to suicide attempt history. The results of this study suggest that higher AS cognitive concerns may be a risk factor for suicidality through the severity of depression in adolescents who are diagnosed with major depressive disorder.

A total of 162 elderly patients with OP fracture treated in three third-grade general hospitals of Jiangsu Province from January 2016 to September 2016 participated in this study. According to the minimization random allocation method, the patients were divided into two groups: the conventional rehabilitation group and the HBM rehabilitation group, with 81 patients in each group. After three months of intervention, the two groups were compared in terms of anxiety, depression, OP knowledge, and OP health belief. After 3 months of intervention, the anxiety and depression scores decreased in both groups. Both anxiety and depression scores of the HBM rehabilitation group were higher than those of the conventional rehabilitation group, with statistically significant differences (P&lt;0.001). The increases in the OP knowledge score and OP health belief score of the HBM rehabilitation group were higher than those of the conventional rehabilitation group, with statistically significant differences (P&lt;0.001).

Study involved 80 hospitalized patients with any of the subtypes of schizophrenia (42 men, 38 women). They were divided into two groups: exercise and control group, both with 40 patients. Maximal aerobic capacity (VO2 max) as an indicator of cardiovascular fitness has been obtained by cardiopulmonary stress test on a treadmill. Twelve weeks program of prescribed physical activity (45 minutes, four times per week) was made for every patient individually. Patients in exercise group practiced in training zone between 65 and 75% of their maximum heart rate (HR). Target HR was controlled by Polar F4 monitors. Symptoms of schizophrenia were measured by using Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS). Before the exercise program was introduced, measured VO2 max was significantly lower in patients with schizophrenia, than the expected average value in matched healthy subjects (p&lt;0.001). After twelve weeks, patients in exercise group showed a significant increase of VO2max (p=0.002), and significantly higher level of VO2max compared to the control group (p=0.000). Significant differences were also observed on PANSS general psychopathology subscale (p=0.007) and on PANSS total score (p=0.001). The pharmacotherapy and exercise had influence on PANSS general psychopathology (p=0.002) and PANSS total score (p=0.001).

The groups were assessed by a wide neuropsychological battery, including measures of attention\/working memory (Digit Span and Stroop Test), executive functions (Tower of London-Drexel Version -TOLDX- and Brixton Test), language (Boston Naming Test and Category Fluency), memory (Prose Recall and Pairs Associates Learning), and visuospatial function (Street's Completion Test and Constructive Apraxia Test). Performances were compared by non parametric tests. Spearman correlations were performed to explore association between neuropsychological measures of attention\/working memory and executive functions in PD-MCI group. The PD-MCI patients performed worse on Digit Span and Stroop Interference\/Error than aMCI+ and controls. AMCI+ patients, in turn, showed a greater deficit on TOLDX Initiation Time and on Violation Time than PD-MCI and controls.

Biological factors refer to increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS), hypertension, elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and homocysteine levels. Peripheral Brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), serum N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) are promising surrogate markers of increased cardiovascular risk. Among psychological factors, some personality traits, such as neuroticism and trait impulsivity\/hostility, contribute to the development of PTSD, and are associated with general cardiovascular distress. Recently, type-D (distressed) personality is usually investigated in relation to cardiovascular morbidity, but in populations other than PTSD patients. Behavioral factors refer to unhealthy life-styles, encompassing high smoking rate, drug substances abuse and addiction, physical inactivity and unhealthy diet. The relationships among all these factors are complex and yet incompletely taken into consideration. Because of a high prevalence of CVD in patients with PTSD, there is a strong need for a more intensive focus on this vulnerable population in both primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention as well as in effective treatment possibilities.","1098":null,"1099":"The boundary between Dermatology and Psychiatry has increasing recognition.

","1100":"The aim of this paper is to elucidate the role of oxidative and nitrosative stress as well as the tryptophan catabolites pathway in the development of depression and the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs, based on the available literature. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 350 million people worldwide suffer from depression. The pathogenesis of depressive disorders has not been fully explained yet and several causes of this disease have been suggested. There is evidence for the involvement of several interconnected biochemical pathways, including oxidative and nitrosative stress as well as the tryptophan catabolites pathway. Studies to date indicate that patients with depression have lower levels of enzymatic and non-enzymatic elements of an antioxidant response and, at the same time, they display an increased amount of oxidative stress markers, when compared to healthy individuals. The development of depression is also associated with excessive activity of nitric oxide synthase. Furthermore, decreased levels of tryptophan and increased levels of its harmful catabolites, i.e. kynurenine and quinolinic acid, may lead to progression of the disease. Changes in these biochemical pathways can be used as risk factors for the development of depression and, in the future, they could be utilized as diagnostic biomarkers. Moreover, regulation of biochemical processes may contribute to the development of a new, effective and personalized antidepressant therapy.","1101":"Anti-psychotics are often prescribed off-licence for personality and affective disorders.

","1102":"This essay was submitted for the Royal College of Psychiatry's perinatal psychiatry medical student essay prize in 2017. The essay considers the choices available to women with bipolar disorder who become pregnant while taking sodium valproate to treat mania or for mood stabilisation. The implications of three options are considered: to stop all treatment, to switch to a different mood stabiliser or to continue on sodium valproate. The implications for the fetus, on the mother's wellbeing and the ethics of patient choice are discussed. Pregnancy can be especially challenging for women with bipolar disorder, predominantly because of the heightened probability of relapse, potential fetal harm caused by bipolar medication, and a 250-fold risk of puerperal psychosis compared to the general population. Sodium valproate is a known teratogen, and is discouraged in pregnancy, but what choice is open to women who rely on this medication to stabilise their mood? The large majority of women of childbearing age with bipolar disorder should not be prescribed sodium valproate as the risks to the unborn fetus far outweigh the benefits of the medication, as other drugs have similar if not better efficacy to stabilize the mother's mood, with lower risks to the fetus. In the small minority of women for whom valproate may be the only effective treatment, she must be fully informed of the teratogenic and neurodevelopmental risks, as well as the ways in which the pregnancy can be managed to reduce such risks. ","1103":"Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a common and highly debilitating psychiatric disorder. Amongst OCD sufferers are a significant number (40-60%) of so-called non-responders who do not fully respond to commonly available treatments, which include medications (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors-SSRIs) and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). Modern 'neuromodulatory' techniques such as Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS), repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) potentially offer alternative forms of treatment for OCD patients who either do not respond to, or are unable or unwilling to take SSRIs and undergo CBT. Although shown to be effective in treatment resistant OCD, DBS requires invasive neurosurgical procedures with associated risks. On the other hand, rTMS and tDCS are non-invasive forms of treatment, which are largely risk free, but the evidence of their efficacy so far is somewhat limited, with only small number of published studies. In this brief survey we will address the potential of rTMS as a therapeutic tool for OCD and review the published literature on the cortical targets for rTMS used so far. We will also discuss some of the newer variants of rTMS techniques only a few of which have been employed so far, and speculate whether there might be a place for rTMS as a standard treatment in OCD, along side CBT, SSRIs and DBS.","1104":"The object of this paper, rather than producing new information, is to produce a useful vademecum for doctors prescribing antidepressants, with the information useful for their being prescribed. Antidepressants need to be seen as part of a package of treatment for the patient with depression which also includes psychological treatments and social interventions. Here the main Antidepressant groups, including the Selective Serotonin uptake inhibiters, the tricyclics and other classes are described, together with their mode of action, side effects, dosages. Usually antidepressants should be prescribed for six months to treat a patient with depression. The efficacy of anti-depressants is similar between classes, despite their different mechanisms of action. The choice is therefore based on the side-effects to be avoided.

Physical health assessments and medicines reconciliation are important aspects of patient care. The interventions introduced have improved the quality of practice at an acute mental health unit.","1107":"Treatment and rehabilitation of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities is a multidisciplinary challenge, which require implementing new attitudes. The use of modern technology solutions like telepsychiatry or virtual reality may be a valuable addition to the traditional methods. The objective of this review was to explore the usability of new technological solutions in this special population of patients. The search in the PubMed was conducted using the following terms: (intellectual disability (Title\/Abstract) OR developmental disability OR learning disorder (Title\/Abstract)) AND virtual reality (Title\/Abstract) OR telepsychiatry OR telemedicine OR e-mental health AND English (lang) AND (1995\/01\/01(PDAT): 2017\/07\/31(PDAT)). Telepsychiatry may be a useful tool in situations, when the direct access to professional assistance is limited, in solving particular problems like e.g. managing challenging behavior, also to support patients' parents and for diagnostic and educational purposes. Virtual reality can be a safe and effective method of improving different skills, developing physical fitness, and enriching the ways of spending the leisure time. Using modern technology is a relatively new and promising field in which new ideas may develop to support the already existing services for patients with intellectual and developmental disabilities. ","1108":"Adherence to treatment is a major issue in relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Injectable depot has been claimed to improve non-adherence. A study in the North of England has shown that risperidone long acting injectable form has reduced number of admissions and number of days stayed in hospital. Our study aimed to replicate the previous study in the South of England. A retrospective study was conducted in the South Essex Foundation University NHS trust. We selected every fifth patient on the Hospital Pharmacy list for risperidone long acting injectable (RLAI). We collected information on. Age, sex, diagnosis and medication ,regular follow up, investigation of each patient which included weight, FBS, S. lipid and hormones at the start of treatment, at three months and six months intervals. We recorded reasons for starting RLAI. Number of antipsychotics prescribed before RLAI, illness duration, number of admissions and days stayed in hospital in each episode before and after RLAI. Patients were included if they stayed for one year or on RLAI. We reviewed 65 case notes. The most common reason for starting RLAI was non compliance. 80% of our sample had the illness for more than five years. Half of them had physical morbidity. After RLAI was commenced there was a significant association with number and length of admissions. We have found an association between prescription of RLAI and reduction in number and length of admission. This needs to be confirmed in a randomised controlled trial. ","1109":"To identify risk factors and psychiatric morbidity in bronchial Asthma. Patients who consented to participate in the study, were checked for bronchial asthma. They were interviewed and their sociodemographic data were recorded, the hospital anxiety and depression was administered. Results were inputted in a computer programme and software statistical programme Minitab version 14.1 was utilised to analyse these data. It showed statistically significant correlation between age, duration of asthma and HAD score. Psychiatric morbidity is a neglected area in the management and care of physical illnesses, especially, bronchial asthma, where patients may get very worried and scared during acute attacks when they feel that they may suffocate. Assessing and managing the psychiatric morbidity of such patients will be reflected on the outcome of the illness and improve the quality of life of such patients. ","1110":"It has been proven that physical morbidity is related to psychiatric illness. Some physical illnesses are more related to psychiatric morbidity compared to others. Epilepsy is considered one of them, as patients who suffer from epilepsy has disturbances of consciousness and this leads to a variety of psychological disturbance in addition to the psychological and social impact of the illness. To identify risk factors and psychiatric morbidity in epilepsy, in order to try to manage it and improve outcome of this illness and enhance quality of life. Patients who were referred to the department of Neurology at Mosul Teaching hospital from primary care centres between October 2012 and February 2013 and consented to participate in the study, were checked and if they fulfilled the criteria for the diagnosis of epilepsy, they were interviewed and their sociodemographic data were recorded, the hospital anxiety and depression questionnaire (HAD) was administered. Results were input in a computer programme and software statistical programme Minitab version 14.1 was utilised to analyse these data. The whole sample was 100 patients. 55 females and 45 males were included. Mean age was 30 years. Mean duration of illness was 5.5 years. Mean HAD score was 17. Male patients were a little bit older but there was no statistically significant difference compared to females and they both scored similar HAD score. There was no difference between urban and rural population with regards to HAD score. The results showed statistically significant correlation between age and duration of the illness and HAD score. The present study showed that there is a correlation between epilepsy and psychiatric morbidity. It has confirmed that females are more affected compared to males, which is expected as compared to the general population. It has also confirmed that psychiatric morbidity is positively related to epilepsy as it showed that the duration of illness has increased the psychiatric morbidity. Psychiatric morbidity is a neglected area in the management and care of physical illnesses, especially, epilepsy, where patients may get stigmatised and traumatised in the society. They may live in constant fear of having a fit. Assessing and managing the psychiatric morbidity of such patients will be reflected on the outcome of the illness and improve the quality of life of patients. ","1111":"A literature review was conducted to elucidate the respective reproductive safety profiles of different SSRIs to inform the prescribing practices of doctors treating pregnant women with anxiety and depression. Women are most likely to be diagnosed with depression or anxiety between the ages of 25 and 44 years, which are also the years of childbearing potential (Burke et al., 1991). Therefore a substantial number of women face a decision about whether or not to take an antidepressant or anxiolytic during pregnancy. There are no psychotropic medications that have UK marketing authorisation (NICE, 2014), no clear clinical consensus has been reached regarding the use of SSRIs in pregnancy, and clinicians lack a resource which discusses the reproductive safety profiles of different SSRIs rather than the class of drugs as a whole. We performed a search for the English language literature indexed on MEDLINE\/PubMed for the period 2012 to 2017, using the following key terms: fluoxetine, prozac, paxil, oxactin, paroxetine, seroxat, sertraline, lustral, citalopram, cipramil, escitalopram, cipralex, fluvoxamine, faverin, with 'pregnant woman', 'pregnant women', pregnancy. We excluded general SSRI and pregnancy articles (although we did read these papers for valuable background information) because we are interested in elucidating the differences between the drugs in this class, rather than the general effects of the SRRI class as a whole. The literature shows that paroxetine and fluoxetine have the strongest association with negative outcomes (significant malformations, PPHN and PNAS) whilst the associations between sertraline and citalopram with negative outcomes remains mixed and generally unsubstantiated when studies that show an association are controlled for the effects of maternal depression and associated factors. There are too few studies to draw definite conclusions regarding the safety of escitalopram and fluvoxamine. Sertraline and citalopram should be first-line drug treatments for anxiety and depression in pregnant women in the SSRI class. Sertraline can be continued in breast-feeding as the concentration found in breast milk is very low and has not been linked to infant complications. Furthermore, it would be useful to assess GPs current knowledge and confidence levels about prescribing, to see whether further education is needed in this area to encourage an open discussion of the risks and benefits of medication or no medication. It would also be useful to conduct further research on escitalopram which is likely to grow in popularity in the coming years as it came off patent in 2012. When these holes are filled, a clinical protocol for treating anxiety and depression in pregnant women should be created and implemented for the UK population. ","1112":"Comorbidity is a term defined as the presence of two or more conditions occurring either at the same time or having a close relationship to the same individual. World Health Organization (WHO) define it as the \"co-occurrence in the same individual of a psychoactive substance use disorder and another psychiatric disorder\". Progressive deinstitutionalisation, despite indisputable benefits and improvement of life quality in psychiatric patients, resulted in appearance of new burdens, such as deterioration of family life. Furthermore, wide availability of alcoholic beverages and drugs in communities where the patients live, led comorbid substance abuse disorders to emerge as one of the biggest challenges in the modern psychiatry. There is a limited amount of data concerning the background of the patients with a dual diagnosis, available in the literature, and therefore our aim was to create a sociodemographic profile of such individuals. The study was conducted among the patients treated in a drug rehabilitation centre of the Upper Silesian Association \"Familia\" in Gliwice, Poland using authors' own questionnaire, consisting of 75 items. The study group consisted of 9 females and 91 males (n=100), average age of the patients equalled 29.7 years (95%CI: 28.5-31 years; min\/max value: 20\/48 years), all the patients had an established dual diagnosis. 66% of the study group was single, with permanent residency, living with family either in city (47%) or in village (19%). Remaining 34% was spread through the other options (1-4%), with the highest percentage in \"single, with permanent residency, living alone in the city\" (4%). Obtained data, demonstrated high homogeneity among the patients with a dual diagnosis in terms of a socio-demographical profile. ","1113":"Hope underpins the recovery process of mental illness, as recovery depends on the notion that a patient desires to get better. This makes hope the route by which it occurs. Here, we assess the importance of hope in recovery by exploring what recovery means; the relevance of hope and other factors in achieving it; and finally, the difficulties surrounding maintaining hope. We attempt to discuss hope in the context of recovery from three different situations; Depression, Anorexia Nervosa, and Schizophrenia, and therefore we consider what recovery means in each of these situations and hence the role of hope in each of them. The journey of recovery is an on-going, personal process, which aims to allow a person to have a satisfying life despite the limitations posed by their condition. Several factors are important in permitting it, ranging from learning how to manage one's condition, to improving self- esteem. However, the central tenet in recovery is hope- it is the catalyst for change, and the enabler of the other factors involved in recovery to take charge. Whilst problems exist in helping an individual believe in it, there exist definite routes by which it can be done, such as education and reducing stigma. Ultimately, hope is just as important in recovery from mental illness as in physical illness because hope matters in any situation - the only difference is that in mental illness, the end point is much harder to rationalize in the patient's mind because it requires an awareness that one's mental state is not fixed, the truth being that mental illnesses are not part of one's nature, but are states of mind which can be changed in many instances. Therefore, we must work even harder to ensure this belief is instilled in those suffering from mental illness because hope offers the means by which a better future can be perceived; and therefore, achieved.","1114":"The PHQ-9 is effective in screening patients for depressionas well as monitoring progress in a variety of situations. Using the PHQ-9 after a pre-assessment with the PHQ-2 increases its specificity, as well as preventing under-diagnosis. Although it is not suitable as a stand-alone tool for a diagnosis, it is a cost-effective, efficient method of screening patients in primary care.","1115":"Antidepressants are routinely used by General Practitioners (GP) as well as Psychiatrists to treat Depression. They are tolerated well. However, in certain patient populations, they are associated with SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Anti-Diuretic Hormone Secretion) and Hyponatremia. Various research studies have shown that all antidepressants are associated with Hyponatremia. Hyponatremia as a side effect of antidepressant therapy is more commonly seen in old age, chronic Kidney disease and Hypothyroidism. Untreated Hyponatremia could lead to life threatening emergencies including Cerebral oedema, brain damage and coma. In this article, the authors discuss a 63 year old patient who suffered from Bipolar Disorder Type 2. He was treated with antidepressants (mainly Paroxetine) on and off for 30 years, without much side effects, until 2014. In July 2012, he underwent subtotal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis as a management of adeno carcinoma of Colon. In April 2013, Paroxetine was stopped as he was well. He developed first episode of mania in July 2014. This was managed with Olanzapine. However, he soon developed a Depressive episode and severe Anxiety. He was restarted on Paroxetine and the dose was increased up to 50 mg along with Olanzapine 15 mg per day. As he did not improve, he was switched to Sertraline with which he developed Hyponatremia. Further to this, he was tried on Venlafaxine and Lofepramine and he developed Hyponatremia with both of them. Considering the severity of Depression, he was started on Mirtazapine and the dose was titrated to 45 mg. With this dose his serum Sodium levels were stable but his Depression persisted. Fluoxetine augmentation at this stage by the GP led to another episode of Hyponatremia. Hence, he was started on Aripiprazole 5 mg as an augmentation agent. His Depression improved reasonably (though he did not remit fully). Recently, he has been started on Vortioxetine and the dose has been titrated to 15 mg OD and in addition, he is on Mirtazapine 45 mg OD and Aripiprazole 5 mg OD. His Sodium levels have been stable and his Depression has improved. This is the first time we have come across a patient with colectomy developing severe Hyponatremia. In this article, we have discussed possible reasons for Hyponatremia following colectomy and the management strategies that could help.","1116":"The quality of information provided by referring general practitioners to secondary care mental health services are crucial elements in the effective management of patients. In order to establish effective communication, both primary and secondary care health professionals should contribute to planning and organising this process taking into account their different opinions and views. Anonymous questionnaire was designed to collect information on items that GPs and psychiatrist rated as most important items in GP referral letters to psychiatrists. The questionnaires were sent out electronically. Each item was scored using a rating scale where 0 was least important and 10 was most important. Items that scored 8 and above were agreed by all as the most important items. 76 GP letters were audited using a devised checklist of the identified most important items. Data was collected and analysed using a devised data collection tool. A re-audit was done 6months later. A response rate of 70% was obtained for both psychiatrists and GPs. Reasons for referral were described in almost all GP referral letters (95%). Only 24% referral letters had details about current physical health which improved to 59%. Concerns about risk were described in only 47% of letters and treatment provided by GP in 50% of letters. These improved in 79% and 71% of letters respectively in the re-audit. The involvement of professionals in devising a standardised approach for referral letters has improved communication in this re-audit between GPs and Psychiatrists. This is evident in the improvement in key aspects of the referral letters: past medical history, past psychiatric history, current physical health, treatment provided by GP. Efficient communication between GPs and psychiatrists improves the quality of health care for patients. ","1117":"As humans, we are born with no knowledge of odour. Our sense of smell is linked directly to the limbic system, the emotional part of our brain responsible for memory and behaviour, and therefore, our individual sense of smell is based purely on life's deep experiences and impressions. The roots of \"Aromatherapy\" can be traced back more than 3,500 years, to a time when essential oils were first recorded in human history for their therapeutic and medicinal properties. However, in the 21st century, it remains one of the most controversial complementary therapies applied in medicine because of its pseudoscience connotations and limited available data on health benefits, despite the importance of smell on human health. Here I introduce the concept of \"eScent\", an emotionally responsive wearable technology that picks up on your emotions and vital signs and sends a personalisable 'scent bubble' to your nose. It combines sensing and dispensing aromatics for immersive experiences and multiple health benefits. It presents an empowering, sensory intervention and resilience builder that emits mood-enhancing aromas in a controllable way, depending on biofeedback. The advantage of essential oils merged with biometric sensors and intelligent tracking devices (e.g. an Apple Watch), could lead to a new palette of scents that are bio-synchronized to an individual's emotional, mental, and\/or physical state and in a real-time manner alleviate high levels of stress, thus preventing the risk of a serious mental ill health relapse. Closure of the loop with wearable scent delivery systems requires an innovative, creative and collaborative approach, crossing many disciplines in psychological related sciences, biotechnology and industrial design. Testing such hypotheses in translational human studies is a matter of future research which could not only lead to valuable \"prodromal\" interventions for psychiatry, but new stress management tools for people suffering from affective disorders.","1118":"Due to increasing demands on limited resources in the health care system, many hospitals are working to improve patient flow, thereby increasing their effective capacity. Identifying barriers to patient flow provides the best available evidence to improve such flow in The Canberra Hospital's acute psychiatric units. This audit uses a multi-method design (combining focus groups, audits of flow in mental health units and retrospective data analysis on a cross-section of patients) to investigate current patterns of patient flow and barriers to discharge through the Canberra Hospital Mental Health Assessment &amp; Adult Mental Health Units, and factors associated with increased length of stay. Mean LoS for MHAU and AMHU was 8.45 hours and 15 days respectively. Multiple factors were associated with an increased LoS including patient factors, certain hospital processes, and limited availability of community services. These findings inform recommendations on improving patient flow and future research to support increases in available funding, staffing and resources. ","1119":"The population of older adults with intellectual disability (ID) is large and growing due to a significant increase of life expectancy caused by improvements in health and social care. Multimorbidity is highly prevalent in this population and co-morbid psychiatric disorders are especially frequent. The aim of this article is to review the prevalence and consequences of psychiatric comorbidity in the population of older adults with ID. We therefore performed a literature search of studies relevant to adults with ID, published since January 2006, using the following keywords: intellectual disability and comorbidity, intellectual disability and mental disorders, intellectual disability and polypharmacy. Psychiatric comorbidity is frequent among patients with ID and correlates with older age. Mental disorders are present in up to 40% of older adults with ID and the most prevalent are challenging behaviour, depression, anxiety and dementia. Patients with ID and at least one co-morbid mental disorder are at a high risk of polypharmacy. Importantly, psychiatric comorbidity was found to significantly increase service use and costs of care. Further investigation of the population of older adults with ID is needed, with special attention to development of clear treatment guidelines in order to effectively manage co-morbid mental illnesses and physical health problems. ","1120":"Deficits in area of communication, crucial for maintaining proper social bonds, may have a prominent adverse impact on quality of life in patients with schizophrenia. Social exclusion, lack of employment and deterioration of family life, may be consequences of aggravated social competencies, caused by inability to properly exhibit and interpret facial expressions. Although this phenomenon is known since first clinical descriptions of schizophrenia, lack of proper methodology limited our knowledge in this area. Aim of our study was to compare facial expressivity of the patient with schizophrenia, and the healthy individual. 47-years old patient suffering from schizophrenia, and 36-years old healthy individual were invited to participate in our study. They underwent the examination in Human Facial Modelling Lab in Polish-Japanese Institute of Information Technology in Bytom (Silesia, Katowice). Both participants were presented with two video materials, first one contained different facial expressions, which they had to imitate. Second one a part of comedy show, during which spontaneous reactions were recorded. Acquisition of facial expressions was conducted with marker-based technology of modelling. Obtained data was analyzed using Microsoft Excel. An overall facial expression intensity, expressed as an average value of distances traveled by markers during shifts from neutral position was higher in case of a healthy participant during both part of the study. The difference was especially visible in case of an upper half of the face. Utilization of marker-based methods in analysis of human facial expressions seem to be reliable and remarkably accurate. ","1121":"People with intellectual disabilities (ID) are prescribed antipsychotic medications for different reasons; sometimes this is for a mental illness such as psychotic or affective symptoms, however antipsychotics are also used to improve behaviours that challenge, which are common in people with intellectual disabilities (ID) or autism or both. Antipsychotic medications can have many unwanted side effects and these should be monitored for. Guidelines also indicate that reductions in medication should be considered at psychiatry reviews and alternative interventions should be trialled. Using national recommendations on antipsychotic prescribing and monitoring and also on reducing antipsychotics in people with intellectual disabilities (ID), audit standards were determined. The Bedford caseload included 192 service users; of these 2 were new referrals and had yet to be seen so were not included. 70 of the remaining 190 were not on an antipsychotic medication. 120 patients were on an antipsychotic medication. Medical records of 60 of these were audited against the identified standards. The records over the previous year were observed to see either how an antipsychotic was started or an existing antipsychotic was monitored compared to the standards. ","1122":"Biofeedback is a non-invasive method of measurement of physiological functions. Precise instruments measure the slightest changes of different body functions-which are then in a clear and understandable manner shown in the form of feedback. Person gets an insight into what is going on inside the body and thus learns to change the patterns of behavior to improve health and performance. Any changes that are wanted are rewarded, which leads to learning of the new patterns of behavior. Neurofeedback is a type of biofeedback which uses electrical activity in the brain. Certain disorders are associated with specific patterns of brain activity, and through neurofeedback it is possible to reduce or even remove symptoms of some disorders. In the treatment of migraine different biofeedback methods- such as breathing, training of vasoconstriction\/vasodilatation and neurofeedback, may be applied. This paper will describe the successful treatment of 25 years old girl who suffered for many years from painful migraine. She had in total 25 treatments during which listed biofeedback methods were used. The first part of the treatment was neurofeedback training on the central sensorimotor area, followed by respiration training and at the end by biofeedback training of vasoconstriction\/vasodilatation. The final result of the treatment was significant reduce in the frequency of migraine attacks and the pain reduction. Further study, have to be done with more patients and with placebo group to scientifically prove the effectiveness of the method. ","1123":"Specific learning disorders include dyslexia - reading disorder, dysgraphia - writing disorder, dyspraxia and discoloration - difficulties with mathematical tasks. Along with these disorders, hyperactivity disorder and attention deficit are often associated with these disorders. According to available data, 2\/3 of children who have difficulty reading, writing, and counting have a lack of attention. Diagnosing these disorders is an important task for parents, preschools and schools, because it is prerequisite for understanding and treatment. The aim of the research was to gain information how the parents of preschool children get information and knowledge about learning disabilities at children, were they able to recognize the symptoms, what was the main source of their information and whether information was understandable and reliable. Five hundred (510) respondents participated in the survey. The survey was conducted from July to August 2016 and was conducted through a \"google\" application. The survey was placed at different social networks, and the participation in the survey was voluntary and anonymous with the note that parents of preschool and school children were participating. A survey of 10 questions with the offered answers was used in the survey. The results have shown that parents majority of information get from Internet \/which is understandable for this sample, because the survey was done through Internet\/. Most parents received information through online pages, which did not always mean getting the correct information. They expressed a need for expert education and more public talk about children's learning disabilities. Parents have been interested in this topic, so it is necessary to organize different workshops and lectures that will be led by experts to provide reliable and useful information and to put more professional information on Internet for parents. ","1124":"PRN prescriptions enablehealthcare staff to respond quickly to the urgent clinical needs of the user without having to contact the responsible clinician (RC). One problem, established amongst most institutions by NICE regarding the use of PRN, is that most of these institutions struggle to keep an updated or full record on the PRN medications. Thus, the aim of this audit was to check the record keeping of PRN medications, of two adolescent wards in St Andrews Healthcare Hospital, against the established standards. The standards were acquired from the local trust's medicine policy and are based on good clinical practice and principles. Data were collected over a 3-month period covering all the 16 in-patients of two wards in St Andrew's Healthcare Hospital. Medical case records and drug charts were reviewed retrospectively. All PRN prescriptions were reviewed against the standards. The total percentage of compliance with the standards was analyzed using spreadsheet software. The significant results obtained were that 36% of PRN medications were not cancelled even if they had not been used for &gt;1 month and 23% did not have clear indications of use. Majority of the other standards showed full compliance. Some PRN medications were not cancelled even if not used for &gt;1 month, most likely because it is often uncertain when a service user may require the PRN. This could be overcome by having screening tools such as START\/STOP to alert the RC after a month. Also, when filling in the PRN medication chart, clear indication for use must be an obligatory section on the system, in addition to increasing awareness among staff about this common error. Finally, regular review by the RC is required through seasonal audits, especially by medical and pharmaceutical staff, which will help monitor errors as well as increase awareness about PRN prescribing practice. ","1125":"Urinary incontinence has a negative impact on a health related quality of life, and it contributes to depression. Depression is a serious illness affecting health, family and professional activity of many people in all sectors of society. Both conditions concern young women. Following study presents depression among young women suffering urinary incontinence. There are various aspects of the young women's comorbid depression and urinary incontinence, mentioned in the present literature: coexistence of depression and urinary incontinence, area of postpartum period, associated sexual dysfunction, and impact on the professional sphere. To conclude, it should be highlighted that the problem of urinary incontinence and depression affects not only elderly, as it would be suspected, but on a large scale also young women and there is a strong need of the further prevention and investigation these coexisting diseases.","1126":"People with Intellectual Disability (ID) have cognitive impairments that affect their level of functioning the causes of which are multiple and often unknown. Behavioural difficulties are common among people with ID. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is recognised more among people with Intellectual Disability and could be a cause of problem behaviours. Screening and assessing for ADHD in people with ID is difficult because of the paucity of robust assessment tools and diagnostic criteria.","1127":"Obesity is a worldwide problem, and Malta is no exception. In Malta, a Foundation was established to address weight problems amongst the population, and this initiative included the opening in 2014 of an 8-week residential programme for morbidly obese patients. This multidisciplinary programme is managed and coordinated by a team consisting of doctors, psychiatrists, nurses, physiotherapist, psychologists, dietitian, nutritionists and occupational therapists. This team guides residents towards adopting a healthier lifestyle, rather than focusing solely on food intake. In this study, the first 163 residents admitted to the programme, (65 males and 98 females), were assessed at the point of admission and discharge against several physical parameters. The effectiveness of the programme in the short term was validated since at the point of discharge these patients had a statistically significant reduction in weight, BMI, cholesterol levels, glucose levels and HBA1C. They were also more mobile, and this difference was also statistically significant.","1128":"Every patient has a story to tell, and every experienced physician has a bank of stories to recall. A patient's visit is not chance but a search for a cure, amelioration of state, advice, guidance, a prescription, or for seeking reassurance, comfort, and in some circumstances, permission to \"be well\". From the simplest tale to the most complex, narratives abound. Sometimes, the most intimate information shared with the physician confidante, go dark and deep, with a yearning to \"tell all\" after a period of suppression. Successful communication and rapport also depends on the carer's response, the degree of concentration, listening skills, body language, eye contact engagement, the patient relationship and empathy. How do we as physicians cope with emotion on both sides when it comes to listening to a narrated story, keeping matters in perspective, recognizing the effects of depression, grieving, anger, forgiveness, or the strength of the patient to be able to face their demons when cowardly acts of abuse have been committed. The professionalism of doctors should always be at the highest level, but individuals vary in their responses. A price may be paid with arising stress, unsolved patient problems, an increase in new ones, and the general challenge of coping. Time may not be the only enemy with modern day medical practice. Does narrative medicine have a place in reducing this dissonance, and will learning to share stories, as well as being a good listener, limit adverse outcomes?","1129":"Sexual practice, attitudes to sex, gender roles and attitudes to power between the sexes are changing rapidly. Here a new free, indulgent, pleasure seeking sexuality, driven mainly by young women is emerging. This new order can be seen in conduct, but is graphically portrayed in popular music, film and the written word. It has travelled as fast as light in digital media, as if there was a new brain- not like the pheromonal brain of ants- but the digitalised brain of new humanity. Across history, the control of sex has usually been located in religion or the state, they have dictated not only conduct, but defined deep rooted feelings about personal anatomy, and intimate activity. Women in particular have been influenced by feelings of shame with their genitalia, pride of virginity, and a high degree of secrecy of sexual arousal which has restricted their sexual exploration and satisfaction. Now emerges a new permissive morality which has asserted its presence so rapidly, that few have had time to consider it, but rather have simply accepted it, with little attention to its impact on our society. Like many revolutions it has its own almost anarchic momentum. The freedom is grandiose and unreflective, arrogant and Hubristic. It brings great benefits, but also significant costs- which are far reaching and important, and should not be overlooked. Love, intimacy and sexual relations, and the body that enables all of this are too precious, too delicate to be governed by pleasure alone! As institutional control diminishes, an appropriate set of ethical moral and medical guidelines, should be constructed and the individual encouraged to apply them. \"I have the right to decide what I do with my body!\" It is this project that is explored in this paper.","1130":null,"1131":"Notion of self-rated quality of life recently acquires more and more attention among health care professionals. The aim of this study is to determine whether one of the questionnaires measuring this theoretical concept, QOL10, could be applied to help to identify individuals who have problems with drug abuse. QOL10 questionnaire complemented with several filtering questions has been administered to 200 students in various schools in Poland. The correspondence between QOL10 and the willingness to take drugs is the strongest for QOL10 above 2.5. For QOL10 &gt;2.5 a statistically significant positive correlation (r=0.464) has been observed between the frequency of use of psychoactive substances other than alcohol (drugs, medications) and the general quality of life. Therefore they might be considered as a risk group. QOL10 proved to be quite a specific tool in detecting people who do not have problem with drug abuse. In spite of that, applying only QOL10 for the purposes studied does not provide conclusive grounds for detecting the problem of drug use. Nonetheless, it might be of help in serving as an indicator that some individuals belong to the risk group. ","1132":"The importance of handovers has been recognised and proven in clinical practice. In liaison psychiatry, this is particularly important due to the high turnover of patients seen, the shift work pattern and the number of member staff engaging in this process. An Audit on the Quality of Handovers was carried out within a Psychiatric Liaison team of a General hospital in UK with an intention to review and improve this. Handovers were evaluated against the gold standard of the SBAR tool (Situation\/Background\/Assessment\/Recommendations) over a period of 4 weeks. Handovers were assessed by 2 members of staff (a Consultant &amp; a Specialty doctor). Data was analysed using Microsoft Excel. Results showed that the team's handover practice is mostly \"Good\" but there was also an amount of \"Poor\" under \"Situation &amp; Background\", mostly presented by mid-grade doctors &amp; trainees. Nurses scored higher than medics on overall rating, nearly 50%.This could be attributed to the fact that handovers form an essential &amp; integral part of Nurse's training &amp; culture. Also mid-grade (staff grade) doctors have had a significant amount of \"excellent\" scoring that other groups didn't have, mostly on the Assessment &amp; Recommendations domains, which can be attributed to the fact that importance is stressed more on the assessment &amp; treatment module by the doctors. The multi-disciplinary composition of the liaison psychiatry team has a positive impact on the patient care. This audit has revealed overall good communication amongst the members of the team, nevertheless one that needs some improvement, particularly amongst the doctors. Doctors tend to focus on the remedial (assessment &amp; treatment) module rather than the holistic approach. SBAR remains an effective &amp; handy tool to improve the handover quality. A re-audit will be carried out in 6 months time to assess the improvements observed following the implementation of this new tool. ","1133":"A growing body of evidence supports the belief that yoga benefits physical and mental health. The aim of the study is to investigate whether the sense of coherence and sense of agency are more developed in people practicing hatha-yoga than in the group of people who have never practiced yoga. TAHE, SOC-29 questionnaire and short microphenomenological interview conducted on a group of 15 people (8 yoga instructors, 7 in the control group). It has been shown that the study group has significantly higher scores in both the sense of agency and sense of coherence than the control group. In addition, a statistically significant correlation was observed between the part of the values mentioned above. There are indications that the hatha-yoga exercise increases the sense of agency, which in the long run can contribute to better mental health. In order to find a clear and certain link between the sense of coherence and the sense of agency additional research is necessary.

The main religions recorded are Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jewish and Sikhism amongst others. Around 45% of them do not have any recorded religion. The Mental Health Advisor will come across a wide range of students from different backgrounds each with their own unique presentation of mental health distress. It is well known that people of different communities and cultures experience signs and symptoms of mental distress in different ways. This is very important for clinicians to be aware of the nuances around cultures and traditions in the context of mental illness in order to assist clinicians more accurately diagnose, support and manage them. In an effort to improve diagnosis and care to people of all backgrounds, the 5th edition of the Diagnosis and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) incorporates a greater cultural sensitivity throughout the manual. This includes a reflection of cross-cultural variations in presentations and cultural concepts of distress. The mental Health Advisor is available to help with practical support to assist students to manage their mental health and study. This includes support with an initial assessment, structures support, assisting with making reasonable adjustments under the Equality Act (2010), support students to access Disabled Student's Allowances and reasonable adjustments to enable them to study effectively and achieve their potential and where necessary, making appropriate referrals to internal and\/or external services. One of the main roles of the advisor is to support students with mental health difficulties which are impacting on their studies. This support may include anxiety management, motivation, relaxation techniques, study plans and understanding the impact of medication. This paper will look at some of the experiences faced by the mental health advisor and will also reflect on understanding the finer nuances of cultural aspects of mental health in different student communities. This paper will also reflect on the learning gained by these experiences which will help better support and assist the student population at the University of Bedfordshire. ","1136":"1 in 4 people experience mental health problems at some point during their lives and Muslims are no exception. Exacerbating the morbidity and mortality associated with mental health problems in Muslims is Islamophobia. Stigma and shame are major barriers to accessing and using mental health services and many Muslims with mental health problems do not receive the treatment they need. The Federation of Student Islamic Societies (FOSIS) United Kingdom branch organized a mental health conference to challenge the stigma attached to psychological problems in Muslims and to encourage care seeking in this group. We conducted a single arm, pre-post comparison study on Muslims who attended the FOSIS mental health conference in Birmingham Medical School, England. Validated stigma scales measuring knowledge, attitudes and behavior were administered on participants before and immediately after exposure to the programme. Participants were also asked to respond to statements, the items of which were on a 5-point Likert scale, about the role that Islam plays in Muslim mental health, stigma as a barrier for Muslims with mental health problems to accessing and using mental health services and if they felt inspired to challenge stigma. 50\/250 (20%) of participants completed the study. There were statistically significant improvements in the 'Reported and Intended Behavior' score (p=0.0036), the 'Inspired to Take Action' Score (p=0.0202) and the 'Incorporating Islamic Principles into Mental Health Treatment for Muslims is Beneficial' score (p=0.0187). The findings of our study suggest that a 'bespoke' Muslim mental health conference comprised of talks delivered by experts in Islam and mental health and a Muslim who has first-hand experience of psychological distress might be effective at reducing mental health stigma in the Muslim community. Our results should help to inform the design, development and delivery of future Muslim mental health conferences however more robust research in this area is needed. ","1137":"On the 11th of February 2016, the Health Secretary in the United Kingdom (UK) Jeremy Hunt announced his plan to impose the Junior Doctor Contract despite thousands of healthcare professionals storming the streets of Westminster in defiant protest. A leading member of the Royal College of Psychiatrists Psychiatric Trainee Committee described the Junior Doctor Contract as 'poisonous', exclaiming that it would be a 'disaster for mental health' and that it would 'disincentivize doctors to work in an already desperately under-resourced specialty'. The number of doctors who applied for documentation to work abroad surged by over 1000 per cent on the same day that the Health Secretary made the Junior Doctor Contract announcement. Not surprisingly, Jeremy Hunt was accused of acting as 'a recruiting agent' for hospitals in Australasia. This paper provides background information about working conditions for Junior Doctors in the National Health Service in the UK and the anticipated effects that the Junior Doctor Contract will have on their morale, well-being and occupational functioning. Our paper then provides a brief overview of mental health services in New Zealand with a focus on a Maori mental health service provider in the North Island. We conclude our paper by offering insights from International Medical Graduates from the UK and from South Africa working as a Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists Psychiatric Registrar and Consultants in Waikato District Health Board (DHB) in Hamilton, New Zealand, respectively.","1138":"Depression is the most common and serious psychiatric disorder that affects patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease, and, has a significant impact on their quality of life. The aim of this study was to investigate and compare prevalence rates of depression among hemodialyzed patients, and non-dialyzed patients with a glomerular filtration rate&lt;30 ml\/min\/1.73m2 receiving conservative treatment or following kidney transplantation. A total of 50 hemodialyzed and 50 non-dialyzed patients with stage 4\/5 of CKD was assessed using the following questionnaires: Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), The Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), The Acceptance of Illness Scale (AIS), and The Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R). The use of steroids and immunosuppressant drugs was also investigated. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were present in both groups, however the proportion of persons with mild or severe depression was higher among dialyzed patients. The AIS, LOT-R and SWLS scores were very similar in both the groups. The patients using steroids and\/or immunosuppressant drugs were more prone to develop mild or severe depression according to the HAM-D scores. The results indicated a high prevalence of depression and anxiety among patients with CKD. Furthermore, the fraction of patients with depression is greater among hemodialyzed patients. This indicates the importance of monitoring the mental state of the patients as well as the necessity of providing timely psychological care for patients with CKD.","1139":"It is well known that high doses of corticosteroids can induce psychiatric disorders, especially the maniacal states. However there are only a few studies that investigate the effects of low and medium doses of such drugs used for a long period of time on the patient's mental health. The aim of the study was to investigate the prevalence and severity of affective disorders among the patients using up to 40 mg of corticosteroids (prednisone or equivalent). 54 patients during the corticosteroid therapy and 51 healthy controls were assessed with the use of the following questionnaires: Hypomania Checklist 16 (HCL-16), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and authors' questionnaire. The results were analysed using SPSS Statistics version 12.5. The results indicated statistically significant differences in the prevalence of hypomania and depression between controls and study group. There were no evident correlations between either the dose or the length of the therapy and the severity of affective disorders. The study has shown that the usage of corticosteroids doses below 40 mg does have an effect on the prevalence of affective disorders. The occurrence of hypomania and depression was more common among the study group. To assess correlations further studies are needed.","1140":"Since its inception in 2013, PROMISE (PROactive Management of Integrated Services and Environments) has been supporting service users and staff at the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT) on a journey to reduce reliance on force. The author's own personal experiences led to the founding of PROMISE and illustrates how individual experiences can influence a patient to lead change. Coproduction is actively embedded in PROMISE. Patients have been meaningfully involved because they are innovators and problem solvers who bring an alternative viewpoint by the very nature of their condition. A patient is more than just a person who needs to be 'fixed' they are individuals with untapped skills and added insight. There have been 2 separate Patient Advisory Groups (PAGs) since the project was first established. The first Patient Advisory Group was recruited to work with the PROMISE researchers on a study which used a participatory qualitative approach. Drawing on their lived experience and different perspectives the PAG was instrumental in shaping the qualitative study, including the research questions. Their active involvement helped to ensure that that the study was sensitively designed, methodologically robust and ethically sound. The 2nd PAG was formed in 2016 to give the project an overall steer. Patients in this group contributed to the work on the 'No' Audit and reviewed several CPFT policies such as the Seclusion and Segregation policy which has impacted on frontline practice. They also made a significant contribution to the study design for a funding application that was submitted by the PROMISE team to the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR). Both PAGs were supported by funding from East of England Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC EoE) and were influential in different ways. An evaluation of the 2nd PAG which was conducted in June 2017 showed very high satisfaction levels. The free text comments also revealed how many of the patients valued their involvement and were glad to have worked alongside the PROMISE team. The impact of this PAG has been recognised by CPFT who have agreed to support the group financially and are keen to widen its remit to ensure that more patients are actively involved in Trust activities.","1141":"Nationally, there is a drive to rotate more Foundation and GP Trainee Doctors through Psychiatry posts. In East London Foundation Trust (ELFT) in Bedfordshire, doctors from Core Psychiatry, Foundation and GP training programmes come to train in Psychiatry. Many will not have worked in Psychiatry before and have little experience of patients with ID. The prevalence of people with ID is increasing with improved life expectancy. They are a complex and vulnerable group with considerable wider legal, ethical and social issues. Recent national reports including the Confidential Inquiry in to Premature Deaths in People with Learning Disability 3 and Transforming Care 4 have recommended increased training and awareness of the roles and responsibilities for all health staff who provide care to people with ID. To survey the knowledge level and expectations of junior doctors on Psychiatry placements in Bedfordshire in relation to ID and local logistical arrangements of services and on call duties. The local ID governance committee together with the Postgraduate Medical Education Department created a questionnaire which was circulated to new trainee Doctors on placements with ELFT. The questionnaire was distributed to new trainees after 3 different inductions throughout the year. This combined self-rating questions using Likert scales, multiple choice answers and others allowing for expanded free text answers. The results show the self-rated knowledge levels of ID psychiatry in general and with regard to local services and on call arrangements amongst new trainees was low. The majority of trainees indicated they would have liked to have received information on the suggested areas at the start of the placement. When given the option of themes of information the psychiatric and medical presentation was most sought, although general and on call specific information was also indicated to be useful. The most popular delivery of information was found to be oral presentation and hand out at induction, followed by an electronic document. 8 trainees were interested in attending clinical sessions in ID and most felt it would be feasible in their posts to get to these. This survey shows that Junior Doctors from different training programmes rate their knowledge of ID psychiatry to be low. This has implications during their rotation in a mental health trust as they are expected to cover an ID ward whilst on call, but also going forward in their careers as all specialties will encounter patients with ID. It is known that awareness of patients with ID is lacking in many healthcare professionals and we know that people with ID are living longer, however continue to have worse health than the general population. The results show trainees would like more education on ID and would be interested in attending clinical sessions in ID psychiatry. The results will enable clinicians in ID services how best to improve the local induction experience for trainees. It also will guide how to educate colleagues outside of the specialty to improve their practice with people with ID, which will improve standards in the quality of care people with ID receive from doctors who treat them. ","1142":"Lithium is widely used as a mood stabilizer in managing Bipolar Disorder. It is also licensed as an augmenting agent for recurrent depression and treatment resistant depression. However, it has a narrow therapeutic index with potentially significant side effects and adverse drug interactions. Toxicity is one of the main concerns for prescribers and serum levels should be checked regularly. Also, due to the adverse effects on Kidneys and Thyroid, there are strict guidelines to monitor the kidney as well as thyroid functions periodically. Whilst the need to monitor blood biochemistry is well established, less well recognized is the need to monitor patients' physical health by means of annual checks of Body Mass Index (BMI) and waist circumference. The purpose of this study was to investigate compliance against the NICE CG185 guidelines. Hereford is a rural town in England with a population of about 180000. Currently, the Herefordshire part of 2gether Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust does not have clearly agreed shared care protocols for Lithium monitoring. Lithium monitoring is done by GPs as part of QOF targets. As Psychiatrists recommend treatment with lithium, they have the responsibility to have an updated results and act on these appropriately. Therefore, an important aspect of this audit was to identify monitoring gaps that may result from the dual ownership of patient care. We found that 80% of cases complied with NICE guidance as regards blood monitoring however, only 40% of cases were compliant as regards checks on the physical health parameters of BMI and weight. The blood biochemistry of patients on lithium is generally well monitored however, physical health assessment is rarely completed with the required annual frequency and, waist circumference is almost never measured; either on initiation of lithium therapy or, on an on-going basis. More needs to be done to promote awareness of the need to monitor the physical health of patients on lithium and, in particular, to ensure that these checks include measurement of waist circumference. We believe that to improve monitoring of patients on lithium, shared care protocols should be developed between mental health services and GP services.

An independent inquiry into Dr Emson's death concluded that mental health stigma in the National Health Service was a factor that contributed to her death. Despite the morbidity and mortality attributed to the stigma attached to post-natal mental health problems there are very few programmes that have been developed to challenge it. King's College London Undergraduate Psychiatry Society organized an event entitled, 'A Labour of Love': Perinatal Mental Health to address this issue. The event included a talk from an expert by experience, a mother who developed post-partum mental health problems. We conducted a single-arm, pre-post comparison study on participants who attended the KCL Psych Soc event. Validated stigma scales on knowledge (Mental Health Knowledge Schedule (MAKS)), attitudes (Community Attitudes towards the Mentally Ill (CAMI)) and behaviour (Reported and Intended Behaviour Scale (RIBS)) were administered before and immediately after exposure to the event. 27\/27 (100%) of participants recruited responded. There was a statistically significant difference in the pre-MAKS score compared to the post-MAKS score (p=0.0003), the pre-RIBS score compared to the post-RIBS score (p=0.0068) and in the pre-CAMI score compared to the post-CAMI score (p=0.0042). There were statistically significant reductions in stigma in the domains of knowledge, attitude and behavior following exposure to the KCL Psych Soc event and no adverse effects were reported. Our study revealed that a brief intervention made a highly significant impact and maybe useful in challenging the stigma around post-natal mental illness. However, more research in this area is required to determine if the changes are sustained before we can consider rolling out and scaling up such an initiative nationally and internationally.

The aim of our study was to assess their incidence in patients with MS in Poland, and whether they change during longitudinal observation in routine clinical practice. We included 53 consecutive patients with relapsing-remitting form of MS in this prospective study, who were treated in our department. All patients were examined at the entry to the study and after at least three or more years after study start with 4 standardized questionnaires and clinical scales that were validated in Polish patients: Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). The data from the two time-points were compared. At the entry to the study daytime sleepiness, nighttime insomnia, depression episodes and anxiety were observed in 11.3%, 13.2%, 11.3% and 28.3% of patients, respectively. At the end of the study higher proportion of patients reported any form of drowsiness, depression, insomnia or anxiety, however, the differences were not statistically significant. Except for anxiety, higher proportion of patients reported definite disorders, with the rise from 3.8% to 13.2% having depression and rise from 9.4% to 15.1% having insomnia. Moderate or pathological drowsiness was not reported initially, but it was reported in 5% and 2.5% patients, respectively, at the study end. The incidence of sleep and mood disturbances in polish patients with MS is quite high, and it is comparable to other studies in patients with MS. Possible mood changes or sleep disturbances in individual patients should be routinely monitored by clinicians.

Yet, despite the availability of effective treatment, many in this group continue to suffer in silence. Fear of exposure to stigmatization has been identified to be a major barrier to accessing and using mental health services. King's College London Undergraduate Psychiatry Society (KCL PsychSoc) organized an event entitled, 'What does bipolar disorder even mean? Psychological distress: How can we challenge the stigma?'. Healthcare professionals who themselves recovered from psychological problems and a mental health advocate with first-hand experience of psychological distress were invited to deliver talks followed by an interactive question and answer session. We conducted a single-arm pre-post comparison study. People who attended the KCL Psych Soc event were recruited to participate. Validated stigma scales on knowledge (Mental Health Knowledge Schedule (MAKS), attitudes (Community Attitudes towards the Mentally Ill) and behavior (Reported and Intended Behavior Scale (RIBS)) were administered on participants before and immediately after exposure to the event. 44\/44 of the participants recruited completed the study (100% response rate). There were statistically significant changes in the respondents' scores for all 3 stigma scales (p value MAKS&lt;0.0001, p value CAMI&lt;0.0001, p value RIBS=0.0011). As far as the authors are aware, this is the first study to date of an anti-stigma intervention comprised of healthcare professionals with first-hand experience of psychological distress. The KCL PsychSoc event was associated with statistically significant changes in the respondents' scores in all three of the stigma scales. More robust research in this area is needed before scaling up similar anti-stigma initiatives. ","1147":"Continuity of care is generally considered beneficial in primary healthcare, and in this paper the evidence for such assumptions is examined. Studies and reviews showed that continuity of care is able to decrease unnecessary hospitalisation, length of hospital stay and attendance at Accident and Emergency departments, as well as improve patient and doctor experience. It has also been found that the continuity of care provided to patients varies greatly depending on patient demographic, GP surgery policy and size. As the evidence suggests that continuity of care has such great health benefits for the patient, addressing the deficit in continuity that some patients receive would be an effective way to improve quality of care.","1148":"Treatment of early phase of psychosis is important not only for overcoming the acute symptoms but also for the later treatment and attitude towards the illness. Psychotherapeutic approach is an integrative part of this treatment. In Psychiatric hospital \"Sveti Ivan\" in Zagreb, Croatia both psychotherapeutic and sociotherapeutic methods are used on the inpatient unit for young people with psychosis along with medications. The aim of this work is to present the work on the psychotherapeutic inpatient unit and to investigate whether during the hospitalisation of individuals with first psychotic episode changes occur in attitudes towards medications, quality of life, insight and self-esteem. 37 individuals with first psychotic episode (20 men, 17 women) completed the following battery of questionnaires upon hospital admission and before discharge: Drug attitude inventory (DAI-10), The World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL), Insight scale and Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale. Before being discharged from hospital, patients assessed their quality of life as significantly improved over time (p=0.000), especially concerning their physical health (p=0.004), psychological health (p=0.004), and satisfaction with their environment (p=0.001). Also, positive trends were observed in attitudes towards drugs and self-esteem. No changes were shown regarding patients' insight. The findings are encouraging: during treatment on psychotherapeutic inpatient unit, significant improvement in quality of life was observed, as well as positive trends in self-esteem and attitudes towards medications. ","1149":"Psychosocial factors are an important contributor to the aetiology of unipolar depression. This paper reviews the evidence for the contribution of different psychosocial factors, and provides an overview of the proposed neurobiological mechanisms underlying the link between psychosocial factors and depression. Implicated psychosocial factors fall into three interrelated groups: life events, socioeconomic status, and social support. The life events most strongly linked with depression are bereavement, disability or medical illness, and childhood maltreatment. Others include refugee status, workplace stressors, and obesity. Studies linking low socioeconomic status with depression are conflicting. There is strong evidence for the association between lack of social support and depression. Multiple neurobiological mechanisms linking psychosocial factors to depression have been suggested, though evidence remains limited. The key foci of evidence point to increased activity in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, epigenetic modifications of key genes, and inflammatory processes. Other mechanisms being explored include structural changes to the limbic system, prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, and hippocampus, and the role of other molecules such as cholecystokinin, tachykinins, spinophillin, synaptophysin and myelin basic protein. There is overlap between these mechanisms.","1150":"The hereby presented guidelines for the use of psychodynamic psychotherapy are based on references and research in the field of individual and group therapy and they refer to psychotherapy for patients suffering from the first psychotic episode, schizophrenia, schizoaffective psychosis, bipolar disorder and paranoid psychosis.

Clinical experience and research of the outcomes of psychodynamic psychotherapy encourage positioning of such treatments among recommendations for treating various mental disorders, as well as in the field of psychotherapy of patients with psychotic disorders (PD).","1151":"In our society, the social stigma against people who suffer from mood disorders is a very powerful factor that negatively affects the healing of patient. He is often isolated from the others for the fear of being judged \"fool, crazy or dangerous\" or discriminated and emarginated for his mental health problem. For this reason, a cornerstone of mood disorder rehabilitation is the bringing out of the patient from his isolation, the reintegration of the user in the social context with the increase and the improvement in the quality of interpersonal relationships in the family and in the external context. The method used in our project is the dance-therapy one. In particular dancing the \"Bachata\" becomes a rehabilitation tool to express emotions through the body and to open to the world, on the territory, overcoming the fear of being judged by others, and of the prejudice and the social stigma about mental illness. The strength and cohesion of the rehabilitation group has given to the patients the opportunity to believe in their own abilities, to accept themselves with their difficulties and to improve the relationship with their body in relation to each other.","1152":"The frequent and protracted use of video games with serious personal, family and social consequences is no longer just a pleasant pastime and could lead to mental and physical health problems.

It is, however, not a somatic illness for which just symptomatic treatment will suffice. Stress is an important factor in not only causing diabetes onset or exacerbation, but also in hampering proper treatment by interfering with the treatment adherence of patients. Hence, it becomes important for physicians to acquaint themselves with the effects of stress on T2DM in order to ensure proper treatment of the latter. Documentation of effect of stress on the management of T2DM. The research was a cross-sectional study on the patients attending Sri Muthukumaran Medical College, Hospital and Research Institute, Mangadu. A total of 400 people, who werepre-established diabetic patients of the hospital of age greater than 30 years, were chosen for the study. The stress levels of the patients were assessed with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and treatment adherence using a questionnaire prepared exclusively for the study. Based on the data, a statistical relationship was framed between the degree of control (treatment adherence) and the stress levels of the patients. The FBS levels were a direct reflection of the stress levels (P&lt;0.05). Stress had a major impact on treatment adherence among the diabetic subjects: Increased levels of stress decreased the adherence (P&lt;0.001). The glycemic index (HbA1C level) was found to be linked to both treatment adherence and stress. Increased adherence kept it at bay (P&lt;0.05) while stress proved abysmal to glycemic control. T2DM is the result of an interplay between various factors; environmental, psychiatric and somatic. Hence, a holistic treatment approach is required, one that involves stress management, education and mental health awareness along with pharmacological treatment, to fully control the disease. ","1154":"The clinical evidence shows that the onset of eating disorders is increasing in the prepubescent phase or even in childhood. Already starting from the prepubescence the certainties related to the body start to unwind and the individual is encouraged to build new ones, based both on the anatomic transformation of his\/her own body and on the social expectation according to the identity. The onset of a Eating Disorders is normally between 13 and 25 years, but in the last years we recorded a lowering in the onset threshold to an age between 11 and 13 years, with some earlier cases at 7 years (Franzoni et al. 2012). Many theories consider body dissatisfaction as the immediate antecedent to the development of this eating disorder. Different studies have confirmed that a strong concern for physical appearance could sometimes precede an eating disorder (Cuzzolaro 2004). The alteration of the body image is the major predictive factor for the relapse, the patients themselves refer that it is one of the major obstacles for the realization of a lasting recovering. In the following study one hundred kids between 10 and 15 years old, without any Eating Disorders diagnosis, have been tested to evaluate whether if already from this age there is a concern about body image starting at this age, the fear of gaining weight and the desire to be slimmer. It is known, indeed, that these factors, if significantly present in a subject, can turn into predictive factors of a psychopathology. We need to build our body image over time; changing our percertion of reality can change also what we see, in particular the body image we strive for changes (Bianchini 2008). 100 teenagers split in 53 females and 47 males aged between 10 and 14 years, randomly picked in the secondary school. The results of the study show that in the age between 10 and 15 years the concern for the body shape is already present, without difference between the genders. Although 45% of the sample is underweight, the Figure Raiting Scale test both males and females want to be of lesser weight. 91 subjects reached a BSQ test score of over 34, so most of the sample has a strong concern for their physical appearance. The results obtained by administering the BUT test also highlighted concern about the body with moderate gravity. Body dissatisfaction, as so many studies have confirmed, can be considered a precursor of psychopathology. Concerns concern both female gender and male gender. It is also necessary to pay close attention to the pressure exerted by family members, friends and the media towards a difficult to reach thinness ideal. That is why we need to focus on strengthening protective factors in adolescents with prevention and awareness campaigns which are properly targeted. The work resulted a useful reflection on the building of the body image as an early risk factor for the onset of pathologies linked to this concept. We need to commit to an educative practice of support for adolescent, recognition and sharing, which does not avoid the presence of the adults, but in fact it is enriched. It would be appreciated if we could introduce in the school, in the program of different subjects, the discussion regarding different aspects of a healthy nutrition and the formation of a solid self-esteem in order, for the students, to have a critical interpretation of the media message on food, body and beauty. It is desirable to promote the emancipation of the adolescents from a condition of dependence to discover their own place in the world. The educative action can help developing the research of the meaning of the own personality. ","1155":"Antipsychotics are effective in reducing positive and disorganization symptoms of schizophrenia. Although SGAs initially all were believed to be more efficacious and tolerable than FGAs, several data show that the SGAs are no more effective than FGAs. In clinical practice, frequent switching of antipsychotic medications is widespread for lack of efficacy, adverse side effects, and partial or not-compliance response. This study suggested that most clinically stable inpatients with schizophrenia maintain their remission states after being switched to another atypical antipsychotic; but that at the end (after 20 years) of the observation period of our study, 11.54% of the patients assumed again typical antipsychotics (haloperidol).","1156":"Approximately one-third of patients with epilepsy continue to experience seizures despite adequate therapy with antiepileptic drugs. Drug-resistant epilepsy is even more frequent in subjects with intellectual disability. As a result, several non-pharmacological interventions have been proposed to improve quality of life in patients with intellectual disability and drug-resistant epilepsy. A number of studies have demonstrated that music can be effective at reducing seizures and epileptiform discharges. In particular, Mozart's sonata for two pianos in D major, K448, has been shown to decrease interictal EEG discharges and recurrence of clinical seizures in patients with intellectual disability and drug-resistant epilepsy as well. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of Mozart's music on seizure frequency in institutionalized epileptic subjects with profound\/severe intellectual disability. Twelve patients (10 males and 2 females) with a mean age of 21.6 years were randomly assigned to two groups in a cross-over design; they listened to Mozart K448 once a day for six months. A statistically significant difference was observed between the listening period and both baseline and control periods. During the music period, none of the patients worsened in seizure frequency; one patient was seizure-free, five had a greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency and the remaining showed minimal (N=2) or no difference (N=4). The average seizure reduction compared to the baseline was 20.5%. Our results are discussed in relation to data in the literature considering differences in protocol investigation. Music may be considered a useful approach as add-on therapy in some subjects with profound intellectual disability and drug-resistant epilepsy and can provide a new option for clinicians to consider, but further large sample, multicenter studies are needed to better understand the characteristics of responders and non-responders to this type of non-pharmacological intervention.

Excessive cytokine secretion during stress situations is one of these causes which can be related with onset of cognitive symptoms including or accompanied by depressive ones, sometimes in an overlapping way. In both cases, chronic inflammation is a common hidden mechanism causing a vicious circle with mechanisms of somatic chronic stress and vice-versa while the serotonin pathway seems not to get seriously involved. Psychotherapy could dynamically influence the brain's and synaptic plasticity by treating disorders in an analogue with life's emotional trauma and conflicts, and by altering current life's stimuli according to the restoration of memories in the prefrontal lobe and in deeper brain areas. After neurological examinations, EEG, Mini Mental Scale and MRI control, Patients underwent personal and group psychotherapy with selective members of their choice participating in the group. The reduction of the cytokine's levels by participation and psycho-education inside the Group Psychotherapeutic Treatment, could lead to a regulation of IL-1, to the reduction of CRP, to the amelioration of the levels of cortisol thus regulating the inflammation of the bain. The function of the Psychotherapeutic environment as a \"container\" is strongly associated with stress relief and reduction of the hyper secretion of cortisol, with successful management of the cortisol blood levels, and with impact on the HPA Axis, with consequence to cortisol secretions in the body's organs and glands. EEG and Mini Mental Scale significantly change and improve after Psychotherapy. Medical treatment for depression and dementia failed in comparison with the benefits which emerged from the Psychotherapeutic method.

The results of the most innovative research would seem to suggest, therefore, that a state of psychological distress or depression, is often related to physiological problems, from physical discomfort in general up to illnesses such as cancer. The research project \"B &amp; M (Body and Mind), Take care of depression, face up to cancer\" moves from these assumptions. The project started in 2015 and continued in 2016, with the aim to focus the attention on the problem of depression related to physical disease states, in particular oncological disorders. In the first version of the project, (January - June 2015), according to the type of treated disease, specific body stimulation such as shiatsu has been associated with psychological techniques, guided fantasies and regressive hypnosis techniques. These mental techniques have been used in order to focus the thought on specific inner images appropriate to the situation of the treated patient and to generate consequently connected positive emotions. In this way it was possible to achieve a synergistic activation and stimulation attached to the body and mind, resulting in regularization of sleep patterns, lowering the hormonal imbalances and heightening the immune system, with the specific objective of increasing the level of excellence of perceived well-being. On the basis of the above results, which were definitely promising, further investigation with more specific applications has started: a research has been conducted on 50 patients with oncological diseases associated with depressive disorder. In this second phase of the research (January-June 2016) 50 patients have been selected with oncological diagnoses associated with depressive mood disorders. The results of the second version of the project have been very interesting, in particular with regard to the level of general well-being, which have shown an improvement of approximately 67%. We have registered also an improvement of the mood state, even though the patients were already under medical treatment and with a depressive state already in place. ","1159":"Over the past twenty years, psychiatric researchers have recognised the important role played by inflammation in the pathogenesis of depression. There has been increasing interest in the use of anti-inflammatory drugs, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), as a way to enhance the efficacy of antidepressant treatments. It is essential that psychiatrists and GPs who prescribe these drugs in conjunction, understand possible interactions, particularly the risk of bleeding. This paper is a literature review regarding NSAID co-prescription with SSRIs and the potential risks and benefits. The objectives of this systematic review are to assess the evidence for the use of NSAIDs as an adjunct to standard antidepressant drugs and evaluate this against the evidence contraindicating such a treatment combination. Our research suggests that there is evidence to support both the anti-inflammatory benefits of NSAIDs for treating depression, as well as evidence suggesting that NSAIDs increases the risk of bleeding when co-prescribed with SSRIs. When a broad consideration of the risks and benefits is done, the review is inconclusive about guidelines for co-prescription. More research is required to make strong claims about whether the type of NSAID and duration of treatment influences the risk (or benefit) of co-prescription.

This belongs to that trend that sees the mediation of art as having big potential to go beyond the spoken word. Everybody knows that our emotions, thoughts, feelings, and so on, are living in the body and speaking through the body, in fact the symbolic dimension (art, music, dance, painting and so on) reconfigures the experience of living. In this form of therapy we use Art as a means of accessing ourselves and opening ourselves up to the world. The forms of artistic mediation that we mainly describe in the paper are the basic elements of tango and performative theatrical technique (Theatre of the Oppressed and Physical Theatre). In the final part of this paper a series of images illustrate specific cases in which the method and its outcomes are described.","1161":"The rating scale \"G.T. MSRS\" has been designed to improve the clinical effectiveness of the clinician psychiatrists, by enabling them to make an early \"general\" diagnosis of mixed states. The knowledge of the clinical features of the mixed states and of the symptoms of the \"mixity\" of mood disorders is crucial: to mis-diagnose or mis-treat patients with these symptoms may increase the suicide risk and make worse the evolution of mood disorders going to the dysphoric state. This study is the second validation study of the \"G.T. MSRS\" rating scale, in order to demonstrate its usefullness.","1162":"Lithium carbonate is valuable and effective agent in the treatment and prophylaxis of mood disorders, particularly bipolar disorder (BD). Due to its narrow therapeutic range, frequent serum lithium estimation is necessary. To avoid the discomfort of frequent venipuncture, a non-invasive method for serum lithium concentration is needed. An alternative method of determining lithium level could be saliva or urine. Literature data regarding the reliability of saliva lithium levels is not conclusive. The aim of this study is to provide an overview of possibility to replace blood serum with saliva look through research in that field. Some authors conclude that there is constant ratio between serum and saliva lithium level and they suggest that saliva can replace serum for estimation lithium level. Other revealed that saliva\/serum lithium ratio is constant individually, so saliva\/serum lithium ratio should be estimated individually. Finally there are studies excluding the possibility of replacement serum with saliva. There is little number of studies on saliva clinical use in lithium level monitoring. Further studies should base on current data including methods of obtaining saliva and its biochemical analysis, collecting samples in a specific time frame from the last dosage of lithium, as well as inter-subject or intra-subject measurements.

As the hemispheric white matter is the major target of these vascular alterations the white matter axonal and myelination disruption may be observed employing measure for the rate of water molecule diffusion. High apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) correspond to unimpeded water diffusion and indicating white matter disintegration. In a retrospective study exploringcentral nervous system magnetic resonance (MR) images of two subjects presenting with neurosyphilis the ADC values were found to be increased as related to normal values being accompanied with normal appearing white matter of hemispheres. Applying ADC analysis to evaluate the brain in patients with neurosyphilis may reveal undetectable changes and explain the scale of abnormalities that occur in CNS. The increased mean ADC valuesin the normal appearing white matter of the hemispheres may correlate with neuropsychoatric symptomatology in syphilis. ","1164":"The impaired decision-making with high risk-aversive behavior and elevated impulsivity are reported as a trait feature in anxiety disorders including panic disorder (PD). It is hypothesised that PD patients exhibit difficulties in executive functions which can influence patients behavioural strategies e.g. problem solving, decision making, planning, impulse control. The aim of this study was to asses decision making process, risk-taking and impulsivity in PD patients as compared to healthy controls. Twenty-one psychotropic drug-naive PD outpatients and 20 healthy subjects matched by age and sex were examined. Cognitive decision-making and risk-taking behaviour was measured with CGT (Cambridge Gambling Task) from CANTAB battery. The PD severity was assessed with Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (PAS). The level of anxiety and depression was assessed with HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Impulsivity was evaluated with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, 11th version (BIS-11). There were no statistically significant differences on CGT in PD patients as compared to healthy control. However, having observed more closely, there are some differences between patients and healthy control. PD patients with higher anxiety level in HADS exhibited lower percentages of risky decisions comparing to PD with lower anxiety in HADS. PD patients with higher depression level in HADS demonstrated slowed decision-making when compared to PD patients with low level of depression in HADS. Total impulsivity and its attentional and motor dimensions were significantly higher in panic disorder patients versus healthy controls. There were no statistically significant differences with regard to CGT assessed decision-making between drug-naive PD patients and healthy controls. The PD patients with higher HADS-D depression level demonstrated slowed decision-making as compared to PD patients with low level of depression. ","1165":"Antipsychotics are a key intervention strategy in pharmacotherapy in schizophrenia. However, the benzodiazepines are often prescribed to control sleep disturbances, anxiety or hostile behaviour. There is some evidence supporting the combination therapy with antipsychotics and benzodiazepines providing beneficiary treatment effect to the psychosis in positive and negative symptom domains as well as catatonia or adverse reactions to antipsychotic drugs. In particular, in a population suffering from residual symptoms of schizophrenia, in particular anxiety, emotional flattening, being refractory to approved treatment strategies, benzodiazepines as add-on to antipsychotics seem to be an option. There is rationale for the therapeutic use for long-acting benzodiazepines as the treatment of option with limited literature indicating the use of chlordiazepoxide, and diazepam. The paper reviews the best clinical practice indications for benzodiazepines as the add-on treatment to antipsychotics in schizophrenia.","1166":"Antipsychotics are a key intervention strategy in pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia. However, benzodiazepines are often prescribed to control sleep disturbances, anxiety or behavioural disinhibition. There is clinical evidence for the beneficial effect of the combined treatment of antipsychotics and benzodiazepines resulting in more favorable treatment outcome in schizophrenia with regard to positive and negative symptoms. This clinical phenomenon seems to be associated with the GABA-ergic activit ythat is believed to be disrupted in the schizophrenia and direct benzodiazepines effect on GABA-A receptors. In the brain there are both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters which cooperate between themselves maintaining the proper functioning of the brain. GABA neurons carry inhibitory signals that help keep brain activity at optimal levels of operation, Glutamate, on the other hand, carry excitatory signals. As the interplay between these two exists they keep the dopamine levels in the average levels. The disruption of GABA-ergic transmission in schizophrenia may induce alternations in dopaminergic neurotransmission providing no inhibitory effect to the central glutamate activity, resulting in the rise of the dopamine levels being associated with psychosis precipitation. Benzodiazepines are believed to reduce presynaptic dopamine release at the mesolimbic level and delay postsynaptic adaptation of dopaminergic neurons to antipsychotics potentiating the action of antipsychotics in resistant schizophrenia. Benzodiazepines also act on mesocortical regions where antipsychotics are less effective and where there is a particular sensitivity to stress. This association is particularly useful in resistant patients or in patients with severe anxiety with or without intolerance to antipsychotics. Improvement concerns anxious symptoms but also positive symptoms (hallucinations, delirium and dissociative syndrome) and negative (social withdrawal, affect flattening). As the available studies are limited there is some clinical evidence that the use of antipsychotic drugs with addition of benzodiazepines can provide better general outcome in ill patients than antipsychotics administration alone.","1167":"Neurosyphilis is an infection of the brain or spinal cord caused by Treponema pallidum. In the third phase of syphilis involving the central nervous system it may manifest in a widespread dysfunctions including psychiatric manifestations being often underestimated in the differential diagnosis. Two patients demonstrating rapid cognitive decline as the primary symptom for neurosyphillis are described with particular focus on the diagnostic process complexity and adequate treatment delivery. Clinical manifestations as well as psychiatric symptoms of syphilis are diverse and often non-specific. The symptomatology of mood disorders in neurosyphilis is frequently atypical, intermittent, and pleomorphic and fails to meet DSM-5 diagnostic categories. Neurocognitive decline although could be one of the key symptoms domains in neurosyphilis. Those two cases emphasise the importance of specific differential diagnosis with rapid onset cognitive decline with spotlight to sexually transmitted diseases as syphilis.

The second aim is to evaluate socio-demographic and clinical differences in patients that were re-hospitalised after the index discharge compared to patients that were not re-hospitalised. Finally, socio-demographic and clinical differences of re-hospitalised patients that were prescribed at discharge with oral or LAI AP were analysed. A retrospective observational study including all patients discharged with diagnosis of psychotic disorders from July 2011 to July 2013 was conducted. Patients discharged with LAI or with oral AP were included. Re-hospitalisations occurred during a follow-up period of 24 months after the index discharge were considered. Chi-square test or Student's t-test were used for comparisons. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the incidence of re-hospitalisation for LAI or oral AP were provided. No significant differences between LAI and oral AP in terms of re-hospitalisation rate in a 24-month period were found. Clinical and socio-demographic characteristics did not significantly differ between the groups. LAI seemed to be similar to oral AP in terms of prevention of re-hospitalisation in psychotic patients.

Many universities offer free counselling services however despite this a recent study in the US revealed that up to 84% of students who screened positive for depression or anxiety did not receive any treatment. There are many obstacles that students with mental health problems encounter that prevents them from receiving care, foremost among these is stigma. Film based interventions are showing promise at challenging stigma which can subsequently lower the barriers to accessing and using mental health services for students who need them. We conducted a single-arm, pre-post comparison study on arts students from the London College of Communication. Participants were exposed to the Wounded Healer film, a motion picture featuring a protagonist who is a doctor with first-hand experience of psychological distress. Validated stigma scales on knowledge (Mental Health Knowledge Schedule (MAKS)), behaviour (Reported and Intended Behaviour Scale (RIBS)) and attitudes (Community Attitudes towards the Mentally Ill (CAMI)) were administered on participants before and immediately after exposure to the intervention. 21\/28 (78%) of the participants recruited for the study responded. The mean age of respondents was 22 years (Std. Dev 2.20). There was an increase in the MAKS score after students viewed the Wounded Healer film indicating lower levels of stigma in mental health knowledge however this change was not statistically significant. A previous study on the Wounded Healer film demonstrated a reduction in stigma among healthcare students. The results of this pilot study, however, suggest that a film featuring a protagonist who is not from the same background as the audience may not be effective at reducing mental health stigma in that group. This is consistent with the results of recent research that revealed that an anti-stigma intervention that is effective in one group may not necessarily be effective in other groups. Our findings, however, must be interpreted with caution due to the limitations of this study. Future research with a prospective study design, a larger sample size and a control group exposed to a film with a protagonist who shares the same background as the audience is needed. ","1172":"To conduct a pilot study on a motion picture based, anti-stigma programme entitled, \"The Wounded Healer film\" to measure if it is associated with any changes in stigma variables in healthcare students and if it encouraged care seeking in this group. The 2008 Stigma Shout Survey of almost 4000 people using mental health services and carers revealed that healthcare professionals are a common source of stigma reported by people with mental illness. Psychological problems are common in medical students and doctors, however, thelevel of care seeking in this group is low. Fear of exposure to stigmatization is a crucial barrier to accessing and using mental health services. Recent research has revealed that film-based interventions can be used to challenge mental health stigma and encourage care seeking. We conducted a single-arm, pre-post comparison study on students who attended the Wounded Healer film at a University College London Psychiatry Society event (n=11). Before and after exposure to the film, students were asked to complete validated stigma scales that measured mental health-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviours. Responses were on a Likert scale and participants also provided free free-text comments which were subjected to thematic analyses. There was a statistically significant difference in the mental health-related knowledge pre-intervention score compared to the post-intervention score (p=0.0322). All participants either strongly agreed or agreed with the post-evaluation statement, \"I feel inspired to raise awareness of the importance of mental health and to take action to challenge stigma.\" This pilot study provides provisional support that The Wounded Healer film may be associated with reductions in stigma variables in healthcare students and encourage them to seek care for their own psychological problems. More robust research in this area is needed before we can scale up such an initiative. ","1173":"Cognitive dysfunction is a common characteristic across a number of psychiatric conditions. With growing technological advances, application based cognitive remediation (cognitive apps) is becoming steadily popular due to its accessibility, ease of use and minimal interference with the activities of daily life. However, despite a number of benefits that application based cognitive training possesses, it is not clear, whether the utilisation of these apps is a reliable approach that can be recommended in clinical psychiatric practice in order to restore cognition. In the present review, we have analysed eleven applications which trained the cognitive domains of memory, attention, language, processing speed, executive function and perception with respect to the structure and function of the applications, duration of use and measuring and monitoring of user progress and assessed them, based on the published data, for efficacy in the general population and clinical subgroups of the population. We conclude that, given that there are differences between the apps, given that there is a difference between the general population using these apps and groups suffering pathological conditions using them, given that cognitive deficits are caused by different pathological processes in different illnesses and that different illnesses present with different ranges of deficits, it is not possible to make blanket recommendations for the use of the apps. Nor is there sufficient published evidence for any of the apps to be specifically recommended for cognitive remediation. More evidence, such as trials of specific apps in different conditions, trials of specific apps against therapist guided techniques and blind trials of different apps against each other are necessary before recommendations of particular apps for particular remedial treatments can be made. Nor can 'brain training' in normal populations be seen as preventing cognitive decline or be seen as proof that cognitive remediation can improve cognition in pathological groups. Our paper serves as a useful reference to what apps are available, how they compare, and what the published evidence is, with a view to planning further research.","1174":"Many patients with opioid addiction continue to use opioids during and after treatment, and their career of drug taking is usually punctuated by repeated treatment admissions and relapses. Personality traits are considered risk factors for drug use, and, in turn, the psychoactive substances impact individuals' traits. The most widely used system of traits is called the Five-Factor Model (FFM). Studies have shown that persons who use heroin are consistently depicted as high on Neuroticism and higher Extroversion, also they are described as more impulsive and less sociable. Those who maintain abstinence are characterized by a higher Agreeableness and Conscientiousness. Treatment programs for opioid addiction vary substantially in treatment processes, and an early identification of patients traits that address their strengths and weaknesses within specific treatment settings could be useful in decreasing the possibility of relapse.","1175":"The research is based on comparative analysis of 'Hinting Task', 'Faux Pas', and 'Reading the Mind in the Eyes' tests sensitivity in detection of Theory of Mind deficits.

It was shown that success rate of the three tests differed significantly. The non-verbal test 'Reading the Mind in the Eyes' caused the most difficulties. The success rate percentage of this test performance correlated negatively with the severity of psychopathological symptoms evaluated according to the PANSS scale. Thus, 'Reading the Mind in the Eyes' test is the most sensitive out of the three to Theory of Mind deficits detection, which may be used for diagnostic purposes.","1176":"Mental health problems are common in Muslim communities however due to fear of exposure to stigmatization many people in this group continue to suffer in silence despite the availability of effective treatment. The Federation of Student Islamic Societies (FOSIS) organized the first ever Muslim mental health conference in Ireland to challenge the stigma attached to mental health problems in Muslims and to encourage care seeking in this group. As far as the authors are aware there are no intervention studies on mental health stigma in Muslim communities reported in the literature. We conducted a single arm, pre-post comparison study on Muslims who attended the FOSIS mental health conference in University College Dublin, Ireland. Validated stigma scales measuring knowledge (Mental Health Knowledge Schedule (MAKS)), attitudes (Community Attitudes towards the Mentally Ill (CAMI)) and behaviour (Reported and Intended Behaviour Scale (RIBS)) were administered on participants before exposure to the programme and immediately afterwards. 18\/150 (12%) of participants completed the pre-post RIBS scale and pre-post MAKS scale and 16\/150 (10.5%) of participants completed the pre-post CAMI scale. There were statistically significant differences in the pre-RIBS score compared to the post-RIBS score (p=0.0262) and the pre-MAKS score compared to the post-MAKS score (p=0.0003) but not in the pre-CAMI score compared to the post-CAMI score (p=0.6214). To the best of our knowledge, the FOSIS Dublin Study is the first intervention study on mental health stigma in Muslim communities to be published. The results of our study provide provisional support that a 'bespoke' Muslim mental health conference comprised of talks and workshops by experts in mental health, scholars in Islam and a lecture delivered by a Muslim with first-hand experience of a mental health problem are associated with reductions in stigma. More robust research with a longitudinal study design, larger sample sizes and a control group are needed to determine if such events can cause a sustained reduction in mental health stigma in Muslim communities. ","1177":"The effects of depression on the immune system are well known. Recently, depression as a consequence of an immune disorder has received increased research attention. Here, we test the hypothesis that the depression-immunity association is a buffer zone between external stimuli, defence mechanisms, and intrinsic determinants. Five hundred and forty-nine patients presenting with a major depressive episode completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Lazarus and Folkman's coping inventory, and the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Scale (FACES III). Lymphocyte subtypes were quantified using flow cytometry. Links between immunity and depression were confirmed: levels of CD3, CD4 and CD8 cells accounted for 12.7% of the variance in the BDI (p&lt;0.001, linear regression; LR). The depression-immunity pairing interacted with family dynamics, coping mechanisms, and gender. Dynamics in the family of origin explained 11.4% of the BDI score (LR) and 1% of CD3 and CD4 levels (p&lt;0.001, Pearson's r). Coping mechanisms were associated with 12% of the BDI score (p&lt;0.001, LR), and the capacity of distancing oneself from one's problems was associated with 10.3% of CD3, CD8, and CD16\/56 levels (p&lt;0.01, LR). BDI scores in women were 2.9 points higher than in men (p&lt;0.01, t=2.379) and associated with a greater risk of immune depression (p&lt;0.001, odds ratio=0.5). External determinants (family), coping mechanisms, and internal determinants (such as gender) simultaneously influence a depression-immunity pairing.

To rule out differences in population characteristics, the study took place in only one hospital: Brugmann University Hospital, whose catchment area is the north of Brussels. Our results show 3 distinctive practice styles. We suggest that variation in urgent admission rates for patients with alcohol and opiate related problems can be due not only to the socio-economic variables of the population, but also to medical uncertainty about the effectiveness of admission for the treatment of these disorders. The extent of uncertainty about appropriate standards of care and the plausible related inappropriate care and welfare losses are discussed. ","1180":"Since 2010, the Belgian mental healthcare system has been involved in a structural reform: the main objective of this reorganisation is to foster the reintegration in the community of patients suffering from a mental health disorder. In parallel, the role of mental health professionals has evolved these last years: from a strictly clinical role, to the preoccupation with the rehabilitation of social competencies such as enhancing patients' abilities to return to work. The aim of this paper is to explore, specifically for patients hospitalized for a common mental health disorder, the predictive variables of returning to work within 6 months after hospitalization (RTW6). Our sample was extracted from routinely collected data during the patients' hospital stay (10 days) at the Psychosomatic Rehabilitation Day Centre of CHU Godinne. A sample of 134 patients participated in our study. Those patients were contacted 6 months after their hospitalization to assess resumption of work. We found that a patient's sociodemographicand socioeconomic variables, and depressive symptoms at the beginning of hospitalization were not predictive of return to work within 6 months (RTW6). On the other hand, duration of absence from work before hospitalization and the diagnosis of a major depression in particular were negatively associated with RTW6, whereas improvement of depressive symptoms during hospitalization stay was positively associated to RTW6. Our study identified the diagnosis of major depression and the duration of absence from work before hospitalization as two important risk factors impeding a fast return to work for patients hospitalised for a common mental health disorder. As the preoccupation with patients' abilities to return to work is now on the agenda of mental health professionals, special support and supervision should be dedicated to the more vulnerable patients. ","1181":"It is important to perform psychiatric assessments of adult patients who are candidates for cochlear implants both to screen them for psychiatric disorders and to assess their understanding and compliance with the procedure. Deafness is a factor of difficulty for conducting in-depth psychiatric interviews, but concomitant blindness may make it impossible. After a description of Norrie disease, a rare disease in which blindness and deafness may occur together, we propose a case report of a patient suffering from the disease and who consulted in view of a cochlear implant. Early information on cochlear implants appears to be necessary before total deafness occurs in patients suffering from Norrie disease. An inventory of digital communication tools that can be used by the patient is also highly valuable. Research should be supported for a more systematic use of psychiatric assessments prior to cochlear implants. In the special case of Norrie disease, we recommend early screening for mental retardation and related psychotic disorders and, depending on the patient's level of understanding, preventive information on the benefits and limits of cochlear implants before total deafness occurs. ","1182":"A large amount of evidence has already shown associations between depression and immunity, a bi-directional relationship seems to be increasingly evident. We showed in several precedent studies that family dynamics (Dubois et al. 2016, Zdanowicz et al. 2015), some coping skills (Manceaux et al. 2016) or gender (Fagniart et al. 2016) are correlated with depression and\/or immunity and change the way depression and immunity interact together. The objective of this review is to study the literature in search of older and recent evidence about how immunity and depression interact and which determinants influence this relationship. We searched on PubMed, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES and Sciencedirect articles with the keywords immunity and depression and with coping, gender and family. Surprisingly we observed in the literature that depression is mostly correlated with both inflammatory and impaired immunity mainly for cell-mediated immunity. Recent studies showed that gender differences in immunity seems to explain in part some variabilities concerning depression and acute\/chronic stress among men and women. There is evidence for a sexual dimorphism of the immune system. Coping style, perceived control or personality impact the immune system. There is evidence that childhood maltreatment or stress occurring early in life can exert persistent effects over a long period of time like a \"biological scar\". There seems to be an individual and biological heterogeneity behind the label of major depressive disorder. We demonstrated the role of several modulators on immunity and depression such as gender, coping, personality, early-life stress or relationships. Many other modulators could exist and should be considered for further investigations. ","1183":"The undergraduate Medicine course at the University of Cambridge has included cadaveric dissection as part of its anatomy teaching for over three centuries. In recent years, medical schools in the UK and the US have debated whether cadaveric dissection is a useful and efficient way of teaching anatomy. Existing research on this subject has focused narrowly on the knowledge-acquisition for medical students afforded through dissection, and thus we have broadened the scope of such considerations to include the emotional responses of medical students to the dissection process. The basis for this paper is a phenomenological analysis of response data gathered from 56 first year medical students at the University of Cambridge through written questionnaires and discussion groups before and after their first experiences of cadaveric dissection. Our research suggests that there are in fact many more lessons taught and acquired through studying in the dissection room: they are tacit, emotional, experiential and dispositional. When this wider picture of the value of dissection is considered, a much stronger case for the continued inclusion of cadaveric dissection in the medical curriculum can be made, as it is a valuable and unique educational experience. ","1184":"Depression is characterized by atrophy in several brain structures, with the hippocampus seemingly particularly affected. A wide variety of cellular mechanisms have been proposed for these structural modifications, including the regression of dendritic branching. While neurogenesis alone appears inadequate to produce such marked changes, an altered rate is likely to affect hippocampal function. There is also strong evidence for neurotransmitter and glucocorticoid-mediated effects on neurogenesis, providing routes for the action of antidepressants. We aim to show how neurogenesis relates to the 'conventional monoaminergic theory of depression' and its modulation by antidepressants.","1185":"Several papers have been written to show that General Practitioners do not always prescribe according to the guidelines despite the availability of guidelines regarding the dosage and length of treatment with antidepressants to treat a depressive episode. Here we review the evidence as to whether GPs follow antidepressant guidelines, covering the data between 1996 and the present day, and discuss the implications of this evidence. We then propose solutions which could be used to improve adherence to the guidelines. We propose as one solution the development of joint Doctor-Practice Nurse clinics for the treatment of depression. The outcomes of these clinics should be auditable against the guidelines. Such a solution, when linked with easy access to advice and referral to Secondary Care Psychiatry specialists, argues for a collaborative care or shared care program for the treatment of depression in Primary Care.","1186":"The PHQ-2 has been presented as an ultra-short screening questionnaire to detect depression in several healthcare settings.

Patients suffering from this disorder have the fixed false belief of being infested by a parasite. Because of this condition, patients mainly consult with dermatologists or general practitioners. They are often reluctant to see a psychiatrist and to take treatment with antipsychotics because of their belief. The following describes the case of a woman who has the particularity that the DP started a few days after sertraline interruption. This situation raises the question of the impact of the sertraline interruption on pruritus and its role as a trigger of DP. Case report description and research on medline, pubmed with the keyword: delusional parasitosis, Ekbom syndrome, pruritus, SSRI. Any other pathology that could explain the patient's symptomatology was excluded which allows us to diagnose this patient with DP. The disappearance of the symptoms was obtained with 200 mg of sertraline and 2 mg of risperidone. It appears that pruritus can be favored by cutaneous dryness due to age and anxiety. Symptoms of discontinuation of SSRIs may include anxiety and paresthesia. The main hypothesis explaining the onset of DP would be the raise of paresthesia followed by the interruption of sertraline (discontinuation symptom) on a favorable field, which means an elderly woman of an anxious nature and having cutaneous dryness. It therefore seems necessary to discuss the discontinuation symptoms at the initiation of a treatment for this kind of patient to avoid false interpretations of skin symptoms such as paresthesia or itching. ","1189":"In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association removed Asperger's Disorder from the DSM, offering instead the new DSM-5 diagnosis: Autism Spectrum Disorder. This change has been hailed the most controversial exclusion from the DSM, yet unlike the 1973 removal of homosexuality from DSM-III, Asperger's disorder has not been demedicalised. Rather, the disorder has simply been reclassified as part of the DSM-5 Autism Spectrum and therefore retains its fundamental characteristic as a mental disorder owing to its inclusion within the sphere of the DSM. This paper is based on a review of the current academic literature in conjunction with careful reading of the DSM-5. Removing the Asperger's label, valued by patients for its distinctiveness from autism brings with it the potential to inflict iatrogenic harm. This paper demonstrates how the DSM-5 reclassification has the potential to threaten the identity of those affected, and discusses the problem of autism as a stigmatizing diagnostic label. A case is made for the use of tandem social\/colloquial - medical\/technical terminology to refer to the conditions classified under DSM-5 Autism Spectrum Disorder, in order to square the circle of social concerns regarding identity and stigma with the need for diagnostic clarity to continue to advance medical practice. ","1190":"Psychiatric disorders may be caused by underlying imbalances between goal-directed and habit systems in the brain. Numerous studies have aimed to establish whether this is because of a goal-directed system deficit, enhanced habit system, or both. This transdiagnostic approach to studying psychiatric disorders is increasingly popular. Maladaptive habitual behaviour is present in many disorders. It is the principal observation in disorders of compulsivity and is also present in other psychiatric disorders that are not primarily characterised by compulsive behaviour. The psychopathology that causes these disorders might be similar and could be targeted with specific treatment. Traditional categorical classification systems of psychiatric disorders do not reflect similarities in neurobiological dysfunction. The comorbidity and overlap between psychiatric disorders means that a dimensional classifications system based on underlying brain system dysfunction might be more appropriate. In this paper, the neural and neuromodulatory systems that contribute to goal-directed and habit systems are discussed. Account is taken of model-based and model-free computational learning mechanisms that are thought to give rise to goal-directed and habitual control respectively. Different psychiatric disorders that have a deficit in goal-directed behaviour or habit systems are then explored to see if there are similarities in the underlying neural systems despite differences in clinical presentation. It concludes that the relative contribution of goal-directed and habit systems in psychiatric disorders is not evenly distributed. Similar dysfunction of these systems might cause different psychiatric disorders. This neurobiological finding might influence classification systems and research into potential treatments.","1191":"Although psychotropic drugs have been hailed as, 'One of the success stories of modern psychiatry' the prescribing of these medicines has not been without commotion, concern and controversy. Moreover, the President of the World Psychiatry Association Professor Dinesh Bhugra and colleagues, after conducting a recent large-scale study (n=25,522) on psychiatric morbidity in the UK, collectively issued the clarion call that, 'The mental health of the nation was unlikely to be improved by treatment with psychotropic medication alone'. The provision of mental healthcare services may likely benefit from a holistic approach that includes a variety of treatment options that prioritizes patient safety and preference. The performing arts is gaining popularity among service users as an adjunctive form of treatment for mental illness. There is a growing body of evidence that provisionally supports the claim that art therapy, 'Possesses the power to heal psychological wounds'. The North American Drama Therapy Association defines drama therapy as, 'The intentional use of drama and\/or theatre processes to achieve therapeutic goals' and that it is 'active and experiential'. This review article discusses and describes the merits of dramatherapy and how this treatment modality can contribute to a patient's recovery from psychological distress.","1192":"Flowers for Algernon is a novel written in 1966 by Daniel Keyes. Since its publication, it has received significant critical acclaim, earning a Nebula science-fiction award, and was also adapted into a feature film. Set in the 1960s, the novel follows the story of Charlie Gordon, an intellectually disabled man who lives a simple but happy life working a cleaning job at a local bakery. Charlie's life, however, faces an abrupt change when he is offered the opportunity to participate in a novel surgical procedure to improve his intellect. Although he doesn't fully understand the risks of the operation, consent is provided on his behalf by his estranged sister and Charlie undergoes the experiment. The experiment is a success and Charlie develops intellectually at an alarming pace, soon surpassing the experimenters themselves. The rest of the book follows the, not all positive, changes that this intellect brings to Charlie's life. The novel is set in a time when American scientific experimentation could often occur without fully informed consent. This article explores the ethical side of such experiments like the one performed on Charlie, namely if it is morally right to perform a potentially dangerous experimental procedure on someone who doesn't fully understand the risks, even if it will potentially help them.","1193":"The current card sort exercise described by Agius et al. in 2006 provides a tool for patients and their families to characterise the temporal pattern of occurrence of both stereotyped and idiosyncratic prodromal symptoms that serve as early warning signs predicting a relapse. This 'individual relapse signature' is highly specific for bipolar relapse, and aids identification of a relapse such that patients can be channeled into appropriate early intervention pathways. This review examines the role of the card sort exercise in the treatment of bipolar disorder, and evaluates the evidence for its efficacy. Few studies involve the card sort exercise, and those that do paired it with other early therapeutic interventions, such that it was difficult to assess the true contribution of the card sort exercise alone to outcome measures such as time-to-relapse or hospitalisation avoidance. We went back to first principles and evaluated the literature concerning various factors necessary for the card sort exercise to be useful. We concluded that there is good evidence that replicable relapse signatures exist as early warning signs for bipolar relapse, and that a certain subgroup of patients and their families can reliably use these signs to seek help and activate therapeutic interventions to abort the relapse episode. Early intervention is both possible and efficacious, which makes early identification of relapse yet more important. The card sort is of less use for depressive relapses, where prodromal symptoms are harder to pinpoint. The card sort exercise is useful in elucidating the relapse signature for each patient, which can then be used in psychoeducation or identification of future relapse episodes. However, more research is needed directly assessing the usefulness of the card sort exercise in helping patients and their families gain insight into the possibility of an imminent relapse.","1194":"Incidental findings on Head MRI and CT scans are common in the general population as well as in patients presenting with first episode of psychosis (FEP). Though unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UICAs) are among the incidental findings, they are rare in those under the age of 30. We present a case of a young man (28) who presented with FEP and unruptured intracranial aneurysm. The implications to treating physicians are discussed given the rareness of the two to be found together in the given age group. Following physical examination and several physical tests including both CT and MRI scans, it was established that in addition to psychosis, the young man had an unruptured intracranial aneurysm on the right anterior communication artery. The psychosis continued despite successful treatment of the aneurysm. It was concluded that the aneurysm was an incidental finding. UICs under the age of 30 in patients presenting with FEP are more likely to be coincidental findings rather than the underlying cause of psychosis. However, clinicians need to remain vigilant by conducting physical examination including neurological examination for patients presenting with FEP. The need for brain CT or MRI scan should be informed by clinical presentation and the findings on physical examination.","1195":null,"1196":"The rise of radicalisation, the 'demonization' of Muslims in the media and the immigration crisis in Europe have all contributed and colluded to heightened levels of Islamophobia in the West. The stigmatisation of Muslims can and has resulted in negative outcomes in this group such as elevated levels of psychological distress and an increase in hate crime and terrorist attacks perpetrated against Muslims from members of the far right. There are 1.6 billion Muslims on the planet and Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world. Now, more than ever it seems, is a critical time to learn about what the true message of Islam is and who the blessed prophet Muhammad peace be upon him (PBUH) was from reliable and authentic sources. This paper aims to challenge the stigma attached to Muslims through the following means: 1. It contains information to educate people about Islam, debunk myths and challenge negative stereotypes; 2. It utilizes the power of 'story-telling' to engage readers and to equip them with facts and the necessary skills to combat Islamophobia. Part I includes a brief introduction of Islam and concludes with a concise description and evaluation of an anti-Islamophobia programme that was piloted in Cambridge University (UK) and delivered as a Keynote Address at the Carrick Institute for Graduate Studies International Symposium of Clinical Neuroscience in Orlando, (USA). Our hope is that through this initiative we can create a critical mass and inspire and empower people, Muslims and non-Muslims alike to stand in solidarity and collectively challenge extremism in any of its many forms. Our hypothesis is that this will result in better outcomes such as reductions in radicalization and Islamophobia.","1197":"The Baqa'a refugee camp is the largest in Jordan, home to some 104,000 Palestine refugees. Barriers to accessing and consuming mental health services in Arab-refugees are well documented in the literature however few studies have been conducted hitherto to identify barriers for Palestine refugees with psychological problems residing in refugee camps in Jordan. To identify the barriers to accessing and consuming mental health services for Palestine refugees with psychological problems residing in Baqa'a refugee camp in Jordan and to formulate policy recommendations to overcome those barriers. 16 qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted with healthcare professionals working at health centres for Palestine refugees in Jordan, 14 of which were in health centres at Baqa'a refugee camp and the remaining two at the Field Office of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in Amman, Jordan. All the interviews were recorded and transcribed and thematic analyses conducted. Ethical approval was granted by the University of Leeds and UNRWA. 16\/16 (100%) respondents reported that resource and financial deficits were the most common barriers that contributed towards the treatment gap. Sex (15\/16, (94%)), stigma and religion (12\/16, (75%)) and culture (10\/16, (63%)) were other major barriers identified. Our findings help to elucidate the contributory factors towards the treatment gap between Palestine refugees with psychological problems residing in Baqa'a refugee camp in Jordan and mental health services therein.

The risk of poisoning in children is important because of possible confusion of black\/dark blue belladonna fruit berries with other edible berries. There are many reports in literature of accidental intoxication but no report on traditional intentional usage to achieve hallucinogenic effects. Here we report purposeful ingestion of Atropa belladonna berries for hallucinatory effects among adolescents in Bjelovar region in north part of Croatia. This has been happening among children\/adolescents while they were grazing animals. We visited a dozen villages in the region and spoke to the oldest mostly to the elderly residents. The existence of such abuse of Atropa belladonna berries in the first part of XX century was confirmed by eight narrators from five distinct places in the region. Interestingly this type of behavior had a specific name \"bunanje\", unknown in Croatian language, but clearly associated with local plant name bun or bunika. According to informants consumers of berries would develop delirium or hallucinations associated behavior, incoherent and meaningless speech. However nobody remembers any severe case of poisoning. At the regional hospital in Bjelovar in the Pediatric department, there is no record of poisoning with Atropa belladonna. To our knowledge this is the first report of intentional consumption of belladonna berries to achieve the hallucinogenic effect. The fact that the custom was observed in five distinct spots and it had its specific name \"bunanje\" suggest that those are not isolated random events but the type of practices; seasonal abuse of hallucinogenic berries of Atropa belladonna, among rural adolescents in the first part of XX century.

The results indicate a tendency of younger gamblers and particularly problematic gamblers towards online-gambling. Considering the substantial addictive potential of online-gambling and hints of a future trend away from offline- towards online-gambling, preventive measures like public restrictions for online providers and awareness campaigns for consumers about the dangers of online-gambling offers are reasonable.","1202":null,"1203":"The rehabilitation of patients with cleft deformities is very complex and unique, and managed by a team of professionals. Quality of life depends on the health, and represents an instrument that examines the disease impact and treatment modalities on the health, integrating an objective assessment of the health status and its subjective experience. Children with clefts are often teased by their peers, and that is the reason why they experience different kinds of psychological distress. Patients with non-syndromic clefts may develop depression and anxiety, hyperactivity, elevated risk of suicide and increased drug abuse in adolescence. Experienced members of a cleft palate team developed a specific questionnaire divided into 2 parts: the first contains the clinical profile of adolescents, and the second part contains questions regarding quality of life. This questionnaire was administered to 73 patients between June 2015 and June 2016, who matched these criteria during their control examinations at the University Hospital Dubrava. In general, the patient group showed significantly worse scores on majority of answers, specifying that their quality of life is worse compared to the control group. The principal component analysis revealed the presence of three components (factors). The interpretation of the three components was consistent with loadings indicating the component names: Component 1: The relationship with parents, success, society; Component 2: Appearance, and Component 3: Function. According to our results, we created a specific instrument - The Quality of Life in Adolescents with Cleft Assessment to assess aesthetic and functional results of treatment and quality of life of the operated adolescents with clefts. The adolescents in this study have no psychiatric disorders diagnosed in their medical charts, but results indicate that some of them need help in dealing with future life. Regarding these findings, it will be possible to intervene in the process of treatment and improve the overall outcome of therapy.

Web of science was searched for relevant articles using search terms \"glaucoma\", \"depression\", \"glaucoma and depression\", \"quality of life and glaucoma\". The additional relevant papers were added from the bibliography of selected papers. All types of articles were included, no time period was defined. We have reviewed 11 studies regarding the comorbidities of glaucoma and depression. The number of participants in all studies ranged from 86 to 6760. Formats of scale in one study was clinician rated, others were self-reported scales. Two studies of the above mentioned studies explored specific types of glaucoma. In the three studies out of 11 there was no significant evidence of elevated depressive symptoms associated with glaucoma. In the six studies the prevalence of depression was significant among glaucoma patients. One study provided suboptimal assessments of depression in glaucoma patients. The other one showed the presence of glaucoma significantly associated with depression after adjustment for the demographic factor. Most of the studies used one scale, while two of them used two scales. The reviewed studies did not analyze the therapy options of included patients. The results presented in this review indicate that glaucoma is accompanied by depression in the majority of analyzed studies. The comorbidity of glaucoma and depression should be the subject of further research on both, self-reflecting and clinician-rated scales, taking into account subjective experience of patients and physicians. The therapy options should be taken into account in future researches focusing on the multidisciplinary approach including novel possibilities of treating both diseases respectively. ","1205":"Breast carcinoma is the most common malignant disease in women in the majority of developed countries. The development of depression as well as the quality of life (QoL) in these patients depends not only on the result of oncologic treatment, but on the cosmetic outcome as well. The primary aim of this prospective study was to investigate the changes in QoL and depressive symptoms among patients undergoing surgical treatment for breast cancer. We conducted a prospective study that included 100 female patients (mean age 60.26 years) who underwent surgical and oncological treatment for breast carcinoma at the University Hospital Center Zagreb, Croatia. The patients were photographed before and after treatment and were required to fill out a standardized quality of life questionairres QLQ - C30 and QLQ - BR23, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and a questionnaire on breast asymmetry. Our results show that patients had significantly higher QoL levels compared with their pre-surgical results. Statistical trend of a lower degree of depression was also observed. A worse cosmetic outcome (i.e., postoperative assymetry) was associated with a lower QoL, but there was no association with depression. Depression was significantly related to the level of pain and lower financial status. QoL improved after surgical treatment of breast cancer and was dependant on postoperative asymmetry, whereas the findings for depressive symptoms remained less clear. Future research should investigate more factors that may contribute to the QoL and degree of depression in this patient population.

While many factors may influence women's decision to adopt prevention-oriented behaviours regarding breast cancer, this study has emphasised the importance of sociodemographic factors, psychological factors and mental wellbeing. Participants in the study were all patients who, during one year, were admitted for the first time for diagnosis and treatment in the biggest Clinical hospitals of the Herzegovina-Neretva region Patients were divided into two groups based on their TNM classification: \"early stage\" and \"late stage\". Three instruments were used in this study: an individual questionnaire about demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the woman, the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control scales, and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The majority of patients diagnosed with advanced disease were admitted to hospital in the late\/advanced stages of the disease. Multi-variant analysis showed that the most statistically significant positive predictor for early admittance in hospital is living with family and marital status while religiosity has a negative predictive value. The results indicate that 59.7% of respondents do not have depression, while the remainder do have some degree of depression. There was no statistically significant difference in the degree of depression between women who were diagnosed and treated early and those who were not. The employment status of the respondents was the only significant factor related to degree of depression. Although health locus of control and depression are not statistically significant predictors of early hospital treatment, the recommendation is that further studies focus on the implementation of MHLC and HDRS scales within the community. This could be useful in planning appropriate and specific interventions, not only because of early diagnosis, but also to ensure good mental health and resilient behaviour.

The purpose of this paper is also to give insight into how the Internet addiction which is a risky health behavior affects the health status of adolescents. The excessive use of Internet is linked with the lower health status of Croatian adolescents as well as of the adolescents in Germany. Respondents are defined as students who attend school regularly ages 11-18. The modified SF-36 questionnaire and IAT for Internet addiction were used. The Spearman correlation coefficient was calculated -0.23 with N=459 and p&lt;0.001. Accordingly, the correlation between health quality and Internet addiction is negative but statistically significant (p&lt;0.001). There is a strong correlation between adolescents' mental health and quality of life and the level of their Internet addiction. Out of the total number of adolescents in ill-health, 39% of them are moderately or severely addicted to the Internet. 20% out of the total number of adolescents in medium health is moderate of severely addicted to the Internet. Finally, out of the total number of adolescents in good health 13% has been moderate of highly addicted to the Internet. Therefore, the better the adolescents' health, the fewer the Internet addicts. And vice versa, the worse the health, the more the Internet addicts. ","1209":"This paper explores problematic Internet gaming in the context of other forms of risky behaviour. The basic premise is that children and adolescents at risk will display different types of risky behaviour in various settings. Children and adolescents (N=1150) were surveyed about (cyber)violence, problematic gaming (habits, motives and symptoms), self-disclosure via Facebook and self-esteem. Regular gamers were more violent both face-to-face and via the Internet, and were more prone to problematic gaming than occasional gamers. Those who played games for more than five hours per day (9% of respondents) were classified as potentially problematic gamers. They experienced and committed more violence both face-to-face and via the Internet, were more involved in self-disclosure and had more problematic gaming symptoms than those who played for less than five hours a day, but these groups did not differ in self-esteem. Participants could choose from a list of eight different motives for their gaming; those motivated by peer communication, a sense of control, relaxation, conformism, self-efficacy and to distract from problems reported more symptoms of problematic gaming than those not motivated by these factors. Gender, age, self-esteem, self-disclosure and committing violence contributed to explaining the variance in problematic gaming, accounting for about 26% of its variance. Boys, lower self-esteem, more self-disclosure and committing both types of violence more regularly were connected with reporting more symptoms of problematic gaming. The results will be discussed in the context of a general proneness to risky behaviour. Committing violence against peers (both traditional and cyber) predicts significantly problematic gaming. This supports the premise that children and adolescents at risk are prone to exhibiting different forms of risky behaviour in different settings.

Except of exposure to traumatic events and related stress, all other variables may have indirect mediating effects on long-term posttraumatic outcomes. The main aim of this cross-sectional study is to explore relative independent contribution of these variables in the explanation of quality of life among war trauma survivors, with a special emphasis on the variables of religiousness and religious coping. The research was conducted on 353 subjects who experienced war related traumatic events during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&amp;H). The data was collected through several self-report measuring instruments: Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life, Stressors Check List (SCL); Religiousness Scale, Social Support Resources Scale; Religious Problem-Solving Scale, Brief RCOPE, Posttraumatic Growth Inventory and Mississippi Scale for PTSD. According to the results of the study, experience of loss and frequent exposure to war trauma and high levels on the primary stress appraisals, self-directing coping style and PTSD-symptoms were associated with lower perceived quality of life among the subjects. High levels of extrinsic religious orientation, effect of religiousness on social behavior, positive religious coping and posttraumatic growth were associated with higher perceived quality of life among subjects. These variables showed significant independent contribution to the prediction of the values on quality of life. Results of the study have a scientific significance in understanding the importance and mediating role of religiousness and religious coping for quality of life perception as one of long-term posttraumatic outcomes. Effects of religiousness on social behavior and positive religious coping showed particularly significant contribution across all prediction models for the quality of life.

The number of immigrants in the world has more than doubled since 1975, with majority of migrants living in Europe today. Migration is now being increasingly recognized as a risk factor for multiple mental-health related issues, such as schizophrenia, psychosis, anxiety disorders and others. The aim of this study was to collect, systematically review and analyze relevant articles pertaining to the mental health of second-or-higher generations of domesticated immigrant population, as well as to determine common socio-cultural predisposition factors leading to the development of mental illness among the mentioned population. Systematic search of relevant and peer-reviewed electronic database ScienceDirect was performed to identify studies related to mental health and healthcare in before-mentioned immigrant population. Study selection was performed by two independent reviewers, following the agreed specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. 2 036 records were identified through initial database search, out of which 5 studies were included in this review, after the selection process. The most consistent clinical finding is an increase in the rate of diagnosis of schizophrenia and related psychoses among migrants when compared to the host population, however the relationship between migration and psychotic disorders remains unexplained. So far, biological factors, such as cannabis use or obstetric complications, have failed to account for the risk of schizophrenia among migrant groups.

Despite heated debates on its addictive nature, consensus is emerging regarding the existence of this problematic behavior. In this paper we provide a comprehensive overview of the literature on Internet addiction in last 20 years. Purpose of this paper is to present crucial findings on Internet addiction to health profession. Besides numerous benefits of Internet use, the virtual environment brings various risks in every age group. The Internet is very significant in the everyday activities of children and youth and professional interventions with this age group should be specific considering their developmental characteristics. Exposure to online risks can have long-lasting and intense negative effects. Effective programs in prevention and treatment should include a multi-sectoral and interdisciplinary approach. Detail review of the symptomatology, diagnosis model an possibilities of treatment can be multiple beneficial to the health professionals and other helping professions due to actual needs for interventions in the field of the internet addiction treatment. Internet addiction is slowly becoming a societal concern as it particularly affects adolescents and children, who are more exposed and consequently more vulnerable.

This paper aims to review finding on the link between attachment style and suicidality. We searched the literature using the database of the U.S. National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)-MedLine\/Pubmed system from January 1992 until December 2016. We started with 1992 because, as far as we know, there are no published studies exploring the relationship between suicide and insecure attachment before that year. We considered reports published on the relationship between attachment style and suicidality. We applied several combinations of the following search terms: attachment, adult attachment style and suicidality, suicide, suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior or suicidal thoughts, and suicide attempts. We selected only English language studies. Research suggests that insecure attachment style, mostly anxious, and unresolved traumas are associated with an increased suicide risk. Few studies prospectively examined clinical course, comorbid psychiatric disorders, familial suicidality or other psychosocial factors. Further research is needed to highlight the nature of the link between attachment and suicidality. The presence of suicidal ideation and attempts might be a consequence of an underlying interaction between the emergence of psychiatrics symptoms, and the long-lasting presence of inadequate patterns of attachment. Within this context, Separation Anxiety Disorder, categorized in the DSM-5 as a condition not confined to childhood but as an anxiety disorder that may occur through the entire lifespan, might be the a key for the comprehension of this link.

While it is well known that both positive emtions in adolescents wiotions and social support can have a positive impact by helping individuals to maintain a positive attitude, the correlation between positive emotions, social support, and depression among these adolescents remains to be investigated. This study examined the mediator effects of positive emotions on the relationship between social support and depression among adolescents suffering from mobile phone addiction. For this study, conducted in 2016, we selected 1,346 adolescent students from three middle schools (ranging from Junior Grade One to Senior Grade Three) in Hunan Province of China, to participate in the survey. Participants were selected using the stratified cluster random sampling method, and all participants remained anonymous throughout the study. Each participant completed the Self-made General Situation Questionnaire, the Social Support Rating Scale, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, and the Mobile Phone Addiction Tendency Scale. There was significant positive correlation between positive emotions and social support. Both positive emotions and social support demonstrated significant negative correlation with depression. Positive emotions had partial mediator effects on the relationship between social support and depression (P&lt;0.01). Both social support and positive emotions can lower levels of depression among adolescents suffering from mobile phone addiction. Social support contributes to positive emoth mobile phone addiction, thereby reducing their levels of depression.

The main aim of this paper is to compare expression of the human neuropsin gene on the mRNA level in a group of patients diagnosed with depression and in a group of healthy subjects who have never been treated psychiatrically. 291 people, aged 18-67, were qualified to participate in the experiment: major recurrent depression group (MRD) and the control group (CG). Designations were carried out for the human NP gene (hNP). For hNP gene expression at the mRNA level was higher in patients with depression than in the CG (p&lt;0.005). A Spearman's rank correlation analysis did not reveal any statistically significant relationship between the intensity of the disease measured using the HDRS scale and expression on the mRNA level for the hNP gene. Expression for the hNP gene in the entire group analysed increased with age of the examined individuals (p&lt;0.005).

We wished to ascertain which symptom clusters had the strongest association with suicidality. Our aims were (1) to examine the presence of current comorbidity and suicidality in patients diagnosed with panic disorder\/agoraphobia (PD\/A) and major depression (MD), and their relationship with duration of psychiatric treatment and frequency of hospital admission; and (2) to examine which coexisting symptoms were most strongly predictive of suicidality in sub-groups and the overall group. The study sample comprised 100 patients with PD\/A and MD. The following assessment instruments were applied: the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory-II, the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation, the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised, the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale and the Whiteley Index of Hypochondriasis. High rates of current comorbidity were seen in both groups. Patients with MD had significantly higher suicidality scores, but were also older, with a longer duration of psychiatric treatment and more frequent hospitalizations. In the overall group, psychiatric comorbidity was correlated with duration of psychiatric treatment and frequency of hospitalizations (with the exception of hypochondriasis which was not correlated with frequency of hospitalization). In both sub-groups and the overall group, suicidality was correlated with scores for all examined comorbidity (with the exception of hypochondriasis in the PD\/A group): however, after multiple regression only obsessive-compulsive symptomatology predicted suicidality in all sub-groups and the overall group, as well as depression in the overall group. Depression supposed as dependent variable and obsessive-compulsive symptomatology as a mediator explained around 37% of the variance in suicidal ideation.

Specific personality features may predispose an individual to mood disorders (MDD or BD) hence increased suicide risk. The specificity of this research is in the assessment of personality features during the acute phase of illness immediately after suicide attempt which resulted in psychiatric inpatient treatment. The study included 119 unrelated Caucasian participants with MDD-severe depressive episode without psychotic symptoms (MDD) and BD-severe depressive episode without psychotic symptoms (BD-sDE). Both groups of patients with MDD and BD-sDE were divided into the suicide attempters and non-suicidal group. The diagnoses of the severe depressive episode without psychotic symptoms in major depressive disorder (MDD; F32.2) and bipolar disorder (BD-sDE; F31.4) were made according to ICD-10 (WHO 1992) diagnostic criteria. Methods of suicide attempts were also assessed according to ICD-10 and a self-report questionnaire, the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) was applied. The participants who exhibited suicide attempt had significantly higher scores on harm-avoidance (HA) (p&lt;0.001), significantly lower score on persistence (PS) (p=0.037) and lower score, however not statistically significant, on novelty-seeking (NS) (p=0.319) regarding temperament dimensions. In character dimensions, the patients with suicidal attempt had significantly lower scores on self-directedness (SD) (p&lt;0.001) and significantly lower scores on cooperativeness (CO) (p=0.001). Patients who had suicide attempt may have some significantly different personality traits than non-suicidal patients with mood disorders. The combination of high harm-avoidance (HA) and low self-directedness (SD) may be specific for depressive episode while the combination of high HA, novelty-seeking (NS), and self-transcendence (ST) with low SD may be related to suicide attempts during the depressive episode in bipolar disorder. The novelty-seeking (NS), self-transcendence (ST) and self-directedness (SD) may be specific for suicidal group of bipolar patients. ","1228":"Psychiatric hospital \"Sveti Ivan\" in Zagreb, Croatia, offers an outpatient Early intervention programme for patients with psychotic disorders (RIPEPP), consisting of psychoeducational workshops and group psychodynamic psychotherapy. The aim of this study was to describe sociodemographic and baseline characteristics of the participants, in order to provide better understanding of this population, and to assist with the development of more effective therapeutic approaches. Since 2008, a total of 245 patients with first episodes of psychosis and their family members participated in the programme. They filled out several questionnaires within the framework of the programme evaluation, but for the purposes of this study, only data collected on sociodemographic questionnaire and the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS) are presented. Majority of the participants were male (66%), at the average age of 28 (SD=6.6), living with their parents (73.5%). Most of them finished secondary school (45.7%) but almost a quarter of the sample (23.7%) is currently studying at university. The average duration of untreated period was 101.60 days, with a median of 30 days. According to results of HONOS questionnaire, upon entry into the programme, the patients most often listed cognitive functioning (attention, concentration, memory) and professional issues (performance of work tasks and activities tied to work) as the most problematic areas. The findings of this study provide more detailed description of the beneficiaries of the RIPEPP programme, which can contribute to forming future programmes for the prevention of psychotic disorders. ","1229":"In Slovenia, there has been no evidence about the prescribing patterns for inpatients with psychotic disorders. The research aims to analyze drug utilization patterns for inpatients with psychotic disorder that are coded as F20-F29 according to International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 10th revision (schizophrenia spectrum disorders). Prospective research was conducted at the Psychiatric Hospital Idrija. The medical records of the inpatients admitted over a 12-month period were collected from the beginning to the end of their hospitalization. A total of 311 inpatients with 446 hospitalizations were included, producing a total of 3954 medication prescriptions. Medications prescribed pro re nata (the use of as needed) were also taken into account. Antipsychotics (N=1149, 43% of prescriptions) were the most often prescribed medications, followed by anxiolytics, antiparkinsonians, antidepressants, mood stabilizers and cardiovascular drugs. A total of 256 (82%) inpatients received at least one pro re nata medication. It was observed that the studied population was treated with one antipsychotic on 27 percent of prescriptions. Inpatients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders were exposed to a large number of different drugs. They were not received only psychotropic drugs but also other medications. With the knowledge about medications the implementation of clinical pharmacy services to the psychiatrists would significantly improve medication of inpatients with psychotic disorders and polypharmacotherapy. ","1230":null,"1231":"Schizophrenia (SCH) and bipolar affective disorder (BAD) are currently classified separately according to the DSM (The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) and ICD (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems) standardized diagnostic guidelines. However, the validity of this categorical approach is controversial because psychotic symptoms may be observed in both diagnoses. The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical and social characteristics in a sample group consisting of patients diagnosed with SCH or BAD to help demonstrate the basic difficulty in the current classification of SCH and BAD as two etiologically distinct diseases. The study sample group consisted of 102 patients diagnosed with SCH and 92 patients diagnosed with BAD. All of the participants were evaluated by Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition with regard to beginning symptoms of the disease, the symptoms and signs of active disease period within total disease duration, continuining residual symptoms in intermediate period. The patients were administered the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire and the Social Functioning Scale. The SCH and BAD groups in this study were statistically similar in terms of sex, length of education, age at disease onset, attempted suicide, quality of life and social functioning. Our study findings indicated that the course of disease in patients with BAD-1, in which psychotic features predominate and which exhibits a recurring course, shares various characteristics with SCH. It can be concluded that further phenomenological and neurobiological evaluations are required for intermediate cases with similiar clinical characteristics with schizophrenia and bipolar disorders. ","1232":"Though a number of reports on the use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been published from the Central-Eastern European region over the past two decades, a systematic review of this literature has not been published. Thus the aim of this paper was to review recent trends in ECT practice in Central-Eastern Europe. Systematic literature search was undertaken using the Medline, PSYCHINFO and EMBASE databases covering the period between January 2000 and December 2013. Relevant publications were found from the following countries: Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Ukraine, but none from Albania and Moldova. ECT practice in the region shows a heterogeneous picture in terms of utilization rate, main indications, and the technical parameters of application. On one end of the spectrum is Slovakia where the majority of psychiatric facilities offer ECT, on the other end is Slovenia, where ECT is banned. In about half of the countries schizophrenia is the main indication for ECT. In Ukraine, unmodified ECT is still in use. Clinical training is generally lacking in the region and only 3 countries have a national ECT protocol. Possible ways of improving ECT practice in the region are briefly discussed.","1233":"Second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are associated with metabolic disturbances. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a rare, but potentially fatal sign of acute glucose metabolism dysregulation linked to the use of SGAs. The aims of this article are to present patients with a history of psychotic disorders and of severe metabolic diabetic ketoacidosis, possibly associated with the use of antipsychotics, and to review the current literature on the topic of antipsychotic-induced DKA. PubMed\/Medline and EBSCO databases were searched using the keywords: diabetic ketoacidosis, antipsychotics, atypical antipsychotics, second generation antipsychotics, clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, ziprasidone, aripiprazole, paliperidone, amisulpride and haloperidol. Case reports, case series and reviews of case series were included in the review. The majority of patients who developed DKA following treatment with antipsychotics were treated with olanzapine and clozapine in monotherapy or in combination with other antipsychotics. DKA mostly occurred in the first six months of antipsychotic treatment. Other risk factors included insulin resistance prior to antipsychotic treatment, male gender and middle age. Clinicians should consider the risk of DKA when starting treatment with SGAs. Preventive measures for patients with psychotic disorders using antipsychotics should include regular assessment of risk factors and screening for diabetes before and after administering antipsychotics, especially in the first months of treatment. Whenever possible, polypharmacy should be avoided. ","1234":"The excess mortality in schizophrenia is still a phenomenon insufficiently studied on the cross-national level. It is important to analyse current studies on morality in schizophrenia since significant changes have recently taken place in psychiatric health care systems and guidelines of pharmacological treatment have been developed in European countries. This article reviews studies addressing mortality in schizophrenia in Europe that were published in English in the Pubmed database in 2009-2014. It aimed at determining countries where studies were conducted, methodologies and tools used, and current main mortality rates, as well as direction of causality in this group of patients. The recently published studies were conducted only in few European countries. The majority of data was obtained from general medical records and death records. The studies indicate that schizophrenia patients are characterized by higher mortality rate than the general population, with natural causes (cardiovascular diseases and cancers) and suicides predominating. The increasing mortality gap with significantly shorter life expectancy of patients with schizophrenia in comparison with the general population is considerable. Death records are a crucial tool in studies on mortality in schizophrenia patients; however they are insufficiently employed. Recent European reports do not show positive tendencies, indicating that standardized mortality rates in schizophrenia remain on the same level or even increase, particularly for deaths resulting from natural causes. Due to various methodologies used in studies, their direct comparison is difficult. This limitation warrants further discussion on methods used in future studies on schizophrenia mortality in Europe.

Modified Alvarado score, Ohmann score and Eskelinen score are used as assistance when setting the diagnosis and making a decision to undertake surgery. To assess accuracy of Alvarado score, Ohmann score and Eskelinen score in diagnosing acute appendicitis and to establish connection of total score of these scoring systems with histopathological degree of appendicitis. A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Department of Surgery of University Clinical Hospital Mostar. The study included 70 patients who underwent appendectomy and were scored before surgery. All tested persons were examined by experienced surgeon who took anamnesis, physical status and ordered laboratory diagnostic tests. Appendicitis was excluded or confirmed by means of histopathological diagnostics, and the degree of appendicitis was determined. According to accuracy parameters (sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive value), the score which was of highest value was Ohmann score, followed by Eskelinen score, while the lowest value was the one of modified Alvarado score. Total score in all three scoring systems follows the degree of appendicitis, but statistical significance was proven only for Ohmann and Eskelinen scores. Ohmann and Eskelinen scores can be useful in diagnosing acute appendicitis, predicting the degree of appendicitis, as well as assistance when making decision to undertake an operative procedure. Modified Alvarado score in our subjects did not prove sufficient value. Diagnostics of acute appendicitis still must be led by contemporary algorithms in which diagnostic scoring is implemented. ","1238":"Studies show that dysfunctional family relationships are important predictors of addictions to all psychoactive substances. To establish if there is a connection between family relations and heroin addiction and if found to exist, what is the quality of this connection. This research was conducted on the sample comprised of 160 subjects divided into two groups. The first group consisted of 61 heroin addicts treated at the Tuzla University Clinical Centre Psychiatric Hospital. The second group consisted of 99 subjects who were students at the Tuzla University Faculties of Philosophy and Electrical Engineering and who were not using any psychoactive substances. The subjects were tested with the Quality of Family Interactions Scale (KOBI) which measures the interactions between children and parents in two dimensions, described in literature as 'acceptance' and 'rejection'. The research team established statistically significant differences between the heroin addicts and the students, the non-users, in terms of their family relationships. The results show that the addicts families were characterized by lack of understanding, by conflicts, rejection, non-acceptance by parents, while the non-users families were characterized by understanding, acceptance by parents and good communication. There is a connection between inter-family relationships and addiction. Namely, rejection and non-acceptance of children\/persons by their families and parents, bad communication and dysfunctional family relationships are significant predictors of heroin addiction. ","1239":"Production of kappa free light chains (KFLC) represents a part of humoral immune response, along with the synthesis of intrathecal immunoglobulins. Increased concentrations of immunoglobulin G light chains, kappa and lambda chains, were identified through research of numerous diseases of central nervous system. The qualitative method of isoelectric focusing (IEF) followed by immunofixation currently represents the accepted standard in identifying oligoclonal bands (OCB), but establishing a sensitive immunonephelometric method for quantification of kappa free light chains (KFLC) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has paved a way for new diagnostic possibilities. Andersson classified the pattern types of OCB, ranging from type 1 to type 5, wherein types 2 and 3 indicate intrathecal synthesis. Our aim was to determine KFLC in CSF of patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) who had presented with type 2 and type 3 OCB, to determine if there is a difference in concentrations between those two groups and to establish a borderline value of KFLC which would enable differential diagnostics. 70 patients, who underwent lumbar punction for CSF analysis and had their blood sampled through the cubital vein, participated in the study. Patients were classified according to Andersson as type 2 or type 3, which besides adulthood, represented the inclusion criteria. The average age of patients classified as type 2 was 36 years, and those classified as type 3 was 39 years, where it is evident that there was not a statistically significant difference (p=0.0685). We used a qualitative electrophoretic technique of IEF with agarose gel followed by immunofixation, and a quantitative immunonephelometric method. All results were interpreted on a level of statistic significance of p&lt;0.05. CSF KFLC concentrations in type 3 were statistically and significantly elevated with regard to type 2 (Mann-Whitney test, p=0.0430). The median for KFLC in type 2 was 0.9 mg\/L, while the median for KFLC in type 3 was 2.71 mg\/L, and the detection limit for both types was 0.18 mg\/L. We used a statistical ROC curve to determine that KFLC concentration can be used for differential diagnostics, meaning it can discriminate type 2 from type 3 with clinical sensitivity of 61% and clinical specificity of 71% (AUC=0.641) (p=0.037). Despite the obtained statistically significant differences in concentrations of KFLC between types of OCBs and ROC analysis results, determination of KFLC by a nephelometric method, insufficiently strong clinical sensitivity and specificity does not justify abandonment of IEF method followed by immunofixation. ","1240":"In recent decades, there is more and more scientific research and evidence that religiosity has a positive impact on quality of life and mental health. The aim this study is to evaluate the impact of religiosity on the quality of life and psychological symptoms of chronic mental patients. The test group was consisted of 100 chronic mental patients at the Clinic for Psychiatry UCH Mostar, and control group was consisted of 80 somatic patients surveyed from the Infirmary of family medicine of the Health Center Mostar. The survey was conducted by the social and demographic questionnaire, a questionnaire on the quality of life of the World Health Organization WHOQOL-BREF, the questionnaire on religiosity and self-assessment questionnaire for psychological symptoms SCL-90th. For the socio-demographic data we obtained results that chronic mental patients as opposed to chronic somatic patients have significantly higher percent of an average lifestyle habits. There is statistically significant difference in the place of residence, chronic mental patients live in the city as opposed to somatic who live in the countryside. On the question of religiosity we received information that the chronic mental patients in relation to chronic somatic patients significantly more attend public religious gatherings, but however, chronic somatic patients compared to chronic mental significantly more use religiosity for better financial position, social comfort. In self evaluation of psychological symptoms we received information that the chronic mental patients as opposed to chronic somatic patients had significantly more psychotic features. To test the quality of life between the two groups, we received the information that chronic mental patients have significantly better physical and mental health, social relationships and caring for the environment as opposed to chronic somatic patients. Quality of life was significantly better in the chronic mental patients. Also, chronic mental patients significantly more attend public religious gatherings, while chronic somatic patients significantly more use religiosity for a better financial position, social comfort. Finally, chronic mental patients had a significantly more pronounced psychotic features.

Brain synaptic plasticity and successful restorative rehabilitation may also contribute to diminish neurological deficit of patients having cerebral palsy. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of intellectual disabilities and epilepsy in adult patients with different forms of spastic cerebral palsy and to find out correlation between the severity level of intellectual disabilities and epilepsy. Adults diagnosed with different forms of spastic cerebral palsy were analyzed during a three-month period. The investigated features were: gender and age; form of cerebral palsy; the prevalence of intellectual disabilities and epilepsy. Intellectual disabilities were divided into 4 severity levels. The correlation between the severity level of intellectual disabilities and epilepsy was statistically analyzed. Intellectual disability was present in 55% of patients diagnosed with spastic cerebral palsy. Epilepsy was present in 36% of such patients. It was recorded in 51.1% of quadriplegic, 21.9% of diplegic, and 19.2% of hemiplegic patients. Intellectual disability was present in 73.8% of quadriplegic, 31.3% of diplegic, and 53.8% of hemiplegic patients. The statistically significant correlation existed between the severe intellectual disability and epilepsy. Intellectual disabilities and epilepsy most frequently occurred in patients with most severe forms of spastic cerebral palsy. Epilepsy is strongly correlated to the severity level of intellectual disability. Such patients require additional special modes of treatment and restorative rehabilitation to improve the functional outcome.

Effective treatment of acne can reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression and significantly improve other physiological parameters and quality of life of these patients. The aim of this study was to determine the psychological status and quality of life of acne patients before, during and after the treatment with oral isotretinoin. The prospective study included a total of 127 patients suffering from moderate to severe form of acne. To assess the psychological status and quality of life of studied groups the following standard psychometric questionnaires were performed before, during and after the treatment with oral isotretinoin: Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Assessments of the Psychological and Social Effects of Acne (APSEA), State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Measure of Psychological Stress (MPS) and Dermatology Specific Quality of Life (DSQL). Results of the present study indicate that there is no increase in depressive and anxiety symptoms in the patients treated with oral isotretinoin. The psychological status by gender has shown the existence of differences between the genders in all measures of psychological status. Statistically significantly better quality of life was observed after healing than before treatment. The results of our study showed no higher risk of depression and anxiety within the patients with acne treated with oral isotretinoin. Improvement of quality of life after the treatment of acne with oral isotretinoin was confirmed.

The field of public health is very broad and its concept is changing over time, being defined in a narrower and wider sense. In short, public health is a science and practice that aims at ensuring the conditions in which people can preserve and improve their health and prevent health damage. The third millennium brings its specifics, needs and priorities according to challenges public health is faced by in the twenty-first century: the economic crisis, rising inequality, population aging, rising rates of chronic diseases, migration, urbanization, ecosystem change, climate change, etc. The role of public health is to protect, improve health, prevent diseases and injuries. Such a public health approach implies a multisectoral work focusing on \"wider health determinants\", and within this activity experts from various medical and non-medical profiles, whose field of public health is concerned, can be found. The development of inter-departmental co-operation skills contributes to a better understanding of health professionals and professionals of other profiles, and facilitates common, synergistic actions in addressing public health problems in the community. Symposium on Public Health Achievements and Challenges organized by the University of Mostar Faculty of Health Studies is just another indication of the obligation, the need and the desire for professional and scientific contribution to the fight for better health. Our faculty has so far organized other numerous symposia, and the aim of this symposium is to present public health achievements and challenges in our surrounding in order to protect, improve health, prevent diseases and injuries in a modern way.","1244":"The continuous progress of science has a very positive effect on health care. Health care in its broader sense has greatly progressed in past decades, and the education of health care professions requires more continuous learning, teaching materials and course duration. It becomes clear that continuous education is not only important for good quality doctors, but all participants of health care are gaining more burdens and their work becomes more complex. There is an increased necessity for team work, division of tasks and specialization. In this battle for health, the Faculty of Health Studies becomes a necessity and has an obligation in education of various health personnel due to acquiring practical and theoretical skills, as well as abilities in providing the best possible health care. The path of knowledge is long and difficult. It has been present at our faculty for 17 years and we carry it out through a variety of undergraduate and graduate programs, and as of this years through our postgraduate program. Besides the education of health care workers we wanted to offer to our current and former students, and their educators the possibility of publishing their work, so in 2015 we launched our electronic journal, \"Health Bulletin\", whose publisher is the Faculty of Health Studies. In the process of continuous battle for health, prevention and treatment, the role of highly educated health care worker is of increasing importance and he certainly becomes an indispensable link in this process. The goal of our faculty is to educate the best possible health care workers, who will in addition to high quality practical work gradually take over our teaching responsibilities at the university.","1245":"One of the most controversial topics in modern bioethics, science, and philosophy is the beginning of individual human life. In the seemingly endless debate, strongly stimulated by recent technologic advances in human reproduction, a synthesis between scientific data and hypothesis, philosophical thought, and issues of humanities has become a necessity to deal with ethical, juridical, and social problems. Furthermore, in this field there is a temptation to ask science to choose between opinions and beliefs, which neutralize one another. The question of when human life begins requires the essential aid of different forms of knowledge. Here we become involved in the juncture between science and religion, which needs to be carefully explored.","1246":"Religion and psychiatry have had complicated, sometimes neutral or friendly and cooperative, sometimes competitive and antagonistic relations over their long histories. Relations between psychiatry and religion are influenced by complex belief systems, each diverse and changing. Psychiatry has often ignored spiritual and religious dimension in health and illness while religions influenced the treatment of mental disorders directly by defining mental disorders as evil spirit possessions and prescribing exorcism as treatment. It has been a long way to prevail looking for natural over supra-natural explanations for mental disorders. Psychiatry and religion as social practices should be regarded as allies against pseudoscientific nonsense and superstitions. This alliance is based on the next evidence: 1. religious and spiritual well-being is an important component of mental health as well as of health in general; 2. research and empirical evidence reveals that healthy-minded and distorted or sick faith are quite distinct in the effects in the lives of the faithful; 3. psychiatrists are professionally expected to always respect and be sensitive to the spiritual and religious beliefs and practices of their patients; 4. religious and spiritual beliefs and practice is very important aspect of person-centered psychiatry. The enduring task for both psychiatry and religion is to enable human beings to live their lives with courage, sense, and optimism, to strive towards creating conditions of well-being and individual, public and global mental health as well as to dispel beliefs and patterns which trap people in lives of misery and mental disorders. Psychiatry and religion in creative dialogues as allies can significantly contribute to the healing of our broken world and promoting compassionate society and empathic civilization. When psychiatry and religion see each other as opponents or even enemies this is only because of their mutual misreading and pseudoscientific thinking.","1247":"Science is expected to be objective: however, since practiced and produced by humans, it has to reflect human flows - prejudices, stubbornness, malice, and the tendency to be misused. No wonder an excellent scientist like John Eccles proclaimed science to be among the most personal activities he had known. By analysing a few examples from the history of science (in particular the intellectual development of Van Rensselaer Potter, the American onco-biochemist and bioethics pioneer), as well as the current trend of the evidence-based approach, the present paper will try to demonstrate that denying, distrusting, and opposing science for the sake of religion, as seen so many times in human history, has significant similarities to the overestimation of science we more often encounter in our times.","1248":"Our world is in a state of crisis which tends to worsen.

A few models of these relations were offered, by which the monopoly over the truth by any one of those is crashed. Therefore, there are a few models but each is with lots of limitations. None is sufficient to explain the relation between the science and religion, but each contributes to certain extent to better understanding of those relations. Almost every one of the interpretations was under the influence of the social (particularly ideological and political) conditions in which they were emerging. One of those could be named as \"Riding on an old horse: there is no reconciliation between faith and reason\". Is the enlightenment theory the source of a conflict between \"faith\" and \"reason\"? What is it that leads to the conflict of the science and religion? From rejection to acceptance - a view on Darwin's theory then and now. do creationist theories lead to exacerbation of relations between the science and religion? Postmodernism on the relation of science and religion. Stand views of religious communities - science and religion are not in conflict. Examples that confirm such opinion. Many priests and Islamic teachers have given their contributions to the development of science (technology, medicine, geography, architecture, urbanism, music etc.). Isn't it that the calendars, past (Egyptian, Chinese, Aztec etc.) and present (Hindu, Jewish, Islamic, Gregorian etc.) have come from the umbrella of religions. Are conflicts between science and religion the matter of the past? Disputes over use of drugs in rituals exist even today. Religion and science are autonomous fields - but where is the border between them? Technology and religions. How religions refer to technology.

We hypothesized that there might be significant differences in personality profiles among subgroups of women who present with alcohol and opiate use disorders. Of 157 consecutive women with diagnosis of alcohol\/opiate addiction, 62 fulfilled following inclusion criteria: age 19-45 years, abstinence from alcohol and opiates for at least 10 days prior to enrollment. Alcohol-dependent group consisted of 30 females, while opiate-dependent group consisted of 32 females. The control group involved 30 age-matched randomly chosen healthy women. The data were collected using the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R). The multiple stepwise discriminant analysis was used to determine relations between personality traits and the probability of belonging to one of the study groups. Significant differences in the NEO-PI-R scores were observed between groups for all main personality traits except for Openness to Experience. Compared with controls, substance-dependent women scored significantly higher on Neuroticism and lower on Conscientiousness. Opiate-dependent females scored the highest on Neuroticism and on Extraversion and lowest on Agreeableness and on Conscientiousness. Alcohol-dependent females scored higher on Conscientiousness and lower on Neuroticism compared to opiate-dependent women. The results of our study confirmed significant characteristics in personality profiles among females with alcohol and opiate dependence, as well as the difference between these two groups of substance abusers and their healthy controls. The distinct personality characteristics among different groups of substance addicted women should be taken into account when creating the most effective program of prevention and therapeutic approaches in this specific cohort.

Analyses of self stigma reduction programs discovered that few studies have investigated the impact of education about the illness on self-stigma reduction. The objective of this study was to determine whether psychoeducation based on the principles of recovery and empowerment using therapeutic group factors assists in reduction of self-stigma, increased empowerment and reduced perception of discrimination in patients with schizophrenia. 40 patients participated in psychoeducation group program and were compared with a control group of 40 patients placed on the waiting list for the same program. A Solomon four group design was used to control the influence of the pretest. Rating scales were used to measure internalized stigma, empowerment and perception of discrimination. Two-way analysis of variance was used to determine the main effects and interaction between the treatment and pretest. Simple analysis of variance with repeated measures was used to additionally test effect of treatment onself-stigma, empowerment and perceived discrimination. The participants in the psychoeducation group had lower scores on internalized stigma (F(1,76)=8.18; p&lt;0.01) than the patients treated as usual. Analysis also confirmed the same effect with comparing experimental group before and after psychoeducation (F(1,19)=5.52; p&lt;0.05). All participants showed a positive trend for empowerment. Psychoeducation did not influence perception of discrimination. Group psychoeducation decreased the level of self stigma. This intervention can assist in recovery from schizophrenia.

Study was conducted on a sample of 88 persons suffering from schizophrenia, 60 persons with physical disabilities and 57 persons with psoriasis. All three groups completed The Scale of Life-Quality assessment. Persons suffering from schizophrenia were less satisfied with their education level and social life. They were less satisfied with life if continued the same as present than persons with physical disabilities and people suffering from psoriasis. However, persons suffering from schizophrenia have higher expectations for the future than persons with physical disabilities and people suffering from psoriasis. Our results show lower quality of life in the group of patients with schizophrenia in comparisons with group with physical disabilities and psoriasis, which indicates that it is necessary, not only to make the treatment of schizophrenia more successful, but also to improve the process of rehabilitation and social reintegration in order to increase the quality of life of people with schizophrenia.

The primary goal of this research was to investigate whether personality dimensions, including temperament, character, and trait impulsivity, were associated with comorbid MDD, as well as with suicidal ideation in psychiatric patients suffering from combat-related PTSD. The sample consisted of 148 Croatian male war veterans (mean age 49.53 years) treated for PTSD at the National Center for Psychotrauma, Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital Center Zagreb. Fifty-one (34%) of them met ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for current or lifetime MDD, while 97 (66%) were diagnosed with PTSD alone. All the participants were assessed with the M.I.N.I. diagnostic interview and they completed the following battery of self-report instruments: the Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-II), the Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R), the Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised (TCI-R), and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11). Comparisons between the two clinical groups showed that PTSD+MDD patients were more suicidal and differed with regard to temperament dimensions Harm Avoidance, Reward Dependence and Persistence, character dimension Self-Directedness, and trait impulsivity. In three multivariate regression analyses, it was revealed that character dimension Cooperativeness as well as trait impulsivity were unique predictors of suicidal ideation, while controlling for the influence of sociodemographics, length of treatment and comorbid depression. Combat-related PTSD patients with comorbid depression exhibit increased suicide thoughts and different personality profiles in comparison with those suffering from PTSD alone. Character dimension Cooperativeness and trait impulsivity seem to be uniquely predictive of suicide ideation in this population. Elucidation of individual psychological factors that increase the risk of MDD and suicidal tendencies in war veterans with PTSD may facilitate more effective prevention and treatment methods.

Stress response, memory functions, social behavior, and mood are modulated by microbiota. Furthermore, microbiota play a role in the development of the central nervous system. These features, established largely in rodent studies, have informed hypotheses about the role of microbiota in human psychiatric disorders. Microbiota affect phenomena that are known to be parts of the depression phenotype, such as exaggerated response to stress and inflammatory features. Furthermore, the role of microbiota in neurodevelopment and in the modulation of social behavior suggests the possibility of its role in autism spectrum disorder and in schizophrenia. If altered, microbiota play a role in psychiatric disorders, then efforts to normalize the gut microbial population by the ingestion of probiotics (live bacteria) could have antidepresssant or antipsychotic effects. Testing such hypotheses in translational human studies is a matter of future research.","1266":"Available data support a contribution of both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative factors in the etiology of schizophrenia (SCH) and bipolar disorder (BD). Of note, one of the most important issue of the current psychiatric research is to identify the specific factors that contribute to impaired brain development and neurodegeneration in SCH and BD, and especially how these factors alter normal brain development and physiological aging process. Our hypothesis is that only specific damages, taking place in precise brain development stages, are associated with future SCH \/BD onset and that neurodegeneration consists of an acceleration of brain aging after SCH \/BD onset. In support of our hypothesis, the results of the present narrative mini-review shows as neurodevelopmental damages generally contribute to neuropsychiatric syndromes (e.g. hypothyroidism or treponema pallidum), but only some of them are specifically associated with adult SCH and BD (e.g. toxoplasma or substance abuse), particularly if they happen in specific stages of brain development. On the other hand, cognitive impairment and brain changes, associated with long duration of SCH \/BD, look like what happens during aging: memory, executive domains and prefrontal cortex are implicated both in aging and in SCH \/BD progression. Future research will explore possible validity of this etiological model for SCH and BD.","1267":"To summarize all available evidence from systematic reviews about the impact of stress response in development of first-episode psychosis (FEP) in schizophrenia. An overview of systematic reviews of any type of primary studies was performed. An electronic search of five databases was conducted in February 2017 (CDSR, DARE, Embase, MEDLINE and PsychINFO). Quality of included systematic reviews was assessed using the AMSTAR checklist. Eight systematic reviews were included. The main findings of the included reviews point out a possible alteration of the stress response in a subgroup of persons with proneness to psychosis. However, the evidence is limited by the inadequate quality of studies, as well as lack of standardization of outcomes and assessment methods. Given the heterogeneity of current results, there is no solid evidence for uniform alterations of stress response found in persons with FEP in suggestive of schizophrenia that may serve as a marker of vulnerability to stress and possibly proneness to psychotic state in response to daily hassles. ","1268":"In this paper, we outline the concept of integrative therapy of borderline personality, also referred to as fragmented personality, which we consider to be the core psychopathology underlying all clinical subtypes of personality disorder. Hence, the terms borderline personality, borderline disorder, fragmented personality, and personality disorder are used interchangeably, as synonyms. Our integrative approach combines pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, each specifically tailored to accomplish a positive feedback modulation of their respective effects. We argue that pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy of personality disorder complement each other. Pharmacological control of disruptive affects clears the stage, in some cases builds the stage, for the psychotherapeutic process to take place. In turn, psychotherapy promotes integration of personality fragments into more cohesive structures of self and identity, ultimately establishing self-regulation of mood and anxiety. We introduce our original method of psychotherapy, called reconstructive interpersonal therapy (RIT). The RIT integrates humanistic-existential and psychodynamic paradigms, and is thereby designed to accomplish a deep reconstruction of core psychopathology within the setting of high structure. We review and comment the current literature on the strategies, goals, therapy process, priorities, and phases of psychotherapy of borderline disorders, and describe in detail the fundamental principles of RIT.","1269":"","1270":"","1271":"","1272":"To detect the effect of two different types of brackets (ceramic and stainless steel) and investigate the effectiveness of two chlorhexidine mouthwashes 0.2% (CHX) on oral hygiene status and incidence of white spot lesions (WSLs) in adolescents wearing fixed orthodontic appliance.

In the total of 112 IBD patients there were 69 patients diagnosed as ulcerative colitis (61.6%) and 43 as Crohn's disease (38.4%). There were 58 (51.8%) women and 54 (48.2%) men. Comparison between endoscopic and clinical indices in CD and UC demonstrated no significant differences in ilnness activity. Endoscopic and clinical disease activity was associated with a higher inflammatory parameters (CRP and leucocytes, L) and lower parameters of hemoglobin (Hb) and MCV.

Despite the importance of controlled medication in treatment child and adolescent disorders, this increase may be a factor which influence misuse and nonmedical use of prescribed drugs among adolescents. Croatian data from ESPAD survey in 2003, 2007 and 2011 were used, and variables selected from the international ESPAD questionnaire. Dependent variable was taking tranquilizers or sedatives prescribed by doctor in the past 12 months. Independent variables were nonmedical use of tranquilizers\/sedatives, use of other psychoactive substances, school performance, truancy, delinquent behaviour, satisfaction with relationships with parents, friends, health, self-perception, financial situation and symptoms of depression. The respondents were 8849 students (4393 boys and 4456 girls) in three consecutive ESPAD surveys (2003, 2007 and 2011). In multivariate analysis for all three survey years the strongest predictor for prescription medication use was use of sedatives\/tranquilizers without prescription (OR 6.14; CI 4.08-9.23; OR 8.16; CI4.65-14.32; OR 9.77; CI5.92-15.13). Frequent drinking and excessive drinking or drunkenness also predicted prescription medication use, (OR 1.85; CI1.10-3.10; OR 2.01: CI 1.20-3.39). Among other problem behaviours lower school performance (OR 2.92; CI 1.41-6.05; OR 2.56; CI 1.12-5.87), missed school days OR 1.59; OR1.01-2.51; OR1.72; CI 1.03-2.87), aggressive behaviour (OR 1.532; CI 1.01-2.28; OR1.65; CI 1.04-2.62), depressive symptoms (OR 2.19; CI 1.24-3.85) and poorer financial situation were connected with prescription medication use. Prescription use of tranquilizers\/sedatives was predicted by nonmedical tranquilizers\/sedatives use, alcohol abuse, symptoms of depression and variables indicating maladjusted behaviour. Although there is sufficient evidence that prescription medication abuse might went unobserved, the further analysis which could better explain its' role and impact is still needed.

MS diagnosis was made according to ATP III criteria, which was the basis for dividing the study and control group into subgroups with regard to MS diagnosis. From blood samples of all subjects total and differential WBC counts were determined. Schizophrenic subjects with MS had significantly higher total WBC count, as well as neutrophil and monocyte count, when compared with both control subgroups. Total WBC and neutrophil count correlated positively with glucose concentration and MS prevalence and negatively with HDL concentration.

They made early, significant and internationally recognized contribution into medical science and became eponymous, although social disasters of the twentieth century caused deep impact on their subsequent lives and careers, so their role was shadowed from global medical community. The article analyzes biographies and academic achievements of A-F.K. Siewert (aka: Zivert, Ziwert, von Siewert) (1872-1922), known for first description of the hereditary dyskinesia of cilia (as a triad of: situs inversus of the viscera, abnormal frontal sinuses producing sinusitis and bronchiectasis); S.S. Abramov (1875-1951), discoverer of primary idiopathic myocarditis, and N.I. Taratynov (1887-1919), who was the first in description of a local form of histiocytosis X (solitary eosinophilic granuloma) and predicted the eosinophilic origin of Charcot-Leyden crystals. The contribution of these scientists into Medicine is reviewed in context of historical epoch, on background of their different individual social choices and the fate of their families. Besides their eponymous descriptions, other medical priorities of these scholars are analyzed. Some previously unpublished materials from their family archives are presented, which witness for possible existence of unknown prototype for the main hero of 'Doctor Zhivago' novel by B.L. Pasternak and for probable priorities of doctor Zivert - in active diastole concept, or doctor Abramov - in description of dilated cardiomyopathy.

Several trials have succeeded in demonstrating the beneficial effects of early depression prevention programs for otherwise healthy children and adolescents. However, comparable programs for children and adolescents with a medical condition are still scarce. This paper discusses the situation of chronically ill children and adolescents who are at risk of developing comorbid depressive symptoms using the example of three conditions frequently encountered in pediatric psychosomatic medicine: diabetes, epilepsy and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Each patient group is introduced with regards to specific risk factors and correlates of depression. Also, existing customized depression prevention programs and according research trials are presented. Reviewing the body of literature, it becomes apparent that risk factor research and depression prevention are still in their infancy for these three patient groups. While new risk factor models and biomarker approaches emerge as a promising rationale for depression prevention, research is called upon to include randomized control trials as well as longitudinal designs in order to achieve more optimally tailored preventive interventions for children and adolescents with chronic medical conditions.","1281":"Negative symptoms are highly prevalent in the acute episode and long-term course of schizophrenia. They are often persistent and tend to chronicity. They have an important negative impact on different dimensions of outcome and therefore require careful diagnosis and treatment. However, the evidence for the available psychopharmacological treatments is still not satisfactory and further research is needed. Antipsychotics, especially some second-generation antipsychotics, are the primary treatment of choice, particularly for negative symptoms in the acute episode. In case of residual negative symptoms concomitant treatment with antidepressants is often indicated. Glutamatergic compounds are of great theoretical interest as an add-on treatment or even as a monotherapy, but so far the efficacy results are inconsistent and their clinical use is limited.","1282":"The main goal of this research is to try and understand influence of psychological and social factors in children with tendencies to repeat tooth trauma. Research included 147 patients, children of preschool and school age (88 boys and 59 girls). In the research patients were divided in two age groups: 5-8 and 9-12 years. In both groups there were 49 patients with no experience of dental trauma and 69 patients with experience of one dental trauma and 29 patients with repeated dental trauma. All patients that were involved in the study had previous experience with dental and medical treatment. Study included evaluation of dental anxiety and also factors that caused dental phobia previous their visit to the office in the children with no dental trauma compared to repeat dental trauma patients. On the whole study group differences considering sex, age and psychosocial status in the level of dental anxiety and dental fear were also measured. Categories of children without trauma and with one or multiple trauma showed that it is a similar sex division in the categories. In the no trauma group participation of the boys is lower (46.9%) while in the group with repeated trauma their participation is significantly higher (79.3%). Based on that the risk of repeated dental trauma is characteristic of boys. Results of this study show that tested psychosocial variables do not differentiate participants according to the tested groups or in other words there is no difference between tested groups in their psychosocial standing. ","1283":"The aim of this study is to determine the results of pharmacist interventions on patient's adherence to drugs in community settings. The study was designed using a standard EQ-SDQ questionnaire and a Culig questionnaire about the adherence to drug. General Level Framework (GLF) was used as a tool for competence assessment among community pharmacists. Participants were pharmacists that issued the medication on repeat prescription in the pharmacy. They interviewed the patient at the first visit to the pharmacy and the next time when the patient came to refill the prescription. The survey was conducted during a two-month period in the Atlantic Pharma pharmacy chain. A total of 152 patients were included at the first visit and 87 patients at the second visit. About two thirds of patients (65.5%) identified themselves as adherent during the first survey, and this number increased slightly during the second interview (by 3.5%), but not statistically significant (p=0.75). A total number of drugs prescribed during the first and second survey was 252 and 253 respectively. The percentage of the advices given to the patients increased during the second survey, but not statistically significant (p=0.62). It is definitely important to check that a patient understands current disease and what are doubts and difficulties in taking a therapy. The reasons for possible nonadherence are different: fears, worsening of the clinical state or other negative treatment outcomes. Enough time should always be left to clarify anything that is unclear and to listen. Application of GLF program for improving pharmacist competences resulted in slightly increased patient adherence to medication. For further development of competences, pharmacist intervention should include some other contents, i.e. tailoring the dosage scheme, counselling about drug-drug and drug-food interactions. The pharmacist counseling should be reimbursed by the Croatian Health Insurance Fund. ","1284":"The aim was to determine distribution and trends in the outpatient utilization of antipsychotics to evaluate the rationality of antipsychotic drug prescribing during the ten year period. The epidemiological method of descriptive and analytical observation was used. Data on drug utilization from Zagreb Municipal Pharmacy were used to calculate the number of defined daily doses (DDD) and DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day (DDD\/TID) using the World Health Organization Anatomical-Therapeutic-Chemical methodology. The ratio of typical versus atypical antipsychotics served as an indicator on assessing the rationality of the utilization. Data on the use of anticholinergics in the treatment of neuroleptic side effects were also included. Outpatient utilization of antipsychotics showed a declining pattern from 14.17 in 2001 to 8.42 DDD\/TID in 2010. The utilization of atypical antipsychotics increased by 60% (from 3.68 to 5.89 DDD\/TID), while the utilization of typical antipsychotics decreased by 76% (from 10.49 to 2.53 DDD\/TID). The drugs showing the largest increase were olanzapine (from 1.21 to 2.78 DDD\/TID) and quetiapine (from 0 to 0.68 DDD\/TID). The typical\/atypical antipsychotic ratio changed from 1:0.4 in 2001 to 1:2.3 in 2010. A 2.3-fold decrease was recorded in the utilization of anticholinergics (from 2.05 to 0.91 DDD\/TID). Total consumption of neuroleptics significantly decreased. A decrease was also recorded in the utilization of anticholinergics. Study results pointed to two favorable features, i.e. low use of typical antipsychotics and the ratio of typical and atypical antipsychotics. Implementation of the new clinical guidelines for nervous system disorders and updating of the list of reimbursable drugs with the addition of new ones contributed to the observed improvement in the prescribing patterns during the study period. Using the WHO ATC\/DDD methodology and rationality indicators in the assessment of trends in the outpatient utilization of psychopharmaceuticals over a ten-year period proved efficient in the evaluation of prescribing rationality.

The objective was to find out whether depression, posttraumatic stress disorder and personality traits at the time of delivery are associated with EBF six to nine weeks after delivery. The targeted population were women who delivered in Croatian largest University maternity hospital. The scores of The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), The Big Five Inventory (BFI) and The Impact of Events Scale (revised) - IES-R three to five days after childbirth were measured to predict self-reported EBF status six to nine weeks after the delivery. Six to nine weeks after the delivery data on breastfeeding were collected for 259 (69.6%) out of initially 372 enrolled women. Six to nine weeks after the delivery 151\/259 (58.3%) were still exclusively breastfeeding their child. After adjustment for all other variables, women who gave their second childbirth had significantly higher odds for longer EBF than primiparous women (OR=2.12; 95% CI 1.10-4.10). Higher EPDS result was significantly associated with lower odds for EBF (OR=0.92; 95% CI 0.85-0.99). Parity and depressed mood immediately after the delivery are associated with EBF six to eight weeks after the delivery. Depression symptoms are a moderator between parity and exclusive breastfeeding, so multiparous women without depressive symptomatology are more prone for EBF.

The aim of this study was to test differences in paternal involvement in pregnancy, perceived stress and relationship quality regarding complications in pregnancy and pregnancy duration (gestational weeks) in the last trimester of pregnancy. The role of personality traits (neuroticism and extroversion), relationship quality satisfaction and perceived stress in prospective father's perception of pregnancy involvement were examined. One-hundred forty-three primiparus couples in the last trimester of their pregnancy participated in the study. Prospective fathers completed a booklet with questionnaires including The Quality of Marriage Index, The Perceived Stress Scale, Eysenck Personality Questionnaire and Partner's Involvement in Pregnancy Scale. Prospective mothers completed only Eysenck Personality Questionnaire and questions on pregnancy complications and demographics. The prospective fathers showed high involvement in their partner's pregnancies, elevated levels of perceived stress and high relationship quality. There were found no differences in the above named variables regarding complications in pregnancy and pregnancy duration. Higher involvement of prospective fathers was related with older age, lower male neuroticism and higher female extroversion, better relationship quality and lower perceived stress. The findings demonstrate that prospective father's involvement in pregnancy is supported with psychological factors, namely personality traits, quality of relationship and perceived stress. These results should lead to target interventions that can modify and improve fathers' involvement perspective and promoting a couples mental health during pregnancy: thus clinically important for promotion of healthy prenatal behaviour and decrease in mothers' emotional distress.

Abandoned by a close figure of attachment, many persons have developed the emotion of anger, even though the separation was caused by death. The traumatic experience of the loss of a parent is particularly hard in war, because most often it does not occur as an individual trauma. Our aim is to research anger as a personality trait in persons whose father had died in war at a time when they were children, and to compare it with an appropriate civilian control group of subjects. The study comprised 155 persons of both sexes. The target group consisted of persons (N=98) whose father had died in the Homeland War and who had just been born at the time of their father's death, or were children or adolescents, and had since their father's death grown up in a single-parent family with their mother, while the control group of subjects (N=57) had not suffered any war losses in the family in the war time from 1991 to 1995. The examined variables were: sex, age, loss of father due to civilian or war causes, marital status, age when the subject lost their father, anger as a state and as a personality trait. STAXI is used in this study; it is frequently used in studies of experiencing, expressing and controlling anger in persons suffering from PTSD. Statistically significant differences were demonstrated in some of the scales and subscales of anger as a state and anger as a personality trait between the abovementioned subject groups, with higher scores in persons who had suffered a civilian loss of father. The study supports the opinion that the social context in which the grieving person is before, during and after the loss of a close person has an important role in the process of grieving, and eventually defines the social and personal meaning of death. ","1292":"Idiopathic scoliosis, defined as a three-dimensional spine and trunk deformity, which appears in otherwise healthy subjects, exhibits complex relations with various forms of personal well-being and psychopathology. Most research studies have documented a higher proportion of psychological disturbances (e.g., self-criticism, negative body image, low self-esteem) and mental disorders (e.g., anxiety and depressive disorders, personality disorders) among idiopathc scoliosis patients compared to healthy controls. In addition, there are some reports, although more systematic research is warranted, on the role of mental health and personality traits in relation to the adherence to conservative treatment. Given the increasing role of surgical treatment in the management of scoliosis, as well as several reports on negative psychological outcomes of such interventions, there is a growing need for ongoing screening and mental health care in this population. It seems this also holds true for non-operative treatments, particularly bracing therapy. One should keep in mind that these scoliosis-psychopathology relations are deduced from a limited number of empirical studies, usually conducted on small sample sizes, suggesting the need for further large-scale investigations, preferrably those with longitudinal research designs. Understanding the complex interplay between personality\/psychopathology and spinal deformities within the framework of personalized mind-body medicine, should help clinicians tailor more individualized and specific treatments and predict therapeutic outcomes in this clinical population.","1293":"This paper presents the morally controversial phenomenon of prostitution. As the basis for contemplating the prostitution issue the most important is revealing and understanding its primitive ethical root. For understanding its \"soul\", its essence, also important is comprehending sexual, \"elementary thoughts\" of mankind, through the relationship between prostitution and religious, social, political and spiritual life, and its nature as a reflection of the sexual-ethical concepts in different epochs and nations. We emphasize the connection between prostitution and psychiatry. Placing a special focus on importance of personality for deciding to become a prostitute, and by pulling it through a moral prism we define prostitution as a new medical situation. In favor of that, we stress the importance of the presence, position and role of psychiatrists within an indispensable multidisciplinary team, which is complementary despite its heterogeneousness, synergistically and simultaneously dealing with psychological, physical and social health-problems of women engaged in prostitution. We propose peer education as a way of promoting healthy and safer behaviors among the subculture of prostitutes, where we see another important role of psychiatrists in selecting\/recruiting, training and motivating peer educators among them.","1294":"Art is a product of human creativity; it is a superior skill that can be learned by study, practice and observation. Modern neuroscience and neuroimaging enable study of the processes during artistic performance. Creative people have less marked hemispheric dominance. It was found that the right hemisphere is specialized for metaphoric thinking, playfulness, solution finding and synthesizing, it is the center of visualization, imagination and conceptualization, but the left hemisphere is still needed for artistic work to achieve balance. A specific functional organization of brain areas was found during visual art activities. Marked hemispheric dominance and area specialization is also very prominent for music perception. Brain is capable of making new connections, activating new pathways and unmasking secondary roads, it is \"plastic\". Music is a strong stimulus for neuroplasticity. fMRI studies have shown reorganization of motor and auditory cortex in professional musicians. Other studies showed the changes in neurotransmitter and hormone serum levels in correlation to music. The most prominent connection between music and enhancement of performance or changing of neuropsychological activity was shown by studies involving Mozart's music from which the theory of \"The Mozart Effect\" was derived. Results of numerous studies showed that listening to music can improve cognition, motor skills and recovery after brain injury. In the field of visual art, brain lesion can lead to the visuospatial neglect, loss of details and significant impairment of artistic work while the lesions affecting the left hemisphere reveal new artistic dimensions, disinhibit the right hemisphere, work is more spontaneous and emotional with the gain of artistic quality. All kinds of arts (music, painting, dancing...) stimulate the brain. They should be part of treatment processes. Work of many artists is an excellent example for the interweaving the neurology and arts.","1295":"The article discusses the impact of contemporary culture on the individual's personality. We used the \"psychocultural\" approach whose key feature is the amalgamation of theories and methods belonging to psychodynamic and psychosocial studies, as well as those used in the field of media and cultural studies. The idea of a potentially therapeutic effect of culture (therapy culture) can already been seen in Freud's and Lacan's texts, and it is often used in critical analyses of contemporary corporate culture, which is more or less developed in some parts of the world. In their criticisms, many contemporary authors emphasize that modern societies have a tendency towards the weakening of basic commitment, or lack thereof, to a social equivalent of Winnicott's concept of environmental provisions as an inalienable democratic right essential for human emotional and mental progress or emotional well-being. The article describes frequent resorting to the so-called manic defences that defensively distort, deny and obscure the awareness that a human being is not the omnipotent source of life, but instead depends on other human beings, and often tries to compensate for loss through various activities. The article describes excessive shopping as an activity that often serves as an attempt to find what was lost, i.e. to fill an emotional void. This solution (resorting to manic defences) is encouraged by contemporary culture, especially through promotional material (e.g. advertising). The main theses of this article are supported by quotations and data from world literature.","1296":"This article draws attention to the relationship between neuroethics, neuropolitics, political psycho-cultures and public and global mental health. In the hegemonic culture of neoliberalism the purpose of life has been reduced to the self-realization in economic and consumerism terms that promotes the hypercompetitive narcissistic or manic self, indifferent to the fate and suffering of others and accommodated to commodification of morals, mental health and well-being. The real public and global mental health promotion is strongly associated with creating a more empathic, less selfish individual and collective mind where people put a greater emphasis on common interests and bioethical values.","1297":"","1298":"","1299":"","1300":"","1301":"Exposure to stress modifies the humoral and cellular immunity by the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. On one hand, this psycho-immunological theory allows the analyse of links between immunity and depression. On the other hand, the correlation between the immune response, the clinical expression in major depressive disorder (MDD) and the gender was proven. Our analysis evaluates the influence of the gender and the level of depression severity on the cellular immune response associated with it. 549 patients with MDD were enrolled in an open-ended survey. In addition to a socio-demographic questionnaire, they completed the Beck Depression Scale (BDS). Flow cytometry was used to assess lymphocyte subsets. On average, the intensity of the depression (ID) among women is higher by 2.9 points (t=2.379*). In terms of immunity, there are correlations between this ID and absolute values of CD3 (r=-0.127***), CD4 (r=-0.189***), CD8 (r=0.089*) and CD16 and 56 (r=0.129*). In terms of gender, there are significant differences for the percentage of total lymphocytes (m=37.84, w=35.59; t=2.646***), CD3 (m=2.08, w=1.9; t=2.676*), CD4 (m=1.44, w=1.3; t =2.522*), CD8 (m=0.62, w=0.57; t=2.182*). A linear regression model including both variables supports the existence of these differences in the percentage of total lymphocytes (Adjusted R2=0.025***) and CD8 (Adjusted R2=0.012*). If the link between depression and the cellular immune response is a known fact, our study proves that women have a stronger immune response than men in terms of percentage of total lymphocytes mobilized and cytotoxic lymphocytes. The volume of natural killer lymphocytes is independent of the gender but connected to the ID. Based on those results, psycho-immunological theories could potentially be rethought in the light of immunity being at least partially dependent of the gender. ","1302":"In a previous study, we compared the family relationships of patients hospitalized in a psychiatry unit from either psychiatric consultations or after passing emergency room (E.R.). The intensity of depression was statistically comparable in both groups. What distinguishes patients transiting emergencies is that their families and couples are more cohesive and adaptable. In this study, we compare both groups in terms of coping mechanisms and multidimensional health locus of control (MHLC). All patients (N=2172) with a major depressive disorder admitted to our department between 01\/01\/2010 and 31\/12\/2012 are included in an open study. They completed the Beck's Depression Inventory, the Olson's Family Adaptability and Cohesion Scale, visual analogue scales of stress, the ways of coping checklist, and the MHLC scale. Patients admitted through emergencies are found to have less belief in chance (CHLC) (t=2.488; p=0.014), distance themselves more from their problems (t=-2.187; p=0.03), but reappropriate them less positively (t=2.355; p=0.019) than those admitted through consultations. A logistic regression model including variables identified in the previous study (adaptability in the original family and the couple's lived stress) gives a risk factor (odds ratio) of 14.7 which means that a patient who would combine the different risk factors would be 14.7 times more likely to go through emergency. How to explain that depressive patients with more favorable factors considered: to believe less in chance, distancing from their problems, and having a better family support, are more likely to go to the E.R.? We make the suggestion that those factors exactly slowed down patients in their care application at first, allowing the depression to worsen. It is only once they would have depleted their reserves that they would reach the emergency room on their own initiative or encouraged by their families, themselves overwhelmed by the situation. Further study should take into account the duration of the episode before arrival at the hospital. ","1303":"Previous study shows that cellular immunity and family relationships are each correlated with the severity of depression and suggests that the psycho-immunological theory should look at the relation between immunity and family life. The aim of the present study based on the same sample is to investigate if similar correlations exist with humoral immunity. 498 inpatients with major depressive disorder were enrolled in an open-label trial. In addition to a socio- demographic questionnaire, they completed Olsen's FACES III and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). We performed a classic blood test, a plasma cortisol assay at 8 a.m., 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. and a dexamethasone suppression test (Carroll test). Electrophoresis is used for separation and quantification of serum proteins. There is no correlation between humoral immunity and the severity of depression. We found a correlation between cohesion of the family of the origin and beta-globulins (r=-0.147; p=0.016), and C4 (r=0.124; p=0.039). Between adaptability of the family of the origin and cortisol levels at 8 a.m. (r=0.122; p=0.008). We showed a correlation between both C4 (r=-0.263; p=0.000) and beta-globulins (r=-0.148; p=0.013) with CD8. There is a correlation between cortisol at 8 a.m. and CD4 (r=-0.095; p=0.033). Humoral immunity has no correlation with depression but has multiple interactions with cellular immunity which is correlate with the severity of the depression. The psycho-immunological theory is reinforced. It is quite original to find correlation between the family functioning and C4 or beta-globulins while the link with cortisol strengthens some studies about psychological stress, cortisol and immunity. Future studies should examine which kind of family or relation are implicated and how the family functioning and immunity could be connected. ","1304":"On the one hand, this psycho-immunological theory makes it possible to forge links between immunity and depression. On the other hand, we know that coping strategies are an important variable in the model of vulnerability to depression. Our study weighs the influence of cellular immunity and coping strategies on the severity of depression. 498 inpatients with major depressive disorder were enrolled in an open-label trial. In addition to a socio-demographic questionnaire, they answered a Cousson's coping test and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). In terms of immunity, there are correlations between the BDI and percentages of CD8 (p=0.000; r=0.163), CD19 (p=0.046; r=0.090), CD16&amp;56 (p=0.011; r=0.282), ratio CD4\/CD8 (p=0.003; r=-0.135). A linear regression model for immune variables explained 25% of the BDI. In terms of coping, there is a correlation between severity of depression and ea (escape avoidance) (p=0.000; r=0.218), pr (positive reappraisal) (p=0.000; r=-0.265) and pps (planful problem solving) (p=0.000; r=-0.296). However, there is no correlation between the severity of depression and d (distancing). A linear model for coping strategies explained 12% of the BDI. Finally, there are correlations between distancing and CD8 (p=0.005; r=-0.119), CD19 (p=0.017; r=-0.102) and CD 16&amp;56 (p=0.029; r=-0.227) but also CD3 (p=0.008; r=-0.114) and CD4 (p=0.027; r=-0.095) but not between those immune variables and the other coping strategies. In this case, a linear regression for distancing explained 10.3% of immune variables. Every coping strategy has an impact on depression. But not in the same way. Ea, pps and pr strategies influence directly the risk of depression while distancing influences the immune variables themselves. Knowing that those variables impact the risk of depression, distancing has then an indirect effect on depression. ","1305":"The hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) plays a pivotal role in response to a range of external and internal factors often described as a \"stress\". Growing evidence in a literature, suggest various dysregulations of HPAA, in course of numerous mental disorders. Patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder seem to have elevated basal cortisol secretion, what might be caused by the diminution of glucocorticoid receptors' amount. It was of the interest if the cortisol concentrations in patients with diagnosed schizophrenia who underwent treatment, differs from healthy individuals. Two groups of participants were included into the study. First group (study) consisted of 10 patients with diagnosed schizophrenia and control group which included 38 healthy individuals. Study was divided into two stages, first one (pilot) included only control group, and utilized cortisol concentrations measurement from saliva, blood and 24h urine sample. Second part (main study) involved both groups although focused on a salivary cortisol concentrations. A mean salivary cortisol concentration in patients with schizophrenia who underwent treatment was significantly lower in comparison with healthy individuals. Obtained results indicate that patients who underwent a treatment, and does not present notable clinical signs of schizophrenia may have moderately lowered levels of salivary cortisol. This may be a reflection of relenting psychotic symptoms as well as a direct effect of atypical antipsychotic drugs on a HPA axis activity. ","1306":"In a previous study, we investigated the risk of admission to emergency (ER) of depressed patients prior to their hospitalization in psychiatry in comparison with hospitalized patients transferred from the consultations department (Cdpt). In the present study, we compare among the same patients variables affecting the intensity of depression in each group. All patients with Major depressive disorder admitted in our department through emergencies (N=146) or consultations (N=2172) between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2012 were included in an open study. They completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), analogical visual scales about stress levels (in professional, social, family, married life, over the past year and the past month), the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control and the Olson Family Adaptation and Cohesion Scale and the Ways of coping. The depression (t=1.438; p=0.90) is similar in both samples. Although some variables such as gender, internality, coping mechanisms and stress factors influence the intensity of depression in both groups of patients (linear regression p&lt;0.000, r=0.593), other factors play a role only in either one or the other group. The factors of patients' age, number of children, elements of family dynamics, couple life, and the belief in luck do influence the intensity of depression only in patients hospitalized through Cdpt (linear regression p&lt;0.000, r=0.366). The intensity of depression of patients admitted through ER, is specifically dependent on the number of collateral factors (p=0.045, r=0.304), the number of living relatives (p=0.036, r=0.276) and the belief in the power of others (p=0.022, r=-0.16). Although Both samples are comparable in terms of intensity of depression, patients admitted through the Cdpt are more dependent on the quality of family relationships whereas those coming from emergencies are most influenced by their concrete social and family situation. Alongside these specific variables it remains that stress and coping mechanisms account for the largest percentage of variance of the intensity of depression. ","1307":null,"1308":"Osteoarthritis (OA) also called degenerative joint disease is the most common chronic condition of the joints that just in 2004, caused moderate to severe disability in 43.4 million of people. OA in Western populations is one of the most frequent causes of joint pain, loss of function and disability in adults. In the U.S. it is the second most common cause of work disability in men over 50 years of age, following ischaemic heart disease, and accounts for a higher number of hospitalizations when compared with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) each year. This condition is associated with chronic pain (which can be severe in many cases) and long term inflammatory processes which all together represent conditions that are known to be associated with depression. Depression is among the most burdensome disorders worldwide having affected just in 2010 15.4 million adults worldwide. Depression is associated with increase of symptom burden, greater level of functional impairment and increased risk of both disease complications and mortality. With this research we wished to put in evidence the importance of an early diagnosis of Depression in patients with osteoarthritis by using PHQ9 and suggest Duloxetine as an antidepressant that can be helpful in the management of not only pain but also depression in OA patients. Our study is a literature based research. Early Diagnosis of depression of patients with osteoarthritis appears to be crucial for improving the outcomes of patients with OA and that can be easily and efficiently done with PHQ9. Duloxetine presents itself as an ally in the fight against the evolution of depression in patients with OA and should be considered even in mild to moderate states of depression. ","1309":"Patients with schizophrenia have profound and disabling cognitive deficits while negative symptoms represent a separate symptom domain, with respect to depression, neurocognition, and social cognition. Particularly, primary negative symptoms of schizophrenia represent a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, In this study we try to evaluate the cognitive symptoms in 51 primary negative schizophrenic inpatients by the administration of simple, fast and understandable scales (MMSE, DSST, EpiTrack, PANSS cognitive factor). We also evaluate the correlation with some SGAs (aripiprazole, quetiapine, olanzapine, paliperidone). Our results support the evidence of the use of simple, rapid and acceptable scales for cognitive evaluation in clinical practice. Overall data indicate no statistically significant variations of the negative symptomatology in all the examined sample, although a reduction of the statistical averages in each group is observed (paliperidone and olanzapine, particularly).","1310":"Pharmacogenetics is a powerful tool to improve drug response and to maximize therapeutic efficacy and safety using genetic information of each individual. This review collects the available literature understanding the influence of heritability on an individual's drug metabolism.","1311":"Alzheimer's dementia is one of the most significant health burdens of the modern age in both industrialised and non-industrialised nations as it is a major cause of morbidity and functional impairment in the elderly. Currently there are no cures for progressive dementias, including Alzheimer's disease, and no treatments that would modify their progress. Intervention involves pharmacological treatment to temporarily relieve the symptoms, including three cholinesterase inhibitors and a noncompetitive NMDA antagonist, and the efficacy of these is widely debated. While our understanding of the underlying pathology of Alzheimer's continues to grow, we have yet to fully elucidate the mechanisms that drive neuronal loss in this condition. Any truly disease-modifying treatment must be developed to target these pathological pathways. An extensive analysis of the available literature is presented here, including a number of trials, meta-analyses and reviews, with the aim of assessing current management, establishing best practice and summarising the future of dementia care. The efficacy of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors remains controversial due to uncertainty over what change is considered clinically significant. Any derived benefit seems to be independent of dementia severity and donepezil is the most cost-effective for Alzheimer's dementia. Memantine potentially influences the underlying pathological processes in Alzheimer's disease and may be more effective in moderate to severe Alzheimer's dementia. The role of combination therapy remains uncertain. Future therapies are aimed at modulating the disease process by using chemical agents to inhibit amyloid and tau deposition. None have been approved clinically. Current pharmacological therapy for Alzheimer's dementia is very limited and primarily aims at achieving symptom control. A major limitation is our lack of knowledge of the underlying pathology and it is only by better understanding the disease process that we can optimize therapeutic agents that modify disease progression.

This implies a systemic approach by of the team, rather than a segmental working mode. Thus change is necessary in the work culture of the teams, and from the State Regions Conference November 13 2014, has emerged the need to share, among all stakeholders, good practices and the development of Clinical Management Tools so that standards of care can be defined to ensure quality, together with the measurement of Processes and Outcomes.","1313":"Prejudice and stigma about mental illness is still present in society. Patients suffer both from the disease, and from the marginalization behavior exhibited by others towards them and their families. Psychiatric professionals may also become ill and suffer for the same reason. The authors of this international multicenter study have set themselves the question of whether there may be prejudice and\/or stigma among psychiatric professionals towards their suffering colleagues, among patients towards nursing staff affected by the same disease and between patients themselves. Using two standardized questionnaires which have been tested, but have not been used before they have studied 207 mental health professionals and 407 patients, of Italian, Belgian, Hungarian and Croatian nationalities. The results show that there are in fact prejudices among Mental Health Professionals about colleagues suffering from mental illness because they responded that such persons cannot treat well patients with their own pathology. However Mental Health Professionals do not demonstrate behaviors which are not frankly marginalizing or stigmatizing towards colleagues suffering from mental illness. On the other hand, among patients the prevailing view was that psychiatric professionals who suffer from mental illness, can better understand the sick, because they are also suffering. This is in analogy with the Jungian theory of the \"wounded healer\" in the myth of the centaur Chiron. Patients did not demonstate rejection or marginalization behavior towards other sick patients. Finally both the professionals and the patients tend to be cautious in relating to healthy persons and tend not to disclose their suffering for fear of being misjudged or marginalized.","1314":"In the context of health care in Belgium, the psychological or psychiatric opinion of a multidisciplinary team is required in the assessment of bariatric surgery candidates. In clinical practice, a wide variety of liaison psychiatry assessment methods exist. On the basis of a post-operative psychiatric comorbidity case report and a literature review on \"liaison psychiatry and bariatric surgery\" we aim to identify opportunities for the systematization of bariatric pre-surgery psychiatric evaluation. The bariatric pre-surgery evaluation must be rigorous and founded on evidence-based medicine. On this basis, specific psychiatric criteria may be defined and researched in assessments. The issue remains for psychiatric comorbidities that develop after surgery and for which a preventive framework should be sustained in the liaison psychiatry approach. The aim of the research is to support an improved systematization of the psychological assessments of pre-operative bariatric surgery candidates. We believe that systematic evaluation tools should be defined for the identification of possible absolute or relative contra-indications and that a preventive approach to post-operative psychiatric disorders should be included in this assessment. ","1315":"Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) is becoming a more and more popular treatment method for patients suffering from anxiety disorders. One of the VRET methods, wchich could be used for this group of patients is MOTEK CAREN system, however, so far no studies have been published on its implementation in psychiatric disorders. Presented here is a case of a 45 year old woman suffering from anxiety disorders, who underwent a series of four subsequent trainings with the use of MOTEK CAREN system repeted once a week. Data from the system were collected on the work of muscles, joints, reactions of the ground, etc. Blood pressure, pulse and salivary cortisol level were measured before and after each training. The level of state and trait anxiety was each time measured with the STAI inventory. The changes of the values of heart rate, blood pressure and salivary cortisol suggest that all trainings we stressful events for the patients, as they were not observed in the control session. But the gradual decrease in the levels of salivary cortisol and axiety as state after subsequent trainings may be signs of a gradual adaptation of the patient to the stressful situation. A lower cadence during the trainings compared to the control session was observed, however the speed of the cadence increased with each session. Ttrainings with the MOTEK CAREN system can be promising in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Of course in order to draw more evidence based conclusions this observations must be confirmed on a larger sample of patients. ","1316":"For a long time, terms like \"mind\" and \"emotion\" have rarely been taken into account, not even mentioned in the medical texts. The latest scientific researches, including the studies of Candace Pert, on the contrary, have emphasized that the entire body thinks, because every single cell hears, and feels emotions. The international researcher has discovered the endocrines and a vast number of neuropeptides, that work as an \"information network\" that interconnects the entire body, the \"psychic\" molecules are transmitted and travel, communicating information as in a circular and recursive body - mind mechanism. This is a sort of body and mind functional identity, which is different in each person, because each person is a unique universe, and the body is the place where mind and body meet in a unique and unrepeatable alchemy. So, if it is true that only in the body the secret of its potential for development and transformation is well hidden, it is also true that this secret is unique for each of us. Then, the strategic therapy becomes 'tailor-made', and the knowledge of the body component is essential to unlock behavior patterns and planning new ones, in order to improve relationships and the quality of life, and enhance the sense of well-being. People are not as simple containers which merely record external incitements, on the contrary, they are able to evaluate and weigh what happens around. Depending on the meaning attributed to each stimulus, a stress response of different magnitude and duration is activated, this can be considered functional or dysfunctional. Many recent studies, in fact, states that there is a significant correlation between the coping strategy chosen and the onset of a disease. According to the theory of 'psychogenic tumor', for example, anyone can potentially develop cancer, but only those who do not have the psychological strength to resist disease get sick. No matter what is the theoretical framework and the conclusion adopted, we go towards a consensus of considering body and mind as a part of a unique and complex functional identity. As a consequence of this completely new approach on how to consider the wellbeing and health, researchers suggest that the goal of a satisfactory physical and mental balance can be achieved through a transversal approach to the various disciplines (psychotherapy, surgical, nutritionist, medical aesthetics and medicine in general). According to this bio-psycho-social approach, each person should be approached in his entirety, bodily and psychological; each individual should be 'hosted' in a sort of 'Body and Mind' zone, where the entire body is able to think.","1317":"Mental Health Services in Malta are presently at crossroads, because they are in the stage of increasing and strengthening the community services and considering closing the main psychiatric inpatient facility and replacing it with a new hospital.

Such studies are strongly recommended, and this approach has already been used in Malta a couple of years ago prior to establishing inpatient care for Eating Disorders. In absence of such studies, this paper proposes ways how to use findings from available research and data to use as basis for such proper service plans.","1318":"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with marked impairments in familial, social, and professional functioning. Although stimulant treatments can be effective in adult ADHD, some patients will respond poorly or not at all to medication. Previous studies demonstrated that cognitive behavioural therapy- (CBT) and dialectical behavior therapy- (DBT) oriented interventions are effective in reducing the burden of the disease, which is mainly marked by depression, interpersonal difficulties, low self-esteem, and low quality of life. In order to determine the effectiveness of this intervention, we assessed the benefits of a CBT\/DBT programme to reduce residual symptoms and help patients improve their quality of life. 49 ADHD-patients, poor responders to medication, were enrolled in a one-year programme where they received individual therapy, associated with weekly sessions of group therapy with different modules: Mindfulness, Emotion Regulation, Interpersonal Effectiveness and Distress Tolerance, Impulsivity\/Hyperactivity and Attention. Each subject was assessed at baseline, at months 3 and 6, and at the end of the treatment for ADHD severity (ASRS v1.1), depression severity (BDI-II), hopelessness (BHS), mindfulness skills (KIMS), anger expression and control (STAXI), impulsivity (BIS-11), quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF), and social functioning (QFS). The 49 ADHD patients were compared with 13 ADHD subjects on a waiting list. Linear mixed models were used to measure response to treatment. Overall, the psychotherapeutic treatment was associated with significant improvements in almost all dimensions. The most significant changes were observed for BDI-II (b=-0.30; p&lt;0.0001), ASRS total score (b=-0.16; p&lt;0.0001), and KIMS AwA (b=0.21; p&lt;0.0001), with moderate to large effect sizes. Compared with the waiting list controls, ADHD patients showed a better, albeit non-significant, pattern of response. Individual and structured psycho-educational DBT\/CBT groups support existing data suggesting that a structured psychotherapeutic approach is useful for patients who respond partially or not at all to drug therapy.

For number of patients these treatment options lack efficacy or are not acceptable. There is need to improve our understanding of neurobiology of ADHD as well as explore other treatment options. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are safe and non-invasive investigative and therapeutic tools respectively.

The aim of this mini-review is to briefly summarize clinically relevant topics within the domain of later-life MDD. The mini-review presents an overview of epidemiology, complications of late life MDD, risk factors and clinical presentation, clinical assessment, general issues relevant to the treatment of the older adult with MDD, drug treatments, discussion of how medical complexity affects drug treatment and other treatment modalities. The mini-review concludes with a short discussion of clinical and research implications. Treatment of depression in the geriatric population is a complex endeavor and clinicians often are faced with medical, social, and environmental issues which can impede the treatment process. Antidepressant drugs, particularly the SSRI and SNRI antidepressants are helpful, but dosing titration needs to be considered against the backdrop of comorbidity and concomitant medications. Psychotherapy and other approaches are additional avenues to consider in the older individuals with MDD. Future research in particular needs to address older people with more extensive medical complexity as well as the \"oldest-old\", individuals in their 80's and beyond.

From the '50s of the previous century we had a continuous increase of the Eating Disorders (Dalle Grave 2011). Indeed, in the National Program of the Prevention is stated that: \"The spread of the eating disorders is very fast and relevant; there is no other disease with the same propagation and that looks like a real social epidemic\" (The Ministry of Health 2010). At the same time, there was a reduction of the time of onset (Favaro et al. 2009) with cases of girls 8\/9 years old, before having their first period (Dalla Ragione 2012). This means that the pediatricians should pay more attention to the eating disorders because there is a big delay in the diagnosis that can have a negative impact on the therapy to apply and on the prognosis (American Academy of Pediatrics 2010). Overweight and eating disorders are the main problems of public health among adolescents and many works show a direct link between eating disorders and child obesity (Babio et al. 2009). In the case of children, the diagnosis is very complex, especially during the early adolescence (-12 years) due to the large heterogeneity of the somatic expressions that make difficult a precise nosographic study. Therefore, it is necessary that the pediatrician has a good knowledge about the eating disorders in order to identify them quickly and to start a multidisciplinary path and to promote an improvement in the long term.","1323":"In modern psychiatry, deinstitutionalization of mentally ill became an essential part of improving state of being of those affected. Integration in community, despite obvious benefits, led to increase in social distance and rejection towards mentally ill. Social stigma affects different life domains of those afflicted, and therefore it is crucial to introduce methods to deal with it. Our objective was to assess and compare psychiatrists' and public attitudes and beliefs about mentally ill people. Comparison of two samples, one including 107 psychiatrists and second including 708 individuals of the general population. Obtained outcomes were collated with similar studies available in literature. The psychiatrists' attitude was more positive in comparison to the general population. Both groups agree that programs raising public awareness are important, and should be intensified. 41% of general population and 13% of respondents from experts' group think of negative associations with mentally ill. Conception of utilizing mental health experts as the opinion leaders should be carefully thought through. Although awareness of social distance and stigma improved both among psychiatrists and general population since 2005 (Wciorka &amp; Wciorka 2006, Lauber 2004), still there are areas that needs enhancement. Fear present in both groups, probably caused by inter allia image of mental illness in news reports (Angermeyer 2001), is one of such areas. ","1324":"Concerns have recently been raised about a possible link between suicidal ideation and the use of SSRIs in teenagers diagnosed with unipolar depression, such that the USA FDA and UK CSM have issued warnings regarding the use of SSRIs in adolescents with depression. We investigated this phenomenon first by recognizing that the initial presentation of unipolar and bipolar depression may only differ in subtle ways and with the result being that a significant number of patients are misdiagnosed at the expense of patient outcomes. This is especially pertinent as patients with bipolar disorder have increased lifetime rates of suicide as compared with those patients with unipolar depression. The normal developmental trajectory of bipolar disorder often involves recurrent depressive episodes in early adolescence before the development of hypomanic\/manic episodes. Therefore, a misdiagnosis of bipolar disorder as unipolar depression in teenagers could explain the failure of SSRIs to adequately treat depressive episodes. A suboptimal response to SSRIs and so a lack of control of the depression is a risk factor for suicide. One reason for this suboptimal response is the markedly different neurotransmission involved in bipolar depression as compared to the neurotransmitter systems operated on by SSRIs. In bipolar disorder, dopamine is the principal neurotransmitter disrupted and we marshal structural, pharmacological and biochemical evidence to support this claim. One important strand of evidence involves polymorphisms in D1 and D2 dopamine receptors being implicated in the pathogenesis of bipolar affective disorder. Serotonin neurotransmission is affected by SSRIs, however the role of serotonin in bipolar disorder is much more ambiguous. The conclusion we arrive at is that the link between suicidality and SSRI use in adolescents diagnosed with unipolar depression may in fact be due to inappropriate treatment of misdiagnosed bipolar disorder that has yet to manifest with hypomanic\/manic symptoms.","1325":"The aim of this paper to describe what Transcultural Psychiatry is.

We tried to know if what we were led to observe by this adolescent could be explained by works and thoughts around the notion of substitute child. Building our thought on various theoretical approaches, including neurosciences, we tried to think the psychopathological signs of this patient by two ways. One is about the birth and the growth in the presence of depressed parents, and this since the pregnancy. The other one is about the necessity to deal with the traumatic story of the family, met by the parents, who are still facing it, that leads to the question of the transmission of the traumatism from the mother to the baby. Using the notion of maternal primary care, we proposed the term 'the child after', which appeared to us more able to represent the dynamic and the place really given to these children. This term could mean the question of an undone grief, a traumatism without temporality, and a relation between the mother and the child which seems to be uncertain because of the investment of the child as an impossible reparation of an unscarred loss.","1327":"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental trouble which prevents the child from socio-communicative interaction, and learning from his environment.

We conducted a search of the literature published on Medline between 2010 and 2015 related to intervention models provided to children with ASD aged less than 3 years. Data were extracted from systematic reviews and recent randomized controlled trials with moderate to high GRADE quality of evidence. Early intervention refers to brain plasticity theory. With the epidemiological studies of infant \"at risk\" there is an attempt to intervene earlier before full syndrome is present. Interventions tend to follow more on a developmental hierarchy of socio-communicative skills and to focus on the dyadic relation between the child and the caregivers to improve the core autistic symptoms. Over the last 6 years, there's been news and fine-tuned ways about early intervention, and more and more systematic evaluation. However, there are only few interventions which were evaluated in trial with a strong GRADE recommendation and all of them have methodological concerns. It is important to be cautious in recommendations for mental health politic, even if it is important to improve access to services for all children and their families, hence finance and design rigorous project in research.

In Belgium, policymakers have reorganize mental health care for children and adolescents in care circuits and care network that include and support intersectoral collaborations. They also support creation of mobile out-reach team for crisis and assertive care to help patient and their families in the least restrictive environment possible. Specific programs are developed for double diagnosis and disabled children but also juvenile offenders with psychiatric problems. The care network should also assure a rapid liaison function to the first line professionals.","1329":"This work presents the experience of an Emancipatory action research led at the Therapeutic Center for Adolescents (CThA) at Saint Luc's Clinics (UCL). This research focuses on the practice effects of \"Pixels\" and \"Passerelle\" workshops at CThA. It is about the use of video games as a therapeutic tool, mobilizing of the symptomatology of the teenager. \"Pixels\" workshops use playing according to three specific forms: the paper role-play game, the video game, and the cards playing game. Their specificity is that the participative adult shows a regressive ability strong enough to play with teenagers and is very careful to not interpret what takes place within. \"Passerelle\" workshops demonstrate the link between the teenager's mind and the use of his own virtual avatar. It allows to evolve from a \"play together\" to a \"talk together\", a moment of symbolization and of being able to stand back in regards to his or her own recreational activities.

","1330":"With the recent introduction of the Psychoactive Substances Bill in the United Kingdom, it is a useful time to retrospectively review the patterns of prevalence of the psychoactive products known as 'Legal Highs'. There has been emerging research and rapidly expanding political, public and media attention and awareness, yet comparatively little scientific discourse on the psychological aspects driving their consumption, beyond simply their legal status. This paper focuses on their usage patterns in the particularly vulnerable, but often-neglected period of young adulthood between the ages of 16-24, focussing on their prevalence, trends in pharmacology and psychological aspects of their usage and propensity for addiction. There is a greater skew of usage to young adulthood in legal highs than that seen in classical drugs of abuse. Although there are still significant research questions to be tackled, it is suggested that the interaction of legal high incentive value and their perception with aspects of enhanced risk taking in young adulthood, particularly impulsivity and sensation seeking, are of key significance, as opposed to any clear pharmacological mechanism for differing prevalence. While there is much further research to be performed on the contents and pharmacology of legal highs, the reasons for potentially lower levels of addiction are also discussed.","1331":"Gender differences in schizophrenia have been recognized for a long time and it has been widely accepted that sex steroid hormones, especially estradiol, are strongly attributed to this fact. Two hypotheses regarding estradiol action in psychoses gained special research attention - the estrogen protection hypothesis and hypoestrogenism hypothesis. A growing number of studies have shown benefits in augmenting antipsychotic treatment with estrogens or selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM). This review is focused on the role of selective estrogen receptor modulators in the treatment of schizophrenic patients. In order to achieve this result PubMed was searched using the following terms: schizophrenia, raloxifene, humans. We reviewed only randomized, placebo-controlled studies. Raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator was identified as useful to improve negative, positive, and general psychopathological symptoms, and also cognitive functions. All reviewed studies indicated improvement in at least one studied domain. Augmentation with raloxifene was found to be a beneficial treatment strategy for chronic schizophrenia both in female and male patients, however potential side effects (a small increase in the risk of venous thromboembolism and endometrial cancer) should be carefully considered. SERMs could be an effective augmentation strategy in the treatment of both men women with schizophrenia, although further research efforts are needed to study potential long-term side effects. ","1332":"Only few studies have compared the psychopathological features in first episode psychosis (FEP) and chronic schizophrenia (CS) patients. The aim of our study was to compare sociodemographic and clinical aspects of FEP and CS inpatients using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) in order to better characterize FEP. We did not find significant socio-demographic differences between the two groups apart from age and nationality. About PANSS we found that conceptual disorganization, poor rapport and lack of insight items scores were significantly higher in patients with FEP. Related to BPRS the items of somatic concerns, grandiosity and motor hyperactivity were significantly higher in the CS group; uncooperativeness was significantly higher in FEP group. Our study offers a characterization of FEP patients that confirms evidence and adds some information from the current literature. FEP patients seem to be more uncooperative with a worse interpersonal empathy and insight into the illness than CS patients; this could reduce their compliance with the treatment.","1333":"There are now many existing studies which assess the treatments available for 'at risk mental states', as patients who are believed to be in the prodromal phase of psychotic illness are referred to. However, concerns regarding side effects of possible treatments remain. We here conduct a meta-analysis of the studies available up to July 2016. The aim of this study is to decide what would be the best treatment for 'at high risk patients'. 18 studies were selected for inclusion; 12 showed significance, 5 did not and one tended towards significance. Both antipsychotic medication and psychological intervention show mixed results with cognitive behavioral therapy and olanzapine\/amisulpride coming out on top. Omega 3 poly-unsaturated acid also shows promising and consistent results. Treatments appear promising but a balance needs to be kept between adverse events and effectiveness of preventing psychosis. It is necessary to search further for treatments in order to identify effective treatments with fewer adverse side-effects in this phase of psychotic illness. ","1334":"The UK-based AESOP study conducted over a two-year period in three UK sites simultaneously (London, Nottingham, and Bristol), is the largest study to date to conduct a first contact case-control study of psychosis. The study found that rates of schizophrenia were markedly elevated in both African-Caribbean and Black African people, in both sexes and across all age groups. English language literature published up to 2016 was searched. The initial search included: PubMed, The Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. A second search was conducted using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and keywords. Studies selected for retrieval were assessed by two independent reviewers. The search yielded eight results, all of which supported the conclusion of an increased incidence of schizophrenia in Black African and Black Caribbean population in the AESOP study. England is a multicultural landscape; multiplicity of cultures makes diagnosis difficult. The lessons we must learn from the AESOP study is the need for transcultural training and the removal of blinding to ethnicity when a large epidemiological study is conducted - psychiatrists need to be cognisant of cultures and aware of the context of symptoms. ","1335":"Bipolar disorder (BD), also known as manic-depressive illness, is a condition characterized by unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, and the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. Bipolar disorder is known to be a chronic and disabling disease associated with higher incidence of obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemias, hypertension and tobacco use which all together are known risk factors for the development of Cardiovascular diseases. With this research we wish to collect evidence to show how Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) affect Patients with Bipolar disease, the burden it can have in patients lives, to understand how this problem has been assessed so far and present suggestions that may improve the health care of these patients. Our study is a literature based research. With our study we concluded that patients with BD are at higher risk of CVD and at an earlier age compared with the general population. Also, there is a lack of proper monitoring and consideration of the cardiovascular risk factors in patients with Bipolar disorder whether by primary care physicians or psychiatrists even though it plays a critical role in the general outcome of this patients and also leads to increase in mortality and morbidity rates.

Research has shown that the suicide risk increases during both rapid-cycling and mixed affective states in bipolar. This article reviews the recent research of patients with bipolar and mixed affective state and suicide risk and highlights the reasons and potential benefits of factoring the potential risks into the assessment for suicide risk.","1337":"BD-II has been consistently associated with cognitive dysfunction across a broad range of cognitive domains. Atypical antipsychotic drugs, or SGAs are effective antipsychotics in these diseases, often in combination with antidepressants and mood stabilizers. Data on the possible effect of antipsychotics on neuro-cognition are rare and conflicting. The main objective of our study was to assess the effectiveness and possible risks to cognitive function in a group of inpatients affected by BD-II. Forty-five inpatients with Bipolar II Disorder (DSM-5) were included in a two-year observational study. They were treated with sodium valproate as a mood stabiliser, atypical antipsychotics and SSRIs. The utilized SGA augmentation were quetiapine (n=13); aripiprazole (n=10); olanzapine (n=11); asenapine (n=11). All inpatients were administered some psychopathological scales and evaluated for neuropsychological variables (for example, attention, verbal memory domains, etc.). After two years of treatment with SGAs, there has been no significant reduction of previous levels. In particularly, quetiapine and asenapine groups showed a better performance in learning task, short-term task and recognition tasks, in accordance with previous studies. Our small observational study shown that atypical antipsychotics cause an improvement in symptoms in BD, and particularly BD II. In particular, they do not induce significant alterations in overall cognitive performance generally. On the contrary, some SGAs, such as quetiapine and asenapine, seem to demonstrate a not statistically significant mild improvement in cognition.","1338":"Very often clinicians meet great difficulties in making a correct diagnosis of mood disorders which they are assessing, above all when mixed states are present: this because the patients mainly focus on their own symptoms of depressive uneasiness; mixed symptoms can insidiously infiltrate into the mood and life of the patients causing a chronic and worsening clinical state. It is essential not to forget that the depression is only one phase of a broader bipolar mood disorder, and this has to be the illness to be treated by psychiatrists and, generally, by clinicians managing an appropriate polytherapy with mood-stabilisers and antidepressants.","1339":"Bipolar disorder is a chronic psychiatric disease with a high prevalence and is a major psychosocial and medical burden. The exact etiological pathways of bipolar disorder are not fully understood. Genetic factors are known to play an important role in the etiology of bipolar disorder. However, high rates of discordance among identical twins and a growing body of evidence that environmental factors such as early stress can influence the onset and course of psychiatric diseases underline the importance of additional etiological mechanisms of bipolar disorders. There has been little investigation about early trauma in bipolar disorder. The aim of this study was to review the literature on the association between early traumatic interactions like child neglect, mistreatment, abuse or early parental separation and the occurrence of bipolar disorder in adulthood or impact on the course of the disease. Studies investigating associations between child neglect, mistreatment, abuse or early parental separation and occurrence of bipolar disorder in adulthood or impact on the course of the disease were searched in the Pubmed database. More than 700 articles were sorted independently by two of the authors using predefined criteria. Only research articles, reviews and meta-analyses were selected for this review. 53 articles met the inclusion criteria. To date, four systematic reviews partially addressed our research question. Early trauma is more frequently found in the past of bipolar patients than in the general population. Studies support a harmful effect of childhood trauma on the course of bipolar disease, with more anxious, depressive or psychotic symptoms, an early age of onset and a worse prognosis. Early trauma is more often found in the past of bipolar adult patients than the general population and studies support a harmful effect of childhood trauma on the course of bipolar disease, with more anxious, depressive or psychotic symptoms, an early age of onset and a worse prognosis. In further studies attention should be paid to the age of trauma occurrence and the definition of trauma. The findings also support the importance of additional psychoanalytic oriented psychotherapy for the treatment of bipolar disorder.

Currently dominant approach separates physical and mental, primary and secondary healthcare. Objective of our study was to explore whether somatic comorbidities are associated with a poor HRQoL independently of some sociodemographic and clinical factors. Majority of studies have explored particular somatic and psychiatric illnesses. Therefore we decided to access the problem from the general perspective of the universe of somatic and mental illnesses in the large psychiatric institution. This nested cross-sectional study was done during May 2016 at Psychiatric hospital Sveti Ivan, Zagreb, Croatia on the sample of 506 patients diagnosed with psychiatric illnesses (ICD-10: F00-F99). Key outcome was the lowest 25% results on the SF-36 General health sub-scale, indicating the worst HRQoL. Predictors were all detected somatic illnesses. By multivariate logistic regression we controlled different sociodemographic, vital and clinical factors. After adjustment for different sociodemographic and clinical factors, three somatic comorbidities remained independently associated with the worst HRQoL: endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases (E00-E90), diseases of respiratory system (J00-J99) and diseases of musculoskeletal system and connective tissue (M00-M99) CONCLUSIONS: Somatic comorbidities in psychiatric patients are associated with the poor HRQoL independently of different sociodemographic, vital and clinical factors and they should be treated seriously and integrally with mental aspects of HRQoL. Early comorbidities detection and adequate pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatment, as well as the prevention of risk factors, may improve the quality of life and reduce morbidity and mortality of psychiatric patients. ","1346":"It has been shown that patients' attitudes towards long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIA) have the influence on the acceptance and use of this type of therapy. The aim of our study was to explore attitudes of patients because, according to our knowledge, there has been no similar research in Croatia thus far. Two questionnaires were given to the total of 100 patients, the first one to patients treated with LAIA (group 1) and the second one to patients treated with oral antipsychotics (group 2). Significantly more patients treated with LAIA find that good aspects of their medication outweigh the bad (p=0.014). Almost one third of patients treated with oral antipsychotics (n=16, 32%) quit taking medication when they feel better and 6 patients (12%) very often or often forget to take medication. Larger number of patients treated with LAIA feels much better since they have been taking their medication (group 1=82%, group 2=68%). Almost all patients treated with LAIA would recommend their therapy to other patients (92%), which is not the case with patients treated with oral antipsychotics (58%). 90% of patients decided to take LAIA because of suggestion given by their psychiatrists and 10% were persuaded by their psychiatrists. When given potential advantages of LAIA, 84% of patients said they found very positive the fact that they didn't have to think about taking their medication every day, 82% were fond of LAIA's simplicity, 68% considered positive that their psychiatrists had better control over their treatment and 66% were very content with their recovery. The larger number of patients treated with LAIA is content with their therapy than patients treated with oral antipsychotics. Patients' attitudes have changed in a way that they don't find LAIA coercive anymore and most of them agreed to that type of therapy on a suggestion given by their psychiatrists. ","1347":"Despite many advantages of long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIA), this type of therapy is still underused in routine practice. Since psychiatrists' attitudes play an important role in prescription rate of LAIA, we found it valuable to examine their attitudes because, according to our knowledge, there hasn't been similar research in Croatia so far. In this research, we included the total of 48 psychiatrists. For research purposes, we created a questionnaire modeled on standardized questionnaire. Results are described with descriptive statistics and Likert scale was used to measure respondents' attitudes to statements. The number of years of their experience in practice is expressed with median of 13.50 years with minimal value of 1.00 and maximum value of 36.00 years. Most of psychiatrists find that LAIA play an important role in treatment of schizophrenia (n=44, 93.62%) and that they tend to prescribe that type of therapy (n=39, 81.25%). Almost all of psychiatrists (n=45, 93.75%) agree or strongly agree that it is easier to control patients' disease if they are treated with LAIA rather than with oral therapy and 32 of them (68.08%) think that doctor-patient relationship is more successful when patients are treated with LAIA than with oral antipsychotics. According to their experience (n=32, 68.08%) patients prefer to be treated with oral antipsychotics instead of LAIA. We expressed approximate percentage of their patients treated with LAIA with median of 20%, with minimum value of 0.00% and maximum value of 70.00%. According to the results of our research, attitudes of psychiatrists towards LAIA are mostly positive, but considering the fact that there is a small number of their patients who are treated with them, we emphasize that psychiatrists still prescribe oral antipsychotics much more often than LAIA. Despite positive attitudes of patients towards LAIA, majority of psychiatrists think that patients would rather choose oral therapy. ","1348":"While numerous studies have confirmed the efficacy of risperidone long-acting injectable (RLAI) on many clinical outcomes in patients with schizophrenia, there is no data regarding its influence on employment status. This was a 12-month observational study with flexible doses of RLAI on a Croatian population of patients with schizophrenia and other psychoses. Visits were at baseline and after 1, 3, 6 and 12 months of treatment. Treatment response was evaluated using Clinical Global Impression of Illness Severity (CGI-S) and Improvement (CGI-I) scales, while remission was defined by 8 items of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Employment status was determined at baseline and at study endpoint. A total of 362 patients were included, with a median age of 37 (interquartile range 29-47) years, 63.5 % were males and 67.4% were hospitalised at baseline. Overall 258 (71.3%) patients completed the study. Improvements in CGI-S scores from baseline were significant (p&lt;0.001) at all visits. Remission criteria were met in 9 (2.5%) patients at baseline, and in 199 (54.9%) at endpoint, while 144 patients (52.7%) achieved symptomatic remission. Female patients were five times more likely to achieve symptomatic remission (OR=5.2; 95%CI=2.64-10.19). At baseline, 74\/362 (20.4%) patients were employed, compared to 77\/257 (30.0%) at endpoint (p&lt;0.001). Adverse events were spontaneously reported in 55 (15.2%) patients. Three patients died (judged not to be related to RLAI) and one patient committed homicide. Patients treated with RLAI had significant improvements in CGI-S scale scores, hospitalization status, rates of remission and employment status, indicating the benefits of continuous treatment over time. Further studies on the comparative impact of different treatment strategies on functional recovery are needed. ","1349":"The aim of this study was to compare the bone mineral density (BMD) of male schizophrenia patients with those of healthy controls in order to determine the relationship between BMD and hormonal changes. The study sample included male outpatients between 18 and 55 years old, diagnosed with schizophrenia who had used prolactin-raising antipsychotics (n=23) and prolactin-sparing antipsychotics (n=19) for at least twelve months, along with an age - matched healthy control group. A socio-demographic form was administered, BMD and T-score measurements were performed with a DEXA test, and hormone levels were measured with commercial test kits. The prolactin levels of the prolactin-raising group (PRG) were significantly higher than those of the healthy control group (CG) and the prolactin-sparing group (PSG). While prolactin levels were normal in the CG, hyperprolactinemia was found in 15.8% (n=3) of patients in the PSG and 65.2% (n=15) of subjects in the PRG. Estradiol levels for the PRG and PSG were similar but significantly lower than those of the CG. There was a statistically significant difference between the PRG, PSG and CG in terms of their L1-4 total actual bone density and T-scores. BMD and T-scores were lower for the PRG in comparison with the PSG and CG, and were consistent with osteopenia. Although not observed for every tested region, a negative correlation was found between age, duration of therapy, duration of illness, and T-scores. A positive correlation was found between subjects BMI and T-scores. A consistent negative correlation was found between total testosterone and L1-4 total T-scores when corrected according to prolactin and estradiol. A linear regression analysis found significant relationships between age, BMI, duration of therapy, duration of illness, chlorpromazine equivalent dose, estradiol and testosterone affected T-scores for some regions. The long-term use of prolactin - raising antipsychotic medications as well as hyperprolactinemia and hypoestrogenism accelerate bone degradation. ","1350":"Over the last decades prolactin (PRL) has gained attention for its possible role in breast tumorigenesis. As all antipsychotics (although differences with respect to PRL elevation are large) have the propensity to induce hyperprolactinemia (HPRL), questions have arisen concerning the influence of PRL-elevating antipsychotic medications on breast cancer risk. A literature search (until January 2016), using the MEDLINE database, was conducted for English-language published clinical studies to identify and synthesize data of the current state of knowledge concerning the relationship between HPRL, breast cancer risk (factors) and antipsychotic medication. Results of human prospective studies evaluating the relationship between pre-diagnostic circulating PRL levels and breast cancer risk are limited, equivocal and only correlational. Associations between higher circulating PRL levels and other breast cancer risk factors than nulliparity and hormone therapies mostly have been negative for both pre-and postmenopausal women. Until today, no causal link between (chronic) administration of antipsychotics and breast tumorigenesis in humans has been demonstrated. Finally, several reports describe mechanisms of cancer protection with the PRL hormone as well as with antipsychotic medication. The role of PRL in breast carcinogenesis therefore remains unclear, unconfirmed, yet controversial. Antipsychotics should not be withhold for breast cancer prevention reasons to patients in need of this sometimes life-saving medication, even if classical breast cancer risk factors are present. ","1351":"The aim is to analyze how schizophrenia is pharmacologically treated in seven CEE countries: Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, Serbia, Slovakia and Slovenia. Psychiatrists from selected centers in each of participating countries were asked to complete a pre-defined questionnaire on their current clinical practice. Information on protocols and resource utilization in schizophrenia treatment was included and derived from randomly selected patient medical records. Expert opinions on country-wide treatment patterns were additionally sought. This sub-analysis focuses on pharmacological treatment patterns in the last six months and over the course of the disease. 961 patients' data show that during last six months the most commonly prescribed medications were oral atypical antipsychotics: olanzapine (n=268), clozapine (n=234) and risperidone (n=160). The most frequently prescribed atypical antipsychotics over course of disease were: risperidone (54.5%), olanzapine (52.4%) and clozapine (35.1%), along with haloperidol (39.3%). Experts reported risperidone (four countries) and olanzapine (three countries) as first-line treatment, with the same two medications prescribed as second-line treatment. Clozapine was the most reported medication for refractory patients. Approximately 22% of patients received polypharmacy with antipsychotics in at least one period over the disease course. Mean time since diagnosis was 13.1 years and on average 4.8 treatment courses received during that period. Anxiolytics (70%), antidepressants (42%), mood-stabilizers (27%) were also prescribed, with diazepam (35.4%), sertraline (10.5%), valproic acid (17.5%) the most commonly reported, respectively, in each group. The most frequently reported treatment change was switch from one oral atypical antipsychotic to another (51%). Oral atypical antipsychotics, mostly older drugs (risperidone, olanzapine, clozapine), were most commonly prescribed for schizophrenia treatment in participating countries. Given that results are from the first large-scale analysis of RWD, we believe these findings can be a benchmark for future real-world studies, which could contribute to the optimization of treatment for this debilitating disease. ","1352":"New determinants of quality of life in schizophrenia need to be identified. As sensory gating deficit is core impairment in schizophrenia, the present study hypothesized that sensory gating deficit is a determinant of impaired quality of life in schizophrenia. This study therefore investigated the relationship between sensory gating deficit and quality of life in patients with schizophrenia after adjusting for key confounding factors. Sensory gating was assessed with the auditory event-related potential method by measuring P50 amplitude changes in a double-click conditioning-testing procedure, perceptual impairments related to sensory gating deficit was assessed with the SGI questionnaire and quality of life was assessed with the SQoL 18 questionnaire in 39 patients with schizophrenia. Patients with sensory gating deficit (n=14) had a lower subjective quality of life on the psychological well-being dimension evaluated with SQoL 18 questionnaire (p=0.008) compared to those without it (n=25). This result remained significant (B=-0.45, Wald=4.84, p=0.02) after taking into account 7 potential confounding factors (gender, age, level of education, duration of disorder, positive symptoms, depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms). Poorer psychological well-being was related to a higher score on the SGI (rho=-0.40, p=0.01), in particular on the Distractibility dimension (rho=-0.47, p=0.001). These findings suggest that sensory gating deficit may be a determinant of impaired quality of life in schizophrenia. Further studies are needed to address the causal relationship between sensory gating deficit, perceptual impairments, attentional deficit and impaired quality of life in schizophrenia in order to act more efficiently on the quality of life of patients with this disorder. ","1353":"In obese individuals impaired sleep and neuroendocrine alterations such as melatonin deficits are associated with circadian rhythm disruption, altered circadian clock gene expression, and bright light at night. While the relation of pineal gland volume (PGV) and melatonin levels has recently been documented in humans, surprisingly little is known about the possible interference of the PGV and the pathophysiology of obesity in humans. We therefore compared the PGV of obese with non-obese individuals; both groups were matched by age and gender. Volumetric analyses were performed on the basis of 3 Tesla high resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We found, that the PGV was significantly smaller in obese individuals than in lean controls (P=0.036). Moreover, PGV and waist-hip ratio showed a significant negative association in controls (P=0.018, rs=-0.602) whereas no association of both variables was found in obese individuals (P=0.856, rs=-0.051). Thus, the current pilot investigation suggests that pineal gland function, reflected by PGV might be involved in the energy homeostasis and pathophysiological mechanisms that contribute to the development and the maintenance of obesity in humans. Moreover, our data supports the notion that the replacement of melatonin deficits might be a novel strategy in the treatment of obesity. ","1354":"Maternal deprivation (MD) in rodents is an important neurodevelopmental model for studying a variety of behavioral changes which closely resemble the symptoms of schizophrenia in humans. To determine whether early-life stress leads to changes in the limbic system structures: the amygdala and the nucleus accumbens, 9-day-old Wistar rats were exposed to 24 hour MD. On P60 the rats were sacrificed for morphometric analysis and their brains were compared to the control group. Results show that MD affected important limbic system structures: the amygdala and the nucleus accumbens, whose volume was decreased (17% of the control value for the amygdala and 9% of the control value for the nucleus accumbens ), as well as the number of neurons (41% of the control value for the amygdala and 43% of the control value for the nucleus accumbens ) and the size of their cells soma (12% of the control value for the amygdala and 33% of the control value for the nucleus accumbens ). This study indicates that early stress in life leads to changes in the morphology of the limbic areas of the brain, most probably due to the loss of neurons during postnatal development, and it further contributes to our understanding of the effects of maternal deprivation on brain development. ","1355":"One of the most serious problems faced by researchers studying eating disorders is denial of illness in individuals with anorexia nervosa. Importantly, the term \"denial\" not only has different meanings, but in the case of anorexia nervosa its very nature still remains obscure. It is not even known whether it is deliberate or unintentional. Denial of illness in anorexic patients has serious consequences for evaluation of the reliability of information obtained from those individuals. Indeed, the most frequently used screening questionnaires, such as the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT) (Garner &amp; Garfinkel 1979) and the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI) (Garner et al. 1983), may not reflect the psychological state of the subjects due to distorted responses. The objective of this review article is to elucidate, at least in part, the nature of denial of illness in anorexic individuals and, importantly, to present methods for direct or indirect measurement of this variable. The authors emphasize the detrimental effect of denial of illness on the quality of information obtained from the patients and the notorious unreliability of self-report data. The final part of the paper contains suggestions as to methods of bypassing the pitfalls associated with the influence of denial of illness on the results of studies involving anorexic individuals; for instance, it is recommended that one should build an honest and trustful relationship with the patient. Last but not least, the focus is placed on the potential of experimental psychology, which offers tools producing robust data, resistant to deliberate distortion by patients.","1356":"","1357":"","1358":"Young people and nursing students are prone to stress and psychological consequences of it.

Sociodemographic data were also collected. All SCL-90-R subscales negatively correlated with religiosity showing that the strength of religiosity was associated with better mental health of nursing students. Twenty two percent of potential cases of mental disorder were detected based on the GSI cut-off score. Religiosity was a significant predictor of mental disorder in logistic regression based on the GSI. The year of the study and quality of family relations were associated with students' religiosity. Gender, socioeconomic status and parents' education were associated with higher psychopathology scores. Religiosity showed to be important factor of resilience for nursing students.

The sample consisted of 38 consecutive patients admitted to the Day Hospital treatment of PTSD during one year observation period. The average age of the sample was 46.03 years. The patients completed 3 self-report measures upon admission to the hospital and upon discharge: The Mississippi scale for combat-related PTSD (M-PTSD), The Crown-Crisp experiential index (CCEI), and The COPE inventory. There was no significant change in the severity of clinical manifestations of PTSD, general neuroticism and coping mechanisms among the whole sample. However, compared to married participants and participants with children, single participants and those without children reported higher levels of anxiety when admitted to the hospital, but lower levels at discharge. In addition, patients without children reduced their avoidance behavior during the treatment. This preliminary study showed that single patients and those without children may benefit more from the day hospital treatment program.

In the observed period (2012-2014), 4568 patients were treated with anti-dementia medications, of which 1275 (32%) with donepezil, and 2753 (68%) with memantine. According to HALMED, the utilization of those medications is constantly increasing, and has increased manifold from 2005 to 2014. The estimate of the proportion of treated patients with dementia aged 60 years and over is around 9.2%. The number of dementia-related hospital stays is also increasing, and has increased by 9.6% in the last 5-year period, compared to the preceding 5-year period. The number of outpatient examinations in Clinical Hospital \"Sveti Duh\" grew from 351 in 2007 to 1151 in 2015 (January 1(st) - October 26(th)). The strain this condition exerts on the healthcare system is increasing yearly. In spite of the large increase in the medication utilization over the previous years, the proportion of treated patients is still small, and further increase in their use is to be expected. It is necessary to monitor this in the years ahead. ","1362":"The research objective was to identify overstated emotional characteristics in armed conflict veterans as well as both the similarities and differences in personality profiles between patients suffering from acute and chronic forms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Our study's sample consisted of 60 participants in the armed conflict in Kosovo that lasted from 28 February, 1998 until 11 June, 1999. All of them were diagnosed with PTSD, during the six months period after their return from active duty. In 2014 we retested the same subjects to see their current psychological state. Diagnoses of PTSD were made using Structure Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I), while the assessment of emotional characteristics was made using Plutchik's emotion profile index (PIE). We established no statistically significant difference in PIE profiles between both groups in recent re-testing. The only significant difference as per PIE classification was found earlier when the subjects were initially diagnosed. The amplified emotional dimension was exploration, and only the group of chronic PTSD patients displayed significantly higher values (p&lt;0.05). Emotional profiles, as a whole, proved to be very similar amongst subjects with both acute and chronic form of the PTSD. The only noted difference is in the significantly higher values of exploration emotional dimension, but only at the time when they were first given initial diagnosis, and only in the group of subjects who later developed the chronic form of PTSD which can indicate that exploration is a factor of vulnerability which is important in chronicity.

However, it is unclear whether these infections are related to the disease or whether they affect the symptom pattern. We investigated the presence of four herpes viruses (EBV, CMV, HSV-1 and HSV-2) in first-episode schizophrenia patients and compared seropositive with seronegative patients and healthy volunteers to reveal the etiological role of viral agents on schizophrenia symptoms. Ninety-two first-episode patients who met the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for schizophreniform disorder were included the study, along with 88 healthy volunteers. The presence of the four herpes viruses was investigated with serological methods (ELISA) in both groups. Positive and negative symptoms were evaluated with Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS). There was no difference between the patient and control groups in terms of seropositivity of the four viruses. We found that SANS scores of HSV-1 and CMV seropositive schizophrenia patients were significantly higher than the scores of patients with seronegative schizophrenia. No difference was found in SAPS scores. The results suggest a role of HSV and CMV infections in negative symptoms. This supports the hypothesis that viruses do not directly give rise to schizophrenia, but patients who were previously been infected with these viral agents may be prone to schizophrenia, and some of the symptom patterns may be related to different agents.

While 115 patients with schizophrenia were invited to participate, 100 of them completed the study and were subdivided into two groups. In addition to pharmacotherapy, the experimental group only (N=50) was integrated into a day-hospital-based psychosocial day care programme. The instruments were applied in three phases: the first measurement for experimental group subjects took place on the first day of psychosocial day-care programme, while for the control group subjects the same was performed on the last day of inpatient care. The second measurement for the experimental group was performed in the end of psychosocial day-care programme, while for the control group patients it occurred four months after inpatient treatment. The third measurement was carried out six months after the second one. The following instruments were applied: General Demographic Questionnaire at the first measurement, Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life-MANSA both at the first and third measurement, and Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale-PANSS at all three measurements. Experimental group patients showed a statistically significant increase in quality of life outcomes as well as statistically significant decrease in positive symptoms and general psychopathology at all three measurements and with regard to the control group. As to the negative symptoms, only the third measurement revealed a statistically significant difference. The results obtained indicate that the adjuvant treatment of psychosocial day care programme has a positive effect on treatment outcomes: on the increase of the patients' quality of life, and, to some extent, on the decrease of symptom intensity in positive symptoms in schizophrenia spectrum. However, the effect of psychosocial day-care programme on the negative symptoms was proved to be considerably smaller.

The sub-study presented here was part of a larger project to characterize the burden of schizophrenia on healthcare systems and on individuals living with the disease in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). This sub-study aimed to assess and analyze the impact of schizophrenia on many aspects of the lives of patients and caregivers. Psychiatrists from selected centers in seven Central and Eastern European countries were asked to complete a questionnaire in order to collect information about the disease history, characteristics, treatment protocols and resources used for each randomly selected patient. All data were statistically analyzed and compared between countries. Data from 961 patients with schizophrenia (mean age 40.7 years, 45.1% female) were included in the analysis. The mean number of days spent in hospital per patient per year across all seven countries was 25.3 days. Hospitalization occurred on average once per year, with psychiatrist visits 9.4 times per year. Of the patients in the study, 61% were single, 12% divorced and 22% married or cohabiting. Almost 84% were living with relatives or a partner; only 17% lived alone and, on average, 25% of patients received support from social workers. Relatives provided care for approximately 60% of patients and 4% of them had to stop working in order to do so. Twenty-nine percent of the patients were unemployed, and 56% received a disability pension or were retired, with only 19% in full-time employment or education. Schizophrenia has a significant effect on the lives of patients and caregivers and impacts their social integration.

The three main areas which we shall discuss here are: 1) cyberspace as provider of health information and self-help resources, since the anonymity cyberspace provides is particularly important in the highly stigmatized field of psychiatry where a large number of people never seek professional help, which in turn negatively affects not only the person in question, but the family and ultimately the society (work efficiency, disability-adjusted life year - DALY, etc.), 2) cyberspace and virtual reality (VR) as cause of psychopathology, starting from violent behaviour, to addictive behaviour and other, 3) and finally cyberspace and VR as providers of efficient professional therapy in the field of psychiatry. ","1372":"","1373":"","1374":"The prevalence of cigarette smoking in patients with different psychiatric disorders is higher than that in the general population, which is partly explained by the pro-cognitive effect of smoking on cognitive functions. In subjects with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), the prevalence of smokers is lower than that in other psychiatric disorders. We hypothesized that cigarette smoking does not provide benefits and even worsen cognitive performance in OCD. We compared different executive function subdomains in 20 smoking and 20 non-smoking inpatients with OCD. At the beginning of hospitalization, we assessed visuo-spatial working memory, planning and set-shifting abilities (Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery), smoking habits (standardized personal interviews), and the severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms (Dimensional Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale). The performance of smokers and non-smokers did not differ significantly in any cognitive subdomain. The smoking duration was significantly associated with poorer visuo-spatial working memory performance (P=0.001). Our results showed that cigarette smoking did not provide cognitive enhancement across various executive function subdomains in subjects with OCD. The lack of beneficial cognitive effects of smoking may make these subjects less prone to smoking and may partially explain the lower rate of smokers in OCD compared with other psychiatric conditions. ","1375":"Suicide is a major health concern worldwide, although suicide rates widely differ among different countries and cultures. Transcultural studies suggest that national anthems reflect national attitudes towards self-harming behaviour as well. Our aim was to analyse the linguistic characteristics of six national anthems, and compare these results with national suicide rates. Word use assessment and content analysis of six national anthems were performed. In the anthems of countries with similar historical or cultural background, similar linguistic patterns were found in word use and in content. Anthems of countries with lower suicide rates tend to contain relatively more positive contents, emotions and intentions, while in the anthems of countries with higher suicide rates more ambivalence, denial, loss or even aggressive and self-destructive implications were found. This transcultural analysis strengthens previous data that anthems could be indicators for national attitudes toward self-harm. ","1376":"The aim of this study was to determine the size of personal space among war veterans with PTSD, compared to healthy individuals, and to examine its associations with some sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Participants were 83 male war veterans with chronic PTSD and 85 healthy male employees of the medical institutions. Preferred interpersonal distances were assessed by using a stop-distance technique, where male and female research assistants approached the participants from four directions (front, behind, left, right). The patients filled out The Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (M-PTSD). War veterans with PTSD preferred significantly larger interpersonal distances compared to healthy participants. Larger personal space size was preferred by those who had children, and the largest preferred distances were observed for the approaches from behind. Both samples preferred larger distances when approached by a male person. The findings of this study contribute to increased understanding of the personal space in patients with PTSD, and may be implemented into prevention of aggressive behavior during psychiatric treatment, and into development of more effective therapeutic strategies. ","1377":"During the Croatian War of Independence, 1991-1995, Croatian soldiers were exposed to traumatic and stressful events. Certain number of soldiers who took part in the war, developed depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Stress is one of the etiological factors in the development of myofascial pain (MPS), although the mechanism of these processes is not entirely understood. The aims of this study were to determine the frequency of myofascial pain among Croatian war veterans with depression and PTSD, association between MPS and severity of depression, to describe the most common locations of trigger points in the region of head and neck, and to find out if there is any association in frequency between MPS and endotracheal intubation. A total of 101 Croatian war veterans suffering from PTSD and depression participated in the current study. Diagnosis of myofascial pain was based on detailed anamnestic history and careful clinical examination. Our findings showed a high rate of myofascial pain among Croatian war veterans, with occipital region and right temporal region as the most common places of trigger points. Higher severity of depression was accompanied by a higher percentage of subjects with MPS. Finally, there was no significant association between endotracheal intubation and development of MPS among the war veterans. It can be concluded that the rate of myofascial pain among Croatian war veterans is high and therefore it must be considered in patients with depression and PTSD. Moreover, the severity of depressive symptomatology seems to be related to the presence of myofascial pain.

Pituitary gland volumes were found to be statistically significantly smaller in the patients with OCD compared to healthy control subjects at the beginning of the study. We found that pituitary volumes significantly increased throughout twelve weeks of treatment.

Thus, genetic variations in the end effector of HPA - glucocorticoid receptor gene and relationships to stressful life events (SLE) may be connected to a higher risk of illness. The aim of the study was examining the association between glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) polymorphisms and risk factors among stressful life events in AN patients. This study comprised 256 patients with AN and 167 control subjects. The questionnaires examining brief history of the mother's pregnancy and long-acting stress factors, as well as life events checklist to assess stressful life events during the 6 months prior to hospitalization were used.

PLA2 and protein S100 concentration were assessed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). PLA2 concentrations were higher in patients with schizophrenia, whereas protein S100 concentrations were not. Higher concentrations of PLA2 were positively correlated with the duration of illness and number of episodes, as determined by multivariate analysis. PLA2 might be considered a possible biochemical trait marker for schizophrenia. Further research with larger and more homogeneous clinical samples is required.

At baseline, all patients answered the following questionnaires: Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI-A), The Multidimensional Coping Inventory (COPE) and General questionnaire (age, gender, education, employment, marital status). After six weeks all the participants were re-tested with 2 questionnaires: SWLS and PWI-A. Six weeks after the initial testing there was a statistically significant difference in satisfaction with life between patients with acute and chronic urticaria. Patients with acute urticaria were more satisfied with their lives than patients with chronic urticaria. Also, there was a statistically significant difference in the use of emotion-focused coping, seeking social support for emotional reasons and seeking social support for instrumental reasons. Patients with acute urticaria used emotion-focused coping and sought social support for emotional and instrumental reasons to a greater degree than patients with chronic urticaria.

Cognitive behavioral therapy has also been demonstrated to be effective in SAD. This review article aims to focus on the psychopharmacological treatment options for SAD. According to clinical trial results, first line treatment options seem to be sertraline and fluoxetine, and are well tolerated by the patients. There is some evidence that other antidepressants (e.g. bupropion) might be effective as well. Although clinical trials have shown that some of these antidepressants may be of benefit, a recent review has concluded that there is not enough evidence to support the use of any of these agents for the treatment of SAD yet. Moreover, more studies are still needed to evaluate the effectiveness of other treatment options, e.g., propranolol, melatonin, hypericum, etc. In addition to the above proposed treatments, patients with seasonal depressive symptoms should thoroughly be evaluated for any cues of bipolarity, and their treatment should be planned accordingly.

The study was limited to the articles published in English in the period from 2007 to 2014. The list of references includes additional articles that were searched manually. The utilization of different psychotropic medications is prevalent among older adults worldwide, regardless of whether they live in nursing homes or in the community. Among older adults, nursing home residents are the most vulnerable individuals for potentially inappropriate drug prescription. The most common potentially inappropriate prescribed medications in the elderly are benzodiazepines, particularly long-acting, antipsychotics and antidepressants, particularly SSRIs. All classes of listed medications have been associated with different adverse events, particularly falls and falls-related fractures and increased risk for mortality. Many different pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, such as monitoring polypharmacy, reviewing medications, spending more time in the institution by a physician, reducing the number of prescribers in the institution as well as greater involvement of geriatricians, general practitioners and pharmacists should be implemented to reduce this health issue. The prevalence of prescribing psychotropic medications to older adults is high. Inappropriate prescribing of psychotropic drugs and polypharmacy are present in institutionalized and non-institutionalized older adults and can cause adverse health events, and can significantly reduce the quality of life of these vulnerable groups. Multidisciplinary approach is needed in addressing widespread problem of prevalence of psychotropic medications in older adults.

AD is a progressive and degenerative brain disease with an onset characterized by episodic memory impairments, although progressive deficits can be observed in several domains including language, executive functions, attention and working memory. The relationship between cognitive impairments and the topography and progression of brain neuropathology is well established. The pathophysiologic mechanisms and processes that underline the course of cognitive and clinical decline have been the theoretical support for the development of pharmacological treatments for AD. Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists are the main drugs used in the management of global cognitive impairment and several studies also explore the effects of both in specific cognitive measures. Recent research trends also examine the effects of combination therapy using both compounds.

Sixty patients (60) diagnosed with conversion disorder according to DSM-IV-TR and 60 healthy volunteers were included in the study. All participants' temperament and character traits were determined using Cloninger's Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI). Patients with conversion disorder were divided into two subgroups using the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES), dissociative (n=30, 50%) and non-dissociative (n=30, 50%). The two conversion disorder subgroups were compared with the control group in terms of temperament and character traits. Correlation analysis was also performed between TCI and DES scores in the entire conversion group. Novelty seeking (NS) scores were lower in both the dissociative and non-dissociative groups compared to the control group. Harm avoidance (HA) scores were higher in the dissociative group than in the control group. Reward dependence (RD) scores were lower in the dissociative group than in the non-dissociative and control group. Self-directedness (SD) scores were lower in the dissociative group than in the control group. Self-transcendence (ST) scores were higher in the dissociative group than in the non-dissociative group. DES scores were negatively correlated with RD and SD scores in the entire conversion group and positively correlated with ST scores. Low NS temperament traits may be associated with conversion disorder. High HA and low RD temperament traits and low SD and high ST character traits may be associated with pathological dissociation in patients with conversion disorder.

We used logistic regression models to assess the relationship between metabolic syndrome and antipsychotic therapy, gender and age. Metabolic syndrome was found in 52.1% of all subjects. Compared to first generation antipsychotics polypharmacy, the monopharmacy with clozapine was associated with elevated rates of metabolic syndrome (28.6% vs. 70.4%, p=0.004). With regard to particular parameters of metabolic syndrome, the elevated plasma triglycerides were significantly more present in subjects within Clozapine group (p=0.03). Logistic regression analysis showed that female gender (p=0.004), and clozapine treatment (p=0.005) were significantly associated with metabolic syndrome. Compared to polypharmacy with first generation antipsychotics, the higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome is found in patients treated with Clozapine alone. The most prevalent metabolic disorder is dyslipidemia. ","1411":"Decision making (DM) consists of a number of complex processes involving higher-order cognitive functions involved in outcome evaluation. Problems in DM may have significant negative repercussions on community functioning. We hypothesise in individuals with schizophrenia difficulties in community functioning will be associated with DM problems. DM performance was assessed using the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) in 30 individuals with schizophrenia and 32 healthy controls. Participants' choices on the IGT were grouped as: Ambiguous Decisions, where the outcome is uncertain and cannot be predicted (i.e. IGT initial phase), and Risky Decisions, where the outcome can be predicted with an error margin (i.e. IGT final phase). People with schizophrenia were also assessed with measures of community functioning and symptoms. Controls outperformed individuals with schizophrenia in risky decisions. In patients, levels of community functioning positively correlated with DM performance. Symptomatology was not associated with DM proficiency or functioning. DM impairment may represent an important contributor to poor functional outcomes in people with schizophrenia. Interventions targeting decision making and higher order cognitive problems in people with schizophrenia may have a greater impact on functional difficulties. ","1412":"Effective pharmacological treatment with a favorable side-effect profile increases treatment adherence and is therefore very important for patients with schizophrenia. Psychiatrists need easy to use and reliable assessments instruments to evaluate treatment effectiveness in their patients. A group of European leading psychiatrists have proposed a framework for the assessment of treatment effectiveness in patients with schizophrenia - the ASSESS battery (The ASseSsment of EffectivenesS in Schizophrenia Battery) which evaluates the effectiveness of treatment during both the remission and the relapse periods. ASSESS includes: 10 items of Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS), Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS), Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ), and Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP). The battery assesses five domains: symptomatic remission and retention of treatment, affective symptoms, cognitive functioning, treatment satisfaction and personal and social functioning. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the applicability of ASSESS in real world practice. The variations of the PANSS items rated during the study indicate a significant improvement of psychopathology. A similar improvement was observed in cognition, social functioning and treatment satisfaction as shown by BACS, PSP and MSQ scales. Cognitive impairment, personal and social functioning, and treatment satisfaction were correlated with the remission or augmentation of positive symptoms. This pilot study revealed that ASSESS is easy to apply in clinical practice and is a suitable tool for psychiatrists since it covers all the relevant aspects of the course of schizophrenia in a compact form. ","1413":"Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP) Framework has enjoyed enormous popularity in the field of applied psychology. NLP has been used in business, education, law, medicine and psychotherapy to identify people's patterns and alter their responses to stimuli, so they are better able to regulate their environment and themselves. NLP looks at achieving goals, creating stable relationships, eliminating barriers such as fears and phobias, building self-confidence, and self-esteem, and achieving peak performance. Neuro Linguistic Psychotherapy (NLPt) encompasses NLP as framework and set of interventions in the treatment of individuals with different psychological and\/or social problems. We aimed systematically to analyse the available data regarding the effectiveness of Neuro Linguistic Psychotherapy (NLPt). The present work is a meta-analysis of studies, observational or randomized controlled trials, for evaluating the efficacy of Neuro Linguistic Programming in individuals with different psychological and\/or social problems. The databases searched to identify studies in English and German language: CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library; PubMed; ISI Web of Knowledge (include results also from Medline and the Web of Science); PsycINFO (including PsycARTICLES); Psyndex; Deutschsprachige Diplomarbeiten der Psychologie (database of theses in Psychology in German language), Social SciSearch; National library of health and two NLP-specific research databases: one from the NLP Community (http:\/\/www.nlp.de\/cgi-bin\/research\/nlprdb.cgi?action=res_entries) and one from the NLP Group (http:\/\/www.nlpgrup.com\/bilimselarastirmalar\/bilimsel-arastirmalar-4.html#Zweig154). From a total number of 425 studies, 350 were removed and considered not relevant based on the title and abstract. Included, in the final analysis, are 12 studies with numbers of participants ranging between 12 and 115 subjects. The vast majority of studies were prospective observational. The actual paper represents the first meta-analysis evaluating the effectiveness of NLP therapy for individuals with social\/psychological problems. The overall meta-analysis found that the NLP therapy may add an overall standardized mean difference of 0.54 with a confidence interval of CI=[0.20; 0.88]. Neuro-Linguistic Psychotherapy as a psychotherapeutic modality grounded in theoretical frameworks, methodologies and interventions scientifically developed, including models developed by NLP, shows results that can hold its ground in comparison with other psychotherapeutic methods. ","1414":"The pathophysiology of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is controversial. There is growing evidence of altered pain perception in people engaging in NSSI. Some hypotheses have been made on addictive aspects of this behavior. Pain and addictive behavior are modulated by the opioid system, which makes the endogenous opioids one of the candidate neurotransmitters related to NSSI. This article explains the theoretical background on NSSI as an addictive behavior, endogenous opioids involvement and pain perception changes in NSSI and updates the latest findings in this field. The main aim of this paper is a comprehensive review of published studies on pain perception in NSSI and an evaluation of the impact of NSSI functions and other psychological elements on pain perception measures. We have reviewed six studies of pain perception in participants with NSSI compared with controls. The participants of these studies were not mentally disabled or autistic and did not have a diagnosed personality disorder. The reviewed studies have demonstrated a higher pain threshold and longer pain tolerance or endurance in five of six studies. Emotional dysregulation was significantly associated with all pain perception variables in one study. Neuroticism, self-criticism and painful and provocative experiences revealed correlated with pain endurance or pain tolerance. No correlation between pain perception measures and dissociation, hopelessness or locus of control was found. Pain perception was altered in participants with NSSI. Pain perception was associated to emotional dysregulation, self-criticism, neuroticism and painful and provocative experiences. Because of the small number of studies reviewed, results should be seen as guidelines for further studies. They should be replicated on a bigger sample of studies. Further research should focus on pain perception measures in participants with NSSI and an excluded personality disorder. ","1415":"Due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) great aggressiveness, many worldwide health associations began to globalize research efforts in order to find a suitable treatment and to clarify once and for all its controversial aetiology. Moreover, the animal modelling research is one of the best tools to evaluate molecular mechanisms and to correlate them with clinical features and behaviours. However, in order to provide valuable scientific data correlated to low error sources, a rigorous algorithm of selecting the proper animal model for testing is required. An ideal animal model for AD research has probably not yet been developed, but by a careful selection of the existent models or even by developing new models suitable to research conditions, consistent progress in this area of research can be achieved. This paper aims to show and centralize some of the valuable information gathered along the past years of failure and success in Alzheimer's disease animal modelling, in order to provide a theoretical ground for new and innovative aspects in this rather new area of research. ","1416":"Alzheimer's disease is increasing to epidemic levels with an estimated 36 million people affected worldwide (Wimo 2010). The aetiology of the disease is not known, which is hindering the progression of the treatment. This study is a longitudinal investigation into the performance of TgTauP301L mice as an animal model of Alzheimer's disease on the computer automated touchscreen 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT). TgTauP301L mice have a single tau mutation in the P301L gene and develop the tau pathology that represents the observed tauopathy in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The aim of the investigation is to observe if tau pathology in the TgTauP301L mice causes a cognitive impairment in attention and executive function and at what stage this can be identified by the 5-CSRTT task. This will establish if the animals can be used as a therapeutic model for pre-clinical drug trials and help to identify an early indicator and intervention point in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The animals have previously been studied at 5-months and no differences between performances of the TgTauP301L mice and wild type mice were found (unpublished data). This study measured the performance of the animals at 7-months which is when the tauopathy begins to develop in TgTauP301L mice (Murakami 2005). The results of this study showed that there was no deficit in the performance of the TgTauP301L compared to the wild type mice and there had been no change in the animals' performance compared to at 5-months. The animals will be retested at 12-months once the pathology has extensively spread to see if the tauopathy causes a deficit in performance.","1417":"There are a number of cognitive models of autism that aim to explain how mental processes are handled differently in the condition. These models make claims about the nature of cognitive function in people with autism, and suggest that these differences applied in social contexts lead to the characteristic behavioural patterns. However, it is difficult to study these cognitive differences directly because of the complexity of social situations. Studies of perceptual function are tempting as an alternative way to study cognition because it is far easier to control the conditions and the stimuli that participants are exposed to. This makes hypothesis generation and interpretation of results more objective and more convincing. However, the study of perception in autism hasn't been very productive in contributing towards a model of cognition in autism. In many areas there are studies reporting contradictory results, preventing arrival at a consensus about the largest unresolved issues in the area. These studies tend to be repeated multiple times, but continue to provide contradictory evidence that doesn't allow us to place confidence in any of the cognitive models. An approach to these issues is proposed, focusing on critical analysis of contradictory studies rather than the endless process of repetition. This allows previous studies to be interpreted more objectively and resolve conflicts, and guides the design of future studies in ways that avoid the pitfalls that have been identified. Both of these outcomes result in more productive work being done. The first example is in the study of motion perception in autism, where the use of non-identical stimuli has been problematic. On closer critical analysis, a fundamental aspect of the motion stimuli demonstrates that the contradictions might be expected based on the differences in stimuli used. Addressing this issue can move the field towards resolution. A second example is in the study of spatial frequency sensitivity. Here, poor study design has created results leading to an \"eagle-eyed visual acuity\" hypothesis of autism. Errors in the initial study are revealed, suggesting that the model should be abandoned. Finally, a general issue is the assumption of homogeneity of perceptual ability and genetics in autism, where the reality is that subgroups exist within the population of people with autism, and significant variation exists between them. The evidence for this is summarised and the issues that it creates explored.

She was supported according to the biopsychosocial model of care i.e. An antidepressant (Sertraline), 1:1 psychology and alternative housing away from precipitating and perpetuating stressors.

Our search included different type of journals to have access on different views (medical, psychological, epidemiologic). The teen mothers are more at risk for postnatal depression, school dropout and bad socioeconomic status. The babies and children are more at risk for prematurity and low birthweight and later for developmental delays and behavior disorders.

Cynicism, lack of energy and decreased efficacy may lead to the occurrence of severe depression. These phenomena influence almost every aspect of affected person's life, both professional and extraprofessional, and decrease its quality. The aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of family life and other factors on levels of work engagement and risk of depression. Our study was conducted on a group of 417 physicians from Poland, Serbia and Bulgaria using a paper questionnaire. The collected data was subjected to statistical analyses using Statsoft Statistica v. 10.0 software. There was no significant correlation between work engagement and sex or age. The highest score on work engagement was in Serbia (m=4.41; Mann-Whitney's U test with p&lt;0.05). The highest score of BDI was in Bulgaria (m=14.73; Mann-Whitney's U test with p&lt;0.05). There was no significant correlation exceeding r=0.5 between UWES and SWING scales. WHI+\/WHI- ratio correlates significantly with a BDI scale (Spearman's r=-0.49; p&lt;0.05). Family life of physicians seem to have minor or even no influence on their work engagement and risk of burnout. The negative influence of work on family life may increase the risk of depression, and that effect is not susceptible to either positive or negative interactions of family life with work.

Many of these patients are often treated with second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics (SGAs), which are associated with weight gain, dyslipidaemia, and other metabolic derangements. The most important and first line of treatment for the metabolic syndrome is lifestyle changes including diet and exercise. However, other approaches like the use of medication (e.g. Metformin) have been also used, mainly when the lifestyle changes are difficult to achieve. Therefore, the treatment of antipsychotic-induced weight gain with metformin may be an option after the lifestyle and dietary changes fail. The use of metformin is still experimental and off license regarding the treatment of metabolic syndrome in Psychiatric patients, however we wished to assess the evidence for its use. Our study is a literature based research. For our research we reviewed 12 Pubmed published articles from 2006 to 2013. Metformin have been reported to counteract effectively antipsychotic-induced body weight gain and has been demonstrated to improve glycaemic control and promote a moderate weight loss in both diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. Metformin use appears to be a benefit when started early in the course of treatment and mostly in young adults newly exposed to antipsychotic drugs.

Petals provides counselling for women and couples who have suffered perinatal bereavement, or trauma during pregnancy or birth. This paper attempts to evaluate the effect of counseling interventions at this difficult time. Outcomes were recorded in 107 patients using the CORE (Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation) system. CORE was developed to assess the effectiveness of psychological therapies. CORE-OM (CORE Outcome Measure) involves a questionnaire that assesses subjective well-being, symptoms\/problems, function, and risk to self and others. The CORE-OM questionnaire was completed before and after the counselling sessions. The CORE-OM scores were summated into a global representation of severity. Severity decreased in all patients. Symptoms of psychological pathology were also decreased in all cases. Offering a free specialised counselling for parents suffering perinatal loss seems to be associated with an improvement in psychological outcomes. It is possible that it is more effective among a clinical population. However, we are uncertain of the natural history of the psychological problems this group of clients are experiencing. Having a control group would show how much of any natural improvement is due to the therapy; conversely, it is possible that without intervention these problems worsen with time, so a control group could actually amplify the effect.

There is a need to refocus on trainee centred teaching principles. Current training scheme started in 2007 as run-through programme spanning six years. Till 2005, examinations decided the progression of trainees through the training scheme with development of Work Place Based Assessments. Following Tooke's report, training was uncoupled and examinations regained importance in deciding the progress of trainees to higher training. EWTD, budget cuts, service priorities lead to a sense of lack of importance among trainees. Surveys focussing on clinical supervision pointed to the inadequacy and poor quality of supervision. Training has lost trainee centeredness. It is important to make the training maximally effective to deliver safer services.

Statistics of deaths, especially in the case of COPD, are underestimated because morbidity and mortality can be affected by other comorbid conditions, for example cardiovascular disease. Asthma and COPD impair not only physical functioning of patients but also affect their psychological state. Mood disorders and cognitive function impairment are more often observed in this group than in the general population. It has been proven that the coexistence of psychological dysfunction significantly worsens the functioning of patients (affects, among others, their work, family and social lives) and has an impact on the course of the treatment of the somatic illness. First of all, patients with cognitive deficits have greater problems in applying treatment recommendations. Accordingly, it seems to be important to pay more attention to the problem of mental disorders in patients with obstructive lung diseases.

The article presents a case of rapid-onset agranulocytosis in a 60-year old clozapine-resistant patient, in whom lamotrigine was introduced as potentiation strategy. Discontinuation of both substances and GCSF treatment resulted in normalization of the absolute neutrophil count. The case suggests a possibility of developing rapid-onset agranulocytosis in clozapine-resistant patients who require lamotrigine as augmentation strategy. This emphasises the significance of monitoring a patient's blood count and early management of any dyscrasias noticed.

The objective of this study was to examine whether anxiety symptoms correlate with impulsivity in patients with panic disorder. We examined 21 psychotropic drug-naove patients with panic disorder recruited from the outpatient setting. The severity of Panic Disorder was assessed with Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (PAS)-clinical rating version. Impulsivity was evaluated with Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, 11th version (BIS-11). Our findings indicate the correlation between specific dimensions of impulsivity and selected subscales of Panic and Agoraphobia Scale. The positive correlation between attentional and non-planning dimensions of impulsivity, 'disability' and 'worries about health' in drug-naove patients with PD was observed. The findings corroborate with the prior reports of higher impulsivity trait among patients with anxiety disorders. ","1437":"Anxiety symptoms and disorders are common. High comorbidity between anxiety and other psychiatric disorders has been observed in community. Still, the relationship between impulsivity and anxiety disorders is controversial and not well explored. The aim of this paper is to review measures of trait impulsivity in anxiety disorders. A literature review of the theoretical bases of the relationship between anxiety disorders and impulsivity is presented. Impulsivity is a key feature of numerous psychiatric disorders. Traditional conceptualizations suggest that impulsivity might display a negative relationship with anxiety. However, an association of impulsivity in patients with anxiety disorders is present. Some studies support proposition that anxiety may influence impulsivity in individuals with predisposition toward behavioural disinhibition. There is a link between anxiety and impulsivity in psychiatric patients characterized by problems with impulse control (e.g. pathological gambling, self-harming behaviour, eating disorders), mood disorders and anxiety disorders. Behavioural and pharmacological interventions for decreasing impulsivity may effectively be used in the treatment.

Patients with BDD often first present, and are hence diagnosed, in cosmetic surgery settings. Several studies have investigated the prevalence rate of BDD in the general population or have done so for patients referring to cosmetic medical centers. To date, however, no review has been undertaken to compare the prevalence in the general community versus in a cosmetic surgery setting. Despite the lack of such a review it is a commonly held belief that BDD is more common in patients seeking cosmetic surgery. The current study aims to review the available literature in order to investigate whether BDD is indeed more prevalent in patients requesting cosmetic surgery, and if that is the case, to provide possible reasons for the difference in prevalence. In addition this review provides evidence on the effectiveness of cosmetic surgery as a treatment of BDD.

It has a structure related to tricyclic antidepressants but it has a different mechanism of action, i.e. binding to sigma1 and to sigma2 sites. It has been regarded as an effective drug in general anxiety disorders together with other agents like SSRI`s, SNRI`s, buspirone and pregabalin for many years. It can however also be indicated in other conditions, e.g. it may be used as a premedication in the evening prior to surgery, positive results are also observed in psychopharmacological treatment with opipramol in somatoform disorders, symptoms of depression can be significantly reduced in the climacteric syndrome. The latest data from literature present also certain dangers and side effects, which may result due to opipramol administration.

A reaudit of 62 discharge summaries was carried out by the same team after three years in the same catchment area but the practice has changed to inpatient and community. Improvement in most of the areas audited occur in the reaudit which indicates the usefulness of audit in improving clinical practice which a pivotal part of clinical governance. This completed audit cycle has proven that clinical practice has been reviewed and methods of improving it have been implemented. It has been noted that more items were reviewed and added to the second cycle which should be condoned.

It was inputted on Excel data sheet and was analysed. 44 psychiatrists responded. All respondents agreed that reason for referral is essential. Concise description of the condition, risks and current medication were rated as essential in more than 90%. Past medical history, past psychiatric history and current physical health were essential in 79%. All professionals involved should participate in evaluating and refining communication. Psychiatrists' opinion in GPs letters is paramount as they are the recipients and their assessments and future management plan should be geared to address the GP's concerns. This is shown clearly by the psychiatrists agreeing that reason for referral should be included in all letters, followed by what the GP has already done and what risks the patient presents. Improving communication between health professionals, improves patient's care, saves time and money, and in addition prevents duplication of investigation and procedures. ","1443":"The use of antipsychotic therapy has been proven to have an association with the incidence of diabetes mellitus. The use of atypical antipsychotics is shown to have a higher association, in contrast with typical antipsychotics. Olanzapine and Clozapine appear to have the highest rates of diabetes mellitus incidence, due to their tendency to affect glucose metabolism compared with other antipsychotic drugs. In this research the main goal is to understand which antipsychotic drugs are the most diabetogenic and to show the mechanisms involved in the glucose metabolism dysregulations with special focus on Olanzapine considering it is a very commonly prescribed and used drug especially among patients with schizophrenia. Our study is a literature based research. For our research we reviewed 41 Pubmed published articles from 2005 to 2015. According to most of the literature, from all the antipsychotics, Clozapine followed by Olanzapine appear to be the atypical neuroleptics that most relate to metabolic syndrome and Diabetes. The basis for this metabolic dysregulations appears to be multifactorial in origin and a result of the drugs, environment and genes interaction. ","1444":"Acute leukaemia and bone marrow transplantation (BMT) as a method of its treatment are great psychological stressors, which are responsible for anxiety and depression in the group of patients. The aim of the study was to assess the patients' mental state and its psychophysical predictors before and after BMT. The study was of a longitudinal and self-descriptive character. The questionnaires: LOT-R, AIS, Mini-Mac, CECS, RSCL and HADS were filled by 60 patients with acute leukaemia before and after BMT. There were no essential statistical differences between the severity of anxiety and depression before and after BMT but the pattern and the power of various mental state predictors changed in the course of the hospitalization. Anxiety before transplantation was greater when the psychological stress and the strategy of \"anxious preoccupation\" were stronger and the strategy of \"fighting spirit\" and the level of generalized optimism were weaker. The factors explained 51% variations of anxiety before transplantation. After BMT 77% variations of anxiety were explained, which were associated with a high level of distress at the end of the hospitalization, higher level of anxiety before transplantation, weaker strategy of \"fighting spirit\" before transplantation and stronger strategy of \"anxious preoccupation\" after BMT. Before transplantation 36% variations of depression were explained and estimated as weaker \"fighting spirit\" and worse \"global life quality\". The essential predictors of depressive symptoms after transplantation, explained by 81% variations of depression, were weaker \"fighting spirit\" before transplantation, stronger \"anxious preoccupation\" after transplantation, worse \"global life quality\" after transplantation and higher level of anxious and depressive symptoms on admission to hospital. The psychological and pharmacological interventions, which reduce anxiety, depression and \"anxious preoccupation\" as well as enhance \"fighting spirit\", should be introduced before BMT to improve the patients' mental state. ","1445":"Conversion (dissociative) disorder is a psychiatric disorder in which somatic symptoms or deficits are present in the absence of a definable organic cause. The etiology of this disorder is not yet fully understood. The most characteristic presentations are: pseudosensory syndromes, pseudoseizures, psychogenic movement disorders and pseudoparalysis. Psychogenic speech disorder is a rare form of conversion (dissociative) disorder. The aim of present case study is to complete the knowledge on this subject. The article presents a case of a fifty year old woman who developed psychogenic disorder of speech after being degraded to a lower position at work. After excluding organic background of observed symptoms, the diagnosis of conversion (dissociative) disorder was stated and adequate therapy was implemented, within the capabilities of the Ward. Partial remission of presented symptoms was achieved as a result of psychopharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Before stating the diagnosis of conversion (dissociative) disorder, possible somatic causes of the observed symptoms should be excluded. Special attention should be drawn to the importance of studying the psychological and family context of this case and the patient's difficulty to understand and accept that produced symptoms might be triggered by a psychogenic factor.

This audit aims to examine if we are achieving the standards set by the local CCG and to identify areas to improve the quality of the service.We also aimed to assess information as to how many patients referred had dementia. If they had a dementia suitable for possible anti-dementia medication (such as dementia of Alzheimer's type, Alzheimer's mixed type or atypical or Lewy body\/ Parkinson's dementia) to ascertain if they were being offered anti-dementia medication. Retrospective analysis of 60 patients from the memory service were analysed. The first 10 patients referred in alternative months were selected for inclusion. Standards were based on targets set by the CCG in terms of time needed to assess, diagnose, communicate diagnosis to the GP and give post diagnostic advice. Patients in this memory service were being seen 37 days (on average) after referral. Most patients received a diagnosis at their initial assessment but some needed further investigation to establish the diagnosis or the specific type of diagnosis. The time for letters to be typed did not meet standards and letters were sent out on average 23 days after patients were being seen. Post diagnostic advice was delivered to most who received a diagnosis. Our service is offering timely diagnosis to those referred to the memory service in line with national guidelines. ","1447":"The problem of employment of people with intellectual disabilities is present in many countries. The literature on this topic draws attention to the fact that the improvement of the situation in this area is conditioned by changes in government policies, practices of employers and adequate preparation to undertake professional duties by persons with intellectual disabilities. The objective of this review was to explore the changes in vocational rehabilitation forms in Poland. As one of the ways to solve this problem since 1991 in Poland the so called Workshops of Vocational Therapy have been created. According to the regulations the Workshops were designed for adults with intellectual disabilities, aged over 16 years with a total incapacity of gaining an employment, for which occupational therapy was a form of social rehabilitation. The further step in this process was the establishment of Vocational Activation Centers, with which high hopes were associated. They were expected to be an intermediate link in the creation of career paths from rehabilitation forms ultimately to open labor market. In practice it turned out that the creation of these Centers in Poland has been too slow. This raised the necessity to change the attitude from the concept of matching the participant to work and to the new environment, which frequently ends as a trauma, to the concept of matching jobs to people. New initiatives and new rehabilitation programs are developed based on this attitude.

In Croatia, during and after the war many war veterans have been in treatment through TC and many of them still participate in it. Majority of them were diagnosed with PTSD diagnosis, but some of them also had other diagnosis, e.g. depression, paranoid delusion, etc. In this paper we describe principles of TC that we use in Croatia and we also try to find out which curative factors of TC are the most important for this population. We applied semistructured intervju based on Yalom book of practice and theory of psychotherapy to explore what factors do war veterans find the most important and relevant for their resilience and better coping with everyday issues. ","1449":"The aim of this paper is to describe neurofeedback (NFB) treatment in Autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) children. There is no specific cure for autism and therapeutic guidelines are directed to improve the quality of life of people with autism by reducing the symptoms and by increasing their functioning. Neurofeedback is a computerized method based on tracking electrical activity of the brain (EEG) and giving a feedback about it. The method has been developed in neurophysiological labs of scientific institutes in USA and has been used very successfully for over last 20 years. It has proven its efficacy in practise, but also in scientific and clinical research. During 2010 and 2011 neurofeedback treatment was administered to 10 children (N=10, 7 males and 3 females) age range 4 to 7 years which have been diagnosed as autistic spectrum disorder (highly functional) with an unspecific impairment of speech development and trouble communicating. An evaluation of treatment was done according to estimation of changes in functioning (parents, teachers and therapists' ratings and all other experts that were monitoring the child before, during and after the treatment) and tracking of changes in electrophysiology. The results have shown most changes in behaviour (less aggressive, more cooperation, better communication), attention span and sensory motor skills. According to the assessment of parents, teachers, therapists and other experts all children have accomplished a certain degree of improvement in the level of daily functioning. Our experiences in usage of neurofeedback in Autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) children confirmed previous data that this method can be applied to this category of patients.

Several studies have been popular to investigate the relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors, including the availability of and exposure to a substance, and shared and unique environments. The genetic influence on addiction has proved to be substantial, and heritabilities for most addictive disorders are moderate to high. In this work we evaluate the current status of data that analyzed genetic contribution in addictions. ","1451":"Telepsychiatry is a new method of medical care, using modern communication technologies and electronic informations. It consists of web pages, containing data about diseases and their treatment in the form of multimedia libraries with video- and audiobooks. This research concerns verification of knowledge and attitude to telepsychiatry amongst patients and psychiatrists. An anonymous survey was conducted amongst 105 psychiatrists aged 26-74, including 74 women and 31 men and 102 patients aged 21-79, including 61 women and 41 men. Research reveals that majority of patients never met with the concept of 'telepsychiatry' and do not know what it means. However, more than 50% of respondents answered positively to every question considering the utility of telepsychiatry. Furthermore according to 18% it is possible to replace eye-to-eye conversation by videoconferencing. Only 15% of doctors claim to have an extensive knowledge on telepsychiatry, and 10% do not know what it means. The vast majority of physicians perceive positive aspects of this method of medical care, but 63% would not want general insertion of telepsychiatry. Doctors are apprehensive of losing personal data and medical confidentiality, and of the necessity of legal changes as well. The obtained results allow us to conclude that Polish patients and doctors, regardless of their knowledge, age, gender or disease, perceive advantages of telepsychiatry. In connection with this, implementing this method into the Polish medical market makes sense and is in accordance with both patients' and doctors' opinion. Based on our research, we confirmed that there is a necessity of wider popularization of telepsychiatry in Polish therapeutics.

To date, there is no data available in Europe on training in sleep medicine for early career psychiatrists (ECP). To identify the availability of training in sleep medicine for psychiatric trainees across Europe and to establish how confident doctors feel in treating these conditions. European-wide survey carried out by the European Psychiatric Association (EPA)-Early Career Psychiatrists Committees. Representatives of ECPs from each participating European country filled in a questionnaire about availability of training in sleep medicine in their country. ECPs were also invited to fill out a questionnaire at the EPA congress in Nice in 2013. 55 participants from 27 European countries responded. Only 24% had sleep medicine training mandatorily included in their national training curriculum. A majority (60%) felt that the quality of the training they received was either average or below average. 88% felt either very or fairly confident in treating insomnia. However, when asked to select the correct management options for insomnia from a provided list of six, only 19% and 33% of respondents chose the two correct options. There is a clear gap between the level of confidence and the clinical judgements being made to treat insomnia among European ECPs. There is a definite need to improve the availability and structure of sleep medicine training for psychiatric trainees in Europe. ","1453":"It is estimated that around 75% of patients with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) are prescribed psychotropic medication during their treatment course, although this is not recommended as first line therapy. In the UK, there are no guidelines to advise which drug treatments to use in BPD, however, numerous, but mostly small scale studies, show evidence that different medications target specific core symptoms. We report a case of a 25 year old woman with BPD, who has received treatment with five different psychotropic medications. We go on to assess not only the efficacy of these treatments in this individual case, but also whether the use of these treatments is in line with best evidence according to currently available research. ","1454":"This study aimed to examine the relationship between some personality characteristics of patients diagnosed with psychotic disorders and the quality of their engagement in psychodynamic group psychotherapy. Given that previous research has shown that self-stigma is significantly negatively associated with the engagement of patients, the measure of self-stigma was used as a correlate of patients' motivation to participate in group psychotherapy. A total of 48 outpatients (52.1% women; mean age 35.30 years) attending group psychodynamic psychotherapy completed The Inventory of Personality Organization, The Pathological Narcissism Inventory, The Measure of Parental Style, The Relationship Questionnaire, and The Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness scale. The findings showed that patients with higher levels of self-stigma have unhealthy attachments styles, perceived their mothers' parental style as indifferent and achieved greater scores on narcissistic vulnerability scale. They are also are prone to primitive psychological defences, have poorly integrated identity, and achieved lower scores on reality testing dimension. Taking into account the limitations of this study, these findings may contribute to improved understanding of the quality of participation and engagement of psychotic patients in group psychotherapy, and may help to develop more effective therapeutic approaches. ","1455":"Routine Outcome Measures (ROM) are important tools, increasingly used to assess both patient progress and service-provider efficacy. The Health of the Nation Outcome Scales for Children and Adolescents (HoNOSCA) is a clinician- and patient-rated ROM which summarises a patient's global functioning within behaviour, impairment, symptoms and social domains. Recent literature suggests that consistent disparity exists between the patients' self-ratings and the clinicians' ratings on HoNOSCA. We analysed HoNOSCA data for our own adolescent inpatient unit and report similar findings. Studies have also shown significant differences in both physical and mental health outcomes based on the patient-clinician dynamic and effective communication. We thus investigated the predictive utility of the two HoNOSCA scores, and the disparity between them, with respect to other outcomes measures (CGAS, length of stay and improvement on HoNOSCA). HoNOSCA disparity scores were significantly associated with both patient- and clinician-rated HoNOSCA improvement scores. Moreover, higher admission HoNOSCA scores were associated with greater HoNOSCA improvement scores, for both patient and clinician ratings. We report admission and discharge HoNOSCA scores comparable to other child and adolescent psychiatric inpatient facilities.

The records of the total population of children and adolescents admitted into the psychatric hospital over a five year period were surveyed. Results showed that the characteristics and circumstances of children and adolescents with mental disorder and comorbid substance misuse in Malta are similar to those described in international studies. The survey emphasised the pressing need for further research into this sub group and also highlighted gaps in reliable data systems locally. ","1457":"The use of antipsychotics, especially second generation antipsychotics, represents the milestone treatment of \"first episode of psychosis\" (FEP). Although prodromal symptoms of psychosis have long been recognized, the clinical management of psychotic disorders conventionally begins at the first episode of frank psychosis, as it is well acknowledged that \"duration of untreated psychosis\" (DUP) is one of the main factor that negatively affects prognosis: a longer DUP is highly correlated to reduced response to treatment, poor clinical and social outcomes, and an overall worst prognosis. Long-acting injectable (LAI) formulations of antipsychotics have traditionally been used for those patients with psychosis with the most severe symptoms, poorest compliance, most hospitalizations and poorest outcomes; moreover it seems that psychiatrists tend to prescribe LAI at the latter stages of the disease. We retrospectively collected clinical and sociodemographic data regarding patients consecutively presenting with symptoms of FEP attending the Community Mental Health Service (CMHS) in Foggia from 1st June 2014 to 31st May 2015. We selected patients who attended the CMHS in Foggia with symptoms of FEP. Different scales were administered to assess symptoms severity, quality of life, side effects, adherence, and overall functionality. In our sample LAI treatment was found to be effective in treating symptoms associated to FEP, improved quality of life and it was associated with a clinically irrelevant incidence of extrapyramidal side effect. Considering that achieving a full symptoms remission in people affected by FEP is associated to better outcomes, and that DUP is associated to poor prognosis, LAIs could play an important role in improving overall recovery.

This endocrine disorder is often associated with psychiatric comorbidities. The most important include mood disorders, psychotic disorders, cognitive dysfunctions and anxiety disorders. The aim of this article was to review the prevalence, symptoms and consequences of psychiatric disorders in the course of Cushing's syndrome. We therefore performed a literature search using the following keywords: Cushing's syndrome and psychosis, Cushing's syndrome and mental disorders, Cushing's syndrome and depression, Cushing's syndrome and anxiety. The most prevalent psychiatric comorbidity of Cushing's syndrome is depression. Psychiatric manifestations can precede the onset of full-blown Cushing's syndrome and therefore be misdiagnosed. Despite the fact that treatment of the underlying endocrine disease in most cases alleviates psychiatric symptoms, the loss of brain volume persists. It is important to be alert to the symptoms of hypercortisolism in psychiatric patients to avoid misdiagnosis and enable them receiving adequate treatment. ","1460":"The origin and course of eating disorders and nutrition have a multifactorial etiology and should therefore take into consideration: psychological factors, evolutionary, biological and socio-cultural (Juli 2012). Among the psychological factors we will focus on violence (in any form) and in particular on the consequences that they have on women, which vary in severity. Recent studies show that women get sick more than men, both from depression and eating disorders, with a ratio of 2:1; this difference begins in adolescence and continues throughout the course of life (Niolu 2010). The cause of this difference remains unclear. Many studies agree that during adolescence girls have negative feelings more frequently and for a longer duration caused by stressful life events and difficult circumstances, such as abuse or violence. This results in an increased likelihood of developing a symptom that will be connected to eating disorders and\/or depression. As far as the role of food is concerned in eating disorders, it has a symbolic significance and offers emotional comfort. Eating means to incorporate and assimilate, and even in an ideal sense, the characteristics of the foods become part of the individual. Feelings that lead to binges with food are normally a result of feelings related to abuse or violence and lead to abnormal behavior which leads to binging and the final result being that the person is left feeling guilty and ashamed. Research confirms that 30% of patients who have been diagnosed with eating disorders, especially bulimia, have a history of sexual abuse during childhood. Ignoring the significance of this factor can result in the unleashing of this disease as the patient uses the disorder as his expressive theater (Mencarelli 2008). Factors that contribute to the possibility of developing an eating disorder are both the age of the patient at the time of the abuse and the duration of the abuse. The psychological effects that follow may include dissociative symptoms and symptoms of an Eating Disorder.

This unwell person is often the object of stigma because he is \"different\" from others, and he also can be margenalised by society. In this study we intend to assess whether these margenalising attitudes might be also present among mental health professionals who have presented psychic problems in a previous period of their life, against sick persons suffering of the same illness even if he is a mental health professional. Two questionnaires have been developed, one for professionals and another for the patients, with the aim of identifying these marginalising attitudes. We intend that this study shall be a multicenter, observational and international study, promoted by the Mental Health Dept. of Naples (ASL Naples 3 South, Italy). ","1463":"The capacity to work productively is a key component of health and emotional well-being. People who work in health care can be exposed to the fatigue of care. Compassion fatigue has been described as an occupational hazard specific to clinical work related severe emotional distress. In our study, we have evaluated compassion fatigue in a mental health group (47 psychiatric staff) and its relationship with inpatients (237 inpatients) affected by some psychiatric disorders. At baseline, the more significant data indicate a high percentage of Job Burnout and Compassion Fatigue in psychiatric nurses (respectively, 39.28%, 28.57%). Significant Compassion Fatigue percentage is present also in psychologist group (36.36%). Finally, in psychiatrists, the exposure to patients increased vicarious trauma (28.57%), but not job burnout. After a year of participation in Balint Groups, the psychiatric staff presented an overall reduction in total mean score in any administered scale (CBI: p&lt;0.0000045; sCFs: (Vicarious Trauma: p&lt;0.0288; Job Burnout: p&lt;0.000001)). Thus, compassion fatigue causes concern among mental health professionals, and Balint Groups may represent a therapeutic strategy to help health professionals to face difficulties in challenging work environments. ","1464":"Colloid cysts account for approximately 2% of primary brain tumours and the majority of cases are identified in the fourth and fifth decade. They are small, gelatinous neoplasms lined by a single layer of mucin-secreting columnar epithelium that are thought to arise from errors in folding of the primitive neuroepithelium. They develop in the rostral aspect of the third ventricle in the foramen of Monro in 99% of cases and despite their benign histology carry a poor prognosis, with a mortality greater than 10% in symptomatic cases. The location of colloid cysts within the ventricular system results in obstruction of the foramen of Monro as the cyst grows, disrupting the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and causing hydrocephalus. This is the mechanism behind the most common presenting symptoms of postural headache, nausea and vomiting - a clinical picture synonymous with hydrocephalus and intracranial pathology. In addition to these classical neurological symptoms, there is a high prevalence of psychiatric symptoms in the patient population, with symptoms ranging from anterograde amnesia to gustatory hallucination. These symptoms can occur with or without the presence of hydrocephalus, and are thought to be secondary to compression of connecting pathways between the mesocortices and subcortical limbic regions. These symptoms have been shown to be comparative in frequency to the classical symptoms, yet are rarely the reason for referral to a neurological or neurosurgical service for investigation. ","1465":"Cannabis is the most widely used illegal drug in European countries. In countries with repressive cannabis policies, prevalence is not lower than in those with tolerant laws. Repressive policies not only have uncertain benefits but they are also expensive. Economists tend to believe that good public policies minimize social costs; that is, they help to improve collective wellbeing at a lower cost. The paper draws on a review of international literature on cannabis legislative models around the world. After a description of some of the fundamental concepts of a market economy, several existing policy scenarios will be presented and analyzed from an economic perspective. Strength and weaknesses will be summarized for each alternative. In addition to consumption tolerance in countries such as the Netherlands, recent decriminalization of domestic markets in the Unites States and Uruguay present alternatives to reduce the negative impact of cannabis on society. Earlier initiation age and rise in consumption are unintended potential consequences of decriminalization that need to be addressed by public authorities when designing a liberalized cannabis policy environment. Price is a key variable that needs to be addressed to prevent a rise in consumption. Repressive cannabis policies are expensive and have limited impact on consumption. Consumption legalization significantly reduces expenses for repression and law enforcement, allowing for the allocation of more resources to other targets such as education and prevention. With legalization of supply along with consumption, repression and law enforcement costs are reduced even further. Moreover, a legal market would create employment and generate tax revenues that could be allocated to the prevention of increased consumption. Legalizing cannabis would not lead to a sudden rise in consumption, providing the duty imposed by the state kept the product at its current price. ","1466":"In this article we propose a model for caring for a group focusing on psychoeducation for stress management and learning relaxation designed for patients experiencing somatization and who were recruited during organic medicine consultations. We are developing an interest for this kind of group from a clinical and practical point of view and have sought to demonstrate the impact that this kind of care can have on health representations among these patients through using the MHLC (Multidimensional Health Locus of Control) questionnaire. Participants in the stress management and relaxation groups completed the questionnaire at the beginning of the first session and at the end of the second and last session. We collected 94 usable questionnaires between January 2008 and December 2014 and processed the data using Student's t-test on paired samples. The results tend to demonstrate that psychoeducation for stress management and relaxation reduces internality scores in patients with high scores and the opposite for patients whose internality scores are low. Our research protocol does not enable us to distinguish between the respective influences of the psychoeducation group and the relaxation group. The psychoeducation groups for stress management and relaxation have an impact on health representations in patients experiencing somatization who would not have spontaneously sought out psychiatric consultations. ","1467":"Teen suicide is a major public health problem. In the United States, it is the third cause of death among the 10-24 year olds. Adolescence involves numerous changes, whether physical, social, emotional or hormonal. At a neurobiological level, a teenager's nervous system is also affected and undergoes significant modifications. We conducted a systematic review of electronic literature published between January 1990 and August 2014 via MEDLINE, PubMED and PsychINFO to list articles concerning the risk of teen depression and suicide risks in adolescents as well as those relating to the adolescent's neuro-anatomical brain and the effect that puberty has on it. When analyzing the various studies, it is clear that all support the idea that adolescence is a special period, both at neuroanatomical and biological levels. The risk of impulsiveness and depression is explained, anatomically, by a faster maturation of the limbic system, and biologically, by a higher sensitivity of the serotoninergic system and to glucocorticoids, which themselves are influenced by the specific hormonal environment during this period. Moreover and above all, adolescence is a vulnerable time for many reasons: physical, hormonal, social, cognitive, and emotional changes, self-development, etc. We should not restrict it to structural neurological changes without taking into account the other factors or compartmentalize young people into a reductive model based on determinism. Adolescence is a time of change, transformation, and adaptation. The hormonal events that occur during this period have significant effects on brain development, neuro-cerebral chemistry, adolescent behavior and risks of depression. It is important to try to prevent suicide and depression in adolescents considering its entirety and complexity but also by paying attention to neuro-biological factors even if, at present, many research projects are currently underway to develop an appropriate drug therapy strategy. ","1468":"Teen suicide is an alarming public health issue. The purpose of this paper is to better understand the reasons behind attempting\/committing suicide. Our research focuses on adolescent psychopathology and on pathologies that are considered as adolescent suicide risk factors. We conducted literature-based research. The first part of this research was based on adolescent psychopathological traits, whilst the second concentrated on the most frequently made diagnoses in the case of adolescents who had attempted suicide. Adolescence is a period of life characterized by great instability, where everything is called into question. We can observe a high propensity towards taking action, which allows the adolescent to bypass certain questions that they cannot answer. This takes place against a background where the body, which is undergoing change, becomes the scene, the means and the purpose to answer these questions, once and for all, through suicide. Notwithstanding, the studies also show that, setting aside these psychopathological considerations that characterize every adolescent, certain diagnoses are commonly related to adolescent suicide and, as such, constitute risk factors. These pathologies are as follows: depression, adjustment disorder and personality disorder. We can, however, include some precisions as regards the frequency of these diagnoses, given that adolescence is inherently a period of life characterized by depression and that the future adult is obliged to adjust. Teen suicide is, therefore, conditioned by pathological behaviour, which is part of a necessary and normal transition, but one which is occasionally stimulated by certain pathological instabilities. ","1469":"The risk of suicide is one of the most important risk factors looked into for acute psychiatric assessments that influences the management plan. The prevalence of suicide is on a rise across European countries; as a consequence, the different countries have created specific guidelines and policies in order to prevent suicides in the acute settings. These guidelines are based on both different cultural aspects as well as the different organization of the mental health system in the different countries. This paper wants to present the comparison between the guidelines of two European countries, England and Italy, in order to evaluate the systems, understand differences and common contact points. The different European countries could learn one from the other and a European shared point of view may be a way forward to create better understanding and preventing the risk of suicide across the population.

Suicide gesture (SG) which refers to self-injurious behaviour with no intent to die, differs from NSB in a variety of important ways. The aim of this study was to investigate demographic and clinical characteristics of NSB and SG to examine whether self-injurers with intent to die differ significantly from self injurers without such intent. All admissions for NSB and SG to the Psychiatric Inpatient Unit of University \/ General Hospital Santa Maria della Misericordia, Perugia, Umbria, Italy, from January 2015 to June 2015 were included in a medical record review. Basic descriptive statistics and distributional properties of all variables were first examined. Bivariate analyses were performed using Chi-square tests for group comparisons and t-test for independent samples used when appropriated. The study sample included 38 patients. Of these 23 had committed NSB (13.1%), 15 had commetted SG (8.5%). Number of married NSB was significantly higher than the number of married SG (p=0.08). We found a significant difference between NSB and SG related to the item of impulse control that was poorer in SG than NSB (p=0.010). BPRS items of hostility (p=0.082), suspiciousness (p=0.042) and excitement (p=0.02) were found to be significantly higher in SG than NSB. Borderline personality disorder (p=0.032) and Passive-Aggressive personality disorder (p=0,082) diagnosed by the means of the SCID-II, were more represented in SG than NSB (p=0.044). Schizoid personality disorder was significantly related to NSB (p=0.042). No others significant differences were found. NSB and SG are different for many psychopathological characteristics. These results confirm the importance of classifying individuals on the basis of the intent to die. Additional research is needed to understand and elucidate psychopatological and clinical characteristics of the different categories of self-injurers to find risk factors specific to suicide attempts.

Furthermore suicide attempts present a frequency 4-10 times greater than the suicidal events, representing also one of the main risk factors to lead to recurrent attempts of suicide. In 2008 the Autonomous Province of Trento launched a suicide prevention pogram called \"Invitation to Life\" which includes various interventions intended to counter the phenomenon of suicide in the region. Actually the epidemiological research upon the phenomenon of suicide in Trentino region is one of the main pillars of the project: it represents a fundamental requirement to identify risk and protective factors in the population in order to adopt more specific and effective preventive strategies.

However, the neural bases of these deficits still remain unclear. Along with the task-related fMRI and EEG research tapping into the mirror neuron system, the characteristics of the resting state activity in the particular areas that encompass mirror neurons might be of interest as they obviously determine the baseline of the neuronal activity. Using resting state fMRI, we investigated resting state functional connectivity (FC) in four predefined brain structures, ROIs (inferior frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobule, premotor cortex and superior temporal gyrus), known for their mirror neurons activity, in 12 patients with first psychotic episode and 12 matched healthy individuals. As a specific hypothesis, based on the knowledge of the anatomical inputs of thalamus to all preselected ROIs, we have investigated the FC between thalamus and the ROIs. Of all ROIs included, seed-to-voxel connectivity analysis revealed significantly decreased FC only in left posterior superior temporal gyrus (STG) and the areas in visual cortex and cerebellum in patients as compared to controls. Using ROI-to-ROI analysis (thalamus and selected ROIs), we have found an increased FC of STG and bilateral thalamus whereas the FC of these areas was decreased in controls. Our results suggest that: (1) schizophrenia patients exhibit FC of STG which corresponds to the previously reported changes of superior temporal gyrus in schizophrenia and might contribute to the disturbances of specific functions, such as emotional processing or spatial awareness; (2) as the thalamus plays a pivotal role in the sensory gating, providing the filtering of the redundant stimulation, the observed hyperconnectivity between the thalami and the STGs in patients with schizophrenia might explain the sequential overload with sensory inputs that leads to the abnormal cognitive processing. ","1474":"Low compliance is one of the crucial problems of contemporary psychiatry. Relapses, deterioration of cognitive functioning, negative symptoms, neuroleptic resistance are the examples of many consequences of noncompliance in schizophrenia The study was designed to assess the compliance in the 200 patients diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, all in the state of symptomatic remission and on the stable neuroleptic treatment. The compliance was assessed using a telepsychiatric system, sending reminders: 1 hour before the planned dose to remind them that drug intake is approaching, and at the moment of intake to check if they took the drug. The confirmed drug intakes were counted by the telepsychiatric system. 158 patients completed the study period. The compliance in the first month of the treatment was 44.6% and decreased over the rest of the period to the level of 33.4%. 50% of the schizophrenic patients were compliant at a level lower than 37%. This group was considered the low compliance group, and in this group the compliance increased after 6 months from 9.3% to 10.3% (p&lt;0.0001). The compliance in the group of schizophrenic patients in remission is very low. The telemedicine system improves the compliance in the patients with the worst compliance. ","1475":null,"1476":"The gold standard pharmacological agents used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in adults are antipsychotics. Atypical or second-generation antipsychotics have superseded or used as alternatives to typical first-generation antipsychotics due to better tolerability and safety profile. However the efficacy and safety of these drugs are severely limited in pregnancy and\/or women of childbearing potential. There are very few guidelines to guide the clinical management of schizophrenia and\/or bipolar disorder in this subgroup. We aimed to review current evidence of atypical antipsychotics used in pregnancy where available, with considerations to its efficacy and safety to both the mother and fetus, in conjunction with the recently updated NICE guidelines. The latest NICE CG192 guidelines on antenatal and postnatal mental health, published in December 2014 was reviewed and summarized, and the BNF-approved list of atypical antipsychotics were identified. Clinically relevant MEDLINE-linked publications were searched and selected where available using the PubMed search engine to identify evidence for or against the use of atypical antipsychotics in pregnancy. NICE CG192 improved clarity on the prediction, support and holistic management of mental illness in pregnancy and puerperium; however there were no specific recommendations in terms of pharmacological agents used to treat schizophrenia and\/or bipolar disorder in this subgroup. Evidence from the literature on atypical antipsychotics yielded discordant results. Nonetheless, our report presents preliminary findings of certain antipsychotics which appear to be effective and safe in pregnancy. Future research would benefit from larger, prospective randomized controlled trials, and perhaps include newer atypical antipsychotics for consideration in this subgroup. ","1477":"Cognitive impairments have been extensively reported for patients suffering from schizophrenia but a lot of questions persist about these troubles. Several domains of cognitive functions are impaired which result in daily life difficulties. Many arguments tend to show that children suffering from psychotic spectrum disorders present cognitive impairments also but things are not clearly defined. The aim of this review is to compare the cognitive impairments of children suffering from psychotic symptoms and adults suffering from schizophrenia in order to improve the understanding of the two clinical affections. A better understanding of the disease is necessary to improve the health care which currently give poor results. Besides the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5) and the French reference books, the present research has been conducted using PubMed, Medline, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES and ScienceDirect. Literature about cognitive impairments of adults with schizophrenia and children with psychotic spectrum disorders is assessed and results are compared. Both children and adults suffer from cognitive impairments: language, memories, executive and motor functions and IQ are impaired. An important heterogeneity in the troubles has been observed and a poor knowledge in terms of onset time, evolution, intensity, impact on everyday life and therapeutic interest has been reported. Adults with schizophrenia and children suffering from psychotic spectrum disorders have similar cognitive impairments in many domains of cognition. The similarities in term of cognitive impairments highlighted in the present work should support new studies in order to adapt to children the current cognitive therapies which are mostly provided to adults. As the cognitive impairments are heterogeneous, each patient should receive a tailored neurocognitive exam which takes into account its abilities and weaknesses. ","1478":"Negative symptoms represent a separate symptom domain, with respect to depression, neurocognition, and social cognition and have a strong direct and indirect impact on real-life functioning. Furthermore, negative symptoms that do not improve following antipsychotic treatment are an important diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. We conducted a 12-month-study open-observational study to evaluate the efficacy of some atypical antipsychotics on negative symptoms, according to the following recommendations of Consensus Development Conference Attendees. In our study, we evaluated in an open-label study the efficacy of some second-generation antipsychotics (clozapine, quetiapine, olanzapine, aripiprazole, paliperidone) in 42 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (DSM-5 criteria) with 'persistent negative symptoms'. We used different rating scales (PANSS, CDSs, BNSS, BPRS), but mainly we focused on the new Brief Negative Symptoms Scale (BNSS) for negative symptoms. Our total data indicate an overall statistically significant reduction in all scales, although not clinically relevant.

The main objective of this study is to find out the prevalence of depression among patients attending a general psychiatric clinic, and study their sociodemographic and clinical features. Files of patients attending a private psychiatric clinic in Khartoum in the period June 2005-June 2010 were reviewed. Only those with a diagnosis of depression were chosen, sociodemographic date and clinical features were documented and results were shown below. Total numbers of patients with depression were 137 (11.4%). Females were more than males (56.2%), the majority are between ages 41-60 (40.9%), married (65%), (14.9%) had family history of psychiatric disorders and (52%) had a previous history of psychiatric treatment. Depressed mood is the commonest symptom (98.5%), loss of interest (91.9%), reduced energy (57%), guilt feelings (17.9%) and (35.8%) of our samples expressed suicidal ideations. The commonest type of somatic symptom is generalized aches and pain (30.7%), (18%) were psychotic. The present study is a retrospective descriptive study, based on a private psychiatric clinic sample. It provided a useful baseline for more comprehensive field based studies, to try to aid planning and development of services to meet the needs of the population. ","1481":"Psychotic depression is widely accepted as a specific subtype of unipolar major depression. Magnetic resonance imaging studies have begun to investigate the neurobiological changes that differentiate this subtype of major depression from non-psychotic depression. Any differences may eventually be useful in aiding diagnosis patients for whom there is diagnostic uncertainty. This review collates the currently available evidence. A systematic search of the Medline, PubMed, Embase &amp; Web of Science databases was used to identify all articles comparing structural grey matter or functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) differences between adults (18+) with previously diagnosed psychotic and nonpsychotic depression in predefined regions of interest (hippocampus, amygdala, cingulate, insula &amp; frontal cortices). The results were collated and organised according to brain region. There is a paucity of studies addressing structural and functional changes differentiating these two disorders and recommendations regarding use of these modalities in diagnosis cannot be made. From the available studies decreases in frontal cortex grey matter volumes may differentiate psychotic from non-psychotic depression whilst further studies are required to confirm decreases in insula cortex volumes. fMRI studies show associations between altered activity in these two regions and cognitive impairments in patients with psychotic depression. The volumes of putative emotional processing regions including the amygdala, hippocampus and anterior cingulate show no difference between psychotic and nonpsychotic depression. Structural and functional changes in the higher associative regions of the frontal and insular cortices appear to differentiate psychotic and nonpsychotic depression to a greater degree than changes in putative emotional processing regions. The quality of the evidence both in terms of numbers of studies available and sample sizes involved is very poor but in regard to directing future study, understanding the neurobiology of psychotic depression may benefit from a more detailed assessment of these two regions. ","1482":"Depression is a major contributor to healthcare costs and is projected to be the leading cause of disease burden in middle and higher income countries by the year 2030. Depression in later life is associated with disability, increased mortality, and poorer outcomes from physical illness. Its prevalence remains high throughout lifetime, with almost 14% of older adults living in the community estimated to have clinically relevant symptoms of depression worldwide. Recognizing depression in the elderly is not always easy. Medical illnesses are a common trigger for depression. Most depressed people welcome care, concern and support, but they may be frightened and may resist help. The treatment of depression demands patience and perseverance for the patient and physician. Sometimes several different treatments must be tried before full recovery. Each person has individual biological and psychological characteristics that require individualized care. The prognosis for recovery is equal in young and old patients, although remission may take longer to achieve in older patients. Depression is a highly treatable medical condition and is not a normal part of growing older. Therefore, it is crucial to understand and recognize the symptoms of the illness in the primary care.

The aim of this study was to explore symptom frequencies of 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) and recognize the clinical characteristics of Major Depressive Disorder in PWE. A sample of 40 adults outpatients with epilepsy and depression was diagnosed using SCID-I for DSM-IV-TR and HDRS-17. The total HDRS-17 score was analysed followed by the exploratory analysis based on the hierarchical model. The frequencies of HDRS-17 items varied widely in this study. Insomnia related items and general somatic symptoms items as well as insomnia and somatic factors exhibited constant and higher frequency. Feeling guilty, suicide, psychomotor retardation and depressed mood showed relatively lower frequencies. Other symptoms had variable frequencies across the study population. Depressive disorders are common among PWE. In the study group insomnia and somatic symptoms displayed highest values which could represent atypical clinical features of mood disorders in PWE. There is a need for more studies with a use of standardized approach to the problem.

This phenomenon enables scholars and in particular demography scholars, to assume that in 2030 the number of elderly persons will reach about two billion worldwide. This development of an increasingly longer life expectancy, justifies the trust in the great progress that characterizes our society. The rapid growth of this segment of population, due to the improved living conditions and the related progress in science, technology and medicine, in addition to its positive aspects, also includes negative elements, which already affect the Welfare State and, more generally, the public administration that is called to fill the gaps that the transformation of the family and kinship networks have treated with indifference. The problems of the increasingly long-lived, is not freed from new elements of negativity related to the physical and mental decline that leads to the development of new diseases in addition to those already present, ans is increasingly motivated to seek the best remedies to shorten or eliminate the diseases of the elderly. In this context, Depression assumes a central dimension which will surely be a central concern for the economic, social and health impact and for the multitude of changes that put in crisis many of the traditional institutions. This work aims to analyze through a careful review of the scientific literature, the causes of the spread of this disease, the diagnostic difficulties and possible solutions for prevention and care. ","1487":"People whose chronic pain limits their independence are especially likely to become anxious and depressed. Mindfulness training has shown promise for stress-related disorders. Chronic pain patients who complained of anxiety and depression and who scored higher than moderate in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) as well as moderate in Quality of Life Scale (QOLS) were observed for eight weeks, three days a week for an hour of Mindfulness Meditation training with an hour daily home Mindfulness Meditation practice. Pain was evaluated on study entry and completion, and patients were given the Patients' Global Impression of Change (PGIC) to score at the end of the training program. Forty-seven patients (47) completed the Mindfulness Meditation Training program. Over the year-long observation, patients demonstrated noticeable improvement in depression, anxiety, pain, and global impression of change. Chronic pain patients who suffer with anxiety and depression may benefit from incorporating Mindfulness Meditation into their treatment plans. ","1488":"Exposure to stress activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis through the release of catecholamines, which modify humoral and cellular immunity. On the one hand, this psycho-immunological theory makes it possible to forge links between immunity and depression. On the other hand, we know that family determinants are an important variable in the model of vulnerability to depression. Our study weighs the influence of cellular immunity and family relations on the severity of depression. 498 inpatients with major depressive disorder were enrolled in an open-label trial. In addition to a socio-demographic questionnaire, they completed Olsen's FACES III and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Flow cytometry was used to assess lymphocyte subsets. In terms of immunity, there are correlations between the BDI and percentages of CD3 (p=0.015; r=-0.112), CD4 (p&lt;0.000; r=-0.175), CD4\/CD8 (p=0.045; r=-0.093) and CD16 and 56 (p=0.014; r=0.113). In terms of family relationships, there is a correlation between the BDI and family of origin, both for cohesion (p=0.007; r=-0.169) and adaptability (p=0.035; r=-0.133) measures. With respect to the relationship between family dynamics and immunity, there are correlations between adaptability in the family of origin and CD3 (p=0.04; r=0.094) and CD4 (p=0.044; r=0.093). A logistic regression model for family variables explained 11.4% of the BDI, compared to 12.7% for immune variables, while a model including the two explained 16%. While both the family and immunity can explain the BDI, it is surprising they have a greater effect in combination than individually. This suggests that the psycho-immunological theory should look at the relation between immunity and family life, notably in relation to the family of origin. ","1489":"The IAPT scheme was introduced in 2007 to implement the recommendations from NICE guidelines regarding psychological therapy for depression. This retrospective audit carried out across two General Practice Surgeries evaluates the care being given in relation to the standards of NICE guidelines. Initial audit found variable concordance, however after discussion of this at a local audit meeting and the displaying of posters and leaflets detailing the IAPT scheme this was improved on re-audit. Training should be provided to General Practitioners regarding the standards of care for patients with low mood or depression. In this training there should be an emphasis on the role of psychological therapy and details given of local resources. Posters and leaflets should be clearly displayed to allow patients to self-refer to IAPT. A close watch must be given to waiting times for the IAPT service as demands increase. ","1490":"Bipolar disorder is a developing disorder; its early stages are sometimes misdiagnosed as anxiety or depressive disorders. At the same time, these disorders are often in comorbidity with bipolar disorder. This complex symptomatology can lead to misinterpretation and underdiagnosis of bipolar disorders, mainly at the earliest stages. Consequently, one of the most important challenges for clinicians is to recognize the non specific early symptoms with the aid of clinical information, for example a family history of bipolar disorder. Furthermore, it is well-known that comorbid anxiety disorders can lead to a worse prognosis in bipolar patients but it is not exactly clear to what extent. A deeper understanding of the relationship between these comorbidities and their stage of development will hopefully lead to better care of patients with bipolar disorder from a younger age. ","1491":"Impulsivity is a complex behavioural feature of many psychiatric disorders, in particular of risk-taking behaviour, and is an important determinant of personality. Both ADHD and bipolar disorder express features of impulsivity. The concept of having two or more simultaneous psychiatric conditions is an increasingly recognised concept in the field of psychiatry, and is important clinically for management and prognosis. Consequently, the aim of this case presentation is to report about a young patient with both bipolar II and ADHD, in order to better understand which of the possible clinical phenotypes of these psychiatric conditions exist in comorbidity, mainly focusing on impulsive features because of the relevant challenge that this psychological aspect can represent in the clinical treatment of these patients. ","1492":"Bipolar disorder, previously called 'Manic-depression', is a complex group of conditions characterised by recurrent changes in mood and energy. Crucially, the intensity and duration of these changes go beyond normal fluctuations and personality traits. Bipolar Disorder is a mental health disorder, but physical health manifestations (Smith 2013, Westman 2013, Fagiolini 2008, Young 2013) and complications are just as important. GPs have a key role in the recognition and management, in conjunction with secondary care colleagues. Diagnosis is often difficult and may take several years (Smith 2011, Angst 2005, Manning 2010), because patients usually seek help for anxiety, depression or fatigue, not hypomania\/mania, which they may not recognise. Individuals with a first episode of mania are more likely to present directly to secondary care, sometimes via a third party alerting the emergency services. There is also debate around the classification, diagnosis and treatment of individuals with brief and milder mood changes ('bipolar spectrum disorder') (Faravelli 2009, Spence 2011). In the UK, the recent NICE Guidelines (2014) 1 only included Bipolar I and Bipolar II for these reasons. A particular challenge for GPs is that whilst most people who have Bipolar Disorder (and especially Bipolar II) are depressed, most people with depression within a Primary Care setting do not have Bipolar Disorder. Thus, a brief pragmatic screen is recommended in Primary care: ask about a family history of Bipolar Disorder and screen for a history of mania\/hypomania in individuals with anxiety, depression or irritability, especially if there are recurrent episodes, suicidal thoughts or a previous suicide attempt. For suspected cases, formal diagnosis should not be made within Primary Care but individuals should be referred for Psychiatric assessment, ideally to a Mood Disorders specialist. ","1493":"It is well known that Bipolar Disorder is a condition which is often under diagnosed or misdiagnosed. We propose an inventory of questions which will help assess the longitutinal history of the patient's illness, and to evaluate the presence of mixed affective states, rapid cycling, and comorbidities, all of which have an important bearing on prognosis. ","1494":"Some investigations strongly support a role of glial abnormalities in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. The degree of white matter axonal and myelination disruption is measured through the rate of water molecule diffusion. High ADC measures correspond to relatively unimpeded water diffusion, while low ADC measures reflect preserved myelinated axons. Parietal and occipital areas may be involved in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder, particularly in cognition and perception, along with the prefrontal and temporal cortices for the disruption of emotional processing. In the literature the widespread alterations of the cortical white matter microstructure is documented. This case reports demonstrates the features of the increased mean ADC values in the left occipital lobe. Future DWI studies are expected to investigate the correlation of white matter changes with the functional impairment, which often persists during euthymia in bipolar disorder. ","1495":"Studies and data on prevalence, recognition and clinical features of bipolar disorder (BD) in epilepsy remain limited. Still, there is a growing evidence of BD and epilepsy being frequent co-morbid conditions with some features suggesting shared pathophysiological mechanisms that include the episodic course of both conditions, the possible kindling mechanism and the efficacy of some antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in BD. The aim of this paper is to review concepts of overlapping phenomena of bipolar disorder and epilepsy. A literature review of the theoretical bases of the relationship between BD and epilepsy is presented. The comorbidity of epilepsy and mood disorders was a subject of interest of many studies for decades. Bipolar disorder and epilepsy have a number of clinical, biochemical and pathophysiological features in common. Bipolar disorder in epilepsy, excluding the ictal or periictal symptoms, can be categorized using standardized measures. Standardized psychiatric interview procedures based on DSM criteria like SCID-I or MINI provide comprehensive way to diagnose mood disorders in patients with epilepsy. ","1496":"There is current scientific debate in consideration of the possibility to consider the Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) as a mood disorder within the bipolar spectrum furthermore, authors reported about the challenging differential diagnosis of BPD and Bipolar Disorder (BD). 32 patients hospitalized in the Inpatient Psychiatric Unit in Perugia, discharged with a diagnosis of BD or BPD, were included. Factor analyses of BPRS and PANSS items were performed. Association between socio-demographic, clinical and psychopathological variables was tested using bivariate analyses. Factor analysis identified 6 Factors, explaining 67.6% of the variance, interpreted as follow: 1) Euphoric Mania, 2) Psychosis, 3) Inhibited Depression, 4) Disorganization, 5) Psychosomatic features, and 6) Mixed features. Bivariate analyses identified statistically significant differences between BPD and BD according to: PANSS positive symptoms domain, BPRS total score, Euphoric Mania and Disorganization. No statistically significant differences came up on socio-demographic and clinical aspects. Even though the sample is small, interesting findings came out from our investigation. Our findings are in line with the current literature. Euphoric mood, is one of the aspects which best differentiated BD from BPD. Higher scores in Disorganization, BPRS and PANSS positive symptoms in BD may be related to the fact that our sample is a group of patients from an acute inpatient unit, so the impact of the symptoms severity for BD may be remarkable. ","1497":"We review the recent literature in order to establish the importance of a spectrum for bipolar affective disorder, and that unipolar depression, bipolar II and bipolar I are discrete entities that may however evolve in sequence. We discuss clinical, genetic and neurobiological data which illustrate the differences between bipolar I and bipolar II. To fit the data we suggest a series of multiple mood disorder genotypes, some of which evolve into other conditions on the bipolar spectrum. Thence we discuss the nature of the bipolar spectrum and demonstrate how this concept can be used as the basis of a staging model for bipolar disorder.

The rehabilitation activities of the dancing group allowed patients to improve their care of self, self-esteem, confidence in their capacities and an increase in their social relations.

There are many films that revolve around a mental illness theme and the medical specialty that most commonly features in motion picture is psychiatry. Over the last few decades films have become increasingly used as an educational tool in the teaching of psychiatry topics such as mental state examination to undergraduate students. Above and beyond its utility in pedagogy, film also has the power to heal and the term cinematherapy has been coined to reflect this. Indeed, there are case studies of people with first-hand experience of psychopathology who report that watching films with a mental illness theme has contributed to their recovery. We provide a first person narrative from an individual with schizophrenia in which he expounds on the concepts of cinematherpy and metaphorical imagery in films which theme on psychosis.

Indeed mental health problems are projected to be a leading cause of morbidity by 2020 according to the Global Burden of Disease study. Bhugra et al, under the auspices of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the World Psychiatry Association, spearheaded an international study across 22 countries and identified myriad factors that can influence career choices at pre-medical school, medical school and postgraduate levels. The enthusiasm and passion of mental health educators and the quality of psychiatry placements were identified as factors that can attract medical and students and graduates to a career in psychiatry. The Future Excellence International Medical Summer School (FEIMSS) is a 5-day event for medical students held yearly in Manchester, UK.

To improve the image of psychiatrists and the perception of psychiatry in general with 2 brief contact-based lectures from a consultant and an early-career psychiatrist. The lectures incorporated references to the humanities (literature, poetry, history, film, drama and art). A mixed-methods study was conducted. Paper evaluation forms were hand-distributed to participants who attended the psychiatry talks. Items to constructs relevant to the talks were on a Likert-type scale. Participants were given the choice of anonymity. There was space for free-text comments which were subjected to thematic analyses. 25\/25 of the participants responded (response rate 100%). The heterogeneous sample was comprised of participants representing 11 countries from Japan to Kosovo. The written feedback was exceptionally positive. For the, 'The psychiatry talks were interesting' and, 'Attending FEIMMS improved my understanding and respect for other cultures' constructs, 23\/25 (92%) of respondents agreed or strongly agreed. Notwithstanding the limitations of our evaluation--which to our knowledge is the first of its kind on such an ethnically eclectic sample--our results suggest that a brief contact-based intervention incorporating the humanities may positively influence the perceptions of psychiatry and psychiatrists that medical students from diverse cultural backgrounds have. We contend that FEIMSS provides a platform to recruit medical students into psychiatry from all over the world and enables them to develop cultural competency.

The Index is based on a list of indicators including the environment for those with mental illness, their access to medical help and services, their opportunities--specifically job-related--and the governance of the system, including human rights issues and efforts to combat stigma. The indicators were developed in consultation with a panel of independent experts on mental health. Key findings of the research are that Germany's strong healthcare system and generous social provision put it at the top of the Index, with the UK and Scandinavian states not far behind. However, examples of best practice \"islands of excellence\" in integration are not limited to the leading countries and exists in all European Countries. The Index reveals also the discrepancy between perfect legislation and poor implementation of it in practice in many European countries. It proposes that the investment figure is a proxy for seriousness in establishing good policy and practice. According to the Index some reform plans including entire national mental health programmes are largely aspirational and are grossly under-funded. Moreover various levels of government responsible for the implementation of its component parts are largely ignoring its implementation. When we consider the legislation as an promise to professionals and people with mental health problems, this promise is largely unfulfilled. The is a need for strong leadership in mental health changes process, policy capacity and real financial investments in the way of The European countries to develop community based mental health services and system of care.","1510":"Social inequality as a social and economic phenomenon has become an issue of common interest in Europe and other societies worldwide, mainly after the recent global financial and economic crisis that occurred in 2008. The increasing gap observed between socioeconomically advantaged and disadvantaged people has caused intensive debates in politics, social sciences and in the field of public health. Today, poverty is considered as a major variable adversely influencing health. In this paper we will discuss the link between poverty and mental health. We conducted a literature search focusing on three main objectives: (I) to investigate the definition of \"poverty\"; (II) to determine the association between poverty and major mental health problems; and (III) to discuss the extent to which poverty could be both a cause and a consequence of mental health. We identified a total of 142 relevant papers, published between 1995 and 2014, only 32 were retained. Main findings are summarised in this paper. Poverty can be considered as a risk factor for mental illness. Yet the relation between poverty and mental health is complex, without direct causation, and bidirectional. As poverty has severe consequences not only on health but also on the whole society, combating poverty should be placed high on the political agenda. ","1511":"In May 2015 the UK elected a new government. In election campaigns, health is one of the most important areas of debate and over the preceding 12 months, the state of child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) had held a particularly high profile in the media and in political debate. Many had suggested that the rate of mental illness starting in adolescence is increasing and that service provision is not of sufficient quality or scale to meet this need. A brief review of the sources for these statistics reveals that whilst this may be true, there is a dearth of accurate and up to date data on the scale of the need for CAMHS or the extent to which it is being met. Nonetheless, members of all parties claimed to support improvements in mental health service provision for children and adolescents through increases in funding. A key question for policy makers has therefore become, from where any additional funding might be derived. One suggestion has been that funding be transferred from spending on adult mental health services. The exact practical nature of such a policy is yet to be explored in detail by government or stakeholders. The primary purpose of the present discussion is therefore to consider the possible ethical implications of such a policy in principle. The discussion forms part of a wider and evolving political and professional discourse on society's and government's attitude towards mental illness, towards the balance of individual and societal needs and towards the balance between preventative and supportive interventions to improve health. ","1512":"This review aimed to improve infant risk assessments in the context of maternal mental illness by identifying key predictors of poor parenting outcomes. Inadequate parenting as a result of severe and persistent mental illness is a common reason for courts terminating parental rights. However, the current practice of parenting capacity assessments in the setting of perinatal psychiatry is fraught with risks and uncertainty. A well-recognised flaw in the assessment process is the lack of valid and reliable tools that have been specifically validated for assessing parenting capacity in mothers with a history of mental illness and the potential risk of harm to their infant. To date, there is only one instrument available. A systematic search of Medline, PsycInfo and Embase via the Ovid interface was conducted between September and December 2014. Citation snowball sampling was also used to identify further relevant studies. An additional search was performed in Google to access grey literature. A total of 38 citations were identified, of which 8 publications focusing on the populations of England, France and Belgium met the eligibility criteria of this review. Evidence from existing research suggests that poor parenting outcomes in maternal psychiatric illness are strongly associated with correlates of socio-economic inequalities. However, evidence regarding the long-term implications of such factors is weak as only one follow up study and no longitudinal studies were identified in this review. Our review suggests that the use of standardised empirically validated risk assessment tools would benefit the current practice of parenting assessments by improving the process by which collected information is analysed. This would enhance the accuracy of decision-making, and improve the safeguarding of the infant. Further research is needed on medium to long-term parenting outcomes, particularly regarding its relations to: the type of maternal psychiatric disorder; the quality of maternal relationships; previous attachment experience; psychiatric illness or behavioural disorder in the partner and neonatal\/infant medical complications. This would more accurately reflect the dynamic nature of parenting and would help to determine the effectiveness of specific interventions addressing risk factors associated with poor parenting outcomes. ","1513":"Child maltreatment is a well-known condition that is currently considered to be associated with the development of severe psychiatric conditions. Consequently, the authors decided to review the current literature in order to give a complete scenario of the situation in the world and to give recommendations about prevention and treatment as well as research goals. An electronic search was conducted through the means of MEDLINE database in order to find the most up to date peer-reviewed papers, including only those papers published in 2015. 15 papers were included and analyzed the current situation in different countries: US (n.3), Australia (n.2), Ireland (n.2), Israel (n.2), China (n.2), Indonesia (n.1), Pakistan (n.1) and Norway (n.1). Even though sexual abuse has been studied extensively, both physical and emotional abuse and neglect appear to be more represented within the population of patients that had suffered from abuse. Psychiatric disorders (mainly personality disorders, depression and anxiety), interpersonal, social and legal outcomes are important consequences of child maltreatment. Interventions and strategies are needed at different levels, from prevention to treatment and further research is important in order to better understand the phenomenon. ","1514":null,"1515":"Empathy is one of the crucial personality traits for all medical professionals, including physicians. The importance of empathy in doctor-patient relationship cannot be overestimated, as it is beneficial for both sides. Regrettably, there is evidence for the decline in this trait over the course of medical studies. The participants were 509 voluntary respondents: medical school candidates (16.1%), medical students (65%), medical trainees (9.8%), residents (6.3%) and specialists (2.8%). The Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) was administered to them, which is a self-report tool measuring empathy. Gender difference in the IRI score was especially prominent - the mean score for female respondents was 59.83 points, while in men it was 51.16 point (p&lt;0.001). The level of empathy did not differ significantly in the sub-groups divided with regards to the stage of their medical career. However, the total IRI score in women was the highest in the group of doctors, while in post-graduated males it was the lowest. Age of the respondents correlated positively with the perspective taking sub-scale and negatively with the fantasy and personal distress sub-scales. Empathy is a trait that is rarely being enhanced in medical students during their education. While empathy is crucial for the development of a satisfactory doctor-patient relationship, there is an urgent need to adopt educational programs aimed at reinforcing empathy in medical students. ","1516":"In this paper we wish to argue that the human body is an instrument of communication that can be used by the individual. This can be shown by the use of phenomenology, as described by Husserl, and that indeed empathy, as described by phenomenology, can be seen as a link enabling two human bodies\/persons to communicate. We then wish to show from neuroscience that empathy can itself be seen as a bodily function. We then will describe how the doctor-patient relationship in the consultation is an extremely important type of communication between two persons, and how teaching of consultation skills has developed. We will show that, once consultation skills teaching was established, then study of body language became an essential part of this teaching, as soon as the technology was developed, and finally we will demonstrate that it is now possible to confirm by observational and controlled trials that appropriate use of body language does indeed enhance the effectiveness of the consultation, including, we would suggest, by appropriate communication of empathy and understanding. ","1517":"The doctor patient relationship is fundamental to the practice of medicine. In the UK, much work has been carried out to develop taining in communication skills for both doctors and medical students. Whereas it is true that controled trials of communication skills are now beginning to emerge in the primary care literature, it is also true that there is need for studies of communication skills on the hospital ward. One alternative form of evidence for the need of communication skills is that of anthropological studies of hospital wards. We here summarise the observations made in one such anthropological study which was carried out in a renal unit in Malta. The conclusion of these observations is that the inability of the doctors to utilise communication skills is that patients develop meaningful relationships with other groups of professionals, to the extent that they consider them as part of an extended family. Doctors remain isolated from all these relationships and only relate to patients from a position of power. ","1518":"Modern psychopharmacotherapy is currently in contention both outside and within the field of psychiatry. Conventional psychopharmacology paradigms focusing just on a disease perspective, biological narrative and a \"one fits all\" treatment are often regarded as inadequate and disjunctive. A significant proportion of psychiatric patients achieve no improvement or only partial improvement in their symptoms, while many of them suffer adverse and even toxic effects of medications. Psychopharmacotherapy as a sole form of treatment may carry the wrong message that patients don't have to change their life style and don't have to learn any new skills, they just have to receive their medication on time because the only problem is in brain chemistry. Evidence-based psychopharmacotherapy and person-centered narrative psychopharmacotherapy are not competitors but a complementuary duality, as intimately connected as brain and soul. Narrative preserves individuality, distinctivenesss and therapeutic context, whereas quantitative methods and evidence-based guidelines offer a solid foundation for what is reliably and generally correct. The purpose of person-centered psychopharmacotherapy is to empower the patients to control their disease, to re-author their problematic life story, to obtain full personal recovery and to regain control over their life. ","1519":"The value of words in the healing process runs constant to the path of therapeutic treatment, the net of exchanges and relationships between brain chemistry and the right words in order to heal is subtle and intricate. Psychotherapy, a treatment with words, is shown to be a treatment that directly affects the brain and that is able to change it stably, even in its anatomical structure and function. According to Kandel (1999), a leading living scientist and Nobel Prize winner for medicine and physiology, American neurologist and psychiatrist, psychotherapy is a real cure, a biological treatment, as it produces behavioral changes through new words and new experiences. The article offers a brief overview of the use of the fantasy of argument, since the time of the classical rethoric of the sophists up to the new rethoric, to illustrate how the structure of the speech, and the dialectic ability of opposing different thoughts, closely resembles the way of thinking. Consequently the choice of words can be considered an instrument of great impact that is inserted in the stream of thoughts that determines the attitude of a person, and therefore, his\/her actions. This happens whenever you communicate voluntarily, and not simply when interacting. The right choice of words remains a turning point in all of our relationships, not only in therapeutic situations, but in every other social relationship in life, family or friends. ","1520":"The assumption that eventually the classification in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) will incorporate aspects of causation uncovered by research in neuroscience is examined in view of the National Institute of Mental Health's NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project. I argue that significant advantages of maintaining the classification system, focussed on grouped descriptions of symptoms, are often undervalued or not considered. In this paper I will challenge the standard view that the transition from the purely symptom based approach is an inevitable and desirable change. ","1521":"The complex inter-relationship between external and internal reality, a source of interest and controversy in psychiatry, has come to the foreground more prominently in the context of more integrative understanding of psychopharmacotherapy. This paper discusses the meaning and clinical applications of the psychodynamic related to psychopharmacotherapy for difficult personality and eating disorders patients. The one of the psychodynamic explanations for patients' being difficult is related to their perceived lack of mentalizing (reflective) capacities. Lack of mentalizing capacity implies disturbed view of psychopharmacotherapy. Therapeutic relationship and optimal alliance offers the frame for acceptance of psychiatric drugs as positive and useful for personality and eating disorder patients. Mentalization and intersubjectivity theories have direct implications for clinical practice, and that the notion of the third is particularly useful in understanding what happens in the patient-doctor relationship. ","1522":"Bipolar disorder is a mental disorder with chronic and remitting course. The disorder is related to high mortality and severely impairs everyday functioning. Therefore a scientifically sound and practical approach to treatment is needed. Making a long-term treatment plan usually also demands some creativity. The patient is interested in a number of issues, from the choice of therapy in acute phases to long-term treatment. Usual questions are how long shall I take the medications, do I really need all those pills or can we decrease the dosage of some drugs? This paper discussed the above mentioned questions in light of latest publications in this field. ","1523":"Despite pharmacological advances in the treatment of schizophrenia, significant number of patients continue to be treatment-resistant. Poor control of symptoms could be related to low concentration of antipsychotics because of non-adherence or pharmacokinetic issues. However, there is growing evidence that \"true\" treatment-resistance might be associated with biological changes, i.e. alterations in dopaminergic and glutaminergic systems, genetics, neurodegeneration and neuroinflamation. Clozapine is recommended as first-line treatment for treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) in all guidelines. Clozapine-ECT combination is effective in majority of those patients, at least in short-term. However, more than half of patients with TRS have resistance or intolerance to clozapine, and more interventions are needed. Different combination and augmentation strategies may offer some advantage, but evidence is limited. Given the severity and complexity of TRS, there is an urgent need for better treatment. Treatment strategies beyond dopamine, such as glutamate-modelling agents, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and hormonal treatment, are under investigation. ","1524":"Each day clinical practice tries to follow the idea and principles of personalized medicine. Besides predicting an individual's sensibility or predisposition for developing schizophrenia, pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic approaches attempt to define and acknowledge important indicators of clinical response to antipsychotics namely their efficacy and adverse effects. The main focus of our article were not facts regarding the role CYP450 liver enzymes have in this; our purpose is introducing other, new genetic and epigenetic factors which could introduce important biomarkers in diagnostics of the disease itself, the efficacy and tolerance for antipsychotics. There is still a huge gap between gathering and collecting information and using them for the personalized treatment of schizophrenia. From the genetic point of view personalized treatment of schizophrenia is the field we need to focus on and successfully incorporate it our everyday clinical practice in the future. ","1525":"Nowadays, more and more mental health professionals manage patients who fail treatment for major psychiatric disorders. There is not a consensus on how to deal with treatment-resistance patients, but usually psychiatrists result to polypharmacy. In reviewing the evidence based clinical research we will try to answer some questions about treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders. Treatment-resistant symptoms complicate the clinical course of all psychiatric disorders especially schizophrenia, causing the patients not to reach the therapeutical goal and enter remission. In consequence, polypharmacy is used to try to deal with the remaining symptoms, raising other issues. We will try to deal with this problematic issue through clinical studies and major research done to try and answer the question posed. ","1526":"This paper discusses about challenges to psychopharmacotherapy, evidence-based psychopharmacology, creative psychopharmacology, creativity and dopamine, creative-rational polypharmacy as a paradigm for creativity in psychopharmacotherapy, and about polypharmacy classification as a good, bad and ugly By stimulating the patient to participate in the creative and artistic process we effect on his optimal identification with the role of the sick person. Through creation, imagination and visualization patients can recognize their own reservoir of inner healing and create a healthier new identity. Psychopharmacotherapy can prevent the deterioration of creativity affecting the quality of life and personal recovery. It may also affect the goals and aspirations of patients as well as the way in forming strategies of their realization. ","1527":"Despite of the huge progress in clinical psychopharmacology and recent introduction of many new mental health medicines, a significant proportion of psychiatric patients do not respond satisfactory to pharmacological treatment. Such patients are commonly labeled \"treatment resistant\" although there is no full agreement about definition of the term. The precise prevalence of treatment resistance is hard to determine due to the lack of consensus regarding the term definition and too many cases of pseudo-resistance. Resistant and refractory mental disorders have significant economic, social, physical, and psychological consequences. The suffering and disability associated with chronic, unremitting mental disorders is profound. Changing treatment philosophy may be a critical step towards overcoming what some view as \"therapeutic stagnation in psychiatry\" and providing better treatment effectiveness and efficiency for patients benefit. A \"paradigm shift\" is needed from the mechanistic, formistic and reducionistic way of thinking of technical and impersonal psychopharmacology to contextual and systemic thinking with new treatment holodigm individualizing and personalizing psychopharmacotherapy in a more creative manner. Treatment resistance as a construct should be reconsidered as well as \"monotherapy before polytherapy\" treatment strategy. The best treatments are those that utilize and integrate multiple therapeutic modalities. The concept of creative, person-centered narrative psychopharmacotherapy gives a hope for increasing treatment effectiveness and efficiency in psychiatry.

A total of 50 heroin dependent patients and 50 of their relatives and 50 healthy subjects and 50 of their relatives were included in the study. The Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (SCID-I) was used to determine the heroin dependence and other Axis I psychiatric disorders. Family burden and QoL levels in the relatives were assessed with the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) protocol and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment-Brief (WHOQOL-BREF), respectively. There were no significant differences in demographic characteristics between the groups. When compared with healthy controls, family members of heroin dependence patients had significantly higher ZBI scores and significantly lower all subscale scores of the WHOQOL-BREF. ZBI score was positively correlated with duration of the illness. All WHOQOL-BREF subscale scores were negatively correlated with duration of the illness. The study suggests that heroin dependence not only affects the lives of patients but also the lives of their family members. Heroin dependence leads to high burden on the family and also impairs the QoL of relatives. ","1534":"The role of rejection sensitivity (RS; the tendency to anxiously expect, readily perceive, and overreact to implied or overt interpersonal rejection) in psychopathology has mainly been studied with regard to borderline personality disorder (BPD). In the present study, we first sought to extend previous evidence of heightened RS in a clinical group with psychiatric disorders other than BPD, when compared with a community sample. Then, we tested whether emotion dysregulation and mindfulness were associated with RS in both sample, further hypothesizing that emotion dysregulation would mediate the relation between mindfulness deficits and RS. We adopted a cross-sectional design involving 191 psychiatric patients and 277 community participants (total N=468). All participants completed the Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire, the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale. Our hypotheses were supported, with psychiatric patients reporting greater levels of rejection sensitivity and emotion dysregulation, and lower level of mindfulness. Mindfulness deficits and emotion dysregulation explained a significant amount of variance in RS, in both samples. Finally, bootstrap analyses revealed that mindfulness deficits played an indirect effect on RS through the mediating role of emotion dysregulation. In particular, two different patterns emerged. Among psychiatric patients, an impairment in the ability to assume a non-judgmental stance towards own thoughts and feelings was related to RS through the mediation of limited access to emotion regulation strategies. Conversely, in the community sample, overall emotion dysregulation mediated the effect of lack of attention and awareness for present activities and experience on RS. Longitudinal studies could help in delineating etiological models of RS, and the joint role of deficits in mindfulness and emotion regulation should inform treatment programs. ","1535":"We aimed to evaluate serum ghrelin (GHR) levels and lipid profile in panic disorder (PD), with and without agoraphobia, and to compare these parameters before and after treatment. The GHR and lipid profiles were measured in blood samples taken from 31 PD patients with agoraphobia, 22 PD patients without agoraphobia, and 53 control group subjects. 23 of the 53 patients who were prescribed 20 to 40 mg\/day paroxetine had continued treatment. The 23 patients who had continued treatment were measured again at the end of twelve weeks. The GHR and triglyceride (TRG), total cholesterol (Total-C), low-density lipoproteins (LDL-C), and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL-C) levels were higher in the PD with agoraphobia group than the PD without agoraphobia and control groups. The 23 patients that had continued their treatment were re-evaluated, and the serum GHR, Total-C levels, and BMI after treatment were significantly decreased, compared to the values before treatment. There may be a pathophysiological relationship between the GHR and lipid profiles that interact with each other in PD. In fact, this relationship was more marked in PD with agoraphobia than in PD without agoraphobia.

Participants were aged 17 or more and somatically stable with the BMI&gt;12 kg\/m(2). Patients with psychiatric comorbidity, mental disorder due to a general medical condition, or serious somatic or neurological disease were excluded. Intensity of ED symptoms and presence of selected impulsive behaviours were evaluated at hospital admission and discharge, and three, six and twelve months after, using an internal Eating Disorder Unit Questionnaire. For statistical analysis multivariate analysis of variance was used. Throughout the research period the appropriate changes in BMI were observed in both patient groups. In both, AN and BN patient groups, the evaluation of longitudinal differences regarding the intensity of all ED symptoms and the presence of studied impulsive behaviours showed a significant decline at discharge and all subsequent assessments compared to the results obtained upon admission to the hospital. The re-hospitalization rates of patients with AN and BN in the first year after discharge from the hospital were 3.84% vs. 3.7% respectively. In male patients with AN and BN treated at the EDU UPCL, ED symptoms, BMI, and studied impulsive behaviours show a substantial improvement during hospital treatment. These changes seem to be long lasting, still being effective through one-year post-hospitalization follow-up. ","1537":"The aim of this study is to identify the risk factors that are associated with suicide attempts in patients with bipolar disorder type I. This cross-sectional study was conducted with inpatients and outpatients with BD type I. Patients who met the study inclusion criteria (n=91) were evaluated in terms of sociodemographic variables, history of childhood trauma, comorbidity of adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder, and the course of the disease. The patients were divided into two groups: those with a history of suicide attempts and those without a history of suicide attempts. The parameters of the study groups were compared with t and chi-square tests as appropriate. Logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of suicide attempt. Logistic regression analysis of the study parameters suggested that the number of major depressive episodes (odds ratio: 7.18; 95% confidence interval: 1.84-28) and history of emotional neglect (odds ratio: 1.83; 95% confidence interval: 1.15-2.90) were significant predictors of suicide attempt in patients with BD. In BD type I patients with a history of suicide attempts, the number of depressive episodes and emotional neglect, a subtype of childhood traumas, were the most remarkable risk factors. Considering the frequency of depressive episodes during the course of the disease and assessing traumas including those in childhood may help predict future suicide attempts in patients with BD. ","1538":"Verbal expression of suicidal feelings has rarely been investigated in the literature, particularly regarding individuals who died by suicide. We retrospectively collected data on the suicide cases of the period November 2007-October 2009 from the Athens Greater Area and completed psychological autopsy questionnaires after phone interviews with their family members. The specific question was: \"Has your relative expressed to you his\/her deep suffering or the intention to end his\/her life at any time during the six months prior to the suicide?\" Data were collected for 248 individuals who died by suicide out of a total of 335. 121 of them (48.8%) had verbally communicated their intention to die -or their profound suffering- to their family members. Suicide communicators were older (p&lt;0.001), less educated (p=0.04), more frequently divorced or separated and less often single (p&lt;0.01) than non-communicators. They had more often positive psychiatric history (p=0.004) and were less physically well (p=0.005), in comparison to non-communicators. Differences regarding sex, nationality, previous attempts, suicide note-leaving, completed suicide method and hospitalization either for physical illness or psychiatric disorder the year prior to the suicide were not statistically significant among the two groups. Considered that we interviewed only one relative for every case, the actual number of suicide communicators would be probably higher; the suicidal feelings could have been disclosed to another relative instead. This is the first time that a similar study was carried out in Greece. We found that approximately half of the individuals who died by suicide in our sample had been (verbal) suicide communicators. The latter seem to present distinct characteristics. These findings, coupled with the observation that the relatives are keen observers of the suicidal feelings of their loved ones, could provide new insights to future suicide prevention efforts.

The principal aim of this review is to summarise the relevant knowledge and suggest further avenues of research into this topic. On 20th April 2015, we carried out a search using the computer database system PubMed by using keywords \"microvascular AND schizophrenia\". Out of the 17 articles found, only seven were relevant. They are generally consistent with the hypothesis of microvascular pathology and brain inflammation as part of the pathogenesis in schizophrenia. It is important to stress that all studies of brain microvasculature in schizophrenia to date have been post mortem findings, apart from the work by Meier et al. (2013) which is related to retinal imaging in living subjects. Based on the literature, we suggest the following research and clinical avenues: Firstly, to assess whether microvascular abnormality found via retinal imaging, fulfils the criteria for the schizophrenia endophenotype. Secondly, to examine retinal imaging in high-risk individuals for schizophrenia. Thirdly, to determine whether the fMRI findings and cognitive abilities of schizophrenia patients in both longitudinal as well as cross-sectional studies, is associated with the microvascular abnormalities assessed by the retinal imaging. Fourthly, to determine if there is a correlation between microvascular retinal pathology and the positive or negative schizophrenia symptoms. Furthermore, to determine if childhood maltreatment results in any abnormities in retinal imaging. Lastly, to analyse the genetic background of schizophrenia retinal microvascular pathology and to apply anti-inflammatory agents in the treatment and prevention of schizophrenia if brain vasculitis is confirmed.

Circadian rhythms include all physiological processes displaying a period around 24 hours. Sleep\/wake cycles, body temperature, hormone secretion and other functions are subjected to person's individual circadian rhythm. Circadian typology includes three chronotypes: morning, neither and evening. The aim of this study was to examine the chronobiological aspects of depression. This cross-sectional study aimed to determine circadian rhythmic expression in 60 patients suffering from depression. The patients were in remission and were treated as outpatients at the Department of Psychiatry of the University Hospital Center Zagreb. The data were compared to a control group consisting of 40 medical workers employed at the University Hospital Centre Zagreb. A self-report measure of circadian typology was utilized - the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire. According to our findings, among depressed patients 35% were morning, 58.3% neither and 6.7% evening types. In the control group 46% were morning, 48% neither and 6.0% evening types. Depressed patients reported stronger morning fatigue. Further, they tended to go to sleep earlier and felt more tired earlier in the evening, and they were less prone to choosing morning periods for completing complex cognitive tasks. This study supports the association between depression and some alterations in circadian rhythms of behavior and sleep. Depression may be considered as the consequence or trigger of circadian disturbances. However, both depression and circadian rhythm disturbances may have a common aetiology: a decreased cellular resilience associated with lower resistance to stressful events.

Even though comprehensive data on psychiatric training in Europe have been already reported, no data are available on even the approximate number of early career psychiatrists (ECPs). With this objective in mind, the Early Career Psychiatrists Committee of the European Psychiatric Association (EPAECPC) and the European Federation of Psychiatric Trainees (EFPT) have undertaken a survey. Based on the methodology used, the total number of ECPs in all European countries was 46 144 with the average number of ECPs being 5.5\/100 000 country inhabitants. The actual numbers in this respect varied greatly among countries from 0.4 and 0.6 ECPs\/100 000 in Azerbaijan resp. Russia; to 20.4 and 28.4 ECPs\/100 000 in Norway resp. Switzerland. An obvious East-West gradient with increasing numbers of ECPs when moving from East to West, and from South to North were found, mirroring the economic strength of European countries. This is the first study to specifically explore the number of ECPs across Europe which might have key implications for planning and establishing recruitment activities and for developing strategies for prevention of brain-drain, such as improvement of educational system and enlargement of professional opportunities.

Generalized and specific emotional abnormalities have been reported, often related to OCD severity and functional disabilities. The objective of the present study was to assess the abilities of experiencing and displaying emotions in OCD patients in response to specific stimuli in relation with the severity of their clinical condition. Thirty-six individuals participated in the study: 10 OCD patients with severe symptoms, 11 with mild-moderate symptoms, and 15 healthy controls. All participants watched emotion-eliciting video clips while their facial activity was videotaped. The congruent\/incongruent feeling of emotions and the facial expression in reaction to emotions were evaluated. The two subgroups of OCD patients presented similarly incongruent emotive feelings and facial expressions (significantly worse than healthy participants). Moreover, OCD patients with severe symptoms expressed the emotion of happiness and disgust significantly less appropriately than OCD patients with mild-moderate symptoms. The present data support the hypothesis that impaired emotional processing may: (i) represent a potential contributor to poor outcome in OCD; (ii) constitute a warning sign for clinicians to establish a more comprehensive protocol for more severe cases; (iii) influence therapeutic strategies used to treat this disorder.

Also, in the case of schizophrenia, a psychiatric disorder marked by gross distortion from reality, disturbances in thinking, feeling and behavior, pain behaves in an unpredictable manner, just like the evolution of this mental disorder. In this way, findings on this matter are contradictory, some pleading for decreased pain perception in schizophrenia, others for increased pain sensitivity, while there are also reports stating no differences between healthy controls and schizophrenic patients. Still, it is now generally accepted that pain perception is impaired in various ways in schizophrenics. Nevertheless, pain is a very important clinical issue in this population that needs to be clarified. Throughout this paper, we are going to review these contradictory information regarding pain manifestations in the context of schizophrenia in both human patients and animal models, emphasizing the importance of determining pain mechanism, its particularities and evolution in the context of schizophrenic disease, so that this phenomenon could be evaluated, quantified and controlled with the intention of obtaining a superior management for this disorder and to possibly raise hopes of higher life quality and expectancy in patients suffering from schizophrenia. Also, we would like to raise awareness on this matter, making psychiatrists, general practitioners, and other medical specialists more conscious of the importance of this problem, so that medical care could improve for these patients in the future.

Analysis of media reports, principally via Highbeam Research, of a noted case of a sudden and unexpected military suicide: Jacob Kovco. Ontogenetic diagnostic analysis, centering on the person, was successfully amplified by diagnostic analysis of time and place, in the cultural and historical, phylogenetic domain. It revealed an occult, dissociative depression. This method is called psychodiagnomics. Ontogenetic analysis of suicide, especially biomedical analysis must be complemented by ontogenetic and phylogenetic analysis in the socio-cultural domains. ","1554":"Medication non-adherence is a great challenge in the treatment of psychotic disorders. Several factors leading to medication non-adherence in schizophrenia have been identified: drug side-effects, lack of illness insight, negative attitude of the patient and friends\/relatives toward medication, stigma of mental illness and taking medication, poor therapeutic alliance, substance abuse, and role of the illness in maintaining the family system. In this work I propose a new vista on the phenomenon of medication non-adherence in psychosis. Rather rule than exception, non-adherence is to be expected in psychosis, it can be considered as a symptom of psychosis similarly as substance craving and use are symptoms of the substance use disorders. Relying on the last refinements of the concepts of boredom, anticipatory anhedonia, intrinsic motivation, and thrill I assume that there is a lure of psychotic episode. In order to escape an extremely unpleasant and distressing experience of boredom and to experience the thrill of psychosis, the patients are prone to quit antipsychotic therapy. The phenomena of boredom and the thrill of psychosis are evident but unexploited for strengthening the therapeutic adherence. Making the lure of psychosis an explicit reason for medication non-adherence would bring to the awareness a personal choice between short-term pleasure of the psychotic thrill and prevention of long-term losses due to a psychotic episode. Neurobiological and psychobiological underpinning of the psychotic thrill has been suggested. An explanation of the pleasure of psychosis and substance use, which overcomes the circular explanation of reward in which dopamine appears as the cause and consequence of reward, has been proposed. The present synthesis can be regarded as a contribution to the field of theoretical psychiatry. It points to a chance for psychiatry to do more for patients' wellbeing and treatment adherence performing in a new key - dealing with boredom and pleasure in patients' everyday life. ","1555":"Permissibility of placebo controls in psychiatric research is raising everlasting controversies. The main ethical issue remains: whether, when, under what conditions, and to what extent is it justifiable to disregard subject's present (best) interest for the presumably \"greater\" ones. In relation to this main ethical concern, two distinct arguments arose: proponents of placebo controls trials (placebo ortxodoxy) and proponents of active controls trials (active-control orthodoxy). More recently, in new ethical guidelines, Declaration of Helsinki and International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects, a \"middle way\" approach was formulated, acceptable to both sides of the argument, saying placebo controls can be justified under certain conditions: when and only when, they firstly present undisputed methodological reasoning, and secondly, fulfill certain ethical considerations - mainly regarding the permissibility of accompanied risks. These ethical evaluations are inevitably contextual and evoke the need for the principle of proportionality. In scope of recent findings of substantial and progressively increasing placebo response in psychiatric research, contextual factors are identified and both theoretical and practical challenges are discussed.

In accordance with the principle of the minimum allocation of imbalance index for comparability, a total of 117 cases that were ready to receive PCI were divided into two groups (59 in the intervention group and 58 in the control group). The patients in the control group received routine care, whereas the patients in the observation group were given massage intervention. The state anxiety, heart rate, and blood pressure of the two groups were observed and compared. Massage treatments reduced the emergency response and level of anxiety of cardiovascular patients before PCI. The post-intervention blood pressure, heart rate, and pain score of the intervention group were significantly better than those of the control group (P&lt;0.05). Health professionals should pay attention to and strengthen the exploration of the effects of reasonable care intervention mode under PCI to promote the physical and mental health of patients, as well as improve their medical care satisfaction.

Pathological gambling is a disorder in progression, and we hope that our experience in the treatment of pathological gambling in the Daily Hospital for Addictions at The Institute of Mental Health, through the original \"Integrative - systemic model\" would be of use to colleagues, dealing with this pathology. This model of treatment of pathological gambling is based on multi-systemic approach and it primarily represents an integration of family and cognitive-behavioral therapy, with traces of psychodynamic, existential and pharmacotherapy. The model is based on the book \"Pathological gambling - with self-help manual\" by Dr Mladenovic and Dr Lazetic, and has been designed in the form of a program that lasts 10 weeks in the intensive phase, and then continues for two years in the form of \"extended treatment\" (\"After care\"). The intensive phase is divided into three segments: educational, insight with initial changes and analysis of the achieved changes with the definition of plans and areas that need to be addressed in the extended treatment. \"Extended treatment\" lasts for two years in the form of group therapy, during which there is a second order change of the identified patient, but also of other family members. Pathological gambling has been treated in the form of systemic-family therapy for more than 10 years at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), in Belgrade. For second year in a row the treatment is carried out by the modern \"Integrative-systemic model\". If abstinence from gambling witihin the period of one year after completion of the intensive phase of treatment is taken as the main criterion of the effectiveness of our model, at this time it exceeds 90%. Given the relatively short period of application, it is necessary to continue to monitor and evaluate the model after 5 years.

The concept of food addiction is new and complex, but proven to be very important for understanding and solving the problem of obesity. First part of this paper emphasizes the neurological studies, whose results indicate the similarity of brain processes that are being activated during drug abuse and during eating certain types of food. In this context, different authors speak of \"hyper-palatable\", industrial food, saturated with salt, fat and sugar, which favor an addiction. In the section on diagnostic and instruments constructed for assessing the degree of dependence, main diagnostic tool is standardized Yale Food Addiction Scale constructed by Ashley Gearhardt, and her associates. Since 2009, when it was first published, this scale is used in almost all researches in this area and has been translated into several languages. Finally, distinguish between prevention and treatment of food addiction was made. Given that there were similarities with other forms of addictive behavior, the researchers recommend the application of traditional addiction treatment. ","1560":"The association between cannabinoids and psychosis has been known for almost a thousand years, but it is still speculated whether cannabis use may be a contributory cause of psychosis, that is, whether it may precipitate schizophrenia in those at risk. In this paper, we will briefly present the data from individual longitudinal studies in the field, together with the factors that are considered important for the association of cannabis abuse and occurrence of schizophrenia and prevention opportunities in the target population. The reviewed studies clearly suggest that cannabis abuse predicts an increased risk for schizophrenia, particularly in young adults. They underline both the need to create adequate prevention measures and consequently avoid the occurrence of the disease in the young at risk. Particular attention should be additionally devoted toward encouraging the young presenting with psychotic symptoms to stop or, at the very least, reduce the frequency of cannabis abuse. The issues are undoubtedly to be addressed by the health care system in general.

The results show rate of this kind of co-morbidity between 35 and 80%. The aims of the investigation are: establishing frequency of harmful use of alcohol in the patients with diagnosis of schizophrenia, observed against the population statistics data; determination of possible predictors of harmful use of alcohol in the population of schizophrenic patients (adolsecent bihevioural problems, child neuroticism); determination of heritage role in the development of the both nosologic entities and the analysis of the outcomes of harmful use of alcohol in the population of schizophrenic patients (suicide attempts, cognitive impairment). The population included 50 inpatients between 20 and 50 years, with primary diagnosis of schizophrenia. Diagnostic procedure was carried out by application: Structured clinical interview ICD 10 (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview), Structured questionnaire for the assessment characteristics and effects of harmful use of alcohol in the population of schizophrenics - modified version, Mini mental state scale and Heteroanamnestic questionnaire. Comparison was made between the patients with schizophrenia and the patients with co-morbidity. The results revealed significantly higher rate harmful use of alcohol co-morbidity in the male population. There is a prominent significant difference in alcoholism heritage in co-morbidity group. A statistically significant difference between the sub-groups was found in the frequency of child neuroticism and adolescent behavioral problems. The results point to a higher suicidal risk and higher rate of cognitive impairment in the co-morbidity sub-group. Young male with schizophrenia and family history of alcoholism are especially susceptible by this type of co-morbidity. Presence of child neuroticism may represent \"protective factor\" for development of harmful use of alcohol. The study stressed some serious consequences of this type of co-morbidity: increase rate of suicide attempts, as well as more frequent development of organic brain tissue impairment. ","1563":"Studies imposing rigorous control over lifetime alcohol intake usually have not found smaller hippocampal volumes in persons with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Since the majority of negative studies have used adolescent samples, it has been suggested that chronicity is a necessary condition for such findings. We have hypothesized that the volumes of hippocampus, amygdale, prefrontal cortex and the intracranial volume are reduced in the patients with PTSD and excessive alcohol intake. Study has been carried out on 54 therapy naive PTSD suffering subjects and healthy controls, divided in two groups: 29 with PTSD and consequent alcoholism, 25 with PTSD but without problems of excessive alcohol intake, and 25 healthy volunteers. All of the patients underwent same magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol and volumetric evaluation of the region of interest. Only hippocampal volume appeared to be significantly reduced in patients with PTSD and alcoholism. Other differences in the volumes obtained remained to be insignificant. Alcohol intake definitely worsens the deterioration of the hippocampal formation in PTSD suffering patients.

A sample of 72 Croatian male war veterans (mean age 52.33 years) diagnosed with PTSD was gathered at the National Center for Psychotrauma between May and October 2014. The participants completed the Temperament and Character Inventory - Revised (TCI-R) and the Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire - Revised (SBQ-R). Zero-order analyses revealed that temperament dimension Harm avoidance and character dimension Self-directedness were moderately associated with the total risk for suicide (i.e., the SBQ-R total score), while Persistence and Cooperativeness showed significant but weaker relations. Different dimensions of suicidality were associated with different personality traits. Harm Avoidance was shown to be significantly increased among the subgroup of war veterans with high suicidal risk. Notwithstanding some limitations of this study, these findings could help extend our understanding of the elevated suicide risk in war veterans with PTSD. Detection of individuals displaying high Harm Avoidance and low Self-Directedness might facilitate prevention of suicidal behaviors in this population.

Although it used to be a syndrome mainly encountered in childhood and adolescent psychiatry, it is now increasingly recognized in adult psychiatry. Nevertheless, little is known about psychiatric comorbidities and life course of adults with AS. The current study aimed to gain an insight into comorbidities and the development of the social situation of adults with AS. We investigated psychiatric comorbidities, psychiatric history, professional background, partnerships, and children in 50 adults with AS (34 men and 16 women) over a broad age range (20-62 years). Seventy percent of adults with AS had at least one psychiatric comorbiditiy. Most frequent comorbidities were depression and anxiety disorders. Obsessive-compulsive disorder and alcohol abuse\/dependence were also observed. Many adults had previously been treated with psychopharmacological or psychotherapeutic interventions. Although most adults had a high-level school leaving certificate and had gone on to complete training\/university studies, less than half were currently in employment. Fourteen adults were living in a partnership and 10 had children. Adults with AS often have psychiatric comorbidities, indicating lower levels of mental health. Additionally, they seem to have severe limitations concerning professional success, despite having a good school education. Their family situation is also impaired with regard to starting a family. These considerable limitations in the life of adults with AS may help to understand their specific problems, and emphasize the importance of developing specific treatments for improving their mental health and social integration.

They are associated with both an earlier onset of symptoms and prolonged episodes. The main aim of the study was to verify the hypothesis of differences in the effectiveness of cognitive processes between patients with a first episode of depression (ED-I) and recurrent depressive disorders (rDD). The study comprised 210 subjects: patients with ED-I (n=60) and patients with rDD (n=150). The assessment of cognitive functions was based on performance of the Trail Making Test, the Stroop Test, the Verbal Fluency Test, the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) and the digit span from WAIS-R. There were no statistically significant differences between the analysed groups in the severity of depressive symptoms. The negative impact of depressive symptoms on the effectiveness of cognitive functions was observed. The ED-I group recorded better results compared to the rDD group in terms of the speed of information processing, visual-spatial and auditory-verbal memory and executive functions, auditory-verbal immediate and delayed memory, ability to learn and verbal fluency. The same differences were observed with respect to the patients from the ED-I group and the patients with the second episode of depression (ED-II) in the course of rDD. There are significant differences in cognitive functioning of patients with a depressive episode and recurrent depressive disorders. These differences are already visible from the second episode of a major depressive disorder. Memory, verbal fluency and frontal functions are reduced.

By focusing primarily on somatic complaints and diseases, general practitioners often fail to identify an underlying mental disorder. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of patients with unrecognised depression symptoms in general practice and identify associated socio-demographic factors. The study included 769 patients without previous psychiatric disorder who attended their primary care physicians in the Health Centre Zagreb - Zapad in January 2011. Data on patients' age, sex, level of education, marital and employment status were collected. All participants completed The Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale. Among the 25.5% of participants whose Zung score was outside the normal range, 19.38% were mildly, 4.64% moderately, and 0.91% severely depressed. Statistically significant differences were observed among groups defined according to level of education, employment and marital status (p&lt;0.001). Lower Zung scores were found in individuals with a higher level of education, who were unmarried, employed or still undergoing education. Multivariate logistic regression model revealed that older age (p&lt;0.001), unemployment (p=0.001) or unmarried status (p=0.025) were significant predictors of depression symptoms. The study revealed a high prevalence of depression symptoms among primary care patients who had not been previously suspected to have any psychiatric co-morbidity.

","1575":"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive and functional decline, as well as by a variety of neuropsychiatric and psychological symptoms and behavioral dysfunctions. Various studies proposed the role of different neurotransmitter systems not only in AD-related cognitive, but also psychotic symptoms and behavioral and emotional deficits. Due to the close proximity, pathological neurochemical changes in brain occurring in AD are likely to be reflected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The purpose of this review is to provide a summary of the CSF neurotransmitter correlates of AD in order to get further insights into the potential role of altered neurotransmitters in the pathophysiology of AD and to offer novel AD biomarkers. PubMed and MEDLINE data bases were searched for English-language articles by using \"Alzheimer's disease\", \"CSF\" and \"neurotransmitter\" as primary terms. No time or article type constraints were applied. Moreover, the lists of references were searched manually for additional articles. Changes in various correlates of cholinergic, monoaminergic and amino acid neurotransmitter systems, as well as neuropeptides, have been observed in CSF of AD patients. However, as the results of these studies have been controversial, the importance of CSF neurotransmitter parameters as potential biomarkers in AD remains quite unclear. The observed discrepancies could be bypassed by implementation of new sensitive methods, such as novel proteomics approaches that include protein separation techniques, mass spectroscopy and targeted multiplex panels of specific analytes. Although no individual CSF neurotransmitter correlate was demonstrated as suitable biomarker of AD, a combined profile of several CSF neurochemical parameters might show enhanced sensitivity and specificity and thus contribute to earlier and more accurate diagnosis of AD, crucial for application of effective treatments.

A total of 10 studies including 5 trials (2*pre-experimental, 2*controlled trials, 1*randomised control trial), 2 qualitative studies and 3 case studies were included (n=185). Two out of 3 studies that considered weight as an outcome measure reported significant reductions in weight and psychiatric symptoms following sports participation. The mean reduction in body mass index (BMI) ranged from -0.7kg.m2 (p&lt;0.001) following 12 weeks of basketball to -1.33 kg.m2 (p&lt;0.001) after 12-weeks of soccer.

A range of secondary health and wellbeing outcomes identified some significant results. Qualitative findings showed that participants had positive experiences from participating in sports. Sport participation may result in reduced BMI and psychiatric symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. Sport has the potential to improve an individual's quality of life through providing a meaningful normalizing activity that leads to achievement, success and satisfaction. Well-designed randomised controlled trials are required to fully determine the health effects of sports participation in schizophrenia.

The patients are presented by sociodemographic data, diagnosis and treatment. In a 4 year period there were 246 scabies cases recorded in Zagreb. Cases have been registered in all quarters of the City. The highest incidence (50\/100 000) was recorded in every child age group following by incidence of over 30\/100 000 in elderly institutionalized in nursing homes. In almost two thirds of patients management of scabies has not been conducted in accordance to current guidelines. 10% of scabies cases were found in medical health personnel predominantly in those working in nursing homes and psychiatric wards. A small amount of cases 19 (8%) were infected outside Croatia; the majority of these cases 15 (78%) are registered within last two years. High percentage of scabies cases registered in nursing homes and psychiatric wards suggests that there is a need of raising awareness on scabies epidemiology and management by public health officers. Due to a higher incidence of scabies in children age, the obligation of medical practitioners is also to emphasize the importance of following treatment guidelines. In order to control scabies cases as well to prevent outbreaks within hospital wards or nursing homes there is an obligation of implementation of strict guidelines regarding treatment of scabies and a public health service referral.

The answers have been interpreted on a scale from 0 to 10. All patients underwent four weeks levothyroxine withdrawal in preparation for I-131 procedures and thyroglobulin testing. Individual statements on the physical subscale showed that patients had most difficulties with fatigue, intolerance to cold and heat, sleep changes and weight gain, but with higher average values than expected. Fatigue was one of the most common physical difficulties. Female patients had significantly more difficulties than male respondents. Five most expressed psychological difficulties have been stress caused by initial diagnosis, followed by stress caused by surgical treatment, fear of metastases, stress caused by initial radioiodine ablation treatment and fear of cancer recurrence. Generally, results revealed troubles mostly in physical symptoms relating to thyroid hormone withdrawal, as well as psychological distress caused by initial diagnosis. Respondents with higher educational level achieved a significantly higher score than less educated patients (p=0.026, Mann-Whitney U test). Illness was very distressing for their families (median value 1, range: 0 to 10) and they reported insufficient support from others (1, range: 0 to 10), but they did not feel isolated. Family and work consequences were less apparent. The results of QOL-Thyroid questionnaire help to identify high-risk areas in patients' lives that are negatively affected by hormone withdrawal.

In this article four adherence studies were analysed and the results were compared, two wherein the patient questionnaire was applied and other two with medication possession ratio applied. The obtained results reveal that more than half of respondents (58.9%) experienced constant nonadherence behavior according to the prescribed therapy. The main reason of nonadherence is oblivion, suggesting that it is necessary to pay more attention to this problem. Nonadherence with therapy has negative consequences on the health of the individual, and an adverse impact on the community health and wealth. Patients should be informed of the importance of regularly taking prescribed therapy. The main problem of long-term therapy is significantly decreased of adherence to medication in a very short time.

The most common injuries are lacerations and contusions of soft tissue (a total of 2 208 or 97.5%), followed by dental injuries (a total of 57 or 2.5%). Out of all recorded laceration injuries 59.8% lacerations of soft tissue occurred during practice (12.6% amateurs and 87.4% professionals), while 40.2% of them occurred during games (2.5% amateurs and 97.5% professionals). Of a total of 57 dental injuries recorded during an athletes career, in 78.9% it were the professionals who suffered an injury, and in 21.1% of them the amateurs. Out of a total of 195 basketball players only 1% (2 players - one professional and one amateur) frequently used mouthguard during practice and games, while 93.3% of them never tried to wear a mouthguard. Such low percentage of mouthguard use in basketball players reflects poor awareness and education of athletes and coaches, as well as insufficient role of dentists in education.

The majority of the patients diagnosed with NSCLC had adenocarcinoma (47.9%), followed by squamous cell carcinoma (33.9%) and large cell carcinoma (15%). Only a small number of patients diagnosed and treated for lung cancer in our Department had never smoked tobacco. The majority of those patients were women and the most common histological type found was adenocarcinoma. The number of patients who had potentially operable disease at presentation was around 10%.

In primary schools pupils rated SHS more available and accessible, staff complaisant and responsible, counselling being useful and justified, confidentiality respected higher than pupils from secondary schools (p&lt;0.001). Teachers from primary and secondary schools perceived SHS as valuable school partners (88.9% and 82.3%). Teachers from primary and secondary schools (88.9% and 88.1%) and parents (78.3% and 67.5%) stated that SHS could not be replaced by GPs or paediatricians. Primary school pupils felt that most common problems were injuries and vocational counselling, secondary school pupils assessed behavioural and sexual related problems as mostly challenging. Satisfaction with the SHS response to the most challenging problems was rated higher by teachers from primary schools (p&lt;0.001 for learning difficulties, chronic diseases, bullying and vocational counselling), by parents for learning difficulties and vocational counselling, but no significance was found for pupils' satisfactions.

Fifty-four subjects (7.4%; 95% CI 5.5-9.3) were suspected to have neoplasm and they were immediately referred for further diagnostic evaluation. Timely manner suspicion of malignant disease is of crucial influence on the course of treatment and outcome of the disease.

","1590":"The purpose of this paper was to compare outpatient consumption and quality of psychotropic drug prescribing between Croatia and Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina 2006-2010. Data on drug utilization from Zagreb Municipal Pharmacy and Sarajevo Public Pharmacy were used to calculate the number of defined daily doses (DDD) and DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day (DDD\/TID) using the WHO Anatomical-Therapeutic-Chemical methodology. Total utilization of psychopharmaceuticals increased in both cities; however, it was higher in Zagreb than in Sarajevo throughout the study period. The utilization of psycholeptics increased in Zagreb by 2.4% (from 74.5 to 76.3 DDD\/TID) and in Sarajevo by 3.8% (from 62.4 to 64.8 DDD\/TID). The utilization of anxiolytics decreased in Zagreb by 2.1% and in Sarajevo by even 18.7%. The utilization of antidepressants increased in both cities with predominance of SSRI over TCA utilization, greater in Sarajevo (96.6%) than in Zagreb (10.2%). The anxiolytic\/antidepressant ratio decreased by 11.1% in Zagreb (from 2.87 to 2.55) and by 58.7% in Sarajevo (from 5.66 to 2.34). Outpatient utilization of antipsychotics increased significantly in Sarajevo, predominated by typical ones, whereas in Zagreb the utilization of antipsychotics was stable, predominated by atypical ones. In Croatia and Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, there was an obvious tendency to follow western trends in drug prescribing, as demonstrated by the increased use of antidepressants and reduced use of anxiolytics. Despite some improvement observed in the prescribing quality, high use of antipsychotics with dominance of typical antipsychotics in Sarajevo points to the need of prescribing guidelines for antipsychotics.

Self-medication in the form of using any kind of therapy without previous consultation with medical professionals has been ever more common among student populations in many countries. The aim of this study was to determine the attitudes about self-medication for pain relief and features of self-medication in first-year students of the University of Applied Health Studies in Zagreb. The study was conducted using an anonymous questionnaire, which was completed by 389 respondents. Taking painkillers in the past year was reported by 74.6% of respondents, significantly more by female students (80.8%); 62.6% of female students used painkillers once a month versus 45.7% of male students taking analgesics once a year. Ibuprofen was preferred by female students and acetylsalicylic acid by male students. Headache was the most common indication for taking painkillers (76.6%), followed by menstrual discomforts in female students (66.2%) and toothache (28.6%). Significant sex differences were recorded in the choice of drugs, indications for self-medication, and frequency of drug use. There were no differences between study courses. Appropriate student education and improved information transfer between professionals and students are the key elements to ensure judicious, quality and knowledge based use of drugs among students. ","1592":"Six years of recent ongoing economic and structural crisis in Croatia have brought to a significant decrease of socioeconomic standard in our country, and had an important impact on the health care system. In this background we examined the prevalence of depression and burnout and their association with work stressors. Cross sectional survey was conducted with self reported questionnaires in 459 hospital physicians in Rijeka, Croatia. Physicians were divided into three groups: surgical, nonsurgical and diagnostic group. Socio-demographic and work-related characteristics questionnaire, Occupational Stress Assessment Questionnaire (OSAQ), Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS) and Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) were used. Sperman correlation and logistic regression were calculated to rank association between stressors at work with depression and burnout syndrome. Response rate was 62.3%, (286\/459). Every fifth doctor experienced all examined stressors in the workplace as stressful. The prevalence of moderate and severe depression was 12.2%. High levels of emotional exhaustion were 43.6%, depersonalization 33.5%, and lack of personal accomplishment 49.1%. There was no statistical difference in surgical, nonsurgical and diagnostic groups in depression and all domains of MBI-HSS. Almost all stressors were correlated with depression and burnout syndrome. Most of the perceived stressors were significant predictors of burnout syndrome and depression. High levels of burnout domain compared to overall results from similar studies from other countries, placed the results in our sample on the higher end of the range, while results for depression after adjustment with lower cutoff point would be similar to those usually found in research literature. Our study showed that burnout is highly prevalent among Croatian physicians. Target interventions at the workplace should be considered as one of the strategies to reduce negative impact of work stress on physicians' mental health. ","1593":"Health is largely influenced by the subjective well-being, optimism, social inclusion and satisfaction with life as well as usually defined variables. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship of dimensions of personality (optimism, control over life), social involvement (social capital) and socio-economic status with health and inequalities in health. This study was performed on 1017 respondents which were chosen according to set criteria: middle age, working capability, and, according to the documentation of the Centres for social welfare, the recipients of financial welfare from the state. A questionnaire was created from several existing questionnaires with validated indicators. The results show that 78.1% of respondents were unemployed. Regarding the health males express a higher level of health than female. The presence of a chronic disease was found in 56.6% women and 43.4% men. The predictors of health such as optimism, life satisfaction and locus of control showed that satisfaction with life was expressed by 39.7% respondents. Greater satisfaction with life was seen in females (59.6%). Surprisingly, 47.7% of respondents said they thought they had control over their lives and decisions. Women are statistically more optimistic. Almost 60% of respondents were not satisfied with their lives. Socially deprived population is mainly unemployed with insufficient resources for living. More burdened and higher risk for future development of the disease was found within this population. Optimism, social inclusion and life satisfaction play a large role, as protective factors in health. The interventions demand a multi disciplinary approach, and, with regard to the sensitivity of the population, the best solution is in their own empowerment, as a protective factor for mental health. ","1594":"The aim of the study was to determine whether there is a difference in the intensity of depression, suicidality, and expression of clinical features among adolescents in two different regions of Krapina-Zagorje (KZ) and Split-Dalmatia (SD). The study was designed as a descriptive cross-sectional, the sample consisted of 200 adolescents, 100 from each region, aging 16-18 years, from various high schools. The research was conducted by psychiatrists in Split and Krapina, where school population of Split-Dalmatia County and Krapina-Zagorje County gravitates. For the assessment of depression, the Hamilton rating scale for depression with 21 items was used, which has proven in clinical practice. For the inclusion in the study, among other parameters, participants needed to satisfy the criterion that depression is clinically significant (19 or more points on the HAMD-21). The data obtained points out to statistically significant difference in the intensity of depression between the two regions (p&lt;0.001). There was no difference in suicidal impulses. For the most part, the expression of clinical features between adolescents in these regions showed no significant difference, except that guilt (p=0.001), failing in the work plan and activities (p=0.000) and paranoid ideas (p=0.013) were significantly more expressed in adolescents of Krapina-Zagorje County and sleep disorders (p&lt;0.001) in adolescents of Split-Dalmatia County. It can be concluded that depression, suicidality and much of the clinical features depend on the developmental age, i.e. the turbulent adolescent development, rather than on regional differences, although, to a lesser extent, the expression of clinical features can be influenced by milieu, lifestyle, family dynamics and educational procedures, which can partially affect the expression of clinical features. ","1595":"The aim of the study was to explore the frequency of depression among the general population of adolescents who were high school students in the city of Zagreb. As depression is associated with increased suicidal risk we wanted to check to what extent depression, as an emotional problem among youth, is associated with auto-aggression in the general population of adolescents. The study was conducted on a sample of high school students in Zagreb and it included 701 students of both genders aged from 14-19 years of age. To test the depression a Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was administered for youth between 11-18 years of age (Youth Self Report for ages 11-18). To test auto-aggression a Scale of Auto-destructiveness (SAD) was used. Results obtained by this study show that about 20.7% of high school students have mild and borderline depressive disorders while moderate or severe depression shows about 5% of them, whereby depression is statistically significant among girls who, on average, report more symptoms of depression. It has also been proven a significant impact of depression levels (F (2,423)=35.860, p&lt;0.001) on auto-aggression in subjects of both genders. In both genders, moderately depressed show more auto destructiveness than those without depression symptoms (p&lt;0.01). In the group of heavily depressed (n=30), significantly higher self-destructiveness is shown by girls (p&lt;0.01). The data suggest the importance of early recognition, understanding and treatment of depressive symptoms in adolescents in order to reduce the risk of subsequent chronic psychosocial damage. ","1596":"Risk factors of postpartum depression, although relatively well investigated, remain largely unclear. The aim of this study was to identify the most relevant predictors of postpartum depressive symptomatology that are of clinical importance using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) 3-5 days and 6 to 9 weeks after childbirth. In order to explore predictors of depression, 3-5 days after childbirth, 372 participants fulfilled several questionnaires: Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Impact of Events Scale Revised (IES-R), Big Five Inventory, and questions regarding breastfeeding practice as well as social and demographic factors. Six to nine weeks after childbirth, the same participants fulfilled the following questionnaires: IES-R, EPDS and breastfeeding practice questions. On a multivariate level of analysis, the predictors that increased the odds for postnatal depression symptomatology at the first study point were: unsuccessful breast feeding initiation (odds ratio (OR) 2.58; confidence interval (CI) 1.35-4.91) and personality traits neuroticism (OR 1.16; CI 1.07-1.25.). The predictors that increased the odds for depression symptomatology at the second study phase were: fear for labor outcome (OR 2.44; C1.03-5.80) and the baseline EPDS score (OR 3.32; CI 1.31-8.40). The predictor that decreased the odds at the second study phase was the personality trait Openness (OR 0.9; CI 0.86-0.99). Immediately after childbirth biological and psychological factors seem to be predictive for postpartum symptomatology while later only psychological factors are of greater importance.

The aim of the study was to analyze some epidemiological characteristics of infants with Down syndrome in the western region of Herzegovina in the period between year 1994-2013. We performed a retrospective analysis of hospital records of children who were supervised and treated at Children's Hospital through the twenty-year period. In this period there were 44,100 liveborn infants. Down syndrome was detected in 78 children (54 male and 24 female). The prevalence is estimated at 1.8\/1,000 of live births. Aborted fetuses and stillbirths were not analyzed. 37 (47%) of the parent couples were over 35 years of age. Out of that 65 cytogenetic analysis, a regular type of trisomy 21 was found in 94% of cases, and the translocation in 6%. From major malformations (MM) heart failure was more often present (47%), then the anomaly of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary systems. Ten children (12%) died, most often in the early period of infancy due to complications of the cardiovascular system. The prevalence of DS throughout these two decades has been uniform in the region of western Herzegovina. Improvement in perinatal care in recent years caused higher survival and a better quality of life for the children with DS and thus their families.

A specially structured questionnaire was applied as a research instrument, together with blood sample taking for laboratory analysis of HIV, HBV, HCV and syphilis. Majority of respondents show insufficient knowledge about HIV\/AIDS, ways of transmission prevention, especially knowledge on ways of HIV transmission. Every sixth respondent has experience of intravenous drug use, of which 58% exchanged drug injection equipment. Every fifth respondent with a tattoo had their tattoo done in prison. Below 2% of respondents quote being victims of sexual abuse, and having wilful anal sexual intercourse in prison. Test results in this research: HIV (0), HBV (1.5%), HCV (14.3%) syphilis (0.5%). Intravenous drug use presents the strongest risk factor for HCV, and therefore for HIV\/ STIs.

Aim of this work is to analyze rate of postoperative spine infections at our institution, and to determine eventual risk factors. In our paper we analyze incidence of deep surgical infections after posterior spondylodesis, performed on our Spine department during last 5 years (September 1, 2008 - September 1, 2013). Including criteria were: posterior spondylodesis with transpedicular screws from Th1 to S2 due to different spine indications (injuries, degenerations, deformities, tumors), absence of local or general infection prior the index surgery, surgery performed by the same surgeon (MB). Excluding criteria were: needle procedures (kypho\/vertebro-plasties, nerve root and faset blocades), anterior spine surgeries, cervical spine surgeries, and decompresive surgeries. One hundred sixty five patients with 183 surgeries have been included in this study. Early surgical infection (within a month after the surgery) has appeared at five patients (2.7%). There have been no late surgical infections. Analyzing patients' charts, we have found that Meticillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have caused infections in two patients, while Clebisiela pneumoniae ESBL has caused infection in one patient. Those five patients with infections have had further risk factors: long preoperative hospitalization at four patients, polytrauma, diabetes and advanced age at one patient, each. Three patients with postoperative infection had completely non-titanium surface of implants, and other two had about 20% of non-titanium implant surface, although vast majority of surgeries have been performed by implants whose surface was completely titanium alloy. Infections have appeared between 10-30 postoperative days. In two patients where revision surgeries (debridement, drainage, antibiotic according the species) had been performed in two weeks after appearance of infection, infections have been cured. In three patients where revisions had been postponed for longer than two weeks, additional surgeries (removal of implants) were necessary for curing the infections. This study presented that rate of infection, microbiological species and risk factors are similar to the other orthopedics procedures and other institutions. Early revision is preferable, since it effectively avoids implant removal.

Due to special histologic, anatomic, physical and biomehanic properties of osteoporotic changed bone the laws of biomechanics suggest that stable osteosynthesis for osteoporotic bone is necessary to increase the contact surface of metallic implants and bone and the stability of the screw-plate-bone compound. There are numerous surgical techniques and methods for treatment of osteoporotic proximal humeral fractures. Every surgical procedure has to establish anatomical reduction and stable fixation that will enable early mobilisation. The aim of this study was to present results of internal fixation of proximal humeral osteoporotic fractures with PHILOS locking plate. Between 2007 and 2012, a total of 67 patients older than 65 years with closed proximal humerus fractures underwent surgical treatment with PHILOS plate system (Synthes, Switzerland). 42 patients were operated with deltopectoral approach and 25 with deltoid split approach. After a mean follow up period of 14.68 (6-28) months functional and radiologic results were assessed. We noted 9 postoperative complications related to surgical technique (1 intraarticular screw placement, 1 displacement in major tuberculum fragment, 1 displacement in major tuberculum fragment along with oblique placement of the plate, 2 cases of inadequate reduction, 1 case of humeral head avascular necrosis, varus humeral head fixation in 3 cases). None of the patients developed superficial or deep surgical infection. There was no nonunions. In the final evaluation, the Constant shoulder score was 91.75 (72-100). In this study PHILOS locking plate showed good applicability, respecting bone biologic properties because of negligible interference with blood supply of the humeral head.

Despite the role that social media obviously plays in the development of mental illness, little research has been done into the impact that social media has on in the mental illness of young people. In general, what research there is points towards social media having a large impact on young people in both positive and negative ways. In particular, certain studies show a greater incidence and severity of bullying online compared to offline which may contribute to the development of depression. This contrasts with the positive impact that social media seems to have for young people in minority groups (ethnic minorities and those with chronic disease or disability) by allowing them to connect with others who live similar lives despite geographical separation. This acts as a positive influence in these people's lives though a direct link to mental illness was not shown. Overall, several important issues are raised: firstly, the lack of research that has been conducted in the area; secondly, the gulf that exists between the generation of younger, 'digital native' generations and the older generations who are not as engaged with social media; and finally, the huge potential that exists for the use of social media as a protective influence for adolescents. With proper engagement, policy makers and health professionals could use social media to connect with young people on issues like mental health.

","1611":"Antipsychotics, particularly atypical antipsychotics, are known to have metabolic side effects such as; weight gain, hyperlipidaemia and insulin resistance. This is problematic as metabolic syndrome can be a precursor to many diseases, including type II diabetes and coronary heart disease. In an attempt to overcome these side-effects, lifestyle changes have been recommended in tandem with commencement of atypical antipsychotics, but is this effective at halting metabolic syndrome? There is some evidence suggesting that lifestyle changes can reduce weight gain caused by atypical antipsychotics. However, there seems to be a paucity of evidence about whether this correlates with correction of metabolic dysregulation. Moreover, there is a lack of research into the precise mechanism of metabolic syndrome as caused by atypical antipsychotics,as well as a lack of evidence into how exercise remedies this. Furthermore, there is research to suggest that the pathophysiology of psychosis may lead to metabolic dysregulation independently of treatment. Lifestyle changes should still be part of a treatment as they seem to partially reverse metabolic changes seen with atypical antipsychotics. However, more research is needed to identify weight independent mechanisms for metabolic dysregulation seen in those taking atypical antipsychotics in order to solve this pressing issue.

A qualitative literature search was conducted to review the evidence to support these changes, and identify randomized controlled trials on off-label and newer SGAs. With respect to atypical antipsychotics, NICE guidelines introduced olanzapine and fluoxetine combination therapy as first line treatment for moderate to severe bipolar depression; and improved clarity on the treatment of mania, hypomania and rapid cycling bipolar disorder. Evidence from our literature search favour these changes; and recognized other atypical antipsychotics such as aripiprazole, asenapine, lurasidone, ziprasidone and clozapine which could be of potential clinical benefit. ","1613":"Antipsychotic drugs are commonly combined in psychiatric practice in an attempt to treat schizophrenia. Such practice is widespread, despite the lack of explicit endorsement by many of the main regulatory bodies. There are varying rationales behind combining these potent drugs-either to augment the effect of a drug whose action alone is inadequate for patients with treatment resistant schizophrenia (TRS), or to improve the side effects seen due to treatment. Augmentations are most frequently observed with clozapine, a drug reserved for use when other antipsychotic medications have failed. Several drugs have been chosen as adjuvants, including aripiprazole, sulpiride, amisulpiride and risperidone. A small number of RCTs (randomized controlled trials) have been performed but, despite this data and numerous case reports showing positive changes in symptomatology, Cochrane reviews of available studies have been unable to definitively confirm the efficacy of these combinations, frequently citing the need for larger, longer term, prospective studies.Evidence for benefits of combination therapy on side effects is also inadequate. Some RCTs and case series have shown they can positively alter side effects due to drugs such as clozapine, e.g. metabolic side effects. However, despite many of the combinations being relatively well tolerated, there is some evidence they can cause adverse effects of their own. More evidence is essential as, on the current data alone, it is not possible to make a firm recommendation on the efficacy and safety of antipsychotic combinations. In addition it is vital that the importance of a fair trial of monotherapy at adequate dosages is reinforced to clinicians, so that patients are not put onto these relatively unknown treatment strategies unnecessarily. ","1614":"Most of the prognostic factors of bipolar disorder, which determine disease course and outcome, could be detected from simple but often-unrecorded questions asked during the psychiatric clinic assessments. In previous parts of this research, we analysed various prognostic factors and focused on mixed states and rapid cycling subsets.

We collected data from the clinical notes of 70 English bipolar and 8 Italian bipolar outpatients seen at the initial psychiatric assessment clinic about socio-demographic and clinical factors to determine whether various factors had relevance to prevalence, prognosis, or outcome. The sample comprised 16 bipolar I (22.9%) and 54 bipolar II (77.1%) English outpatients and 7 bipolar I (87.5%) and 1 bipolar II (12.5%) Italian outpatients. Differences between the groups are seen mainly in terms of age of onset, duration of both depressive and hypomanic episodes, presence of psychiatric family history, incidence of mixed state features and rapid cycling, presence of elated mood in response to past antidepressant treatment, and misuse of illicit drugs and alcohol. In order to promote improved mental health primary care, mental health systems in all countries should develop standardized epidemiological tools that are shared between countries. We recommend the use of a questionnaire that reminds clinicians of potentially prognostic information and suggest that this might identify important components of a potential standardized diagnostic and prognostic tool.

Mixed states features do similarly and are known to present an increased risk to patients. Early recognition of these patterns can lead to better treatment strategies and improvement of the long-term course of the disease. We collected data from the clinical notes of 70 bipolar outpatients seen at an ASPA (initial assessment) clinic about socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. The sample comprised 16 bipolar I (22.9%) and 54 bipolar II (77.1%) outpatients; percentages reported in our results are of the sample for which the data was available. 71.7% (33 patients) of the sample reported mixed states features and 32 patients (72.7%) are recorded to have more than 4 changes in mood in a year. There were no statistically significant correlations between mixed state features or rapid cycling and anhedonia, suicidal ideation, borderline symptoms, OCD symptoms, anxiety, positive psychiatric family history, current alcohol use, previous alcohol use, current illicit drug use, or previous illicit drug use. An almost significant correlation was found between mixed state features and anxiety. Assignation of a care coordinator did not seem to be associated with these prognostic factors. The two subgroups of mixed state features and rapid cycling patients share very common clinical characteristics: high incidence of suicidal thoughts, high levels of anxiety, and high previous substance use - but low levels of current alcohol and drug use and high levels of features of atypical depression. These features of mixed state bipolar disorder and rapid cycling bipolar disorder should be identified during psychiatric assessment to identify useful information for prognosis.

More research is needed to consolidate the findings of these studies. ","1618":"Since the introduction of antipsychotic medication for the treatment of psychosis, a wide range of different types of antipsychotic drugs have been developed while their side effects have become evident. The side effects of both the typical and atypical generation of antipsychotics have important consequences for the quality of life of recipients, stigma experienced and also the level of care of patients. It is well acknowledged that the side effects of antipsychotics reduce compliance with the medication. In this review the data for an association between typical and atypical antipsychotics and the main side effects that are well-supported in the literature was explored: weight gain and associated metabolic effects; extrapyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesia; prolactin elevation and associated sexual effects; QTc elongation; and a group of miscellaneous side effects. It has been demonstrated that the production of adverse effects following the use of antipsychotic medication differs widely both between atypical and typical drugs but also within these subgroups. Considering the wide range of antipsychotics available amongst both groups and the differing effects they have on patients in terms of side effects, there is reason to believe that a more personalised approach to antipsychotic treatment should be considered.

The authors present a review of existing literature relating to the pathophysiology and presentation of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, prior to proposing a management pathway avoiding delays to treatment incurred through misdiagnosis or inappropriate referral. Acute care physicians should have a low threshold for suspecting anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis in any patient presenting with acute psychosis in the context of non-specific coryzal and constitutional symptoms in whom infective causes have been excluded.

On day 2, they were subjected to the Trier Social Stress Test, a psychosocial stress paradigm, 22 minutes after which they took the other version of DAS. Stress did not affect the DAS score in either group. Brief psychosocial stress does not appear to influence negative assumptions in healthy young adults with or without a past history of depression. It is possible that this is because dysfunctional assumptions, unlike self-schemas, are not latent. More long-term stresses may be needed to activate negative thoughts to a level where risk of depression is increased. ","1625":"OCD is a condition seen often in Community Mental Health Teams in England. It is treated with medication and psychology. We wanted to assess what co-morbidities were present in our OCD patients, with which medications they were being treated, and whether patients had received psychological treatment. On assessment It is clear that a very large number of the OCD patients in our cohort are complex patients who have not responded to first line treatment, such as SSRIs or basic psychology, and who suffer from co-morbidities. Treatment of these patients, while oriented towards the achievement of recovery, is also relatively complex and long term. ","1626":"In 2011, the FDA published guidelines regarding the prescribing of citalopram and escitalopram following publication of evidence showing prolongation of the QT period at therapeutic doses. This paper looked at the impact of these guidelines on the prescribing practices of clinicians in one centre. It showed that clinicians have changed practices in accordance with the guidelines for citalopram but no clear patterns were seen in escitalopram or when looking individually at thespecific guidelines for patients over 60 years of age. There was no evidence of increased concordance by clinicians with the guidelines in patients taking other QT prolonging drugs who are at additional risk. Overall, the guidelines have made an impact on practice but this is partial and 2% of all patients still remain on regimes that do not fit the guidelines. The possible reasons for this are explored. ","1627":"This article outlines the use of the multidisciplinary approach to mood disorders in the Short Stay Psychiatric Unit (SSPU) in Mater Dei Hospital, Msida, Malta. An audit was carried out on all patients whose first admission to SSPU was in 2008 and who were diagnosed with having a mood disorder. The aim was to see whether the use of a multidisciplinary approach is in actual fact affecting patient outcome or not. The latter was measured by recording whether the patients needed any further admission and if this was the case, the length in days leading to their 2nd admission. ","1628":"We aimed to evaluate the outcomes of Petals: a charitable organisation in Cambridgeshire. Petals provides counselling for women and couples who have suffered perinatal bereavement, or trauma during pregnancy or birth. This paper attempts to evaluate the effect of counseling interventions at this difficult time. Outcomes were recorded in 42 patients using the CORE (Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation) system. CORE was developed to assess the effectiveness of psychological therapies. CORE-OM (CORE Outcome Measure) involves a questionnaire that assesses subjective well-being, symptoms \/ problems, function, and risk to self and others. The CORE-OM questionnaire was completed before and after the counselling sessions. The CORE-OM scores were summated into a global representation of severity. Severity decreased in all patients. Symptoms of psychological pathology were also decreased in all cases. A review of the available literature indicates that little is known about the efficacy of therapy for perinatal bereavement and trauma. These original data suggest convincing efficacy and benefits, but the numbers involved are small.Further trials with greater sample sizes are required.

In order to support the prevention and treatment of depression through sport, it seems particularly useful, to encourage the practice of moderate, diversified physical activity. ","1630":"The focus of this article is to show that in Italy nowadays it is not important to relate psychopathology with violence. That is because it seems that it is more important to study gender and domestic violence as a social and cultural phenomenon than analyzing its psychopathological issues. Obviously, in accord with the literature there is a relationship about psychopatholgy and violence and this relationship concerns only about 5% of the total violence reported.

","1632":"Workplace aggression constitutes a serious problem in individual, organizational and social cause-effect relations. The aim is to determine the prevalence of such aggression on the pilot sample to test the appropriateness of the research design for the further conduct of a national survey on the specified topic. The sample included 113 employees in the city of Split, deployed within the public, profit and non-profit sectors. The research was conducted through an online survey. The questionnaire consisted of pre-coded questions on the socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents and their perception of interrelations with colleagues and clients\/customers of products and services, exposure to various forms of physical and verbal aggression and the frequency of somatic and psychical problems caused by the workplace conditions and interrelations in this context. Although participants did not suffer direct physical assault from associates, and only two of them have experienced it from clients\/customers, they emphasize the frequency of psychical workplace abuse through more subtle forms of physical and verbal aggression.The training of employees at all hierarchical levels is required for the better understanding of the roles of their associates and clients\/customers. Its effects strengthen their mutual respect, tolerance and solidarity. In this way, the interrelations that many respondents do not see as good or excellent can be improved, hence improving the prevention of aggression. The study of aggression should include a broader social context. Aggression tends towards a quantitative and qualitative expansion in different environments. When individuals seek some benefit for themselves in a dubious way, while neglecting others, aggressive acts are foreseeable. Therefore, Croatian society has the foundation for aggressive behavior, as it is unable to make the consensual practice of a moral, political and economic recovery. ","1633":"The initial enthusiasm for atypical antipsychotics, with a lower incidence of extra pyramidal symptoms, was tempered by the association with metabolic disorders. The presence of metabolic alterations significantly influences morbidity and patients' quality life. We performed this open-study to determine the relationship between antipsychotic efficacy and side effects, especially the impact of various antipsychotics on metabolic parameters after 20-year treatment with atypical (SGA) and typical antipsychotics (FGA). 62 psychiatric schizophrenic inpatients treated with typical (haloperidol) and atypical (clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole) antipsychotics were studied over 20 years. Some biological parameters such as blood arterial pressure, lipidic and glucidic profile, liver enzymes, complete blood count, electrocardiogram and body weight (and body mass index) were collected. The results have demonstrated a not homogeneous statistically significant variation of the lipidic and glicidic profile but we have also found a reduction of the recorded values at endpoint vs baseline in aripiprazole and haloperidol groups vs clozapine, olanzapine, and quetiapine groups. We want to point out that to endpoint of the period of observation (20 years) the patients with typical antipsychotics haloperidol reported satisfactory and a better glycemic and lipidic profiles than previous pharmacological treatments with antipsychotics of second generation. Optimal monitoring should include assessments of fasting glucose, lipids, cholesterol, and blood pressure. ","1634":"The crisis of the couple in today's society, increases the number of singles and causes difficulty in creating stable and lasting relationships over time. The last two censuses of the Italian population show an increase in the number of singles, especially among the young generation. From this figure we have tried to understand the causes of this phenomenon both from the point of view of sociology and psychology. The sociologist Baumann considers the crisis of the couple and the increase in singles as a result of the crisis of modern society. The author says that we live in a fluid world where everything changes quickly and there is nothing stable and this also affects the couple. From a psychological point of view, reference has been made to all that psychoanalytic writers from Freud, have said about the crisis of the couple. It is clear that some subjects have difficulty maintaining stable and long-lasting relationships because they are suffering from philophobia (fear of love). We have tried to understand what the causes of different types of philophobia for both men and women are. It was found that the origins are created in the early childhood relationships with their parents. It 'was found that people who have had problems in their childhood relationships with their parents, because of their lack of love, tend to reproduce in adulthood the same dysfunctional relational model, learned in childhood. ","1635":"Psychosocial rehabilitation, and choral singing in particular, allow the recovery of lost or compromised ability of patients with mental illness and they facilitate the reintegration of the user in his family and into his social context. The choral singing, used as an operational tool for psychosocial rehabilitation, allowed users of the Day Centre of the Unit of Mental Health Torre del Greco ASL NA 3 South to achieve concrete goals of rehabilitation: improvement of self-care and self-esteem, the management of emotions, the growing of their interests, the integration and socialization overcoming the isolation of their mental suffering. In particular patients with mood disorders have been significantly benefited from the rehabilitation activity. They improved their mood and all the related diseases and the quality of their life with the result of a positive therapeutic implication. The singing group and for some individuals, also psychotherapy and drug therapy, have allowed users to improve their lives and give them a concrete integration into the society. Working in a group with patients, caregivers, family members, volunteers, social workers allowed a consolidated rehabilitation with the passing of time.Using the chorus group \"Sing that you go\" as an operational tool for psychosocial rehabilitation and therapeutic element we promote the psychological well-being and the enhancement of mood. ","1636":"Individuals, who work in an organization, develop a shared perception that influences their behavior and emotions. This perception guides operators in the interpretation of the main business processes and in the modes of decision-making. The Italian Ministry of Public Administration in 2004 issued a directive to improve the organizational well-being and the emotional state of the environment in the workplace. This law identifies the necessity of an organizational climate that fosters creativity at the workplace, for the development and the efficiency of public administration. Several studies have shown that the development of creativity in the operators becomes a resource for the organization to facilitate the adaptation to change and to the solution of problems. So the techniques of creativity can be used as a training strategy for the quality management and human resources, optimizing services.

In particular, patients with schizophrenia, psychotic and mood disorders had a concrete benefit from such rehabilitation activities, facilitating interpersonal relationships, therapy compliance and significantly improved mood, quality of life, providing them with the rhythm and the security in their relationship with each other. The dance group and for some individuals, also psychotherapy and drug therapy, have facilitated social inclusion, improved the quality of life and cured their diseases. The work is carrying out in a group with patients, practitioners, family members, volunteers, social community workers, following the operating departmental protocols.

","1638":"We examined all psychiatric consultations carried out over 3 years at the Emergency Room (ER) of the hospital of Perugia, with the aim of describing the epidemiologic characteristics of patients with any psychiatric illness and their management. We also assessed the distribution of psychiatric emergencies over this period of observation. We recruited patients consecutively admitted to the ER, between June the 20th 2011 and June the 20th 2014, for which a psychiatric consultation was required. We analysed socio-demographic and clinical data as well as the type of long-range plan after discharge. Continuous variables were presented as means and standard deviations. Categorical variables were presented as number and percentages. For comparing the means we used the Student's t-test. For analyzing the association between categorical variables we performed Pearson's chi-squared test or the Fisher's exact test where appropriate. We considered significant test results with p&lt;0.05. The post-hoc analyses were carried out by means of standardized Pearson residuals, in order to assess the significance of the cell-wise divergences from homogeneity. Spearman's correlations were computed for reasons for a psychiatric consultation request across months. Multinomial logistics regression model was used for analyzing the variability of the reasons for the admission to the ER for the 12 months. Statistical analyses were performed using the R software v 3.1. Neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders were the most represented. The most frequent approach to patients with psychiatric complaints did not imply the use of psychopharmacological treatments or coercive interventions. No particular seasonality of psychopathology was observed. ERs may represent the place where the first psychiatric visit occurs and a point of reference for the chronic patients. It can also represent an opportunity for further examination of organic comorbidity. ","1639":"\"Invito alla Vita\" is a community-based suicide prevention project that officially started in Trentino in late 2008. The project was promoted by the local Health Services, trying from the beginning to involve other community subjects, and has been working over five years and a half in different directions, particularly promoting a phone help-line. The aims of the Invito alla Vita (IaV) Help Line have been clear from the beginning: decrease the sense of loneliness, offer encouragement and support, promote engagement with health services, reduce stigma and prejudice. Contrary to popular misconceptions, talking with people about suicide will not increase suicide risk, neither will it induce patients to commit suicide.The volunteers involved in the IaV help-line offer people empathic listening without judgment and easy tips, to reduce loneliness, sadness and supply reassurance that other people care. In this study we tried to deepen our knowledges about the volunteers' motivations and necessities to use them for creating a better system of support: we realized indeed that continuous training and supervision, along with official awards given by community institutions, are basic factors to sustain the volunteers' motives to cooperate with the help line.

This paper aims to present the authorized operative protocols of no restraint methods and data from the first four years experience of no restraint management in the psychiatric Department of Trento. Avoiding physical restraint and confinement force every member of the ward staff to look for innovative solutions and means a deeper and strenuous engagement of the staff in the therapeutic relationship. We are aware that this is basically a small thing, and that certainly it will create many contradictions. We chose to stay on the other hand in these contradictions, and to witness that it is possible, and indeed useful. The great lesson we learnt over past years in Community Psychiatry was that only the hard experience of these contradictions can allow people to regain health, not just as assimilation to stereotyped models, but as adhibition of resources and self-determination, normally stolen by psychiatric illness.

Unlike other European countries, such as England and France, where migration is linked to a colonial past, Italy has only recently found itself faced with a tumultuous transformation of identity, becoming from a country of emigration, an immigration country. In light of all this, this work stems from the need to shed light on the relationship between social integration and development of psychiatric disorders in migrants, with particular attention to the correlation between migration and psychotic pathology. Finally, the elaboration of various issues related to the migration process will be dealt with, placing the priority on investigating the greater psychiatric morbidity in migrants compared with natives.

The educational process involves the complete growth of each and completes the infinite possibilities that every child has potential since birth. Education also is a necessity for the human being, as only adequate environmental stimulation causes the mental processes to begin. In fact, the higher intellectual functions, such as language, thought, memory, emerge only from social and educational experiences of the child. The educational surgery creates experiences and learning that allow the person to change by improving the efficiency of synaptic connections. Clinical pedagogy has developed in Italy in the last decades of the twentieth century with the aim of research and experimenting educational purposes suitable for different situations in order to provide each subject with appropriate development opportunities. Clinical pedagogical support is offered in the form of artistic or bodily activities and represents for the individual a positive environment that allows the development of different brain areas and the potential inherent in them.

","1649":"Mixed states represent a controversial topic in the current psychiatry. The definitions and the diagnostic criteria have changed over the past years. The new DSM-5 classification will have a substantial impact in several fields: epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, research, education, and regulations. We reviewed the latest literature by using the key words \"mixed states\" and \"agitated depression\" on the PubMed. Although there is a great expectation about the validity of the new DSM-5 mixed states diagnosis, little is known about its application on large population study but the formulation of less restrictive and more specific criteria for the diagnosis of mixed states represent a starting point for future researches, mainly in consideration of the fact that previous classifications consider the MS a superposition of manic and depressive symptoms, underestimating the clinical complexity and the wider phenomenologic variability of these conditions. Clinical trials need to address treatment effects according to the presence or absence of mixed features in consideration of the fact that replacing in the bipolar spectrum patients that traditionally are considered to be affected by unipolar depression, represent a topical research hypothesis and has a practical remarkable importance in the appropriate therapeutic choice. ","1650":"As is clear from research accredited by the ONU, the violence suffered by the partner, husband or other family members is the leading cause of death and disability for women aged 15 to 44 years. The WHO has also shown that at least one in five women suffers a beating or any form of violence in herl lifetime. Gender-based violence is undoubtedly a widespread phenomenon on a worldwide scale regardless of ethnicity, religion, social class,or level of education. It is a traumatic experience that produces different effects depending on the type of violence and the person who is the victim. There is a close relationship of cause and effect between violence and health status of women. They are in fact relevant primary effects related to the consequences of direct physical violence on the body and the side effects associated with mental and physical damage to repetitive exposure and situations of traumatic impact. The health consequences can be of different nature,rainging from Physical, Psychological and Behavioral, Sexual and Reproductive, to Death. The first important Psychological consequences are Depressive Disorder and Anxiety. The objective of this study was to analyze, through the administration of diagnostic tests, the methods of the links of the subjects on the one hand, attachment and relationships on the other; grouped in practice to detect if there is a close relationship between a Depressive Disorder and Violence suffered. 20 women aged between 23 and 50 years who have experienced various forms of violence, were randomly selected and followed by the three anti-violence centers of Calabria. The Separation Anxiety Depressive trait that explains the current Depression is not the result of the violence, but it is due to lack of self-confidence, difficulty im being identified and ability to plan for their lives. These difficulties are established in the woman through an enmeshed relationship with her partner, in fact, what has emerged is the establishment of an Insecure Attachment. Women who have been raped are traumatized individuals, who have not recovered from trauma, and therefore are vulnerable to pain. In relationships that have established themselves they feel responsible for what they have now (guilt, lack self-confidence, difficulty in separating); denying Separation Anxiety and remaining trapped in a violent relationship. The term Separation Anxiety denotes an aspect of behaviour, considered as a pathological form as well as clarified by the DSM V (even in adults); In fact, this is the separation anxiety which is manifested by extreme anxiety and those who suffer from it are tied more to the partner and\/or parents that are the very cause of the symptom. This discomfort is related to childhood, therefore, the evidence suggests that there is a close relationship between what one has lived in that era and adult life. Women victims of violence, must overcome the separation anxiety that has been established as a result of trauma, the latter if not processed coincides with the shame and the guilt. This will be possible if they are given valid support, which is psychological \/ psychotherapeutic and pharmacological , to accompany and support them towards a new lease of life. ","1651":"To investigate whether a brief, contact based anti-stigma interventionentitled, 'The Wounded Healer' can positively influence participants' views towards mental health challenges in medical students and doctors. We also wanted to raise awareness of the importance of registering witha General Practitioner (GP) and consulting him\/her when under mental distress. Despite the perception that medical students and doctors should be 'invincible', mental health challenges are common in this population. Doctors and medical students have low levels of help-seeking for their own psychiatric problems often only presenting to mental health services once a crisis arises. Fear of exposure to stigmatization is a critical factor contributing to symptom concealment and is a major barrier to accessing mental health services. The Wounded Healer was delivered to participants in 6 cohorts across the United Kingdom (UK): Cambridge Medical School (n=97), Manchester Medical School (n=36), Manchester University International Society (n=25), Sheffield Medical School (n=21), Foundation Doctors in the North West of England (n=54) and Southampton Medical School (n=23) (total sample size n=256). Immediately following the intervention, we hand distributed paper questionnaires that contained stigma constructs to each individual participant.Answers were on a Likert-type scale and there was also space for free-text comments which were subjected to thematic analysis. 174\/219 (79.5%) of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that their views towards mental health issues were more positive after the talk. 172\/219 (78.5%) of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the talk made them more understanding and accepting of medical students and doctors with mental illness. 156\/219 (71.3%) of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the talk made them more aware of the importance of registering with a GP and consulting him\/her if they felt they were under mental distress. Following the delivery of the anti-stigma Wounded Healer intervention a majority of respondents stated that they viewed mental health challenges in medical students and doctors in a more positive way. A majority of respondents also demonstrated a better awarenessof registering and consulting a GP if they develop mental distress. Further research which incorporates validated assessments of stigma (at baseline and at follow-up points after the intervention has been delivered), a control group and larger sample sizes are needed to determine if the Wounded Healer intervention can cause a sustained reduction in the stigma associated with mental health challenges in healthcare professionals and encourage help-seeking behaviour for mental health challenges.

While depression is overall less common in older people compared to younger people, there are sub-groups of elderly, such as those with significant medical comorbidity, who are at greatly elevated risk for depression. Negative consequences of late-life depression include functional decline and disability, increased use of non-mental health services, increased mortality rates due to cardiovascular causes, increased cancer rates, and substantially greater risk for suicide. Geriatric suicide is a global epidemic, which is worsened in many countries and cultures by socioeconomic disparities and cultural\/social upheaval. Geriatric depression should be carefully assessed and treated. Treatments for geriatric depression include biological modalities such as antidepressant medications and Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) as well as psychotherapy and psychosocial interventions. When they are prescribed pharmacotherapies for depression, older adults are especially likely to experience adverse drug effects as a result of their multiple chronic diseases, use of multiple concomitant medications, and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes that accompany aging. Antidepressants that minimize side effects are generally preferred in elderly individuals although the expected therapeutic response to drug treatment is generally modest. Psychosocial and psychotherapeutic measures can also be effective in late-life depression. Complexities of assessment and treatment include the risk of missing a bipolar depressive diagnosis, which would contra-indicate the use of antidepressant monotherapy. Given the projected increased proportions and overall numbers of older people with mental disorders there is a need for all clinicians to be familiar with mental health issues in elderly patients.

In 12 suicidal therapy-resistant depressed patients accelerated intermittent TBS was delivered on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in a randomized, sham-controlled cross-over fashion. Patients received 20 sessions spread over 4 days. The change in severity of suicidal ideation was measured by the Beck Scale of Suicidal Ideation (SSI) before and after treatment. We found a significant decrease of SSI score over time; unrelated to active or sham stimulation. Furthermore, the attenuation of suicidal thinking was not merely related to depression severity changes caused by TBS. Accelerated TBS treatment in depressed suicidal patients was found to be safe and well tolerated and may have the potential to acutely decrease suicidal ideations.

These changes lead to the issue of the equity of care for all groups of society, particularly for ethnic minorities. Within the context of medicine, it has been proven that doctors are sensitive to patient ethnicity, and that this in turn affects doctors' decision-making and the quality of their relationship with the patient. This leads to reduced access and quality of care for ethnic minority patients, which in turn magnifies ethnic inequalities in health care. Little is known about the extent of this issue within the specific field of mental health care. We conducted a literature search within three online databases, focusing on two main questions: (I) What are the main types of disparity observed in the provision of mental health care for ethnic minority patients? and (II) How do mental health care providers contribute to disparities in the mental health status of ethnic minority patients? We identified a total of 164 articles relevant to our research questions, published between 1989 and 2013. Of these, only 29 were retained. The main findings are summarised in this paper. Mental health care providers should be constantly aware of potential bias due to patient ethnicity and of the potential impact of this bias on the process of care if they want to act in the best interests of patients and avoid contributing to mental health disparities. The contribution of mental health care providers to these disparities is only one aspect of this complex social issue.

The psychological factors are also important. We found it useful to present a clinical case of a patient who presented with symptoms of hypersexuality and to discuss the diagnosis and the management. Data collection was based on the case of a patient hospitalized in the Department of Psychosomatic medicine in CHU Mont-Godinne - Yvoir - Belgium in February 2013. For the literature review, we used the database PubMed with the following keywords: hypersexuality, dementia. A total of 40 articles were selected for this study. The patient had symptoms of hypersexuality, and hyperorality in the context of delirium induced by benzodiazepine withdrawal. A blood test and brain imaging were normal. She was put under risperidone 2 mg with complete resolution of symptoms within a few days. The diagnosis of Kluver-Bucy syndrome in the context of a minor neurocognitive disorder was retained. Management is mainly non-pharmacological using behavioral techniques. The education of the patient, his partner and caregivers are essential. Pharmacotherapy is sometimes necessary. It is reserved as a last resort because of the serious side effects of the drugs used. ","1663":"Bipolar disorder (BPD) has over the last fifteen years been considered as a biological disease with genetic bases, possibly triggered by stress factors. On the basis of a clinical case, we will question this theory. Mrs. X, a patient with a history of domestic violence, has two manic episodes that corresponded with conjugal difficulties. This would lead us to believe that stressful life events may have triggered the onset and the relapse of the illness of our patient. To confirm this, we made a literature review with the keywords bipolar disorder, stress, family functioning and domestic violence on three databases: PubMed, PsycInfo and PsycArticles. Studies show that BPD has likely genetic and biological origins. It is also established in the literature that stressful life events influence the course of the disease, with for example the \"Kindling\" effect. However, there is very few data regarding the precise nature of these events. It is also established that the family interactions are affected by the BPD. Nonetheless, little is known about the influence of the family's interactions on the onset of the disease. Our clinical case raises the question of the stress factors that may influence the onset and the course of BPD. It also raises the question of the possible link between BPD and domestic violence and the question of theeffect of stressors on the genetic and biological factors, introducing a more psychodynamic view of BPD. Further research on this subject should allow us to expand the treatment to more comprehensive care. ","1664":"The epidemiology of anxiety disorders in adolescence is different from that of adults. Furthermore, some clinical disorders seem to be linked to the specific adolescence period. This article intends to make a literature review. Besides the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM-5 (DSM IV-TR) and the French reference books, we chose to conduct our research on PubMed, Medline, PsycINFO and PsycARTICLES. It seems obvious in the literature that the prevalence and the epidemiology of different anxiety disorders in adolescence is different from that in adulthood. Anxiety disorders most frequently encountered in adolescence are social phobia and generalized anxiety disorder, as compared to adulthood where most viewed clinical disorders concern specific phobias. Moreover, a large proportion of patients with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) are teenagers and there is a high comorbidity of BDD with anxiety disorders, particularly with social phobia and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and with depressive disorders. However, literature still does not show clear epidemiological or prognostic data about anxiety disorders in the specific period of adolescence. Finally, there seems to exist in the identified categories, clinical sub-entities that require specific nosology to this age group. If a specific classification of teenage anxiety disorders is well and truly necessary, its organizational principle would have to reflect the fundamental question of this age: the prognosis of these different clinical presentations. More extensive research on the impact of different identifiable characteristics of these disorders, biological and environmental factors, associated comorbidities and possible significant functional impairment, would be very useful for the improvement of diagnostic sensitivity and prognostic predictions in psychiatric clinical practice of the anxiety disorders in adolescent patients. ","1665":"This article aims at determining the place of benzodiazepines in the current treatment of anxiety disorders in opposition to antidepressants, neuroleptics and anticonvulsants. Belgium and France are the only two European countries which prescribe the most benzodiazepines despite the dissuasion of the international guidelines (NICE) issued in the nineties concerning the high risk of dependance of these molecules. What about the respect of these guidelines and the use of benzodiazepines in general practice in 2014? Review of the literature with the following key words \"anxiety disorder, benzodiazepines, anxiolytic, treatment\" in the international database of PubMed, Medline, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES and consulting of various reference books. No class of molecules could measure up to benzodiazepines until now, neither from the point of view of efficiency, nor from the point of view of cost-efficiency. This is why the guidelines (NICE) discourage the few available alternatives in the general practice. International figures from Belgium and France show a continuous increase in the use of benzodiazepines in the treatment of anxiety disorders, even after the nineties. Given the fact that benzodiazepines differ from one another at the level of their action profile (graphical representation in \"stars\") and are therefore able to relieve several symptoms simultaneously, these molecules still respond nowadays to many expectations of the clinical practitioners. The divergence between the guidelines and the practice confirm the irreplaceability of benzodiazepines at the present time. Nevertheless, the expectation of new molecules with fewer side effects should be investigated in further research. ","1666":"A pharmaceutical firm that has an antidepressant is a happy one for 1\/5 of the population is likely to consume it. A pharmaceutical firm that has an antipsychotic is less happy since the prevalence of schizophrenic and other psychotic disorders is stable, and averages around only 1-2%. However, between 1997 and 2007, the daily consumption of neuroleptic drugs has increased by 14% in Belgium! Whatcommunication strategies have been implemented to promote their sales? Four messages have been identified and examined: 1) These disorders are serious and require the systematic prescription of neuroleptics; 2) These are chronic disorders for which we must consider lifelong treatment, preferably as \"deposit\"; 3) schizophrenia, in particular, has a peak prevalence at 18: Young people should be monitored; 4) There are means of early detection of at-risk youth that must be addressed at this stage with neuroleptics. 1) YES these disorders are serious and require the prescription of neuroleptics, HOWEVER 2) At least 40% of patients do NOT display a chronic evolution and the \"deposit\" forms should be reserved for certain situations; 3) YES, schizophrenia has a peak prevalence at 18, and young people must be monitored, However 4) Our ability to achieve pre-diagnosis is limited. If prescribing neuroleptic drugs to all at-risk youth might prevent the onset of the disorders, it would also result in prescribing them to some persons who do not need them two out of five times. From these four arguments, only one is valid whereas the remaining three are only partially valid; nevertheless, since the advent of second generation antipsychotic drugs, their consumption has increased by 14% in 10 years.

This paper seeks to explore fundamental requirements of the consultation by exploring empathy, integrity, and the understanding of the human self, using concepts taken from Neuroscience, Group Analysis, Philosophy and Theology. It then introduces a plan for a study aimed at assessing the impact of a specific form of teaching consultation on the patient. ","1668":"CRHT services have reduced admissions to psychiatric hospitals. Some patients use CRHT services repeatedly. We reviewed the first 30 patients who were repeat users of the CRHT services, Luton, between 1 August 2010 and 31 July 2011. The repeat users were a small group of patients needing disproportionately large amounts of resources from the CRHT service. The factors associated with repeat use of CRHT were past psychiatric admission and the diagnoses of emotionally unstable personality disorder, self-harm behaviour and substance misuse. Identifying the factors leading to repeat CRHT use could lead to providing a more tailored service and reduce repeat use of these services. It appears that repeat CRHT service use might be the result of the interaction of a wide range of factors relating to underlying disorder, substance misuse, self harm behaviour, employment status and social support. It is also important to note that many of the patients are liable to relapse as they go through stressful life situations, despite adequate medication and psychosocial intervention. It can be difficult to identify all the factors that contribute to a pattern of repeat presentation to CRHT services. However, identification of such factors might help clinicians to offer more targeted services and might also assist commissioners in focusing resources effectively. They might need more intensive community-based programs to identify and treat the relapses. The CRHT teams should include all the appropriate professional disciplines required to provide community care for these challenging service users.

Even the neurobiological processes of the brain show similarities in all addictive disorders. Gambling is more and more shifted into the cyberspace owing to the global expansion of the internet. The addictive potential of online-gambling seems to be higher than offline, though, which is also reflected by the patient population of the outpatient clinic for gambling addiction in Linz. This fact poses a challenge for the persons affected, therapists, gambling providers, legislator the society as a whole. ","1671":"Online gaming is more and more common and increasingly accessible.

Fifty (50) subjects participated in the study. Insomnia and sexual performance were evaluated before and after 4 weeks of hypnotic treatment. At week four, both treatments improved sleep quality to a similar degree. Sexual function also improved significantly with both treatments, with no significant difference between the groups. In post-menopausal women, sexual problems and sleep problems may be related and solving sleep problems may help sexual functioning, independently of depression. ","1679":"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among parents of neonates hospitalized in the Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) stays an underestimated problem. We determined the incidence of PTSD in parents and pointed out medical and demographic risk factors for PTSD in neonates hospitalized in the NICU. The study involved 39 mothers and 27 fathers of 42 infants aged 1 to 16 months who were hospitalized in the NICU of a Children's University Hospital during the neonatal period. As a measure of PTSD we used the Polish version of the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). The current level of stress was measured using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). The author's questionnaire contained demographic and medical information on the infants hospitalized in the NICU and their parents. Data were statistically analyzed. The incidence of PTSD and levels of stress did not differ in the group of mothers and fathers. There was a statistically significant difference in the severity of PTSD symptoms in general (p=0.006) and the severity of symptoms of intrusion (p=0.009) and arousal (p=0.015), which were more pronounced in mothers of children hospitalized in the NICU than in their fathers. In the multivariate models perceived stress was the only predictor that significantly affected the rate of PTSD symptoms in parents. Since PTSD is a very common problem in parents of children hospitalized in the NICU and estimating the risk of its occurrence on the basis of collected data is not possible, the parents of all those children should be considered at high risk.

Cross-sectional online self-report survey conducted in 45 schools from the 15 districts in Istanbul, Turkey. A representative sample of 4957 10(th) grade students was studied between October 2012 and December 2012. Other than sociodemographic variables the survey included the Addiction Profile Index Internet Addiction Form-Screening Version (BAPINT-SV) and the Psychological Screening Test for Adolescents (PSTA). The participants were classified into two groups as those with HRIA (15.96%) and those with lower risk of Internet addiction. The rate of HRIA was higher in the males. The findings indicated that HRIA is related with negative consequences in school, lifetime use of tobacco, alcohol and\/or drug, suicidal thoughts, self-harming and delinquent behaviors. Male gender, lifetime use of tobacco, alcohol and\/or drug, depression, attention deficit and hyperactivity symptoms and lack of assertiveness predicted the HRIA in Turkish 10(th) grade students. Being aware of those with HRIA is important in prevention and management of Internet addiction as well as other important problems among students, such as substance use. ","1682":"Mental disorders in children and adolescents are common and have serious consequences. Schools present a key opportunity to promote mental health and implement prevention measures. Four school coaches in five German schools were enlisted to engage students, teachers and parents in building a sustainably healthy school and classroom climate. Altogether, 58 focus groups with students (N=244), parents (N=54) and teachers (N=62) were conducted longitudinally. Topics included: (1) the development of the school and classroom climate, (2) the role of mental health in the regular curriculum, and (3) the role of school coaches in influencing these aspects. Over time, school coaches became trusted reference persons for an increasing number of school system members. They were able to positively influence the school and classroom climate by increasing the awareness of students, teachers and parents of mental health in daily routines. Nevertheless, topics like bullying and student inclusion remained an issue at follow-up. Overall, the school coach intervention is a good model for establishing the topic of mental health in everyday school life and increasing its importance. Future efforts will focus on building self-supporting structures and networks in order to make these efforts sustainable.

This study included 29 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), who were consecutively recruited from the psychiatric outpatient clinic, and 30 healthy individuals recruited from the general community. Each patient underwent a detailed diagnostic evaluation by two psychiatrists using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I). Serum prolidase activity and oxidative parameters were measured in the patient and control groups. The severity of depressive symptoms was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Serum prolidase level was significantly higher in patients with MDD compared to healthy subjects (p&lt;0.001). Total Oxidant Status (TOS) levels and Oxidative Stress Index (OSI) were also significantly higher in patients with MDD (p&lt;0.001), whereas no significant difference was observed between the groups in the TAS levels (p=0.297). Serum prolidase level did not show any correlation with markers of oxidative stress in patients with MDD. Increased serum prolidase levels in patients with MDD may be interpreted as the interaction of prolidase activity, glutamate transmission and oxidative stress. It is suggested that prolidase activity is involved in the etiopathogenesis of depressive disorder. ","1684":"Schizophrenia treatment has been debated at length and presently pharmacological treatment is being advocated as the most beneficial for patients. However, research has shown contradictory results regarding the suitability of pharmacological treatment for certain groups of schizophrenia patients. The present review discusses results from the literature indicating good outcomes only for patients who adhered to prescribed pharmacological treatments. It also describes studies favoring non-drug treatments in certain schizophrenic patients. The authors described two groups of patients where the long-term use of neuroleptics may be useless, if not harmful. The first group comprised schizophrenic people with a single psychotic episode and therefore very good prognosis. In their case, the prolonged use of antipsychotics would not be beneficial due to pharmacological and social (stigma) side effects. Further research is warranted to identify and investigate biological, environmental, and psychological factors associated with single-episode schizophrenia. The second group comprised ultra-resistant schizophrenic patients. In their case, in the absence of a therapeutic response in acute episodes or aggressive behavior, clinicians should use short episodes of treatment with benzodiazepines or other sedative medications such as mood stabilizers. The present paper attempted to answer the important question as to whether all schizophrenic people should be treated with antipsychotics for the same good prognosis. The authors have provided solutions for better outcomes in a greater number of patients using alternative treatment after identifying schizophrenic patients who should not receive neuroleptic treatment.

Only five cases of delirium due to SSRIs as the main or most probable etiologic factor were published in the last two decades. In two cases SSRI seems a possible additional cause of delirium in combination with other psychotropic medication. Although SSRIs are considered safe, they can still cause delirium in an ageing patient even when SSRI was previously used without considerable side effects.

These controversies are created around everlasting tensions between two positive duties: the duty to protect vulnerable subjects, and the duty not to deny them potential benefits. Most of the contemporary ethical guidelines and regulations, including most recent revision of the Declaration of Helsinki, permit these researches under certain ethical conditions. The notion of informed consent as a cornerstone of bioethics emerges as essential requisite of moral research. We are presenting some key concepts and safeguards regarding informed consent that researcher needs to be aware off when conducting a research involving mentally impaired persons.

The clinical sample comprised 97 preschool children (23 girls) with SLI from, while the peer sample comprised 60 (34 girls) developmentally normal preschool children. The emotional competence of mothers was evaluated using the Emotional Competence Questionnaire (ESCQ-45). Emotional and behavioral difficulties in children were assessed by mothers, speech therapists, and teachers, using Achenbach's CBCL and CTRF scales. A lower emotional competence was found in mothers of children with specific language impairments. Mothers in clinical and peer samples differed in their ability to express emotions, while there was no statistically significant difference in their ability to recognize and manage emotions. Poor emotional regulation in mothers was linked to increased emotional reactivity, anxiety, and depressive manifestations in children with SLI, as well as to their speech comprehension. Emotional expression in mothers seems to be important for psychopathology in children with SLI, and their expressive and receptive speech. Our findings suggest that, in addition to the rehabilitation of children with SLI, clinical practice should implement preventative work with parents to enhance their emotional competence.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of sleep disturbances in a Lithuanian community sample of individuals with the relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and its relation with depression, anxiety, and health related quality of life (HRQoL). The examined group consisted of 137 RRMS outpatients. The following questionnaires were used: the original socio-demographic questionnaire, Medical Outcomes Study Sleep (MOSS) measure, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and HRQoL measure. The relationship of objective sleep disturbances was evaluated with multivariate linear regression, adjusted to socio-demographic and clinical data. Sleep disturbances were present in 45.3 percent of patients. According to the HADS-D, depressive symptoms were present in 21.9 percent, according to the HADS-A, anxiety symptoms were present in 19.7 percent of study participants. Mean value of Physical and Mental component of HRQoL respectively constituted 40.4 and 44.5. We observed the relationship between sleep disturbances and gender, age, EDSS, prevalence of depression and anxiety, and Physical and Mental component of HRQoL. Our research was limited by narrow number of study participants and could be accepted only as preliminary study. The study investigated only RRMS patients, therefore investigation of other clinical forms of MS could provide more exhaustive data related with sleep disturbances. The investigation included only outpatients group, therefore research of inpatients could provide more comprehensive data. Sleep disturbances in our study were common in RRMS, and they related with female gender, older age, higher disability status, prevalence of depression and anxiety, and worse HRQoL. The treatable causes of sleep disturbances in RRMS should be identified and cured. However, further research are requested to confirm these findings.

The aim of the present study was to verify such improvement in cognitive function by cognitive function assessment with a detailed neuropsychological battery covering all relevant cognitive systems expected to be impaired in early phase HD. Eighteen (18) HD patients entered the study and were randomly allocated to the rivastigmine and placebo group. All subjects underwent neuropsychological assessment at baseline. Follow-up neuropsychological assessment was applied after 6 months of rivastigmine or placebo treatment. Eighteen (18) healthy controls entered the study to control for practice effect and underwent neuropsychological assessment at baseline and after 6 months, without treatment. The neuropsychological battery consisted of assessment tools that are sensitive to cognitive impairment seen in early phase HD: CTMT, SDMT, Stroop (attention and information control), RFFT, TOL, Verbal fluency (executive functioning), CVLT-II, RCFT (learning and memory). Effect of rivastigmine and possible effect of practice was assessed using the mixed ANOVA model. No statistically significant effect of rivastigmine treatment on cognitive function in HD patients was detected. There was no evidence for practice or placebo effect. Detailed neuropsychological assessment did not confirm previously reported effect of rivastigmine treatment on cognitive function in HD patients. The limitations of our study are, in particular, small sample size and the lack of a single measure of relevant cognitive functioning in HD patients. Instead of focusing solely on statistical significance, a clinical relevance study is proposed to clarify the issue of rivastigmine effects in HD.

However, existing studies were mostly carried out in the West, while they also did not analyze specific symptom clusters of PTSD. The aim of this study was to examine the role of socio-demographic characteristics, war experiences and subjective quality of life in the prediction of three clusters of PTSD symptoms (i.e., avoidance, intrusion, hyperarousal). This study comprised 184 male participants who have survived war imprisonment during the Croatian Homeland War in the period from 1991 to 1995. The data was collected through several self-report measuring instruments: questionnaire on socio-demographic data, war experiences (Questionnaire on Traumatic Combat and War Experiences), subjective quality of life (WHO-Five Well-being Index), and PTSD symptoms (Impact of Events Scale - Revised). The level of three symptom clusters of PTSD was found to be moderate to high, as indicated by the scores on the IES-R. Results of the three hierarchical regression analyses showed the following: traumatic war experiences were significant predictors of avoidance symptoms; traumatic war experiences and subjective quality of life were significant predictors of hyperarousal symptoms; and traumatic war experiences, material status and subjective quality of life were significant predictors of intrusion symptoms. These findings support the widespread belief that the development of war-related PTSD is accounted for by multiple chains of risk, while traumatic war experiences seem to be the only predictor of all three symptom clusters. Future research should put more emphasis on specific PTSD symptom clusters when investigating the etiopathogenesis of this disorder among war-affected populations.

The aim of this study was to determine a one-month prevalence of psychological symptoms in Slovenian general population and to identify correlates of health seeking behaviour. This study was conducted in a representative sample of 1,002 randomly selected Slovenian citizens, stratified according to sex and age. We used a method of computer assisted telephone interview (CATI). The questionnaire consisted of demographic questions, questions about the prevalence and duration of preselected symptoms in the past month (irritability, nervousness), questions about the presence of chronic diseases, EQ-5D questionnaire and the questions on health seeking behaviour (self-treatment, lay advice seeking and medical advice seeking). The self-reported prevalence of psychological symptoms in the past month was 38.0% (381\/1,002). Multivariate analysis for the presence of self-reported psychological symptoms revealed that female sex, higher age, the presence of chronic disease, primary education, lay-advice seeking, pain and the presence of anxiety\/depression on EQ-5D questionnaire were independently associated with psychological symptoms. Psychological symptoms are a major public health problem in Slovenian general adult population and the self-reported utilization of professional health care services by Slovenian population is high.

The study included 56 patients with colorectal cancer (40 men and 16 women), aged 48-87. The following instruments were used: the Questionnaire on General Information and Lifestyle Habits, the Quality of Life Scale, and the Neo Five-Factor Inventory. The results of overall quality of life estimations of colorectal cancer patients were comparable to those of healthy people. Contrary to expectations, extraversion was not a significant quality of life predictor. Neuroticism as a personality trait was the only variable which consistently proved to be highly significant across analyses in the prediction of total quality of life, satisfaction with past life, future expectations, and comparison with others. Key determinants of neuroticism are a proneness to experiencing negative affects which makes adaptation difficult, a proneness to irrational ideas, reduced impulse control, ineffective coping strategies, the perception of poor control over oneself and others, and deeming one's own resources to be insufficient to adequately cope with stress, thus resulting in a more negative quality of life estimation. These results support the conclusion that cognitive-behavioral interventions aimed at changing negative attributions, reducing tension and negative affects, acquiring more effective coping strategies, strengthening perceived personal control, redefining and re-conceptualizing quality of life, and seeking\/receiving more adequate social support could lead to an improved quality of life in patients with colorectal cancer.

This is a cross-sectional naturalistic study of 52 inpatients (28 females and 24 males, aged from 24 to 75 years) meeting criteria for a current depressive episode within Recurrent Depressive Disorder (RDD) or Bipolar Disorder (BD) according to ICD-10. All patients were evaluated with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), followed by a direct interview about their dreams' content and emotional charge, as well as about suicidal thoughts and plans or previous attempts. Patients with RDD suffered significantly more frequently from nightmares than those with BD, p&lt;0.05. Within the RDD group, experiencing nightmares was associated with significantly higher scores on the HDRS suicide risk item (2.36 vs 1.00), higher frequency of suicide attempts (35% vs 6%), and lower likelihood for lack of detectable suicide risk (21% vs 81%), p&lt;0.05. These differences were not explained by significant difference in the severity of depressive symptoms (28.00 vs 24.75, p=0.16). We were unable to detect such differences in the bipolar subgroup. No gender influences on the association of nightmares and suicidal risk were observed. Depressed patients suffering from nightmares showed significantly higher suicide risk.

Data on suicides between January 2006 and December 2010 were provided by the Department of Health, Keelung City Government. The suicide victims were categorized into non-violent and violent groups, based on the International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision. Meteorological data were obtained from the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan. Socio-economic data were gathered from the Accounting and Statistics Office, Keelung City Government. Multiple linear regression analysis with backward elimination was performed to determine the model that was most effective in predicting dependent variables. During the 5-year study period, the overall suicide mortality rate was negatively associated with ambient temperature. Male suicide mortality was positively correlated with unemployment, and negatively correlated with ambient temperature, barometric pressure, rainy days, family income and number of holidays. Female suicide mortality and violent suicide mortality were not significantly correlated with any meteorological or socio-economic factors. Non-violent suicide mortality was positively correlated with unemployment, and negatively correlated with ambient temperature, barometric pressure and family income. Suicide is a complex psychopathological phenomenon. Further studies with individual data are warranted to confirm how meteorological and socio-economic conditions influence ones' suicidal behaviour. ","1711":"The leptin -2548G\/A (rs7799039) gene polymorphism has been implicated in susceptibility to antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG), but study results are still controversial. The present meta-analysis was performed to investigate the relationship between the leptin -2548G\/A gene polymorphism and AIWG. Electronic databases were searched for eligible articles in English and Chinese and seven separate studies on the association of the leptin -2548G\/A gene polymorphism with AIWG were analyzed. The meta-analysis involved 451 AIWG patients and 568 controls. The pooled odds ratio (OR) and their corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated by a fixed or random effect. Overall, our meta-analysis suggests that the leptin -2548G\/A gene polymorphism was not significantly associated with AIWG risk under various genetic models. But, in the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significant association was found between leptin -2548A allele and the AIWG risk in Asian populations under additive, dominant, recessive, and homozygote genetic model. On the contrary, in European populations, the -2548A allele seemed to decrease the risk of AIWG when compared with the -2548G allele under various genetic models, even though they were not statistically significant. Our meta-analysis suggests that the correlation between leptin -2548G\/A gene polymorphism and AIWG risk has significant racial differences. ","1712":"The effect of the cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for panic disorder varies, but how personality disorder functioning style influences it remains unclear. In 30 healthy volunteers and 44 patients with panic disorder (22 treated and 22 waiting list), we administered the Parker Personality Measure (PERM) and the Plutchik-van Praag Depression Inventory (PVP). Before and during the CBT or waiting period, patients were asked to record their panic attacks using the Panic Attack Record (PAR). Patients scored significantly higher on PERM Antisocial, Borderline, Histrionic, Avoident, Dependent, and Passive-aggressive styles and on depression. After CBT, all PAR parameters were significantly reduced in the treated group. The Obsessive-compulsive style was positively correlated with the panic attack duration and the total-thought before CBT or waiting period in all patients. In treated patients, the decreased panic attack duration was positively correlated with Histrionic, Obsessive-compulsive and Passive-aggressive; the decreased total symptom number was positively correlated with Antisocial and Histrionic; the decreased total-sensation was positively correlated with antisocial; and the total-thought was positively correlated with Narcissistic style. The length and duration of CBT was short and mainly with behavioral strategies, how personality influenced the related cognition per se remains unknown here. However, our preliminary results indicate that personality disorder functioning styles related to the externalized behaviors and the Obsessive-compulsive style have positive effects on CBT for panic disorder, implying that CBT practitioners should note their personality styles when treating these patients. ","1713":"Many empirical studies give evidence of co-occurrence of mental and personality disorders (PDs). On the other hand theoretical models explain the relationship between personality and mental disorders from different perspectives. This research studied the phemenological aspects of PDs in adult psychiatric patients with different mental disorders according to cognitive and psychoanalytic criteria for personality pathology. In order to study personality pathology in different diagnostic groups we constructed a self-report Questionnaire of Personality Disorders (VMO-2) on the basis of the DSM-IV-TR classification of PD (APA 2000), Beck's theory of dysfunctional beliefs (Beck et al. 2004) and psychoanalytic theories of personality (Kernberg 1986). The content of items in VMO-2 reflected the phenomenology of PDs and is focused on the basic experience of self and others in specific personality types. The questionnaire consists of 193 items which are divided into 11 clinical scales (Histrionic, Obsessive-compulsive, Avoidant, Dependent, Depressive, Narcissistic, Borderline, Antisocial, Paranoid, Schizoid and Schizotypal PD scale) and a validity (Lie) scale. The sample of 642 adult patients with different mental disorders and 477 healthy controls of both genders served as subjects in the study. All groups of patients reached higher scores on VMO-2 and revealed more personality pathology as compared to the control group. There were differences in specific personality scales between patients of different diagnostic groups. The schizotypal PD scale discriminated significantly between patients with schizophrenia and the majority of other diagnostic groups. The group of patients with opioid dependence disorder reached the highest mean score on the scale for antisocial PD. Our results on VMO-2 show partial support for psychodynamic and cognitive theories of personality pathology. Results are also in accordance with other empirical studies which show that some characteristics of PDs relate to specific mental disorders. We discuss methodological problems regarding some uncontrolled factors which could influence the results of our study. Despite some limitations the present study confirms the relationship between the phenomenological aspect of personality pathology and mental disorders. ","1714":"In recent years, social functioning of patients has increasingly been used as a criterion for assessing therapeutic efficacy of the group psychotherapy. The purpose of this preliminary study was to examine whether social functioning of patients with diagnosed psychotic disorders changes during their participation in psychodynamic group psychotherapy. The sample consisted of 30 patients involved in the psychodynamic group psychotherapy (PGP), and a comparative group of 30 patients treated only with antipsychotic medication therapy (treatment as usual; TAU). After two years of therapy, the instruments designed for this study (self-assessment and therapist-assessment questionnaire) were applied to examine changes in patient communication in their interpersonal relations, romantic and working functioning, and overall social functioning. The research also included data as to whom patients turned to for help, and the number of hospitalisations in the observed period. The majority of patients from both groups assessed their social functioning as improved, with significant differences found only in the area of romantic relations: more patients in the TAU group assessed their functioning as worsened. Nevertheless, a significantly higher number of patients in the PGP group were assessed by their therapists to have improved social functioning in all dimensions, except in the area of romantic relations, where there was no statistically significant difference between the groups. In comparison with the TAU group, twice as many patients in the PGP group turned to their psychiatrist for help and had four times fewer hospitalisations. Considering the limitations of this preliminary study, it can be concluded that the findings are promising, although further research is required to determine whether a psychodynamic approach to group psychotherapy truly leads to improved social functioning of patients with psychotic disorders. ","1715":"When psychosis first presents, and particularly in the case of schizophrenia, the guidelines recommend rapid institution of treatment with atypical antipsychotics. Two different clinical pictures can be observed: psychoses with acute onset and those with insidious onset. Acute cases (60% of the total) have a favourable course in 85% of young patients but where onset is insidious and the symptoms are predominantly negative, the course is poor in 25% of subjects. Since acute symptoms are relatively easy to diagnose, it is diagnosis of the 'insidious\/negative' cases that represents a major challenge. Is such a diagnosis possible yet? How can we limit the number of false negatives and false positives with the attendant risk of stigma? What treatment should be administered? Review of the literature (PubMed, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO) and comparison with clinical practice here. Young people with a high risk of developing psychosis can be identified using scales such as SOPS (Scale of Prodromal Symptoms), PACE (Personal Assessment and Crisis Evaluation) or from the presence of neuroanatomical and genetic characteristics. Unfortunately, these tools are more specific for positive symptoms, and therefore identify a sub-population of young people at risk: those at Ultra-High Risk (UHR). It can be argued that effective treatment is available for these UHR young people to prevent the condition from developing into schizophrenia. On the other hand, the problem persists for young people presenting an insidious onset and predominantly negative symptoms: to date we have no real way of either screening them or assessing the efficacy of a treatment. \"Ultra-High Risk\" patients are starting to represent a separate nosological entity. This entity is made up of young patients, most of whom have positive symptoms. If left untreated, the course will lead to seriously compromised social and psychological functioning. Rapid diagnosis and treatment for UHRs is therefore essential. In the future we need to refine our diagnostic tools to make them sufficiently specific and sensitive but also so that the widest category of \"Risk Syndrome for Psychosis\" includes young patients with mostly negative symptoms. ","1716":"Suicide is a leading cause of death in patients with bipolar disorder. Risk factors and prevention of suicide in this illness are the focus of considerable current research. MEDLINE data base was searched for the key words \"bipolar disorder\" with \"suicide\", \"lithium\" with \"suicide\", \"anticonvulsants\" with \"bipolar disorder\", and \"anticonvulsants\" with \"bipolar disorder\" and with \"suicide\". No language or time constraints were applied. The lists of references were searched manually to find additional articles. It is estimated that 25% to 50% of patients with bipolar disorder will attempt suicide at least once over their lifetime, and that 8% to 19% will complete suicide. Mortality rates from cardiovascular diseases are elevated in bipolar disorder. Risk factors for suicide include younger age of onset of the illness, history of past suicidal behavior, family history of suicide acts, comorbid borderline personality disorder and substance use disorders, and hopelessness. The warning signs calling for immediate action include the patients threatening to harm themselves, or looking for ways to kill themselves (seeking access to pills or weapons), or the patient talking or writing about death. Robust evidence supports the effects of lithium treatment in reducing suicidal attempts and completions in bipolar disorder. The evidence for antisuicidal effects of anticonvulsants is weaker. Nevertheless, valproate and other anticonvulsants are frequently prescribed as mood stabilizers. There have been controversial suggestions that this treatment may elevate the risk of suicide, but the data supporting this are not convincing. Psychoeducation can reduce the number of suicide attempts and completions. Suicide in bipolar disorder is a major public health problem. Recent research has expanded our knowledge of risk factors and warning signs. Nevertheless, it appears that the introduction of lithium treatment in the 1970s was the most recent important breakthrough in the prevention of suicide in this illness.

Starting with the history of the placebo effect and giving a review of the most significant studies reporting about the placebo effect from 1939-2013 it was our intention to give the all-around look on this phenomena discussing the neurobiological and other theories of its origin and concentrating especially on the field of psychiatry and finally coming to conclusions regarding the conductance of clinical trials and ethics. Regarding psychiatry, the placebo effect has a substantial role in most of psychiatric conditions including depression, anxiety, addictions, and contrary to what may have been expected, schizophrenia. Likewise, the nocebo effect is not to be neglected as the studies are being conducted to identify the factors causing it so it could be prevented.

Thirty-six (36) patients received acute ECT treatment and eighteen (18) patients maintenance ECT, yielding a ECT utilization rate of 0.05\/100.000 population. ECT was delivered with a modern square-wave (brief pulse) machine with EEG and ECG monitoring. In all cases the electrode placement was bifrontal and treatment modified (with anesthesia). The most frequent indication was recurrent depressive disorder (66.7%) for both acute and maintenance treatment. The limited availability of ECT in Serbia raises serious concerns. Provision of updated and effective treatment modalities for severe psychiatric disorders is crucial and the need for additional ECT services in Serbia is urgent. ","1724":"During the past decade studies have shown that Type D personality is associated with increased risk of cardiac events, mortality and poor quality of life. Some authors suggested that depression and Type D personality have substantial phenomenological overlap. The sample consisted of non-consecutive case series of seventy nine patients with clinically stable and angiographically confirmed coronary artery disease (CAD), who had been admitted to the Clinic of Cardiology, University Clinical Centre, from May 2006 to September 2008. The patients were assessed by the Type-D scale (DS14), The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and provided demographic information. Risk factors for CAD were obtained from cardiologists. The findings of our study have shown that 34.2% patients with CAD could be classified as Type D personality. The univariate analysis has shown that the prevalence of Type D personality was significantly higher in individuals with unstable angina pectoris and myocardial infarction (MI) diagnoses (p=0.02). Furthermore, some components of metabolic syndrome were more prevalent in patients with Type D personality: hypercholesterolemia (p=0.00), hypertriglyceridemia (p=0.00) and hypertension (p=0.01). Additionally, the distribution of depression in patients with a Type D personality and a non-Type D personality were statistically significantly different (p=0.00). To our knowledge, this study is the first one to describe the prevalence and clinical characteristics of the Type D personality in patients with CAD in this region of Europe. We have found that the prevalence of Type D personality in patients with CAD is in concordance with the other studies. We also have found that Type D personality and depression are two distinctly different categories of psychological distress.

After a workshop, 173 students (23.1% male, 75.7% female; 44.4% age 16, 43.8% age 17 and 11.8% age 18) from a Swiss school were surveyed by questionnaire. 59.3% (n=103) of all participants had tried cannabis, and 30.1% of those who reported cannabis use had consumed more than 100 joints. Of those 103 students with cannabis experience, 6.8% rated the risk of cannabis-related psychic effects as low, and 9.8% were not concerned about driving under the influence of cannabis. In cases of heavy cannabis use, the chance of increased tobacco, alcohol or other drug use is higher than for those with less or no cannabis use at all (odds ratios of 4.33-10.86). This paper deals primarily with cannabis prevalence data in adolescents from previous studies and sources, and shows that our findings deviate significantly - and surprisingly - from past research. Our data from a school survey indicates higher cannabis use than data from official drug policy studies. Additionally, our data shows that the students' self-reported attitudes towards health and safety issues were mostly realistic. The examination of methodological issues that might impact prevalence estimates should be added to the cannabis literature. ","1728":"Suicidal behavior is an important worldwide health problem. Psychiatric disorders, especially mood disorders, are the main risk factors for suicidal behavior. Suicide is an important cause of death in patients with epilepsy. The aim of this study was to analyze the presence of suicidal ideation in patients with epilepsy. The study included 50 epilepsy inpatients and outpatients of both genders, aged 18 years and older, treated at the Department of Neurology, Clinical Center University of Sarajevo in the period from 1(st) of April - October 1(st) 2007. The sample was selected randomly. Applied research instruments were general questionnaire, HAM-D-17, BHS and BSS. Suicidal ideation and thoughts of death were present in 38% epilepsy patients. Symptoms of depression as well as feelings of hopelessness were found in half of the participants (52% and 48%), and were significantly more common in epilepsy patients with suicidal ideation. There was a significant relation of suicidal ideation with the presence of chronic pain (3.86; p=0.49), sexual\/physical abuse history (5.95, p=0.015), level of hopelessness (20.7; p=0.000) and severity of depression (14.48; p=0.000) in epilepsy patients. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that unemployment (Exp(B) 33.9; p=0.007) and the level of hopelessness (Exp(B) 14.9; p=0.001) were independently related to suicidal ideation in these patients. The study has shown that the level of hopelessness and unemployment have a predictive value for appearance of suicidal ideation in epilepsy patients. In the prediction of suicidal ideation in this population of patients, there is no single variable that should be considered as specific and separate.

During the study, the Internet Addiction Test (IAT), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the State Trait Anger Expression Scale (STAXI), the UCLA-Loneliness Scale (UCLA-LS), and the Interpersonal Relationship Styles Scale (IRSS) were used for the evaluation of the patients. The results of this study showed that the 'duration of internet use' (B=2.353, p=0.01) and STAXI 'anger in' subscale (B=1.487, p=0.01) were the predictors of internet addiction.

ERP amplitudes were measured during an auditory oddball task in response to target (P3b, anterior N100) and novel (P3a, posterior N100) stimuli. Depression was significantly positively associated with early perceptual processing in response to novels in men (parietal N100 amplitude), and with a later processing stage (parietal P3b) in women.

In the past ninety years the development of psychodrama in the world has been influenced by many social events and sundry psychology movements. In her work the author describes and analyses the theory of psychodrama in the context of a behavioural and psychoanalytic perspective. She illustrates its origin and connects it with the influence of ancient drama and the developmental concept of modern European theatre in the first half of the last century, the magic\/religious tradition of Indian tribes, constructivism and postmodernism, and the deterministic chaos theory.

Both first generation antipsychotics (FGAs) and second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are effective in the acute treatment of schizophrenia and in relapse prevention. Clinicians must keep in mind that most patients are likely to require long-term, if not life-long, treatment which determines treatment strategy with an optimal balance between efficacy, side effects and compliance.

They may aggravate psychiatric disorders, perpetuate them or predict a disease onset, like in depressive or manic episodes. Also in organic sleep disorders, such as sleep-related breathing disorders or nocturnal movement disorders, increased anxiety or depression scores may be observed. Patients suffering from sleep disorders do not only experience impaired well-being, but also show deteriorations in cognition and performance, have a higher risk of accidents, are generally more prone to health problems, have a higher sickness absence rate, seek medical help more often and thus are also an important socioeconomic factor.

This has an effect on the number of patients within the population of the CMHT who fall within the psychotic clusters of HONOS-PBR. This should effect the resources which will be allocated to deal with the patients in the team. ","1754":"With an increased general practitioner and public awareness, patients are being referred on to Memory Clinics earlier and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is often a conclusion of the assessment. The function of memory clinics is to facilitate early and accurate diagnosis of dementia and its management. Mild Cognitive Impairment is an organic condition which in significant proportion of cases, progresses to Dementia. In Bedfordshire and Luton, patients with MCI are followed up at nine months to yearly intervals and detailed neuropsychological assessments are carried out to monitor cognitive functions in order to detect dementia early and plan care at an early stage in line with the NICE guidance CG42. An interesting patient presented to the Memory Clinic. He suffered from bipolar disorder with age of onset after 50 years. He was successfully treated with a combination of antidepressants, antipsychotics and lithium carbonate. He started complaining of memory difficulties and the initial memory assessment concluded that he had MCI. He was followed up by the clinical psychologist at memory assessment services at yearly intervals. There were no active cognitive interventions done by the psychologist. In the meanwhile the patient developed Parkinson's disease and was treated successfully with levodopa. Following this, neuropsychological tests demonstrated a significant improvement in cognitive functions. The patient was assessed as having recovered from mild cognitive disorder. In this article the authors discuss the possible differential diagnosis and causative factors for the presentation of MCI in this patient. Furthermore the possible reasons for recovery are explored. This also raised interesting questions as to the pharmacological management of mild cognitive disorder secondary to neurological conditions and as to how the course of mild cognitive disorders could be modified by effective interventions. ","1755":"Bipolar affective disorder (BPD) frequently occurs with co-morbid mental health problems. This study shows that that the prevalence of co-morbid BPD and anxiety symptoms is especially high. This is important because for a person affected by both BPD and anxiety there is a negative impact on the symptoms, treatment response and recovery. A clinician faces particular treatment challenges when managing these co-morbid conditions due to a limited evidence base for effective interventions. The frequent occurrence of anxiety symptoms and BPD together has informed theories of the shared aetiology of these conditions. ","1756":"A new Assessment service (ASPA) which has been developed in Bedford within the Community Psychiatric Team has been described. Demography of patients referred to the service as well as their diagnoses are explained. Outcomes of treatment in this assessment service are also assessed. The most common diagnoses were mood disorders. These were generally equally divided between patients with unipolar and bipolar disorder. The next most common diagnosis was obsessive compulsive disorder. Within the period, approximately one third of patients were referred back to primary care, one third were still in the assessment process, and one third had been admitted to secondary care community services. ","1757":"In this manuscript, a Lebanese trainee psychiatrist qualitatively analyses and discusses the provision of mental healthcare services for Palestinian refugees in Lebanon. There are more than 250,000 Palestinian people sporadically dispersed in the refugee camps in Sidon, Beirut and other major cities in the Levant. Displacement, conflict, trauma, unemployment and poverty are but some of the myriad factors that influence Palestinian refugee mental health. This article traces the historical, political and socioeconomic determinants of health for Palestinians exiled in Lebanon and describes the pivotal role that the non-Govenmental Organisation Medical Aid for Palestinians is playing in helping to alleviate the psychiatric distress of Palestinian sufferers of mental illness. The latter half of the manuscript contains an interview with a consultant psychiatrist about his experiences volunteering in the war-torn lands of Libya post Arab Spring. He expounds on how he feels mental healthcare services in Libya are woefully inadequate and broaches on his perception of how the resilience and the 'family-centric' model of the Libyan people has conferred a certain degree of protection towards developing severe psychiatric illness. ","1758":"Suicidal behaviour is a major public health concern. It is known that the pathogenesis of suicidal behaviour involves altered neural plasticity, resulting in the aberrant stress response of the central nervous system to environmental factors. Indeed, altered brain structure and function was found in suicide victims. Neurotrophins are growth factors that are involved in the regulation of structural, synaptic, and morphological plasticity and in the modulation of the strength and number of synaptic connections and neurotransmission. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) the most studied and the most widely distributed among neurotrophins binds to a tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor and to a pan75 neurotrophins receptor. It has been reported that BDNF production is decreased in all patients with suicidal behaviour and in all suicide victims regardless of a psychiatric diagnosis. It was also found that the mRNA and protein level of BDNF was significantly lower in both the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus of suicide subjects. Different mechanisms could be involved in the regulation of BDNF gene expression, among which epigenetic mechanisms seem to play a key role. However, also for a functional polymorphism (rs6265) Val66Metit has been shown that the Met allele is associated with the reduced BDNF activity. Further, a recent meta-analysis including 12 studies showed a trend for the Met-carrying genotypes and Met allele conferring risk for suicide. Among included studies, our study with the largest sample size, indicated that the combined Met\/Met and Met\/Val genotypes of the BDNF Val66Met variant could be the risk factor for violent suicide in female subjects and for suicide in victims exposed to childhood trauma. In accordance with previous reports, our findings demonstrate that aberrant regulation of BDNF synthesis is associated with suicidal behaviour. ","1759":"Despite different treatment approaches many patients with drug addiction continue to use drugs during and after treatment. Approximately 50 percent of the patients in substance abuse treatment do not complete the first month of treatment ,and this is associated with poor outcome. Attempts have been made to improve outcomes of addiction treatment by addressing patient characteristics that predict continued drug use. Appropriate instruments have been developed in order to facilitate assessment and outcome research. It could be concluded that different psychosocial factors could serve as a predictor of drug addiction treatment outcome. However the interplay of these factors is still poorly understood and further research is needed. ","1760":"Suicide has been identified as a serious public health problem that is often accompanied by alcohol misuse and dependence. It seems that suicide is a result of an interplay between distal (e.g. genetic loading, family history of suicide) and proximal factors (e.g. existence of psychiatric disorder, events conferring acute stress), as well as their interactions. However, like suicide, alcohol dependence seems to be a multifactorial disorder caused by genetic and environmental factors. Serotonergic dysfunction has been implicated to be involved in the pathophysiology of substance abuse, and has also an important role in suicidal behaviour. Studies investigating suicide, alcohol-related suicide and the rate limiting enzyme of serotonin synthesis, tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2), remain to date rather limited. Recent studies of TPH2 showed a range of strong, mild or no association with suicide and alcohol-related suicide, depending on a study group and genetic variants tested. Overall, to date the clinical effects seems to be quite modest. Among suicide victims with more impulsive and verbal aggressive behaviour more alcohol misuse or dependency was present. Suicide and alcoholism are often comorbid disorders with a complex nature. They are both strongly linked to serotonin modulation, and therefore association studies of SNPs in genes from the serotonergic system could provide an insight into the genetic background of such disorders. However, based on current results we cannot draw any conclusions, but further research to clarify the interplay between serotonergic system dysfunction, suicide, alcohol dependence, impulsivity and the role of TPH2 enzyme is needed. ","1761":"In the present study we evaluated attributional style which refers to how individuals explain the causes for positive and negative events in their lives in patients with first episode of schizophrenia with and without paranoid ideation. 43 patients with first episode of psychosis and 37 matched normal controls completed Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ) (Combs et al. 2007). Between group comparison of AIHQ scores showed a notable tendency to show aggressive response in overall patients group. We obtained significant elevation of hostility and blame biases scores in intentional and accidental situations in patients with paranoid ideation while the patients with non-paranoid ideation showed greater hostility and blame biases only in accidental situations as compared to controls. Correlations with positive and negative symptoms were obtained. Our findings suggest that patients with first episode of psychosis exhibit difficulties of the attribution biases which are interconnected with symptoms and thus indicate a trait-deficit of attributional style. ","1762":"Suicidal behaviour has multiple causes. Psychiatric disorder is a major contributing factor. Consecutively, diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders has an impact on suicide rate. The studies that investigated the possible impact of psychopharmacotherapy prescription practise on suicide rate have been gathered in the present article. Ongoing discussion of potential benefits and risks of antidepressant treatment with respect to suicidal behaviours includes many ecological, or population- based, correlational studies of temporal or regional trends in suicide rates and rates of usage of modern antidepressants including SSRIs. A number of studies have found a relationship between increase in national antidepressant prescribing and declining suicide rates, with general agreement but some exceptions. In general, studies showed that increased prescribing of antidepressants may indicate improved diagnosis and treatment of depression. On the other hand, studies that investigated the impact of prescription of anxyolitics on suicide rate were scarce, although the ratio of anxiolytics to antidepressants has been described as a quality indicator regarding treatment of depression, which is in most cases combined with anxiety and increased suicide risk. Importantly, sedatives and hypnotics are widely prescribed to elderly persons with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance, but studies demonstrated that sedatives and hypnotics were both associated with increased risk for suicide in the elderly. Finally, studies on antipsychotic prescription demonstrated that particularly treatment with clozapine decreased suicide mortality among individuals with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders and on the other hand lithium reduced suicide rate among individuals with mood disorders. ","1763":"The aim of our work is to evaluate and compare some of the key indicators that characterize one English Community Health team (Bedford), two Italian Mental Health Services, in Bastia and Magione, and one University Hospital Mental Health Service, in Perugia. Our work was conducted on the basis of a collaboration between Cambridge University (UK) and the University of Perugia (Italy). We analyzed and described the teams supplying information about the number of psychiatrists, types of staff and populations in the catchment areas. Furthermore, we analyzed their caseloads, referring to the epidemiologic features and the diagnostic aspects. We considered the population that were referred to the services in February 2013. There are some differences between the organization of the teams and the caseloads of the Community Mental Health Services in Italy and in England and between the community health services and the hospital service. As for the diagnostic aspects, Mood Disorders seem to be the most frequent diagnosis in each service (Bedford 53.8%, Perugia 48%, Magione 45%, Bastia 38%). The World Health Organisation identifies strong links between mental health status and development for individuals, communities and countries. In order to improve the mental health of the population, countries need effective and accessible treatment, prevention, and promotion programs. Achieving adequate support for mental health in any country requires a unified and shared approach. Little research has been done to describe the Mental Health Services in the different countries of the world, consequently more studies are needed to assess the improvements in the mental health system in relation to the services available for the population. In our study, according to the literature, we detected that mood disorders are the most frequent cause of referral to mental health services in all the populations studied. ","1764":"While knowledge of the aetiology of psychiatric disorders is complex and has not been fully elucidated, recently it has been noted that a sizeable proportion of psychiatric patients have coexisting immunological health conditions. It is debatable whether inflammatory factors plays a role in the aetiology of the psychiatric conditions, or if psychiatric conditions predispose to immune dysfunction. However, previous work has given weight to the theory that the immune system has important neuromodulatory roles in the brain, and disturbances in this system can lead to psychiatric manifestations. Epidemiological evidence is needed to explore the strength of the correlation between immune conditions and psychiatric disorders, and this audit attempts to investigate this potential association using the psychiatric patient databaseof Bedford East Community Mental Health Team (Bedfordshire, UK). In this audit, the patient information was analysed to obtain prevalence data for an array of autoimmune conditions. This was then compared to the expected prevalence of the same autoimmune conditions. The results showed that patients with each psychiatric condition had a higher than expected prevalence of autoimmune conditions overall. The most striking discrepancy was that the percentage of patients with coexisting hypothyroidism was higher than expected in almost every psychiatric condition recorded. Other patterns in prevalence of autoimmune conditions were also noted. A causative link between psychiatric and autoimmune diseases is still questionable, and this issue needs to be researched further in terms of prevalence data and aetiological evidence. There are significant implications for clinical practice if a greater incidence of autoimmune conditions among psychiatric patients is proven. This includes screening opportunities and risk assessments, as well as potential for new pharmacological therapies based around immune regulation. ","1765":"Work with dreams in the group analysis represents an important part of the analytical work, with insight into unconscious experiences of the individual dreamer, and his transferrential relations with the therapist, other members of the group, and with the group as a whole. The way dreams are addressed varies from one therapist to another, and in line with that, members of the group have varying frequency of dreams. In groups of psychotic patients dreams are generally rarely discussed and interpreted by the group, with analysis mainly resting on the manifested content. This paper describes a long-term group of psychotic patients which, after sharing the dreams of several members and daydreams of one female patient, their interpretation and reception in the group achieved better cohesion and improved communication and interaction, i.e. created a group matrix. Furthermore, through the content of dreams in the group, traumatic war experiences of several of the group members were opened and discussed, which brought with it recollections of the traumatic life situations of other group members. In expressing a daydream, a female member of the group revealed the background for her behaviour which was earlier interpreted as a negative symptom of the illness. ","1766":"This systematic review looked at the utilisation of treatment, access to treatment and referral of ethnic minorities for treatment of eating disorders in western settings. It also aimed to explore the barriers in access and utilisation of treatment including the role of acculturation. The review included both qualitative and quantitative studies. The search identified a total of 2786 articles. Out of the 2786 articles, 12 articles (1 qualitative and 11 quantitative) were selected for the purpose of the research. The review showed that ethnic minority communities in UK and USA were far less likely to seek and receive treatment for their eating disorders and also less likely to be diagnosed and referred to eating disorder services or clinics for treatment of their eating disorders. Referral bias of ethnic minority participants to specialist eating disorder services were found in three quantitative studies (Waller et al. 2009, Becker et al. 2003, Abbas et al. 2010). The review also found that more accultured ethnic minority participants were more likely to seek treatment for their eating disorders. The above study has shown that ethnic minorities are less likely to have access to treatment for Eating Disorders. ","1767":"Collaborative care between general practitioners and mental health specialists has been shown to improve the care of patients with depression in primary care and may be an important development in mental health services. Outcome measures are becoming increasingly important in psychiatry as we attempt to alter and improve the structure of services. In this article we propose a series of outcome measures that can be used to measure the effectiveness of shared care for patients with depression including objective measures of improvement in psychopathology and subjective measures of patient and professional experience. ","1768":"Depression within the geriatric patient population is an important issue as it is associated with increased mortality. Such depression may have a different aetiology to that in younger patients and be associated with comorbid chronic physical health problems or cognitive impairment. However, there is no specific UK guideline for the treatment of depression within elderly patients. The first-line pharmacological treatment recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is to use a serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Unfortunately these can have significant side-effects in the elderly such as hyponatraemia. Sertraline is one such SSRI commonly used in the geriatric population. Mirtazapine, a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSa) is seeing increasing usage as an alternative agent. Here we evaluate the role of using the NaSSA in place of the SSRI and how such drugs may be cross-titrated. PubMed and an internet search engine were used to identify relevant studies and information sources. Limited evidence suggests that for certain elderly patients, mirtazapine may be preferable to sertraline for treatment of depression. It may also be more cost-effective in patients who have dementia. The choice is highly dependent upon individual co-morbidities and subsequent polypharmacy. If required, sertaline can be cross-titrated to mirtazapine. ","1769":"An audit has been carried out of the patients who have been assessed using the CAARMS tool in order to assess patients who have been judged to have a prodromal psychotic syndrome. Instead of advocating PRS, Johannessen &amp; McGorry (Johannessen 2010), have offered an alternative: a 'Pluripotent risk syndrome'. This less specific prodrome reflects the unpredictable nature of \"Ultra-High Risk\" states which have been shown to be more likely to develop into a non-psychotic mood disorder than schizophrenia (Hoon 2012). The corollary this is thus; could patients who exhibit significant depressive features (regardless of diagnosis) be initially identified as having a 'Pluripotent risk syndrome'? Ten adult patients (6 males &amp; 4 females, aged 19-26 years old) with four broad psychiatric diagnoses (Depression, Schizoaffective disorder, Borderline personality disorder and psychotic illness) were chosen from an anonimised database of the patients and their symptomatology as assessed by CAARMS was retrospectively assessed to see if the presence of depressive symptoms supported the case for a \"Pluripotent risk syndrome\". Though patients diagnosed with depression frequently exhibited depressive symptoms, psychotic symptoms were also apparent, albeit in comparatively decreased severity. Patients diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder had depressive symptoms more frequently than psychotic symptoms, but these were comparatively less severe. Borderline personality disorder patients exhibited depressive symptoms more frequently than psychotic symptoms. Psychotic illnesses frequently had depressive symptoms, but more typically (and unsurprisingly) had comparatively more severe psychotic than depressive symptoms. Hence we propose that the concept of a \"Pluripotent risk syndrome\" is in our view born out.","1770":"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative condition of aging, however it is only seen infrequently in an Adult 'Working Age' Community Mental Health Team. When it presents, it presents in a number of different situations, but, since antipsychotics may often cause extrapyramidal side effects, there is often the concern that iatrogenic parkinsonism may occur. Here we describe a number of different patients presenting in a CMHT who have been assessed and investigated for Parkinson's disease. In many of these medication for Parkinson's disease was started. Often the patients need to stay on an atypical antipsychotic because of the mental health symptoms which they present. We assess present practice in the team, and make recommendations. ","1771":"Dementia is associated with increased health care resource utilisation and greater co-morbidity burden. Due to the psychophysiological and social demands of dementia, specific approaches to care, communication, environment and clinical treatment are needed. Timely diagnosis can greatly improve quality of life. Dementia is often not coded in hospitals as it is not considered the primary reason for admission. These missed opportunities have potential to serve as important checkpoints for proper diagnostic assessment. Upon discharge, adjustments can be made to manage these patients better. In April 2012, the dementia CQUIN was introduced with goals for early diagnosis of dementia at point of hospital admission. This study aims to investigate if the raised profile of dementia care has been generalised across the whole system, the impact on management and whether there is a difference in dementia care between geriatric and medical wards. There was excellent performance across the board for review of medication, prescription of anti-psychotics, ordering of routine bloods and neurological examinations. Increased awareness is needed for dementia-specific blood tests, namely: thyroid function test, B12 and folate. Geriatric wards performed consistently better than medical wards for all aspects of clinical care examined. For medical wards, incorporating multi-disciplinary care would be useful in managing these patients more holistically. ","1772":"Mood disorders (MD) show higher prevalence among psychiatric disorders. As a matter of fact 10% of inpatients in non psychiatric health care structures are affected by MD. A consultation-liaison service bridges the gap between psychiatric and other medical disciplines and increases the cooperation in the context of care, improving the diagnostic process for all inpatients in medical wards. Our sample is composed of 1702 patients assessed from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2012 referred from the wards for psychiatric specialist evaluation in Santa Maria della Misericordia, Perugia, Italy. Each patient was assessed by a consultant psychiatrist performing a psychiatric interview leading to a diagnosis according to DSM-IV-TR criteria. Clinical and sociodemographic data were collected and registrered in the clinical records. SPSS software (ver. 18) was used for data analysis. Chi-square test and T-student tests were performed as appropriate. A p-value&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. 17% of our sample shows a diagnosis within the mood disorder spectrum. As for the source of referrals we find that 51.4% came from the Emergency room, 39% from medical wards and 9.4% from surgical wards. On the basis of the consultation referral urgent status we found that 84% of requests needed to be seen within 24 h, most of them come from Emergency room. Statistically significant correlations can be found between the source of referrals, the reasons for the referrals, psychiatric care prior to the evaluation and the psychiatric disorder which was diagnosed during the assessment. Consultation-liaison service for MD in an italian general hospital is generally based on emergency\/urgency referrals from the Emergency room for patients already assessed to mental care facilities by private or national health service psychiatrists. ","1773":"There is considerable variability in the response of individuals to adverse environmental conditions, while some develop psychiatric illnesses like depression, others seem very capable of dealing with it. It is in this observation that the concepts of vulnerability and resilience are rooted. We conducted a review of the literature by inserting in PubMed the keywords resilience, vulnerability and depressive disorders. Freud formerly used the so-called crystal-principle to describe the concept of vulnerability: according to this, the different psychopathologies would arise depending on the different psychological weaknesses, just like a crystal thrown to the ground shatters along its lines of cleavage intrinsic to it, albeit invisible. The term resilience has been borrowed from physics where it is used to describe the ability of a material to withstand impact without cracking. In psychology, the term resilience refers to a complex and dynamic multidimensional construct, which derives from the interaction of neurobiological, social and personal factors and indicates the ability to adaptively cope with stress and adversity, preserving a normal physical and psychological functioning. Resilience has proven to be a protective factor against the development of psychiatric disorders such as depression. Making a conceptual leap, the concepts of vulnerability and resilience can be related to the psychodynamic classification of depression postulated by Gaetano Benedetti, who distinguished four kinds of depression: the first due to the failure of the ego, the second to the perversion of the superego, the third to the inhibition of the Id and the fourth to the collapse of the ego ideal. It is possible to improve the resilience of depressed subjects through pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions. ","1774":"International literature has shown that Postpartum Depression (PPD) has a significant social and relational impact on mothers and their partners, on the interaction between mother and child, as well as on the cognitive and emotional development of the child. The goal of this study is to increase the epidemiological knowledge of PPD and to evaluate both risk and protective factors. Our study is based on the administration of three tests, Paykel's Life Events Scale, EPDS and MMPI-2, at three distinct time point (during the third trimester, 72 hours after delivery, and three months after delivery, respectively) to a sample of women recruited in the Prenatal Medicine Clinic at the Hospital of Perugia. The data collected was statistically analyzed. The prevalence of PPD 72 hours after delivery was 11%, while the prevalence of PPD three months after delivery was 16.7%. Antepartum Depression (APD), measured using EPDS cut-offs scores of 9 and 14, was found to be a statistically significant risk factor for the development of PPD, while desired life-events during pregnancy can represent a protective factor. The prevalence of PPD that we measured, in agreement with that found in the literature, demonstrates that despite the fact that the diagnostic criteria of the DSM-IV refer to PPD only if it develops within 4 weeks after delivery, PPD can also develop after this period. Furthermore, it appears that monitoring APD and encouraging a psycho-socially serene pregnancy are important for prevention of PPD. In the case of APD it was shown that monitoring women with even light depressive symptoms is important, because these women are more likely to then develop PPD.

A telephone based survey was conducted between 30 May and 11 June 2012. A randomized sample of 6000 of the population between 15 and 50 years old was chosen. 2.9 per cent of respondents have suffered from an eating disorder at some point in time. 2.0 percent of these had suffered from an eating disorder in the past, while the remaining (0.9 per cent) were suffering from an eating disorder at the time of study. Out of these 2,008 individuals participated in the study. Binge Eating was the most common eating disorder, with 55.8 per cent of respondents having this condition, followed by Anorexia (34.3 per cent) and Bulimia (13.3 per cent). These results were comparable to those of other European countries. Awareness of these conditions in the general population was generally good, higher in females and in those with a higher educational level.

Migration is also known to have an impact on emotional wellbeing (Bhugra 2004). Foreign doctors in Malta now make up over 30% of the junior doctor cohort. This is a new situation for trainers here.This study was carried out in part fulfillment of the requirements for the completion of Specialist Training in Psychiatry in Malta. This article focuses on the first part of the study: the quantitative analysis aimed to answer the following questions: 1. What are the rates of mental health problems amongst recently qualified doctors? 2. What are the factors associated with the increased rates of mental distress? A quantitative cross-sectional analysis was carried out by means of self-report questionnaire including demographic details and the General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28) (Goldberg 1972). This study was approved by the Health Ethics Committee (HEC23\/12). 117 (78.5%) of junior doctors participated in this study. 70.9% were Maltese. 49.4% were found to have GHQ-28 scores of more than 6, indicating significant psychological distress. Further analyses revealed that lack of leisure time (p&lt;0.001), uncertainty (p=0.009), migration (p=0.03) and being female (p=0.04) were significantly related to caseness. As trainers and supervisors in medical education, it is important to be aware of the difficulties that young doctors face. These may include psychological distress, significant enough to reach caseness. Lack of leisure time seems to be an important factor which is possibly an area that can be easily tackled.

There are different conditions, which may have an influence on cognitive impairment in schizophrenic patients. One the factors differentiating subgroups of schizophrenic patients when neuropsychological functioning is analyzed is sex. This Review was focused on cognitive functioning of schizophrenic patients of different sexes. In order to achieve this result PubMed was searched using following terms: cognitive functions, schizophrenia, gender differences, sex hormones, memory, attention, neuropsychological, psychopatological symptoms. Most of the analyzed papers reflecting the cognitive differences between men and women suffering from schizophrenia postulate a worse performance in neuropsychological test by male patients. However according to some authors there are no gender differences in cognitive functioning in schizophrenic patients or those differences are not clinically significant.

Section 5(2) applies for patients who are already admitted to hospital and express their wish to leave against medical advice. It requires the recommendation of one medical practitioner. It gives the power to detain them for 72 hours in hospital for further assessment. To safeguard malpractice of this section, trusts have developed policies and procedures which define good medical practice within the legal framework of the MHA 1983. To evaluate current medical practice and insure that it complies with trust's policies and procedures and applies good medical practice. Medical case notes of patients admitted from 1.1.07-30.6.07 and were detained under Section 5(2) were reviewed. A special form was devised to collect information from the notes. It included age, sex, marital status, occupation, diagnosis, history of violence, history of drug and alcohol abuse and circumstances of their detention were obtained. 44 patients were identified. 40% were men, 65% above the age of 50 years; 52% were sectioned after hours or at the weekends. Measures to persuade patients to stay as informal patients were taken by 16%. 55% were sectioned by the on-call doctor. 68.5% exhibited threatening behaviour. 30% had self neglect, 13% were a risk to others, 26% had a deliberate self harm risk. 60% had moderate to severe suicidal risk and ideation. 68% did not have mental health capacity to give consent for admission. 60% had been assessed in the first 24 hours of their section. 60% were converted to Section 2,3 of the Mental Health Act. 25% stayed as informal patients and 7% were discharged. Female patients were more likely to be put on Section 5(2), which was against expectation. Older people were more likely to be put on section 5(2), which was again against expectation. Majority of patients were a risk to themselves and only 13% were a risk to other people. Nearly two-thirds were assessed within 24 hrs from the section, which we commend our services on. 60% needed to be transferred to different sections which indicates that 40% of the sample could have been managed more efficiently without warranting section 5(2). Section 5(2) is a useful legal framework when it is used efficiently. This study has shown that current clinical practice could be improved by applying the least restrictive measures by giving patients more choice and empowering them in clinical decision making.

The study involved also 191 patients, 160 men (83.77%) and 31 women (16.23%). All the surveys were anonymous and were collected in health centers within the province of Silesia. More than 2\/3 of therapists have heard of the method, but do not know the specifics of it. The most important sources of knowledge are other therapists, literature, and mass media. According to the respondents the most important barriers to alcohol addiction treatment include cultural barriers, such as embarrassment or fear of stigmatization. Younger Patients and those treated for a shorter period, state that they know the name of the current method of treatment to a lesser extent than other subgroups. About 10% of people have not heard about the BSFT method of treatment. The level of knowledge about the BSFT method suggests the need to promote this model among both therapists and patients. An introduction of BSFT can improve the treatment of alcohol addiction. ","1781":"New decades introduce more and more new medical specialties with the inevitable progress of medical science. This is due to the increasing amount of knowledge, and in opposition to the physical and intellectual faculties of a single man. In contrast to the time of Hippocrates, today one cannot be an expert in every field of medicine. We need to consult with specialists in various fields, in order to properly diagnose the patient. Without this the final diagnosis is often impossible. The objective of our survey was to check how often psychiatrists use consultation with physicians in other specialties, and whether there is a relationship between the place of work, academic degree, work experience in the profession, and the number of commissioned consultations. It was also important for us whether consultations affect the final diagnosis. Most of the respondents are young doctors, specialists from big cities. They rarely consult with doctors of other specialties - 1\/10 cases. However they are skeptical about the opinions of other psychiatrists. In contrast the proctologist and the pathologist are the least frequent groups of specialists who are requested for a consultation by psychiatrists. Specialists consulting the most often are internists and neurologists. The key to a diagnostic success is a holistic view of the patient. It is necessary therefore to develop the most effective cooperation between doctors of various specialties.

Questionnaires were completed before and after each workshop to test knowledge acquisition of mental health issues, stigma and where pupils could get help with mental health problems. Comparisons between data from the pre- and post-workshop questionnaires were made to assess learning. The responses from the questionnaires showed a global improvement in knowledge of mental health. This is highlighted by the increase in awareness of the prevalence of mental health problems amongst young people from 47.0% before the workshops to 97.8% after the workshops. The ability to identify symptoms of anxiety rose from 21.7% to 44.8% and the ability to identify depression rose from 29.0% to 53.5% respectively. Whilst only 15.2% pupils disagreed with a stigmatising statement about mental illness before the workshops, 61.3% pupils disagreed afterwards. The students were also better informed about how to access help and identified areas that they found useful to learn about. Comparison of the pre- and post-workshop questionnaires indicate that medical student-led workshops are an effective method for improving knowledge of mental health topics amongst 12-13 year old school pupils, as well as encouraging positive attitudes towards mental health. The project highlights a demand for mental health education in schools and brings to light topics that could be covered in future sessions or similar projects. ","1783":"The role of inflammation in major depressive disorder (MDD) has been of growing interest over the past two decades and evidence suggests it plays a role in depression. Evidence linking inflammation to MDD comes from three different observations (a) elevated levels of inflammatory markers in patients with MDD, even in the absence of illness, (b) co-occurrence of MDD with inflammatory illnesses and (c) increased risk of MDD with cytokine treatment. Cytokines have been found to influence almost every pathway involved in the pathogenesis of depression including alterations to the expression of neurotransmitters, neuroendocrine function, synaptic plasticity and basal ganglia. The similarities between cytokine-induced sickness behaviour and MDD further support a role of inflammation in depression as well as the anti-inflammatory effects of successful antidepressant treatment. This account describes the inflammatory mechanisms thought to be involved in MDD and the evidence for this. ","1784":"The definition of addiction is that it is an acquired, strong need to perform a specific activity or continued use of mood alerting substances. Increasing discussion about the development of Internet addiction, which like other addictions, have their roots in depression, impaired assessment esteem and social anxiety shows that it affects all users of the global network, regardless of gender or age. The aim of the study was to assess the impact of social networking on the ongoing behavior of respondents- the first step of a study on the possibility of dependence on social networks. The study was based on an authors questionnaire placed on popular polish websites on February 2013. Questions related to the types and frequency of specific activities undertaken by the private profiles of users. The study involved 221 respondents, 193 questionnaires were filled in completely and correctly, without missing any questions. 83.24% admitted to using social networking sites, 16.76% indicated that they never had their own profile. An overwhelming number of respondents are a member of Facebook (79.17%), specialized portals related to their profession or work were used by only 13.89%, Our-class (6.25%) and Twitter was a primary portal for one person only. Nobody marked a participation in dating services. There is a big difference between the addiction to the Internet and addictions existing within the Internet; the same pattern applies to social networking. There is a need to recognize the \"social networking\" for a particular activity, irrespective of Facebook, Twitter and Nasza-Klasa, which are commercial products. ","1785":"In the literature we can find examples of comorbidity of the diseases of the respiratory tract and mental disorders. Among them a particularly significant position is occupied by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, which may be accompanied by anxiety, depressive and cognitive symptoms. The present research project was aimed to establish a connection between psycho-intellectual functioning and suffering from the aforementioned diseases. The patients were divided into 3 groups. In the asthma group there were 11 people, mean age 54, who met the GINA criteria for asthma. The group of patients with COPD was formed by 12 people, mean age 67. The control group included 13 people, mean age 48. Patients from all the groups underwent spirometry, sputum induction and the following tests: Mini-Mental State Examination (MSSE), Trail Making Test (TMT A and B), Beck Depression Inventory - BDI (Beck et al. 1961) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults - STAI 1 and 2. In the TMT tests results were the following: We can presume some deficiency when the time required by a patient to complete the task is longer than 78 seconds for Part A and 273 seconds for Part B. In our research the best mean time was obtained in control group (Part A - 30.04 s, Part B - 67.37 s), then in the asthma group (Part A - 35.54 s, Part B - 98.81 s) and in the COPD group (Part A - 42.80 s, Part B - 107.79 s). In our research study the lowest score for the Beck Depression Inventory was obtained in the control group (mean 6.15), then in asthma (mean 9.63) and in COPD (mean 13.61). Results for State-Train Anxiety Inventory were distributed as follows: mean score in the asthma group was 36.48 in Part 1 and 43.27 in Part 2, in the COPD group 36.41 in Part 1 and 42.66 in Part 2 and in the control group 32.61 in Part 1 and 36.75 in Part 2. In our research the level of anxiety and depression measured by self-assessment questionnaires was higher in the study groups than in the control group. Also cognitive functions were worse than in the healthy controls, especially among COPD patients. ","1786":"Sleep disorders belong to the most common health problems in modern society. The aim of this study was to analyze and determine different factors, which have an impact on the occurrence of sleep abnormalities among people with mental illnesses. An original questionnaire containing 23 questions was created. 49 respondents from an outpatient psychiatric clinic were recruited to the study. The results indicate that the majority of respondents have the frequency of sleep disturbances more than 3 times per week. In 36% of them the length of sleep was not sufficient enough, and nearly half of the patients reported waking up at night. Sleep disturbances resulted in the appearance of several symptoms (tiredness - 66%, lower motivation and lack of energy - 51%, decreased mood - 45%, attention deficits and memory deterioration - 45%, irritability - 43%). Only 19% of them declare a deterioration of their social and vocational functioning. The majority of patients sleep more than 6 hours, but the patients consider this amount of sleep as not sufficient. The methods to cope with reported sleep problems are: most of respondents (68%) take hypnotics, 4% of respondents drink alcohol before going to sleep, 4% try to solve the problem with sex or masturbation. 9% reported talking about this problem with family member and\/or friends. The other 13% of the respondents do not try to make any efforts to manage their sleep disturbances. The questionnaire confirmed that sleep disturbances are common in mental disorders and the problem of insomnia has a negative impact on mood and quality of life for the majority of the patients who we studied. ","1787":"Much more is known about attitudes toward mental illness and social stigma, the viscious cycle of its consequences and how to fight the social stigma in public, but much less is known about how to combat the stigma and self stigma in clinical practice. Stigma theories have not been enough to understand the feelings and experience of people with mental illness. Conceptual framework that understands stigma as consisting of difficulties of knowledge (ignorance or misinformation), problems of attitudes (prejudice), and problems of behaviour (discrimination) have not o been enough to understand stigma dynamics in the patient therapist interaction. Understanding the psychodynamic aspects of internalized stereotype of mental illness in the patient- therapist relationship may improve our competency to deal with stigma and self stigma in clinical practice. ","1788":"Presently few studies demonstrate improved outcomes in patients with schizophrenia treated in day rehabilitation centres. One reason is the absence of an evidence based protocol for rehabilitation in such centres. Hence further research is required to assess whether such a protocol will improve psychosocial outcomes. We performed a controlled evaluation study of a protocol based rehabilitation day program (RDC) for persons suffering from schizophrenia. Patients from the experimental group (N=50) were treated within the RDC for a 6 month period. The control group were patients on the waiting list for the RDC. Quality of life (MANSA), social functioning (OSA) and self-esteem (Rosenberg) were measured before and after the intervention. Statistically significant improvement was shown in social functioning measured by OSA (F(1,96)=33.7; p&lt;0.001), quality of life measured by MANSA (F(1,96)=69.3; p&lt;0.001) and self esteem measured by Rosenberg scale (F(1,96)=84.5; p&lt;0.001) for patients treated in the RDC compared with the control group, conversely, the control group outcomes deteriorated. An evidence based protocol for rehabilitation within the RDC lead to improved social outcomes and recovery for persons suffering from schizophrenia. ","1789":"The aim of this study is to show how managing long term patients who are diagnosed as having bipolar disorder with an affective mixed states can cause them to achieve a high level of recovery from the illness and quality of life. This study observed all consecutive new patients who were seen in a private psychiatry practice during the years 2008-2009-2010 who had a diagnosis within the mixed states sub-group (Irritable Cyclothymia, Mixed Disphoria and Agitated Depression)Thirty patients were selected who presented with a score of less than 40 on the Global Assessment Scale (GAS). They were reassessed by readministering the GAS scale after six months and after two years treatment. The final results demonstrate an improvement of the mood of the patients and their increasing quality of life. Almost all reached a value on the GAS scale of between 60 and 80 after six months, and between 90 and 100 scores after two years.

The Authors, after reviewing the negative role that stress has in the management of the employment relationship, describe the main steps that have brought Europe to recognize the importance of the role of prevention, and to recognize the role of well-being in the workplace. ","1791":"This study aimed to evaluate the perceptions of UK psychiatry trainees (residents) towards workplace-based assessments (WPBAs) as formative learning tools. WPBAs are a new form of UK mandatory assessment. Two focus group interviews were held with psychiatry trainees at different stages of training in Cambridge, UK. Trainees identified a number of opportunities and barriers of WPBAs as formative assessment tools, and gave suggestions for their further development. A key opportunity was the compulsion for supervisors to observe trainees in clinical practice, and to provide individually tailored feedback. Barriers to learning were ideological, such as the emphasis on grades rather than formative feedback; and practical, such as the time taken for assessments. Suggestions for development of WPBAs included redesigning the forms to incorporate more formative feedback, and improving training in WPBAs. The perceptions of psychiatry trainees towards WPBAs are mixed and would benefit from further exploration. ","1792":"Clinical observation is very important to manage risk of people who are acutely ill on psychiatric wards. It is always an area of dispute between different specialities and disciplines in serious untoward incidents (SUI). Three levels of observations have been applied on acute psychiatric words. Assessing practice is important to help to identify any area needs improving. A questionnaire was developed by HN to collect demographics. Medical notes on Westley and Grangewater wards were reviewed. Excel Microsoft Office World Computer Programme was used to analyse the results. 57% were men. 62% were above 41 years of age. Majority were suffering from schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders 61%. 64.28% were admitted as formal patients. 31.42% were on level I observation.62.53 were informal. 54.76% were risk to themselves, 28.57% risk to others. 82.3% were on level II observation, 31.42% formal and 68.50% informal. 21.32% were on level III observation. 66.66% were formal and 66.66% had an incident before this level. This study have shown that patients are assessed properly before they go on any level of care. Some patients need to go on level III as they pose a risk mainly to other people. Regular reviews of patients, especially on high level of observation should be done more promptly, as being on observation is not a comfortable experience to go through and applying the least restrictive practice should always be sought and adopted. ","1793":"To establish the level of physical care of people suffering from severe mental illness attending a psychiatric depot clinic. 37 Records of patients who were on long acting injectable antipsychotics, were reviewed to establish their physical care arrangement against the POMT-UK standards,and also to establish the type of antipsychotics, whether they suffer from metabolic syndrome, or whether other physical illness has been recorded. Records lacked any reference to baseline arrangements of physical monitoring. 22% suffered from diabetes and 75% of them were identified by The Depot and Well Being clinic (DWBC), 73% had abnormal lipid profile 59% were identified by (DWBC). 22% suffer from hypertension, all of them were identified by (DWBC). Physical care is an important aspect of care of people with severe mental illness total care. This study has demonstrated that this area is still not looked after adequately. Improvement in this area will improve the global outcome for these patients. ","1794":"To assess the existing physical care of patients with severe mental illness and whether it has complied with national protocols and guidelines. Medical notes of patients who has been on risperidone long acting injectable depot for a year were reviewed and a form was filled with the information of each patient including weight, physical examination, fasting blood sugar (FBS), Serum lipid (S.L.), pulse, blood pressure and ECG liver function tests (LFT). 50% had comorbidity with other physical illness, at the start of treatment, at three months and six months intervals. 65 notes were reviewed. 70% males. 70% between 18-50 years. 80% had the illness more than 5 years and 50% more than 10 years. The following was done baseline: 50% had physical examination. 25% had pulse, blood pressure and ECG. Body weight 10%. Triglycerides 20%. Urea and electrolytes (U&amp;E) 15%. 40% had their liver function tests (LFT). 50% had comorbidity with other physical illness. The following were done on six monthly maintenance measures: Only 5% had maintenance ECG. LFT 10%. U&amp;E 30%. Triglycerides 5%. Physical illnesses are neglected areas in the care of the severely mentally ill patients. It is an important area in the management of severe mental illness. Proper physical assessment and regular follow up should be adopted. Promotion of healthy living and eating, exercise and monitoring weight should be recommended. All these measures may improve the physical health of severely mentally ill patients and improve the total outcome of these illnesses. ","1795":"To examine whether prescribing Clozapine was delayed in Treatment Resistant Schizophrenia (TRS), and elucidate possible reasons for this. A retrospective Case note review was done. The main outcome measured was the mean maximum theoretical delay in starting Clozapine. In analyses, mean values were compared using an unpaired, 2-sided Student t-test. The association between duration of illness and theoretical delay was analysed by scatterplot and Pearson correlation coefficient. 42 case notes were reviewed. Mean age of subjects was 40.1 years. The mean maximum theoretical delay in all patients was 5 years. A statistically significant longer delay was found in patients over 30 years, patients diagnosed with TRS before 1991,and for patients before the introduction of Risperidone. Delay was significantly shorter for patients admitted to a psychiatric hospital more than once a year. There is a strong indication that Clozapine was not introduced at the earliest opportunity. Factors contributing to the delay include the patient's age, using sequential antipsychotic trials, and the failure to identify TRS. The use of Clozapine appears to have been adopted more in recent years, with a delay of five years to Clozapine for those diagnosed pre-1991, reducing to two years for those diagnosed pre-2003. Mean average delay of prescribing clozapine was 5 years. Statistically significant delays in patients over 30 years of age. There was no evaluation of: Reasons for co-prescribing of antipsychotics. Reasons for delay in prescribing Clozapine, e.g. prescriber inexperience, patient choice, risk of non-compliance etc. Evidence of treatment resistance, and whether primary or secondary in onset. ","1796":"The prevalence of severe mental illness is known to be greater in urban than in rural areas. Less studied are differences between the patients themselves and, more specifically, their use of psychiatric services. The prevalence of severe mental illness was determined in semi-rural Maidstone in Kent by case identification register. Patients who met the OPCRIT diagnosis criteria were interviewed with the Multi-Site Collaboration Study (Case ID Schedule for Maidstone) which consists of five sections. 140 patients were identified with severe mental illness in the Maidstone area; their mean age was (42.85 years SD + 12.11). Most of the sample were born in England (94%), 34.5% were married or living with partners, 87.9% were living with no supervision, 37.1% had no qualification, 48.9% were unemployed. 45.7% suffer from schizophrenia, 21.4% suffer from depression, 13.6% suffer from schizoaffective psychosis and 20% suffer from other forms of psychosis. 99.3% were in touch with the services during the index period, 30.7% needed in-patient treatment, 82.12% attended out-patient clinic, 82.12% had community psychiatric nurse input, 17.1% have ever been charged with a crime and 15.7% have been ever convicted with a crime. 52.9% were receiving depot injection. The prevalence of severe mental illness in Maidstone (3.8\/1000) is less than inner city areas (7.7\/1000). Maidstone patients were at a higher level of functioning and made more use of available psychiatric services. ","1797":"Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by Treponema pallium. The invasion of the central nervous system is observed in 5-10% of untreated patients and may occur at any stage of the disease. The diagnosis of the early stage of syphilitic infection is complex as many patients present either nonspecific symptoms or are asymptomatic. The identification of the most common radiologic characteristics of neurosyphilis is important in the proper diagnosis of the infection. The paper reviews the MR findings in neurosyphilis presented in the literature with the emphasis on common traits, patterns and factors in MR neuroimaging in neurosyphilis. Twelve papers were selected as suitable for analysis. Psychiatric symptomatology was the most common clinical manifestations of neurosyphilis. As MRI findings in neurosyphilis were not highly specific it proved being the most sensitive technique in detecting the changes in cerebral vasculitis commonly presenting with focal areas of high signal intensity in any distribution with areas of infarction and hemorrhage observed at times. In neurosyphilis medium and small vessels are usually involved. Parenchymal and meningeal enhancement was usually demonstrated. The most frequently involved arteries are middle cerebral artery and branches of the basilar artery. However, normal findings were also common. The most common MR diagnostic features are medium contrast enhancement, atrophy, white matter lesions, cerebral infarction, oedema. Radiologists, neurologists, and psychiatrists should take neurosyphilis into consideration when facing the differential diagnosis in central vascuclar disorders.

Cognitive functions which may be involved with anxiety and maladaptive cognition such as e.g. attention, memory and perception might be decreased. Within the preliminary studies eleven patients diagnosed with panic disorder (DSM-IV-TR), and nine healthy controls were studied. The severity of disorder was measured by the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale. To assess working memory Delayed Match to Sample (DMS) with CANTAB (Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery) was used. Percent of correct answers was significantly different in both groups in delayed visual memory and recognition test. In the control group results were higher (M=92.22) than in the experimental group (86.06). PD is associated with impaired performance on a DMS task that requires the stable maintenance of representations in working memory. ","1800":"Sibutramine is a weight loss agent recently withdrawn from the European market due to cardiovascular risk concerns. It was used for long-term obesity treatment. Zolpidem is a short acting hypnotic agent commonly used in the treatment of insomnia. A number of case reports describing psychotic reaction to sibutramine were reported in the literature. We present a case of a 61-year-old Caucasian woman who developed two psychotic episodes related to sibutramine treatment. The second psychotic episode was complicated with complex behaviours after zolpidem use due to insomnia. Sibutramine and zolpidem discontinuation resulted in rapid resolution of psychotic symptoms. This case suggests a possibility of incidence of psychotic symptoms and complex behaviour disturbances in patients prescribed sibutramine or other monoaminergic reuptake inhibitors. ","1801":"This exploratory study examined attachment style and state\/trait anxiety in adolescents - 30 recently hospitalized psychiatric patients, and 49 school controls. All were aged 13-18, with the majority (67%) female. The attachment style interview (ASI, Bifulco et al. 2002) was administered, together with the Recent Life Events questionnaire (Brugha &amp; Cragg 1990) and the STAI anxiety questionnaire (Spielberger et al. 1983). Results showed the hospitalised group to have significantly more negative interactions with parents and poorer support than the comparison group. They had significantly more insecure attachment style (96% s 37%). Among the hospitalized adolescents, both the Anxious and the Avoidant attachment style group had higher anxiety scores on the STAI-trait scores than on the STAI-state scores assessed during the first days of hospitalisation. This suggests adolescents, even those with Avoidant attachment feel less anxious after admission. Implications for assessing attachment style in adolescent patients to aid with care planning is discussed. ","1802":"Bipolar Affective Disorder is frequently under-diagnosed and misdiagnosed, particularly as unipolar depression. This has serious implications on treatment and outcome of the condition. A community mental health team (CMHT) in Bedford, United Kingdom, has therefore reassessed patients to examine whether it is possible to increase the sensitivity of diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder; to identify more cases and to identify them earlier, in order to be able to offer adequate treatment as early as possible. Standards were decided within the team for the diagnosis of bipolar disorder based on the DSM4 criteria for the diagnosis of Bipolar I and Bipolar II illness. Patients were reassessed and patient data from 2006, 2007, 2010 and 2011, as well as from 2013, with respect to psychiatric diagnoses. The results were audited and analysed in every year in question. The proportions of total bipolar, bipolar I affective disorder and bipolar II affective disorder diagnoses, as well as the proportions of recurrent depressive disorder and other unipolar depression diagnoses were determined. There was a steady increase in the proportions of both bipolar I and bipolar II diagnoses -from 10.5% in 2006 to 11.0% in 2013 for bipolar I affective disorder, and from 0% in 2006 (4.9% in 2007) to 9.7% in 2013 for bipolar II affective disorder-, and a steady decrease in the proportions of both recurrent depressive disorder and other unipolar depression diagnoses - from 16.1% and 18.7%, respectively, in 2006, to 4.8% and 8.0%, respectively, in 2013. The results confirm that it is possible to increase the sensitivity of bipolar affective disorder diagnosis and that this results in an increased number of diagnoses of the disorder, and a decreased number of diagnoses of unipolar depression. Unexpectedly, the data also showed that increasingly more patients are receiving multiple psychiatric diagnoses. This paper shows that it is possible to increase the sensitivity of diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder. This may be particularly useful in the light of increasingly more mental health problems being treated exclusively in primary care, since bipolar diagnoses will be less likely to be missed. Better identification, and therefore treatment, of bipolar affective disorder is likely to lead to better social and professional functioning of affected individuals. ","1803":"With the publication of DSM III, the nosology of children and adolescents' disorders has evolved differently in Francophone and Anglo-Saxon countries. We want to 1 \/ familiarize readers with the nosographic concepts of mood disorders and bipolar disorders in the Francophone world of Adolescent Psychiatry; 2\/ highlight the major current issues of concern to both Francophone and Anglo-Saxon adolescents' psychiatrists. A review of the literature in PubMed, PsycINFO and PsycARTICLES, but also of Francophone journals or textbooks not included in these databases nor distributed outside Francophone countries. Although Francophone adolescents' psychiatrists still rely on the DSM II, particularly in reference to the transitory dimension of problems during adolescence, the DSM III led to a tightening of criteria for bipolar disorder in the Anglo-Saxon countries. These disorders have become rare in the 2000s while still common in Francophone countries. Nowadays the evolution of current criteria in Anglo-Saxon countries tends to bring the diagnostic criteria closer to the Francophone's one even though important differences still persist. Despite differences between these two approaches in Psychiatry, there is agreement regarding the poor prognosis of type I bipolar disorder, particularly when psychotic traits are observed. Early diagnosis and treatment are therefore a challenge for both, but their limitations are inherent to their respective approaches. In Anglo-Saxon countries, if the criteria are met for bipolar disorder, treatment is decided at the risk of over-diagnosis and stigmatization of false positives. In Francophone countries, even if the criteria for bipolar disorder are met, it is still necessary that the psychopathological analysis of the disorder in the developmental framework of adolescence confirms that the disorder is stable, at the risk of later treatment and of increase of insufficiently treated false negatives. A reconciliation of these fields may limit the above side effects. ","1804":"It has been suggested that alcohol problems have a major impact in the workplace. It has long been recognized that misuse can have serious consequences for the productivity of workers. The extent of the problem is still an uncalculated cost. Few studies provide clear evidence of a cause, effect or relationship between substance abuse and workplace costs and valuable guidance to employers in evaluating the cost of substance abuse in their workplaces is missing. To estimate the awareness, policies and cost to employers of drinking in the workplace in Belgium and to illustrate the potential gains from drinking cessation provision. Costs vary with type of industry and policy in place; therefore, to estimate these costs, results from a survey were combined with evidence drawn from a review of literature. An Internet survey of 216 workplaces in Belgium, based on a stratified random sample of workplaces with 50 or more employees, was conducted in 2005. Further information was collected from 150 occupational physicians. Additional evidence was compiled from a review of the literature of drinking-related costs. 216 General Directors or HR Directors completed a questionnaire related to awareness, policy and costs. 150 occupational physicians completed a questionnaire related to awareness and policy. Companies are unaware or underestimate alcohol misuse among their employees. At least 84% of companies have no education or information policy about substance abuse. Absenteeism, accidents and turnover account for 0.87% of the wage bill. Reduced productivity\/ (presenteeism accounts for 2.8%. The construction industry, postal services, hospitality industry (hotel\/restaurants and catering) and sanitation industry (collection, street cleaning) are the most problematic sectors. Awareness: many companies are totally unaware of the impact of substance abuse and those that are aware underestimate the problem. Sectors are heterogeneous; some are more problematic than others. Policy: although there is a link between policy and consumption, few companies have a clear substance abuse policy. Cost: reduced productivity is perceived as the most important cost. ","1805":"For many years, several cases of neonaticide resulting from a denial of pregnancy were reported in the press. Recently, a case of neonaticide made headlines in Belgium: a woman realised that she was pregnant during childbirth. A few minutes after the delivery, the baby was asphyxiated to death. In the obstetric history of the patient, we note six pregnancies, of which three births were given to anonymous adoption. Mrs D. was not able to explain why she was not using any method of contraception despite all of her pregnancies. Many questions need to be asked in order to further understand denial of pregnancy. Do these women understand the link between sexual intercourse and the potential of pregnancy? Which women are more at risk of denying their pregnancy? Is there a certain personality profile at risk? In the following article, we report the case of Mrs D. who presented to the consultation of the clinic of CHU Mont-Godinne (Belgium). We will also discuss the literature available on the online databases (PubMed, PsycArticles, PsycInfo and Cairn.info) using the following keywords: denial of pregnancy, neonaticide, contraception. In the results of retrospective studies, we notice that indeed most women who have had a denial of pregnancy were not using any method of contraception. This observation suggests the hypothesis of a denial of fertility in these women. In addition, it appears that a specific personality profile is very difficult to establish, due to the lack of sufficient data and due to the discrepancy of the results concerning these women, especially in the matters of age and socio-economic status. However we can note that some psychological characteristics are similar. The denial of pregnancy is a complex mechanism, which still raises many questions in the clinical setting and in matters of etiopathogenesis. In these patients, we note that denial is a defense mechanism regularly used, even in other aspects of their lives. Moreover, the frequent non-use of contraceptive method might therefore be more in favor of a denial of fertility than of a denial of pregnancy. ","1806":"Drug addicts are more and more stigmatized in our society. Recent data show a connection between substance abuse and other behaviors considered normal, such as passionate love. Adolescence is characterized by a biopsychosocial, cognitive and neurodevelopmental immaturity. This article aims to understand if these subjects are more likely to develop addictions to certain products or addictive behaviors such as passionate love. It also offers a better understanding of the current models for prevention of substance abuse during adolescence. After defining the roles played, in the brain, by dopamine and by the reward circuit, as well as the different stages of development of the human brain, we compared neurobiological data and imaging studies both in cases of passionate love and substance addiction during adolescence. The brain imaging studies highlight the role of the prefrontal cortex in the cognitive and behavioral aspects of the addictive phenomenon. Now, the maturation of the prefrontal cortex occurs during adolescence, as do significant peaks in the expression of dopamine. These studies also suggest an increase in cortical activation (nucleus accumbens and amygdala) when processing emotional information, which is also increased during adolescence. Taken together, the results show a parallel between addiction and love relations, both at the level of neuroscience and imaging. A greater emotional lability and sensitivity may play a role in the higher incidence of substance abuse and dependence in love observed at this age. Preventing the use of illegal substances among young people therefore requires a very specific approach. ","1807":"A previous study showed an overuse of psychiatric emergencies by physicians. Now we study whether patients hospitalized through emergencies have more pejorative specifications than patients admitted through consultations. All patients with Major depressive disorder admitted in our department through emergencies (N=146) or consultations (N=2172) between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2012 were included in an open study. They completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), analogical visual scales about stress levels (in professional, social, family, married life), life events scale over the past year and the past month and the Olson Family Adaptation and Cohesion Scale. The depression (t=1.438; p=0.90) and stress level in the previous month (t=1.704; p=0.90) was similar in both samples. Patients admitted through emergencies are characterized by lower levels of marital stress (t=2.590; p=0.01), higher levels of cohesion (t=-2.988, p=0.003), higher adaptability of the current couple (t=-2.975, p=0.003) as well as the adaptability of the family of the origin (t=-2.504, p=0.012). If both samples are comparable in terms of stress or severity of depression, patients admitted through emergencies have relatives who are more supportive and more adaptable! How can we explain why they did not consult before? We propose the hypothesis that physicians and families would be exceeded or overloaded with symptoms they thought they could contain, forcing them at this point to request an urgent care of the pathology. On the contrary patients with environments which are less cohesive and adaptable would be redirected earlier to specialised consultation. ","1808":"Patients who are suffering from tinnitus are rarely directly referred to an audiophonology centre. Often, they have tried several medications and met with several doctors. Sometimes, they are also referred too quickly to a psychiatrist without a complete ENT assessment. Nevertheless, they frequently develop psychiatric comorbidities in regard to the tinnitus. On the basis of structured interviews with the \"Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview\" and on a review of records, we assessed the associated psychiatric diagnoses in patients who consulted for tinnitus as their main complaint at the audiophonology centre from the University Hospital Centre of Mont-Godinne-Dinant between 2009 and 2012. Of the 80 patients who consulted for tinnitus, 28% suffered from a major depressive disorder, 27.5% from a somatoform disorder, 23.7% from sleep disorder, 22.5% from an anxiety disorder and 16% from alcoholic dependence. On the basis of these results, we developed clinical considerations concerning the treatment approach and options for patients suffering from tinnitus with psychiatric comorbidities. The interdisciplinary approach (ENT and liaison psychiatry) in an audiophonology centre seems to be a factor for better treatment adherence for patients with severe and chronic tinnitus. ","1809":"In the recent years the phenomenon of early alcohol initiation is observed. This problem is often underestimated, in spite of its numerous negative consequences The research study was based on authors` anonymous questionnaire including questions referring to: age of alcohol initiation, age of the first blackout after drinking alcohol, the place and circumstances of alcohol initiation and the reason of drinking alcohol for the first time. The study group consisted of 125 people, 83 men and 42 women, aged from 22 to 68 participating in treatment programs for alcohol addiction. In the study group it occurred before the age of 15 more often than in the control group (49% vs. 42%). The same correlation exists for the alcohol initiation before 12 years of age (13% vs. 8%) and is statistically significant (p&lt;0.05). What's very alarming drinking alcohol for the first time took place for some of the respondents before the age of 10 and also significantly more often in the study group (6% vs. 2%, p&lt;0.05). The obtained results allow to conclude that in patients addicted to alcohol the initiation took place earlier than in the study group (age 13-15 vs. 16-18). Also, very early alcohol initiation (&lt;12 years) occurred more frequently in the study group (12.8% vs 8.2%). Based on our research, we confirmed that early drinking onset is associated with subsequent alcohol dependence. ","1810":"The Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of commonly coexisting clinical markers. It is well established that MetS is more prevalent in schizophrenic (SCZ) patients medicated with atypical antipsychotics, however, questions still exist over whether schizophrenia itself can contribute directly to metabolic dysfunction. We evaluated the antipsychotic-independent link between MetS and schizophrenia, by conducting a systematic literature search. Twelve papers were identified, from which 893 patients were evaluated. The mean prevalence of MetS was 10.8%, suggesting its incidence is not increased. However, some aspects of MetS may be increased, such as diabetes. Hypothalamic-pituitary axis dysfunction, sympathetic nervous system dysfunction, proinflammatory states and several genetic mutations have been implicated in the observed metabolic dysregulation in schizophrenic patients, however much controversy exists in this area. The huge cardiovascular burden makes it crucial to establish the causes and optimal management of MetS in schizophrenia. ","1811":"In the present paper we want to emphasize the importance of more and more obvious subthreshold depressions, both for their high incidence in the general population and the high economic cost that results in terms of loss of working days, due to the difficulty of diagnosis especially for general practitioners in grasping the different aspects of Depression, when this is expressed not in the classical forms but as more and more often happens, in 'dimmed' forms and body language- included in the category of \"not otherwise specified\" (minor depression and brief recurrent depression), which are the main innovation compared to the DSM-IV DSM-III-R. The precocity of their diagnosis and the implementation of an effective treatment results in a lower severity of depressive symptoms and decrease in the risk of relapse. It is important therefore that doctors acquire knowledge and tools that allow early recognition of this clinical picture. ","1812":"Diagnosis and observation of patients' behaviour during outpatient visits or hospitalisations strips the diagnostic process of the opportunity to consider their places of residence as their natural environment. In this way, patients present their symptoms and problems outside of the context of their daily life. Community-based psychiatric care, on the other hand, provides a chance to include, in the diagnostic process the environment created by a patient in their home. This image of a patient's external reality can reflect a certain mental reality. Such elements as furniture and other objects, their number, quality, distribution may reflect the inner mental world of the objects featuring in a person's mind. In some cases, this can become a valuable contribution to a diagnostic process. A description of three patients, all treated for schizophrenia, has been presented in this paper in order to explore this possible relationship. The first individual, \"Patient N\" lives in a flat in a state of extreme depletion of elements. \"Patient N\" suffers from chronic schizophrenia with severe negative symptoms. The second individual, \"Patient D\", has been also diagnosed with schizophrenia. Yet his home is filled with a huge number of elements, writings on the wall, things, figurines and objects of symbolic meaning. A closer examination of his psychopathological symptoms (fantastic, colourful, bizarre content) and history of his illness (unstable diagnosis of schizophrenia), and unpredictable response to antipsychotics may indicate a dissociative type of schizophrenia. Finally, \"Patient K's\" main living space is dominated by cats that live with him. Patient K was exposed to physical violence as a child and to him cats represent safe, non-threatening objects. He has been also treated for paranoid schizophrenia. The differences between these patients' personal histories and the courses of their illnesses are clearly manifested in the way they create their immediate environment. ","1813":"Alcohol consumption in our society is a known, and a widely discussed problem, due to the proven negative impact of excessive usage of spirits on health. Aim of the study was to evaluate the rate of consumption, and risk of an alcoholic disease among Polish students. Study was carried out using an authors' own questionnaire, made of a queries about amount and frequency of alcohol consumption, risky behaviors and knowledge about alcoholism. Research was conducted through community portals (f.e. facebook.com), and within 3 weeks time (from a 10(th) of January to 31(st) of January 2013) 1300 students from different Polish universities participated in it. Out of them, after removal of inadequate questionnaires, group of 1259 students (822 females, 437 males) was selected for further analysis. Average age equaled to 21.5, with the maximum of 27 and minimum of 18 years. For the statistical analysis StatSoft \"Statistica\" 10.0 software was used. The study shows that 95.5% of students use alcohol (mostly beer and vodka) and they tend to overuse it. 28.86% of respondents drank excessively more than 3 times during the month preceding research, 46% of subjects also had an alcoholic palimpsest more than once, 12.7% need an alcohol to enjoy a party and 0.83% of respondents can't control the amount of a one-time alcohol consumption. 3.32% of students may be in the group of a high alcoholism risk. Alcohol consumption is a common problem among Polish students. Most of respondents, mostly males, drink excessively and potentially risky for their health. There is a remarkable group of students endangered with alcohol addiction. ","1814":"Alcoholism is a family disease. Many studies confirm that a family history of alcoholism is associated with the development of later alcohol dependence. The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of family structure and relations between its members in the development of alcohol addiction in children grown up in these families. The research study was based on authors` anonymous questionnaire including questions referring to: family structure, parents' divorce, prevalence of alcoholism in the family, parents' attitude towards alcohol and parent-child relationships. The study group consisted of 125 people, 83 men and 42 women, aged from 22 to 68 participating in treatment programs for alcohol addiction. The control group consisted of 231 people, 136 men and 95 women, age from 17 to 65, with no history of alcoholism. The study group participants stated less frequently that they had been raised by both parents (78% vs 87%, p&lt;0.05). In this group one of the parents significantly more frequently abused alcohol (43% vs 19%; p&lt;0.05) or both parents abused alcohol (15% vs 1%; p&lt;0.05). The participants also claimed to be more often punished for their failures, abused physically\/verbally and could less often depend on their parents. Based on these results we concluded that patients addicted to alcohol were more often raised by a single parent, they were more likely to have alcohol-dependent parents and relationships with their parents were more often impaired. ","1815":"Contemporary psychiatry is looking at affective sciences to understand human behavior, cognition and the mind in health and disease. Since it has been recognized that emotions have a pivotal role for the human mind, an ever increasing number of laboratories and research centers are interested in affective sciences, affective neuroscience, affective psychology and affective psychopathology. Therefore, this paper presents multidisciplinary research results of Laboratory for Interactive Simulation System at Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb in the stress resilience. Patient's distortion in emotional processing of multimodal input stimuli is predominantly consequence of his\/her cognitive deficit which is result of their individual mental health disorders. These emotional distortions in patient's multimodal physiological, facial, acoustic, and linguistic features related to presented stimulation can be used as indicator of patient's mental illness. Real-time processing and analysis of patient's multimodal response related to annotated input stimuli is based on appropriate machine learning methods from computer science. Comprehensive longitudinal multimodal analysis of patient's emotion, mood, feelings, attention, motivation, decision-making, and working memory in synchronization with multimodal stimuli provides extremely valuable big database for data mining, machine learning and machine reasoning. Presented multimedia stimuli sequence includes personalized images, movies and sounds, as well as semantically congruent narratives. Simultaneously, with stimuli presentation patient provides subjective emotional ratings of presented stimuli in terms of subjective units of discomfort\/distress, discrete emotions, or valence and arousal. These subjective emotional ratings of input stimuli and corresponding physiological, speech, and facial output features provides enough information for evaluation of patient's cognitive appraisal deficit. Aggregated real-time visualization of this information provides valuable assistance in patient mental state diagnostics enabling therapist deeper and broader insights into dynamics and progress of the psychotherapy. ","1816":"Although obsessive jealousy is a highly disturbing disorder, frequently it goes unrecognized, as most attention is paid to delusional jealousy, being the more prominent clinical phenomenon. In order to distinguish obsessive from delusional jealousy, the basic clinical characteristics of these two types of jealousy are presented, as well as the mechanism of their respective genesis, and the differences which we must be aware of in order to prevent misdiagnosis and consequent wrong treatment choices. The theoretical considerations are supported by case presentations providing a clear picture of the phenomena discussed. Unlike delusional jealousy, characterized by the presence of strong, false beliefs that the partner is unfaithful, individuals with obsessive jealousy suffer from unpleasant and irrational jealous ruminations that the partner could be unfaithful, accompanied by compulsive checking of partners' behaviour, which is recognised by the patient as ego-dystonic. This jealousy resembles obsessive-compulsive phenomenology more closely. Despite the differences, both forms of jealousy result in significant distress for patients and intimate relationships, and carry the risk of abuse, homicide and\/or suicide. Delusional jealousy is a psychotic disorder and should be treated mainly with antipsychotics, while obsessive jealousy resembles obsessive-compulsive disorder and should be treated with SSRIs and cognitive-behavioural therapy. Regardless of the presence or absence of insight into the disorder, one of the key factors in the treatment of pathological jealousy is to motivate the sufferers for pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions. ","1817":null,"1818":"In distinguishing why some patients respond and other do not respond to treatments arraised the clinically very important body of research considering weather patients' personality characteristics might predict outcomes of pharmacotherapeutic treatment. Personality can be a predictor of a psychiatric disorder either owing to their common genetic background or because it enhances exposure of the subject to environmental risk factors. The results of the studies using psychobiological model are reviewed. The studies show that personality temperament dimension Harm Avoidance and character dimension Self-directedness predict outcomes of the pharmacological treatment of depression, but the result for other psychiatric disorders are sparse. The studies are not straightforward in recommendations for treatment choice dependent of personality dimensions. ","1819":"Contemporary psychiatry pays more and more attention to the patient's capacity regarding acceptance of psychiatric drugs. Understanding the basis of our treatment's effectiveness becomes more challenging. To understand psychiatric treatment psychiatrists must pay full attention to mentalizing and the conditions under which this basic human capacity becomes impaired especially in those suffering from personality and eating disorders. This paper discusses the meaning and clinical applications of the mentalizing related to psychopharmacotherapy for personality and eating disorders patients, including suicidality. ","1820":"The treatment of psychiatric disorders often consists of a combined approach that integrates both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Unfortunately, psychiatric texts and the educational process in psychiatry training do not adequately address the combined approach. There is a lack of information concerned with the psychological aspect of prescribing medications. This is striking since many patients require both treatments. There is an inevitable psychological aspect of the administration of medication in psychiatry, and the meaning ascribed to the prescription of drugs has an impact on doctor-patient relationship. Understanding the psychodynamic issues is crucial for the success of psychopharmacology. Psychodynamic psychopharmacotherapy represents an integration of biological psychiatry and psychodynamic insights and techniques. This approach recognizes that many of the core discoveries of psychoanalysis are powerful factors in the complex relationship between the patient, the illness, the doctor, and the medications. Scientific pharmacotherapy is, as it should be, based upon patients' responses to treatments of specific target conditions. Enduring personality traits are being increasingly incorporated as targets for pharmacotherapy. However, in the real world of psychiatric practice we see that transference issues and a patient's character or set of personality traits have a greater impact on the selection, dosage, tolerability, and treatment outcome than is generally recognized or admitted. In contemporary psychiatry, a psychodynamic perspective must be preserved. Without it, meaning will be lost, and both diagnostic understanding and informed treatment planning will suffer. ","1821":"This paper discusses interrelations between creativity, mental disorders and their treatment. The psychology of creativity is very important for successful psychopharmacotherapy, but our knowledge about creativity is still insufficient. Even that which is known is not within the armamentarium of most practicing psychiatrists. In the first part of this article creativity and possible associations between creativity, mental health, and well-being are described. The second part deals with the intriguing relationship between creativity and mental disorders. The third part emphasizes the role of creativity in the treatment of mental disorders. This paper ends by underlining the importance of a creativity-enhancing oriented, and personal recovery-focused psychopharmacotherapy in helping psychiatric patients achieve fulfilled and purposeful lives. ","1822":"Antipsychotic monotherapy is strongly recommended in the treatment of schizophrenia. However, antipsychotic polypharmacy (APP) is common in clinical practice, and appears to be related to illness severity and duration, treatment-refractoriness, hospitalization status, duration of hospitalization, geographic region and age. Given the high number of different antipsychotic combinations reported in the literature and prescribed in clinical practice, there are perhaps more differences than similarities between such combinations. While the majority of combinations increase side-effect burden, limited evidence suggests benefits of certain combinations.Until more data are available, APP should be reserved for difficult-to treat patients, with careful consideration of pharmacodynamics properties and doses of each drug, as well as close monitoring. ","1823":"One of the most consistent biological findings in major depression (MDD) is the altered activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. It is not surprising that glucocorticoid receptor (GR), the common mechanism for stress-related changes in brain function, is a potential target of antidepressant drugs and therapies. All effective antidepressant treatments should trigger and maintain GR-related cellular processes necessary for recovery from MDD. Classic antidepressants act indirectly, by affecting the dynamic interplay between serotonin neurotransmission and HPA. On the other hand, certain compounds acting at supra-hypothalamic, HPA axis, glucocorticoid receptors, and post-receptor levels are being considered as new therapeutic options with the potential to modulate the aforementioned system in affective disorders directly. Different classes of drugs pharmacologically modify the HPA axis. This article summarizes the efficacy of classic antidepressants, as well as drugs classified as \"antiglucocorticoids\" (GR agonists, GR antagonists, dehydroepiandrosterone- DHEA, steroid synthesis inhibitors drugs, etc) in their capacity to heal glucocorticoid-mediated damage in depression. New avenues investigating the potential therapeutic benefits of antiglucocorticoids in affective disorders are at the proof-of-concept stage and future developments in this area deserve the full attention of psychiatrists and neuroscientists, as the current pharmacological treatment of MDD is far from perfect. ","1824":"Anti-inflammatory treatment could be expected to show positive effects in the subgroup of psychiatric patients who show signs of inflammation, i.e. an increase in proinflammatory cytokines and PGE2. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) not only reduces the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, but also affects glutamatergic neurotransmission and tryptophan\/kynurenine metabolism. In the meantime, several studies have been performed with the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib in schizophrenia; the studies found a therapeutic effect, mainly in the early stages of the disorder. We were able to demonstrate a statistically significant therapeutic effect of celecoxib on depressive symptoms in a study in patients with major depression (MD). Another study in fifty patients with MD also showed a statistically significant better outcome with celecoxib. This paper will discuss immune-based therapeutic approaches in both schizophrenia and depression. ","1825":"There are a lot of unresolved issues associated with the classification, diagnosis, clinical management and understanding of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of bipolar affective disorder. To search for discrete endophenotypes in BAD. We studied various bipolar I and II and recurrent depression patient samples and healthy controls using descriptive data, self and clinician-rated scales for neurological and psychopathological symptoms, neurocognitive instruments, and inventories for temperamental and characterological features. We also looked into the efficacy, tolerability and cost\/benefit ratio of sodium valproate in the treatment of acute mania. BAD patients display deficits in the domains of memory, selective attention, working memory and psychomotor speed. Sensory, motor and complex neurological soft signs can be considered part and parcel of the symptomatology of BAD. The evidence linking hyperthymic temperament to the bipolar spectrum is not supported, while cyclothymia seems to be a marker of vulnerability to affective psychopathology. In contrast to others, we found significantly lower self-transcendence in BAD patients compared to controls. Early age of onset, abrupt onset, lability of mood and energy with late-day brightening and activation, discriminate bipolar from unipolar depression. Sodium valproate (especially if started intravenously) is a highly efficacious, cost-effective treatment approach for acute mania. The discovery of BAD endophenotypes can enhance early diagnosis, prevent errors in treatment and help elucidate the genetic vulnerability for this grave disease. ","1826":"In literature, algorithms (guidelines) are often synonymous with problem-solving procedures. The importance of using algorithms in psychiatry can be seen in many areas. For physicians, algorithms ease clinical decision making, provide an adequate clinical basis for therapy, stimulate research, and stimulate sources of financing. For users of psychiatric services, algorithms tailor treatment to the individual, enhance the standard of care by using efficient therapeutic techniques, improve outcome, cut costs, and provide continuity of care after hospital treatment. Our goal with this paper is to present the advantages of using algorithms, but also to advise caution in their application. It is important to be aware and critical of limitations present in algorithm use. A MEDLINE and KOBSON search was conducted combining the following key words and phrases: \"treatment guidelines\"; \"algorithms\"; \"psychiatry\"; \"bipolar\"; \"depression\"; \"schizophrenia\". We investigated the advantages and disadvantages of algorithms presented in the publications we found in our search. We consider algorithms to be a necessary component in the treatment of psychiatric patients, but recommend that one should maintain a critical attitude and remember that guideline proposed therapy should always be tailored to the individual. ","1827":"Any medical or psychosocial treatment has two components, one associated with the specific effects of the treatment itself, and the other related to the treatment context, individual perception, imagination, subjective meaning and psychobiological response. Psychopharmacotherapy is a context dependent practice because different contexts affect the meaning of biological variables in different ways. Creation of favorable treatment context as well as creative collaboration with patients and their families may significantly improve treatment outcome. Positive therapeutic context is fundamental for treatment success in psychiatry because it may significantly increase placebo and decrease nocebo responses. Creative approach to psychopharmacotherapy reflects a creative synergism between clinical pharmacology and positive psychology of creativity in the frame of transdisciplinary holistic, integrative and person-centered psychiatry. ","1828":"Psychopharmacotherapy is a fascinating field that can be understood in many different ways. It is both a science and an art of communication with a heavily subjective dimension. The advent of a significant number of the effective and well tolerated mental health medicines during and after 1990s decade of the brain has increased our possibilities to treat major mental disorders in more successful ways with much better treatment outcome including full recovery. However, there is a huge gap between our possibilities for achieving high treatment effectiveness and not satisfying results in day-to-day clinical practice. Creative approach to psychopharmacotherapy could advance everyday clinical practice and bridge the gap. Creative psychopharmacotherapy is a concept that incorporates creativity as its fundamental tool. Creativity involves the intention and ability to transcend limiting traditional ideas, rules, patterns and relationships and to create meaningful new ideas, interpretations, contexts and methods in clinical psychopharmacology.","1829":"","1830":"This study describes the validation process for the Slovenian version of the Drug Addiction Treatment Efficacy Questionnaire (DATEQ). DATEQ was constructed from the questionnaires used at the Centre for the Treatment of Drug Addiction, Ljubljana University Psychiatric Hospital, and within the network of Centres for the Prevention and Treatment of Drug Addiction in Slovenia during the past 14 years. The Slovenian version of the DATEQ was translated to English using the 'forward-backward' procedure by its authors and their co-workers. The validation process included 100 male and female patients with established addiction to illicit drugs who had been prescribed opioid substitution therapy. The DATEQ questionnaire was used in the study, together with clinical evaluation to measure psychological state and to evaluate the efficacy of treatment in the last year. To determinate the validity of DATEQ the correlation with the clinical assessments of the outcome was calculated using one-way ANOVA. The F value was 44.4, p&lt;0.001 (sum of squares: between groups 210.4, df=2, within groups 229.7, df=97, total 440.1, df=99). At the cut-off 4 the sensitivity is 81% and specificity 83%. The validation process for the Slovenian DATEQ version shows metric properties similar to those found in international studies of similar questionnaires, suggesting that it measures the same constructs, in the same way and as similar questionnaires.

We analyzed the first and second waves of the reported articles about this double suicide case, in online daily newspapers, news portals and also the readers' comments. Provocative aspects were present in 38.9-100.0% of the articles, while preventive aspects were found in 0-22.2% of the articles. Readers commented in 49.6% \"Other Aspects\" (comments about all other aspects not belonging to any other category, i.e. Risk Behavior, Family Relations, Suicide Place and Methods, Prevention, Media Style Reporting) and in 25.4% \"Without Content\" (comments without a specific content: e.g. chatting), while \"Prevention\" (comments about possible safety preventive measures) was mentioned only in 1.5% of the comments. In 34.1% the emotional tonality of the comments was \"Neutral\" (indifferent comments: e.g. chatting). Though articles published for the second time were significantly longer than the firstly published ones, the preventive aspects of reporting were not added to the second articles either, but significantly more provocative aspects were found in them. The suicide reports, both in the first and second waves of reporting, were not in line with the recommendation of the international guidelines on suicide reporting. It draws the attention of professionals to the importance of developing national guidelines on media suicide coverage.

The aim of the study was to analyze the impact of the economic condition and family relations in childhood as risk factors for late-life depression. This was an analytical cross-sectional study comprising 120 subjects, 60 patients with unipolar depression and 60 subjects without depressive disorders, diagnosed in accordance with the 10-th International Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders. All participants in the study were above the age of 60 and there was no significant statistical difference in the sex proportion in both groups (p&gt;0.05). Data for the examination were taken from a self-reported questionnaire designed for our aim. The Geriatric Depression Scale was used to measure depressive symptoms. Our results have shown that severe financial difficulties are important events in childhood and are risk factors for depression in the elderly (Chi-square=12.68, df=2, p=0.0018). Our investigation has found the association of family relations with late-life depression. In fact, conflictual relations in the family were more common in the experimental group than in the control group (Chi-square=14.32, df=3, p=0.0025). Furthermore, father's addiction to alcohol in childhood was associated with depression in later life (p=0.013). The difference in childhood emotional neglect and unequal treatment between siblings in both groups was insufficient to be confirmed statistically, but the examinees with this trauma had a threefold higher chance of having depression later in life (Odds ratio=3.04, 95% CL0.92 &lt; OR&lt;10.65; Yates chi-square=3.2, df=1, p=0.07). Subjects who have estimated their mother (p=0.019) or father (p=0.046) having negative personal character traits had a significantly greater risk for development of late-life depression. Negative socio-economic circumstances as well as family conflicts during childhood are associated with late-life depression. Father's addiction to alcohol and parents' negative personal character traits are associated with depression in the elderly. ","1834":"Cancer often progresses very rapidly and either leads to various complications or patients eventually die of the disease. One of important consequences of cancer is depression which can increase the morbidity and mortality in non-treated cases. Religious coping is the use of religious beliefs or practices to reduce distress and deal with problems in life. This study aimed to determine the relationship between religious coping and depression in cancer patients. A descriptive-correlational study was conducted on 150 consequent cancer patients in three centers: Imam-Reza Hospital in Birjand, Qaem and Omid hospitals in Mashhad. Two questionnaires including Pargament's questionnaire for evaluation of religious coping and the Beck depression inventory were used. Data analysis was performed using multiple regression and correlation. There was no significant difference between men and women in the mean score of avoidant relationship with God and alternate fearfulness and hopefulness (ambivalence coping style). But the mean score of relationship with God in women was higher than men. The rate of depression was higher among patients who had an avoidant strategy. The religious coping method of relationship with God was effective in reducing depression. The rate of depression was lower among patients whose families had a better attitude to religion. Psychotherapy, individual\/familial counseling, and especially increasing of religious beliefs such as praying and trust in God, as well as increasing the knowledge of patient and his\/her family cause better acceptance of the disease and better confrontation of psychological problems.

Cariprazine has also moderate affinity for serotonin 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HT) 1A receptors, high affinity for 5-HT1B receptors with pure antagonism and low affinity for 5-HT2A receptors. Randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, flexible-dose (3-12 mg\/day) studies have demonstrated cariprazine is effective in both schizophrenia and acute manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder. The incidence of serious adverse events in cariprazine arm was no different than in placebo arm in these studies. The most common adverse events were extrapyramidal symptoms, headache, akathisia, constipation, nausea, and dyspepsia which can be explained with cariprazine's partial dopamine agonism. Although cariprazine treatment was associated with a higher incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, particularly akathisia and tremor, common side effects of marketed second generation antipsychotics such as weight gain, metabolic disturbances, prolactin increase or QTc prolongation were not associated with cariprazine, probably due to its moderate to low binding affinity for histamine H1 and 5-HT2C receptors. Animal studies show that cariprazine may have additional therapeutic benefit on impaired cognitive functioning with D3 receptor activity, however clinical data is still scarce. The aim of this article is to review the potential use of cariprazine for the treatment of acute manic episodes in the light of the preclinical and clinical trials reported to date.

The study group consisted of schizophrenic patients from the University Clinical Hospital Mostar (n=100), while the control group consisted of healthy subjects who came for systematic medical examinations at the infirmary of the Health Center Mostar (n=100). The diagnosis of MS was made according to NCEP-ATP III criteria, and on that basis subjects from both groups were divided into two subgroups, one with and one without MS.

Many hospitals in Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&amp;H) have become child-friendly during the implementation of the Project on Child-Friendly Hospitals supported by UNICEF and WHO. Apart from the introduction of child friendly environment, staff in hospitals was trained to provide a holistic approach. The program was closely linked to the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative that supported breastfeeding. A few years thereafter, our focus is still on the physical treatment of sick children, whereas the attention to their anxieties, fears and suffering has failed. A more serious approach to this problem is needed and should begin at an educational level in medical school programs. Accordingly, our philosophy (mission) should change from a mechanical (techno-) medicine to holistic medicine. ","1847":"Traditionally, research has been focused on the development of symptoms in direct trauma survivors. However, during the last two decades researchers and clinicians have started exploring the way individual traumatic stress exposure affects trauma victims' spouses, children and professional caregivers. Studying trauma within the family is a part of what is called systemic traumatology, a study of groups, institutions and other human systems that show stress reactions directly caused by a traumatic event or series of events. The effect of an individual's traumatic stress on family members and on persons in direct contact is conceptualized as secondary traumatisation. In its narrow sense, secondary traumatisation involves a transfer of nightmares, intrusive thoughts, flashbacks and other Posttraumatic Stress Disorder symptoms, which are typically experienced by individuals suffering from PTSD, onto their immediate surroundings. In its broader sense, the term refers to any kind of distress transfer from a trauma victim to their immediate surroundings, and includes a broad spectrum of distress manifestation along with that resembling Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. Beyond that, a family member's PTSD is potentially transferable to subsequent generations, interfering with the psychological development of children. ","1848":"Professionalism has been a hot topic in medical education and in medicine in general. Professionalism in medicine embodies the relationship between medicine and society as it forms the basis of patient-physician relationships and the mutual expectations patients and physicians have of each other. Education on professionalism in medicine and professionalism in medical education are two important liasions. Increasing efforts have focused on fostering professionalism in medical education. Medical faculties have long taught the theoretical and technical aspects of medicine, but teaching professionalism in medicine and healing qualities has been a recent trend. The concept of professionalism has evolved over time by a process of exploration and reflection. It seems that medical professionalism has been changing from paternalism to partnership with patients and mutuality, from tribalism to collegiality, and from self-sacrifice to shared responsibility. There is still no consensus on how professionalism in medicine should be defined as and about the best methods for teaching medical professionalism. The aim of this \"landscape\" review is to promote the complete integration of a culture of professionalism into the educational and research body, including staff, faculty, residents and students.

Our aim was to determine the proportion of medical students intending to pursue a career in psychiatry and to define undergraduate education-related factors influencing that choice. We report the preliminary findings of a cross sectional quantitative survey of final year Croatian medical students as part of the International Survey Of Student Career Choice In Psychiatry (ISOSCCIP). We surveyed medical students attending their final year at Zagreb School of Medicine in the academic year 2009\/2010, using a structured questionnaire examining demographics, students' preferences on future career choice and their evaluations of undergraduate psychiatry teaching. The overall student evaluation of the compulsory psychiatry curriculum was \"average\". Significantly higher ratings were reported by students who felt more involved in the teaching of the subject. The possibility of psychiatry as a career choice correlated significantly with better evaluation grades of psychiatry lectures. Furthermore, poor evaluation grades predicted a higher likelihood that medical students completely ruled out choosing a career in psychiatry. This is the first survey of this kind in Croatia. Student ratings of medical school psychiatric education and perceived involvement in teaching appears to influence the likelihood of a stated career in psychiatry. Addressing these issues may increase the number of students motivated to pursue psychiatry as their future career choice.

The objective of this study was to assess the impact of regular ecstasy use on its acute and subacute effects. At the first stage, we recruited 120 subjects. If participants continued regular use of ecstasy in this period, they were asked to participate in the second stage of the research 6 months later. Thirty-five subjects attended the second stage of the study, 5 of which were excluded because they had less than 5 drug experiences during the last 6 months. At last, we recruited 30 novice ecstasy users by means of the snowball technique in Tehran, Iran. The pattern of use and experienced effects of ecstasy was documented at the beginning and after 6 months of regular consumption with a self administered questionnaire. Little or no change was observed in acute effects. Those subacute effects that had considerable increase in frequency were anxiety, depression, aggression, memory impairment, poor concentration and learning problems. Small change in acute effects suggests low possibility of tolerance after at least 6 months of regular use. Our results support long term neurocognitive damage and mood impairment with ecstasy use. ","1856":"Formal education, daily living activities and jobs require knowledge and application skills of counting and simple mathematical operations. Problems with mathematics start in primary school and persist till adulthood. This is known as dyscalculia and its prevalence in the school population ranges from 3 to 6.5%. The study included 1424 third-grade students (aged 9-10) of all primary schools in the City of Kragujevac, Serbia. Tests in mathematics were given in order to determine their mathematical achievement. 1078 students (538 boys and 540 girls) completed all five tests. The frequency of dyscalculia in the sample was 9.9%. The difference between boys and girls according to the total score on the test was statistically significant (p&lt;0.005). The difference between students according to their school achievement (excellent, very good, good, sufficient and insufficient) was statistically significant for all tests (p&lt;0.0005). The influence of place of residence\/school was significant for all tests (p&lt;0.0005). Independent prognostic variables associated with dyscalculia are marks in mathematics and Serbian language. Frequency of dyscalculia of 9.9% in the sample is higher than in the other similar studies. Further research should identify possible causes of such frequency of dyscalculia in order to improve students` mathematical abilities. ","1857":"Personal space is the area individuals maintain around themselves into which others cannot intrude without arousing discomfort. The purpose of this study was to establish whether patients with anxiety disorder and patients with psychotic disorder differ in personal space preferences according to experimenter sex. 82 patients who met the ICD- criteria for psychotic and anxiety disorder participated in the study. Personal space was assessed using stop-distance method in which all subjects were approached by female and male experimenter from four directions. Personal space zone was significantly larger in the patients with anxiety disorder than in the patients with psychotic disorder. The results of this research can be seen as possible tendencies, rather than firm indications; it is necessary to make a further research, on a larger sample, of different aspects of psychotic and anxiety patients' personal spaces in a quest for the significances in their behavior in space. ","1858":"Identification with a media character is an influential factor for the effects of a media product on the recipient, but still very little is known about this cognitive process. This study investigated to what extent identification of a recipient with the suicidal protagonist of a film drama is influenced by the similarity between them in terms of sex, age, and education as well as by the viewer's empathy and suicidality. Sixty adults were assigned randomly to one of two film groups. Both groups watched a drama that concluded with the tragic suicide of the protagonist. Identification, empathy, suicidality, as well as socio-demographic data were measured by questionnaires that were applied before and after the movie screening. Results indicated that identification was not associated with socio-demographic similarity or the viewer's suicidality. However, the greater the subjects' empathy was, the more they identified with the protagonist in one of the two films. This investigation provides evidence that challenges the common assumption that identification with a film character is automatically generated when viewer and protagonist are similar in terms of sex, age, education or attitude. ","1859":"Today there exist different views on origins of suicidal behaviour, which can influence the help-seeking behaviour and the adherence to the treatment of suicidal people. The beliefs lay people and patients have about the origins of suicidal behaviour as well as the compatibility of their beliefs with the views of the mental health personnel (general practitioners and psychiatrists) were assessed. 45 semi-structured interviews with the general population, suicide attempters, general practitioners and psychiatrists were conducted, audio typed, transcribed and a thematic analysis of the data was carried out. The results indicated the incompatibility of the views. The general population and the suicide attempters favoured psychological explanations of suicidal behaviour, whereas the general practitioners and psychiatrists promoted medical explanations. The only common theme was perception of the suicidal crisis as a crucial factor in suicidality. Lay people and experts believe that suicidal crisis is the main origin of suicidal behaviour. The awareness of this common denominator and also of the differences in opinions between lay people and experts should be kept in mind when planning and implementing prevention and treatment programmes if we wish to promote help-seeking behaviour and attain good adherence to treatment.

Asperger-Syndrome is rarely reported in adult ADHD and commonly little attention is paid to this possible comorbidity. We investigated 53 adult ADHD-patients which visited our out patient clinic for first ADHD-diagnosis (17 females, 36 males; range of age: 18-56 years) for the frequency of a comorbid Asperger-Syndrome. Diagnosis of this autism-spectrum disorder was confirmed by applying the appropriate DSM-IV-criteria. Additionally we tested the power of the two screening-instruments \"Autism-spectrum quotient\" (AQ) and \"Empathy quotient\" (EQ) by Baron-Cohen for screening Asperger-Syndrome in adult ADHD. Eight ADHD-patients were diagnosed with a comorbid Asperger-Syndrome (15.1%). The difference in AQ- and EQ-scores between pure ADHD-patients and comorbid patients was analysed, showing significantly higher scores in AQ and significant lower scores in EQ in comorbid patients. Results show that the frequency of Asperger-Syndrome seems to be substantially increased in adult ADHD (versus the prevalence of 0.06% in the general population), indicating that investigators of adult ADHD should also be attentive to autism-spectrum disorders. Especially the AQ seems to be a potential screening instrument for Asperger-Syndrome in adult ADHD-patients.

Three groups (N=120) were analysed: DD, PD\/PDA, and a healthy control group, matched by socio-demographic characteristics and classified in sub-groups according to gender. Diagnoses were made using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV DD and PD\/PDA, and the personality assessment was made using the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory 201 (MMPI-201). MMPI-201 profile of DD and PD\/PDA groups has been characterised by a global increase of \"neurotic triad\" scales (Depression-Hypochondriasis-Hysteria) (D-Hs-Hy), more expressed in the DD group. Sub-groups of women and men with DD, when compared to the healthy control group, have a significant (p&lt;0.01) increase on the F, Hs, D, Pd, Pa, Pt and Sc scales, and sub-groups with PD\/PDA a significant (p&lt;0.01) increase on the F, Hs, D, Hy, Pa, Pt and Sc scales. Scores on the F, D, Hy, Hs, Pt, and Sc scales were significantly higher (p&lt;0.05), as well as on the scale Pa (p&lt;0.01) in men suffering from DD than in the PD\/PDA sub-group. Women suffering from DD, when compared to the PD\/PDA women, showed a significant increase (p&lt;0.05) on the F and Hy scales. Personality profiles of persons suffering from DD and PD\/PDA are very similar, with differences being more dimensional than qualitative. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings have been discussed. ","1865":"Panic disorder, a relatively common anxiety disorder, is often associated to agoraphobia and may be disabling. Its neurobiological underpinnings are unknown, despite the proliferation of models and hypotheses concerning it; investigating its correlates could provide the means for better understanding its pathophysiology. Recent structural neuroimaging techniques may contribute to the identification of possible brain morphological alterations that could be possibly related to the clinical expression of panic disorder. Through careful major database searches, using terms keen to panic, agoraphobia, structural magnetic neuroimaging and the like, we identified papers published in peer-review journals and reporting data on the brain structure of patients with panic disorder. Included papers were used comparatively to speculate about the nature of reported brain structural alterations. Anxiety, which is the core feature of the disorder, correlates with the function of the amygdala, which showed a smaller volume in patients, as compared to healthy subjects. Data also showed a volumetric decrease of the anterior cingulate along with increased fractional anisotropy, and increase of some brainstem nuclei, particularly of the rostral pons. Other structures with reported volumetric correlates of panic disorder are the hippocampus and the parahippocampal cortices, the insula, the putamen, and the pituitary gland. Volumetric changes in the anterior cingulate, frontal, orbitofrontal, insular, and temporal cortices have also been described in structural neuroimaging studies. Major methodological limitations are considered in context. Several data point to the existence of structural neuroanatomical alterations in panic disorder, consisting in significant volumetric reductions or increases in different brain areas. White matter alterations were shown also in the only diffusion tensor imaging study performed to date. Available data do not allow us to conclude about the possible progression of these alterations.

In such cases the combination of the two treatment modalities are commonly used. Amisulpiride, a second generation antipsychotic drug is used in the treatment of schizophrenia and psychotic depression. When amisulpiride is ineffective as a monotherapy, combination with ECT could be an option to enhance its efficacy. To the best of our knowledge, to date there have been no data about the safety of this combination. Medical notes of all patients who were given ECT while on amisulpiride were selected from the archives of the Department of Psychiatry, Semmelweis University Medical School, Budapest, covering a 10-year period. A randomly selected matched control group was formed from patients who underwent ECT but were not taking amisulpiride. Patients in both groups also received a variety of psychotropic drugs other than amisulpide. Side effects were compared between the two groups of patients. Twenty patients received amisulpride with ECT. The most common side effects were headache, hypertension, tachycardia, nausea, dizziness, confusion, psychomotor agitation, sialorrhea, and prolonged seizure activity. All adverse effects resolved within 24 hours. No side effects of any kind were observed in 7 and 8 cases in the study and control groups, respectively. This was the first study that examined the safety of amisulpride-ECT combination in schizophrenia. Comparing the side-effects between the study and control groups, no significant differences were detected in terms of their types or frequency. The amisulpiride-ECT combination appears to be a safe treatment option. ","1872":"Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the industrialized world. Recent research evidence suggests that psychosocial distress has been implicated as both a precursor to IHD and a significant risk factor for death in those with established IHD. According to WHO, psychosocial distress will be the most harmful risk factor for the development of IHD in the near future. Some experts have underlined the importance of the psychosocial distress of economic and political reforms as the main reason for the IHD mortality crisis in Russia in the 1990s. The aim of the present study was to estimate the effect of psychosocial distress on IHD mortality rate in Russia. Trends in age-adjusted, sex-specific suicide (as an integral indicator for psychosocial distress) and IHD mortality rate in Russia from 1965 to 2005 were analyzed employing a distributed lags analysis in order to assess the bivariate relationship between the two time series. Time series analysis indicates the presence of a statistically significant association between the two time series for males at lags 0 and females at lags 0 and 1. These findings suggest that the Russian IHD mortality crisis is most likely to have been precipitated by the psychosocial distress imposed by rapid societal transformation. The experience of Russia should serve as an example of how societal-level change can influence the health of a population. ","1873":"Many authors suggest that there is low reactivity of autonomic nervous system and reduced heart rate variability in patients with panic disorder. The patients are therefore exposed to increased cardiac mortality. Power spectral analysis is a successful tool in detecting autonomic instabilities in many disorders. The aim of our study is to monitor the activity of the autonomic nervous system through heart rate variability measured in the beginning and end of a therapeutic cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program in patients with panic disorder. We measured 31 patients with panic disorder in the beginning (1st measurement) and end of a therapeutic CBT program (2nd measurement). The autonomic nervous system (ANS) has been evaluated in three positions (supine - standing - supine). The evaluated parameters of the HRV linear analysis were: RR interval, HF, LF, VLF band and VLF + LF \/ HF ratio. Spectral activity in the very low frequency band was significantly higher in the 2nd measurement compared to the 1st measurement in the standing position. The ratio of the spectral activity at lower frequencies (VLF+LF) to high frequency (HF) was significantly lower in the supine position. This study demonstrated an improvement of neurocardiac control regulation after a therapeutic CBT program in patients suffering from panic disorder. ","1874":null,"1875":"Although the negative appraisals of the illness may be related to suicidal thinking and behaviours in schizophrenia, this has been insufficiently studied. The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between schizophrenic patients' cognitions about their illness and past suicidal behaviours. The relationship between patients' beliefs about their illness with potential mediators of suicidal behaviours such as depressive symptoms, hopelessness and insight was also investigated. A group of 60 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia according to ICD-10 criteria belonging to a follow-up study were assessed one year after their last psychiatric admission. Psychopathological variables were assessed by the Calgary Depression Scale, Beck Hopelessness Scale and the first three items of the Scale to Assess Unawareness of Mental Disorder. The appraisals of the illness were assessed by the Personal Beliefs about Illness Questionnaire. Negative appraisals were associated with hopelessness and depressive symptoms. Negative expectations and stigma showed the strongest associations. Contrary to our expectations, this scale was not able to differentiate between patients with and without past suicidal behaviour. Negative appraisals of the illness in patients with schizophrenia seem to have psychopathological consequences such as greater hopelessness and depression. Since these psychopathological features are linked to suicidal risk, the psychotherapeutic approach counteracting negative beliefs about the illness may reduce the risk of suicide. ","1876":"Mood disorders are an important health risk factor in the elderly population. Studies on the relationship between residential environment and elder's psychological wellbeing show the worst psychological status results in institutionalized subjects. To elucidate this relationship in Slovenia, we compared cognitive functioning and the levels of anxiety and depression of Slovenian elders among different residential arrangements. The subjects were recruited from elderly clubs (EC; living at home; n=32), elderly day care centers (EDC; living at home; n=22), and elderly homes (EH; institutionalized; n=49). All were female, 65-80 years of age and matched for their duration of education. We compared the cognitive status (Mini Mental State Examination) and the levels of depression and anxiety (Zung self-rating depression scale inventory, Zung self-rating anxiety scale inventory) among the three groups. For statistics ANOVA, MANOVA, and ANCOVA were used. The EDC group showed the highest levels of anxiety, depression and cognitive decline compared to the EC and EH groups, with no statistically significant differences between the EC and EH groups did not differ significantly in these respects. Controlling for the cognitive status revealed that general cognitive functioning and residential environment did not exert their influence directly on the depression level, but rather through their interaction. Regarding anxiety levels, after controlling for the cognitive status no significant differences were found between the study groups. In terms of anxiety and depression among Slovenian elders without or with moderate cognitive decline, home environment may be favored versus institutionalization. Visitors of EDC should probably receive more attention to their psychological wellbeing, including possible earlier transfer to EH. ","1877":"Establishing whether a depressive episode is part of a unipolar or bipolar disorder is essential for treatment planning. Over recent years, a growing number of publications have discussed psychopathological characteristics that might serve as indicators of bipolarity in patients with a history of depression dominated by unipolar symptoms. Our primary aim was to verify the adequacy of these indicators in contributing to a precise diagnosis in everyday clinical practice. We investigated 104 patients diagnosed with major depressive episode at the time of examination. 52 patients had major depressive disorder and 52 patients had bipolar disorder. The patients were then assessed for the presence of potential bipolarity indicators: psychomotor slowing, self-view (self-blaming, feelings of worthlessness), hypersomnia, increased appetite, leaden paralysis\/loss of physical energy, weight increase, interpersonal sensitivity, and early morning insomnia, using the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology. We analysed the correlations between these indicators and the presence of unipolar or bipolar affective disorder. Psychomotor slowing, self-blaming\/feelings of worthlessness, increased appetite, leaden paralysis\/loss of physical energy, and weight increase were significantly more frequent in bipolar depression than in unipolar depression (p&lt;0.05). Early morning insomnia was significantly more frequent in unipolar depression (p&lt;0.05). There was no statistically significant correlation between hypersomnia or interpersonal sensitivity and either of the affective disorders. It would be worthwhile identifying the relative importance of clinical indicators for probable BP in large-scale prospective studies. These would contribute to the better diagnostic assessment of major depressive episodes and therapeutic decision-making. ","1878":"Although most psychiatric patients are not violent, serious mental illness is associated with increased risk of violent behavior. Most of the evidence available pertains to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. MEDLINE data base was searched for articles published between 1966 and November 2012 using the combination of key words 'schizophrenia' or 'bipolar disorder' with 'aggression' or 'violence'. For the treatment searches, generic names were used in combination with key words 'schizophrenia' or 'bipolar disorder' and 'aggression' No language constraint was applied. Only articles dealing with adults were included. The lists of references were searched manually to find additional articles. There were statistically significant increases of risk of violence in schizophrenia and in bipolar disorder in comparison with general population. The evidence suggests that the risk of violence is greater in bipolar disorder than in schizophrenia. Most of the violence in bipolar disorder occurs during the manic phase. The risk of violence in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is increased by comorbid substance use disorder. Violence among adults with schizophrenia may follow at least two distinct pathways-one associated with antisocial conduct, and another associated with the acute psychopathology of schizophrenia. Clozapine is the most effective treatment of aggressive behavior in schizophrenia. Emerging evidence suggests that olanzapine may be the second line of treatment. Treatment adherence is of key importance. Non-pharmacological methods of treatment of aggression in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are increasingly important. Cognitive behavioral approaches appear to be effective in cases where pharmacotherapy alone does not suffice. Violent behavior of patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is a public health problem. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches should be used to treat not only violent behavior, but also contributing comorbidities such as substance abuse and personality disorders. Treatment adherence is very important for successful management of violent behavior. ","1879":"Subjective factors influencing placebo response have been a focus of numerous theoretical conceptualizations and empirical research. One such factor, individual's personality, has been linked to different clinical conditions, their expressions and treatment outcomes. Thus, there is little surprise many researchers have tried to identify placebo-prone personality over the years. Because of certain methodological and conceptual issues of the earlier studies, these efforts have not been very fruitful. However, recent scientific endeavours, facilitated by improved experimental designs and neuroimaging technology, have 'reignited the old fires'. It is now suggested that studies exploring the placebo-related personality traits, such as optimism\/pessimism, neuroticism, and novelty seeking, need to take into account situational variables (e.g., positive or negative expectations, patient-clinician relationship) and relevant underlying neurobiological mechanisms (e.g., endogenous opioid and dopaminergic systems). Even though many questions still remain to be answered, such as the identification of different situational variables interacting with personality traits, exploration and better understanding of placebo-related personality would facilitate the use of placebo in clinical practice and improve the methodology of clinical trials.","1880":"Most often it is assumed that the 'psychosomatic' concept originated from psychoanalysis. However, this term had already been introduced into medical literature about 80 years before Sigmund Freud - namely by Johann Christian August Heinroth, the first professor of psychiatry and psychotherapy in the western world. Widely through quotations from his works, the authors analyze Heinroth's understanding of the interrelations between the body and the soul. For Heinroth both formed a unified, indivisable whole, which interacted in many ways, including pathologically. According to him, a mental illness had its cause in the patient's leading a 'wrong life'. This 'wrong life' deranged the soul from its normal functioning. In a second step, this derangement can have an impact on the body and produce the somatic symptoms that accompany a mental illness. Since both 'components' of the 'indivisible whole' were affected, it was clear for Heinroth that doctors needed to view their patients holistically and treat the whole person. Since in the end the somatic symptoms were caused by an underlying mental derangement, this needed to be treated in the first place - and the psyche could only be reached by direct psychological intervention. Hence what he called his 'direct-psychische Methode' ought to be the remedy of choice for mental illnesses. Through his clear understanding of the interactions of body and soul and by integrating somatic and psychological therapies into a holistic, unified treatment programm, Heinroth is of major importance for the history of psychosomatic medicine.","1881":"The renewal of the philosophical debate in psychiatry is one exciting news of recent years. However, its use in psychopharmacology may be problematic, ranging from self-confinement into the realm of values (which leaves the evidence-based domain unchallenged) to complete rejection of scientific evidence. In this paper philosophy is conceived as a conceptual audit of clinical psychopharmacology. Its function is to criticise the epistemological and methodological problems of current neopositivist, ingenuously realist and evidence-servant psychiatry from within the scientific stance and with the aim of aiding psychopharmacologists in practicing a more self-aware, critical and possibly useful clinical practice. Three examples are discussed to suggest that psychopharmacological practice needs conceptual clarification. At the diagnostic level it is shown that the crisis of the current diagnostic system and the problem of comorbidity strongly influence psychopharmacological results, new conceptualizations more respondent to the psychopharmacological requirements being needed. Heterogeneity of research samples, lack of specificity of psychotropic drugs, difficult generalizability of results, need of a phenomenological study of drug-induced psychopathological changes are discussed herein. At the methodological level the merits and limits of evidence-based practice are considered, arguing that clinicians should know the best available evidence but that guidelines should not be constrictive (due to several methodological biases and rhetorical tricks of which the clinician should be aware, sometimes respondent to extra-scientific, economical requests). At the epistemological level it is shown that the clinical stance is shaped by implicit philosophical beliefs about the mind\/body problem (reductionism, dualism, interactionism, pragmatism), and that philosophy can aid physicians to be more aware of their beliefs in order to choose the most useful view and to practice coherently. In conclusion, psychopharmacologists already use methodological audit (e.g. statistical audit); similarly, conceptual clarification is needed in both research planning\/evaluation and everyday psychopharmacological practice.","1882":"","1883":"","1884":"We assess the number of patients who we have on the Database of a Community Mental Health Team in the UK who have Bipolar Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder.

We note the difficulties regarding the use of phenomenology alone to decide this problem, and we note the similarities in genetics, neuroimaging observations and neurobiological mechanisms among the following conditions; Bipolar Disorder, Unipolar Depression, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, and Borderline Personality Disorder. Ethiologies such as Trauma, Abuse, Childhood adversity and exposure to War appear to influence all these conditions via epigenetic mechanisms. Hence we argue that for a spectrum to be proposed, conditions in the spectrum need to be underpinned by similar or common Neuroimaging and neurobiological mechanisms.On this basis, it may be reasonable to include Borderline Personality Disorder within a broadly described bipolar spectrum. New details of the common Neurobiological mechanisms continue to emerge.","1885":"A higher rate of psychosis has been observed in immigrant populations as compared to the indigenous populations of the UK. Specifically, second generation immigrants (born in the UK) have been noted to have the highest risk. This phenomenon has been attributed to a number of genetic and social factors such as problems with acculturation. Previous studies in Luton, Bedfordshire have shown that the Bangladeshi community experience the highest rate of psychosis above all other ethnic minorities in this area. Here, we consider the lasting epigenetic impact of the stressor of migration and discuss the implications for further work and treatment.","1886":"It has been reported that some atypical antipsychotics promote neurogenesis in the hippocampus and possibly in the frontal cortex.

Our aim in this study was to compare factors influencing career choice between French medical students considering and not considering psychiatry as a specialty. Quantitative cross-sectional online survey on 145 French students in their last year of medical school. 22.7% of our sample considered choosing a career in psychiatry. A preference for a career in psychiatry was associated with more frequent history of personal\/familial mental illness, higher ratings of psychiatric teaching, more weeks of compulsory psychiatry teaching and placement, during which students had more often met patients in recovery and been asked their opinion on patients. Students considering psychiatry as a career also emphasized more the need for a good work-life balance, and presented better attitudes toward psychiatry.

Depression and cognitive dysfunction share a common neuropathological platform in cortical and sub-cortical brain areas implicated in emotional and cognitive processing which may be under the control of genetic and environmental factors.","1890":"In this article we discuss what we can discover about Bedrich Smetana's illness and its effect on his art.","1891":"Recovery encompasses symptom remission and functional elements such as cognition, social functioning and quality of life. Personal recovery is also important in illness management to help the person stay on track with treatment and focus on activities unrelated to taking medication that maintain mental health. In the present study we aimed to identify neurocognitive functioning in two clinically stable groups of patients with personal recovery and non-recovered patients. The results showered generalized cognitive deficits in both groups while the non-recovery group was more impaired in verbal and visual memory, acoustic and tactile gnosis and neurodynamics and executing functioning. Interestingly the recovery group demonstrated lack of programming of actions and sufficient error monitoring and self-correction whereas the non-recovery group was significantly more impaired in all executive domains. The obtained results could be beneficial in identifying a target for psychosocial treatments and specifically cognitive remediation for patients with schizophrenia to facilitate the process of recovery.","1892":"Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a member of the neurotrophin family and is widely expressed throughout the central nervous system (CNS). BDNF is involved in proliferation, differentiation, survival and death of neuronal and non-neuronal cells in the developing and adult CNS. The BDNF hypothesis of depression postulates that a reduction in BDNF is directly involved in the pathophysiology of depression, whilst anti-depressant mediated restoration of BDNF is responsible for the alleviation of the depressive state. This hypothesis is drawn from several studies implicating BDNF in depression and has received considerable support, which will be reviewed in this paper. This review will also discuss the implications of the functional Val66Met polymorphism of the gene encoding BDNF, which may reduce BDNF expression particularly when exposed to stress and thus may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of depression.","1893":null,"1894":null,"1895":"There exists a growing argument in favour of a more dimensional approach to the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric patients.

The aim of the study was to evaluate possible danger that may occur in the working environment of physiotherapists as well as to assess the correlation between such factors as the length of professional experience and exposure to the aggression inflicted by patients and workmates in the workplace with the level of aggression occurring within the professional group of physiotherapists. The study was conducted among 50 physiotherapists from Opole and the Silesian Voivodships in Poland. Two types of questionnaires were used: the author's own questionnaire, assessing exposure of the physiotherapists to aggression in the workplace, and the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire. The results were analyzed with the Statistica 8.0 application. 60% of participants suffered from patients' verbal aggression, 8% from physical aggression and 26% from the patients' emotional self-aggression at least twice a month. The study showed a minor correlation between the duration of the length of professional experience and the level of hostility (r=0.2; p&gt;0.05). There is a considerable impact of negative emotions present in relations with workmates at the workplace causing mainly increase of general aggression among physiotherapists and hostility. Similarly, negative emotions that may appear in relations between psychiatrists and patients show a positive correlation with the level of general aggression developed by doctors. It can be observed that there is a huge impact of the impulsive behaviour and attitude (presented both by patients and workmates in the workplaces) on the appearance of aggressive actions by physiotherapists (especially anger and hostility). Further research in this field is needed. ","1898":"Several studies have been carried out regarding the possible overlap between Bipolar Disorder and borderline personality disorder. Up to now, it is not possible to provide a definitive picture. In fact, there is currently significant debate about the relationship between Borderline Personality Disorder and Bipolar Disorder. MEDLINE searches were performed to identify the latest studies of these disorders, considering psychodynamic aspects. Bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder share common clinical features, namely affective instability and impulsivity which however differ in quality. Consequently, to better understand these aspects, it is necessary to trace the stages of childhood psychological development. It has been claimed that Bipolar Disorder Type II can be divided into two subtypes: one stable and functional between episodes and one unstable between episodes which is related to Borderline Personality Disorder. However, better diagnostic theories, psychiatrist's empathy and patience remain the essential tool to understand and to face human suffering. ","1899":"Suicidal ideation and attempts account for a significant number of Emergency Department visits and represent a major public and mental health problem. Suicide and suicide attempts are a major cause of death and morbidity worldwide. 111 suicide attempters (81 F (73%), 30 M (27%)) were consequently recruited in the Emergency Department of the Santa Maria della Misericordia, Perugia, Italy between June 2011 and June 2012. Patients were assessed and demographic and clinical data were collected in clinical records. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS software. Chi-square test and logistic regression were used as appropriate. A p-value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Females attempt suicide 3 times more frequently than males and generally use a non-violent suicide attempt method. In our sample unmarried status is the most represented and the most common diagnosis is major depressive disorder, followed by borderline personality disorder. Suicide attempts are more frequent in January. It is of crucial importance to conduct a suicide risk assessment when subjects are admitted to an ED given that the strongest known predictor for future suicide is attempted suicide. ","1900":null,"1901":"Depressive disorders are often treated with the use of antidepressants and with psychotherapy at the same time. According to the literature these two types of treatment may exert a certain influence on brain functioning. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of different forms of therapeutic methods on the improvement of cognitive functions. 60 patients participated in the study. They were divided into 3 groups treated with pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy or both, respectively. The neuropsychological changes observed as a results of the application of these methods was assessed with the Vienna Test System (VTS). The patients recruited to the study were treated at the psychotherapeutic subdivision of a psychiatric ward. Inclusion in the study was restricted to individuals with a diagnosis of recurrent depressive disorder. The improvement in psychological tests measuring short-term memory and attention was present on average after 8 weeks of treatment and was most prominent in patients treated with both forms of therapy. The interpretation of the achieved results must be cautious because of the relatively small groups participating in the study. Further research is necessary to analyze the impact of different therapeutic forms used in the treatment of depression on cognitive processes. ","1902":"A diagnosis of schizophrenia, as well as the use of atypical antipsychotic medications, have previously been linked with a higher prevalence of diabetes. 670 patients from a single out-patient clinic were analysed (Chi-square) to determine if diagnosis or antipsychotic treatment had an effect on the prevalence of diabetes. The overall rate of diabetes was also compared to the national average. No significant effects of antipsychotic class or diagnosis were found on prevalence, and the prevalence was not significantly different to the national average. This work may point to a need to carry out a systematic assessment of these patients for Metabolic Syndrome or diabetes as a thorough review\/screen for these patients. ","1903":"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a very common condition, although its prevalence is believed to be underestimated. The affected subjects often have trouble to search for support. The onset occurs mainly in early adolescence. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the impact of school and family background on the development of SAD. Our survey, available on a popular social network site, was divided into 4 parts: 1) demographic data (gender, age, site of residence), 2) genetic and organic background (comorbid mental disorders, addictions), 3) situation at school and in the family environment during adolescence, 4) the part designed to define the group that may suffer from SAD with the use of the Mini-Social Phobia Inventory (Mini-SPIN). 226 people were recruited. The age range was 16-61, with the average of 25,8. 71% of the respondents lived in cities with a population of more than 100 000. Male to female ratio was 3:1. According to Mini-SPIN 26,5% of the interviewees might suffer from SAD (28.2% of women and 21.4% of men). Our study showed, that both family and school environment factors have an influence on the development of SAD. It was shown that the especially important risk factors are bad relations with peers and being an object of derision at school. The percentage of network community users that are likely to suffer from SAD, significantly exceeds the clinical data. Both family and school environment factors were shown to be risk factors for the development of this disorder. ","1904":"The origin and course of eating disorders constitute a multifactorial etiopathology. This is why it is important to consider the psychological, developmental, biological and socio - cultural evaluation of each patient. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM IV - TR (APA, 1994) distinguishes two main eating disorders: Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia Nervosa. Together with them are described a broad and heterogeneous category (EDNOS) of \"atypical eating disorders,\" that is a clinically significant eating disorder, but that does not meet all the diagnostic criteria for Anorexia Nervosa or Bulimia Nervosa. The aim of this pilot study was to analyze the differences detectable in anorexic and bulimic patients in relation to several factors of mental functioning, particularly with respect to the presence of distinctive characteristics and symptoms and the associated substrate personality. 20 patients with eating disorders who have a residential rehabilitation program, all women, 10 diagnosed with AN aged between 18 years and 31 years, including (5 Restrictive and 5 with Purging) and 10 diagnosed with BN aged between 19 years and 31 years (including 5 with Purging). The pictures of AN and BN can be placed within a continuum of symptoms that distinguishes them exclusively for the presence or absence of bulimic episodes; also the symptom of bulaemia can be considered a most important aspect in the distinction between anorexia and bulimia as all other aspects of mental functioning appear to be similar in almost direct measurement, and finally some food pathological events are associated with personality characteristics, Axis I symptoms and quality of life, linked to specific types of global functioning. Some symptoms may have different functions depending on the patient's personality style: a patient may develop a symptom of anorexia because it is competitive and a perfectionist, another as a form of self-punishment or as a strategy to regulate the feeling of being out of control, another again as a phenotypic expression of an underlying mood disorder, in the same way the purging may represent a reaction for a patient who is emotionally dysregulated or a measure of weight control which is more deliberate for a patient who is highly controlled perfectionist. There is a need to look at eating disorders within a global view of mental functioning, these conditions may be considered \"diagnostic trans', ie disturbances traveling along a continuum, and are therefore characterized by a \"diagnostic migration.\" ","1905":"The Kraepelinian dichotomy sees schizophrenia and bipolar disorder as two distinctly separate diseases each with its own pathogenesis and disease process. This study looks at the difference between patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in terms of suicidal behaviour. Both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have been identified as significant risk factors for suicide, while bipolar and major depressive disorder appear to be the greatest diagnostic indicators. This study also aims to look at any differences in suicidal behaviour between the two major classes of bipolar disorder (bipolar I and bipolar II) to possibly determine how distinct these two conditions are in this respect.     As expected, this study found that patients with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder were significantly more likely (OR=4.79) to have a history of suicidal behaviour than patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia.     Neither bipolar I nor bipolar II patients were significantly more likely to have a history of suicidal behaviour. However, this study yielded a weak association between bipolar II patients and suicidal behaviour (OR=1.83) compared to bipolar I patients, which may have been more significant under different circumstances such as a greater sample size.","1906":"Bipolar disorder, also known as manic-depressive illness, is a brain disorder that causes unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, and the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. The involvement of genetic factors has been evaluated through twin, family, linkage and association studies but specific genes that contribute to the illness remain unclear. This study gives an overview of available literature.","1907":"Bipolar disorder; migraines and epilepsy are three prevalent conditions, of which little is understood about their pathophysiological processes. Co-morbidities often present between two of these conditions, but it is uncommon for all three to co-exist in a patient. Here, we present a middle-aged gentleman, seen in the outpatient department of a district general hospital in England, who suffers from severe effects of all three disorders, with no other medical history. Clinical difficulties have arisen in the diagnosis and treatment of his bipolar disorder. Management of his depressive episodes with simple selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and mood stabilisers were either ineffective, or precipitated complicating adverse effects. Persistent use of citalopram is likely to have triggered bipolar disorder, whilst quetiapine induced seizures. The clinical problems presented question the possibility that bipolar disorder; migraines and epilepsy may fall on the same spectrum of disorders. This could contribute towards the complexities in treating his conditions. Further insight into their link and interactions would facilitate diagnoses of these conditions, as well as improve treatment strategies when they are presented co-morbidly.","1908":"The Gaza Strip, with a population of 1.7 million, over half of whom are under 18 years old, has existed in a state of ongoing conflict and containment for years, most notably since its closure in 2007. There is much concern for the mental health of the vast young generation who have little memory of other circumstances of existence, and even less exposure to the outside world. Their society forms the site of direct conflict and social destruction pertaining to untreated stress among the adults. However, leaving the social realm for the institutional for mental health treatment carries strong taboo, especially for adults. Civil society expert organisations offering a range of mental health work primarily pertaining to childrens social development can bypass some of this taboo and can also intervene at their schools and in their families, and may be most strategically located as social rather than institutional actors. Empowering the youth and seeking to strengthen Gazan society through them and for them causes some friction with the local government.     However, despite the cultural and political challenges of mental health treatment for children within the Gaza Strip, the wider fact remains that however treated and psychosocially rehabilitated, society is predictably the site of renewed trauma in the short term and foreseeable future, enmeshing the mental health of its future generation inseparably with the international politics it inhabits.","1909":"Since Kraepelin grouped affective disorders under the title of 'manic-depressive insanity', there has been controversy over whether the bipolar and unipolar entities within this are distinct affective disorders or whether they are merely two ends of an affective continuum. In order to bring some clarity and goal-posts to this argument, we define the criteria that must be fulfilled by diseases in order to be considered as part of a spectrum. We analyse bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder with respect to these criteria and find the model fits in many respects but fails to account for either the poor correlation in severity of manic and depressive symptoms or for the apparent discontinuity in the distribution of familial mania. A one-dimensional spectrum is thus too simple and a two-dimensional approach is required; this also fits much better with our current understanding of the genetic picture.","1910":"Recently, the pharmacological division between typical and atypical antipsychotics has been called into question. New evidence, however, continues to emerge showing differences between these two classes of drugs. Hence typical and atypical antipsychotics are clearly different classes of drugs, as evidenced by their actions, mechanisms, effects and side effects. The most recently investigated field in which both classes of drugs have opposing effects is neuron survival and neurogenesis. Schizophrenia has been found to be a disease of progressive reductions in grey matter, and the more lost, the worse the outcome. Medication naive patients have lowered levels of neurotrophins e.g. NT-3, NGF BDNF. The antipsychotic drugs alter the levels of these neurotrophins. Haloperidol, of the typical antipsychotics, causes neuron apoptosis by a free radical induced mechanism, involving Bcl-XS, P53, cytochrome c translocation and caspase 3 activation. Haloperidol also lowers BDNF levels, reducing neuroprotection in the brain to enable haloperidol's toxic effects. Atypical drugs have opposing effects. They increase levels of BDNF, improve cell survival and enhance neurogenesis. Atypical drugs can also prevent or reverse the effects of haloperidol induced toxicity. The mechanism involves the inverse agonism of 5HT receptors, particularly those of the 2A subset, but the situation is considerably more complicated.","1911":"This paper describes the relationship between depression and the difficulties experienced in the postmodern world for human beings who must reconcile their consciousness of their own death and the feelings of powerlessness in the face of inevitable consequences. Depression and suicide are closely linked, and the consequences in terms of philosophy and psychology are described.","1912":null,"1913":"Suicidal behaviour is a significant public health problem. Suicide alone represents the 10th leading cause of death worldwide. Suicide is a complex phenomenon and may be the result of an interaction of biological, psychological and socioeconomic factors. Although there are many differences in suicide rates between different countries in the world, some studies reported huge differences of suicide rates between different regions within the same country as well. The studies that investigated the regional differences in suicide rates were gathered in the present article. The studies revealed that depression frequently remained unidentified and thus untreated and could contribute to high regional suicide rates. It could be speculated that access to services, which increases the possibility of diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders, could have an impact on regional suicide rates. Thus the availability of services may be relevant in explaining geographical variations in suicide incidence. Many studies reported that suicide was a major public health issue of particular concern among rural populations, which experienced a consistently higher suicide rate than urban areas considering the availability of psychiatric services, was typically less available in rural regions. As suggested in some studies, it seems that socioeconomic factors outweighed climatic factors in explaining regional differences in the suicide rate but further research is needed.","1914":"During adolescence, there is an increased chance of increased incidence of depression and the development of addictive\/dependent behaviours such as pathological gambling, excessive Internet use and compulsive shopping, Here we present a psychoeducational approach in the schools of Pescara and Penne to identify and treat these problems.","1915":"With the inauguration of the UK's first ever Medical Film festival MedFest in 2011 there has been resurgence in the interest of the association between psychiatry and film. The festival in 2012 was titled \"HealthScreen\": Understanding Illness through Film and its aim, according to the founder Dr Kamran Ahmed, was, 'To stimulate debate of the social, political and ethical implications of portrayals of health and illness on our screens' (1).     Waltz with Bashir is a 2008 Israeli animated documentary film written and directed by Ari Folman. It portrays the protagonist (Folman) in search of his lost memories of his experience as a soldier in the 1982 Lebanon War and his attempt to both decipher them and reconcile himself with them.      2012 marks the 30th year commemoration of the Sabra and Shatilla tragedies. Waltz with Bashir vividly depicts the massacres of Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps in Beirut through the lens of an ex-IDF serviceman and the harrowing effects that PTSD has on him. Waltz with Bashir was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film however despite the popularity of the film and much critical acclaim it is officially banned in Lebanon.      The authors are mindful of the devastating effects that the atrocities have had on the mental health of all those who were involved, the Lebanese, Palestinians and also the Israelis. The purpose of this presentation is to explore how the film Waltz with Bashir portrays PTSD and how it has influenced cultural perceptions.","1916":"Different environmental factors are thought to be responsible for 15-20% of schizophrenia pathogenesis. Religion has long been considered a major force in human life, regardless of economic, social or political affiliation. How the perception of religion has changed over time, especially in the context of mental illness, was the focal point of this long-term comparative study. A random selection of 100 case histories from the years 1932, 1952, 1972 and 1992 was selected. By reviewing the subject history and medical notes, information on the presence of religious hallucinations and\/or delusions were collected and grouped. Religious topics were demonstrated in 46.8% of the test population. Whereas there was a clear diversity of religious-themed delusions, \"God\", \"Christ\", \"Mary\", \"Satan\/devil\" and \"hell\" all figured prominently across all reviewed years. There is a progressive decrease in the number of religious topics in paranoid schizophrenia. The transfer of holiness from historical saints onto a subject was observed. Evil dominates over good in productive symptoms in paranoid schizophrenia. The phenomenon of apocalyptic subjects in paranoid hallucinations and delusions increased after the Second World War. Religious topics of hallucinations and delusions change over time and relate to objective historical events and reflect changes in religiosity in society. ","1917":"The World Health Organization estimates that almost one million deaths each year are attributable to suicide, and suicide attempt is close to 10 times more common than suicide completion. Suicidal behaviour has multiple causes that are broadly divided into proximal stressors or triggers and predisposition such as genetic. It is also known that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) occur throughout a human DNA influencing the structure, quantity and the function of proteins and other molecules. Abnormalities of the serotonergic system were observed in suicide victims. Beside 5-HT1A and other serotonin receptors most studied are the serotonin transporter 5' functional promoter variant, and monoamine oxidase A and the tryptophan-hydroxylase 1 and 2 (TPH) polymorphisms. It seems that especially genes regulating serotoninergic system and neuronal systems involved in stress response are associated with suicidal behaviour. Most genetic studies on suicidal behaviour have considered a small set of functional polymorphisms relevant mostly to monoaminergic neurotransmission. However, genes involved in regulation of other factors such as brain-derived neurotropic factor seems to be even more relevant for further research.","1918":"The management of stress in a group of patients with Bipolar II Disorder is described. The use of psychotherapy and psycho-education has been shown to reduce the number of relapses and improve the quality of life of these patients.","1919":"In bipolar disorder there is a deterioration of concomitant diseases, a marked deterioration in the quality of life, an increased difficulty of personal relationships, both in the family and the workplace, and an increased vulnerability and inability to deal with stress. Here we describe how pharmacotherapy can be combined with psychotherapy and psycho-education to improve recovery of a patient with bipolar disorder.","1920":"Primary insomnia (PI) is a common sleep disorder affecting diurnal functioning. It may contribute to the development of several comorbidities such as major depression or arterial hypertension. It affects about 7% of the adult population. Pharmacotherapy remains the most common treatment for insomnia. However, many studies suggest CBT may be a supreme therapeutic approach resulting in a better long-term outcome.      The aim of the study was to determine the efficacy of a CBT-protocol in the treatment of PI by means of sleep onset latency and the number of awakenings during night parameters along with sleep quality and the level of psychophysiological hyperarousal. The secondary outcomes were focused on CBT efficacy as determined by the predisposition to insomnia as related to higher vulnerability to stress (measured with FIRST)     MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-six individuals from a tertiary reference sleep disorders outpatients' clinic (22 women; mean age 41.4; 4 men; mean age 42.5) with primary insomnia (DSM-IV-TR) were included in the study. The exclusion covered other primary sleep disorders, secondary insomnia (psychiatric illness, unstable somatic illness, shift work), substance abuse\/dependence, high results in HADS-M scale (score above 11). The participants were scored with HADS-M, Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST) at the beginning of the study. The Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), Hyperarousal Scale, Leeds Sleep Questionnaire (LSEQ) were applied at the beginning, at the end and three months after the end of the study. The participants were also examined by 7 days actigraphic records before and after treatment. During the course of the treatment patients completed a Sleep Diary (SD). The CBT program employed was based on the Perlis protocol. Standard individual sessions of 50 minutes were provided on a weekly basis for 8-10 weeks by a board certified CBT therapist. After 3 months a follow-up session was scheduled. The significant improvement as related to the CBT treatment was present in the measures of sleep onset latency (67.2 vs. 23.4 min.; p&lt;0.000), numbers of awakenings during night (2 vs. 0.4; p&lt;0.000) and sleep efficiency (77.3 vs. 91%; p&lt;0.000) - data from SD, quality of falling asleep (3.2 vs. 6; p&lt;0.000), quality of sleep (3.3 vs. 5.8; p&lt;0.000) and quality of morning awakening (3.2 vs. 6; p&lt;0.000) - data from LSEQ. The improvement reached the significance level in the measure of psychophysiological arousal (52.3 vs. 42.4; p&lt;0.000) and AIS (15.7vs. 6.8; p&lt;0.000). No significant differences were identified between actigraphic records (light\/dark ratio) before and after CBT. FIRST scores allocating patients to high and low stress vulnerability groups were non-contributory to the observed treatment efficacy. CBT is an effective treatment in primary insomnia. No relationship between CBT efficacy and predisposition to insomnia as determined by higher vulnerability to stress was identified. ","1921":"Mood disorders are common in people with epilepsy (PWE) with prevalence rates ranging from 11% to 62%. The variation in epidemiological data results probably from the diversity of methodologies employed and selection of the populations across the studies. Moreover, the symptomathology of mood disorders in epilepsy is often atypical, intermittent and pleomorphic and fails to meet DSM-IV-TR categories. Several studies suggested the existence of distinct interictal dysphoric disorder (IDD) in patients with epilepsy. The majority of research studies in mood disorders in epilepsy were based on screening instruments in the diagnosis of mood disorders in PWE. However, the results in validity and reliability in detecting major depression in epilepsy using self-report inventories of mood symptoms is vague. The aim of this study was to review studies on mood disorders in epilepsy with particular focus on diagnostic methods. The focus of this Review was on patient studies on mood disorders in epilepsy (2000-2012). We searched PubMed using the following search terms (effective date: 20th May 2012): (epilepsy (Title\/Abstract) OR seizure (Title\/Abstract)) AND depression (Title\/Abstract) OR Dysthymia OR mania OR bipolar disorder OR affective disorder OR Interictal Dysphoric Disorder OR AND (humans (MeSH Terms) AND English (lang) AND (2000\/01\/01(PDAT): 2012\/04\/31(PDAT)). Depression is the most frequent comorbid psychiatric disorder in epilepsy. Recent studies pointed out that bipolar disorders are not rare in epilepsy. Most of the research in PWE did not rely on standardized psychiatric measures and only about 18% of studies were based on diagnostic psychiatric interviews (mainly MINI and SCID-I). Mood disorders in epilepsy excluding the ictal or periictal symptoms can be categorized using standardized measures. Common self-report depression measures may be used to screen for depression in clinical settings. The use of screening instruments in epilepsy must be followed by structured psychiatric interviews designed to establish a DSM-IV-TR diagnoses. Standardized psychiatric interview procedures based on DSM criteria like SCID-I or MINI provide a comprehensive way to diagnose mood disorders in patients with epilepsy. ","1922":"Impulsivity is the neurophysiologically based inability to confirm behaviour to its context or consequences. Overimpulsiveness characterizes many mental disorders and poses an important clinical dilemma. Although the relationship between mood disorders and impulsivity has been well studied the relationship between anxiety and impulsivity is controversial and not well explored. Some studies hypothesise that patients with the diagnosis of panic disorders are characterised by higher levels of impulsivity as a trait as compared to healthy individuals. The aim of this study was to assess cognitive correlates in panic disorder as related to impulsivity measures. Within the preliminary studies four patients diagnosed with panic disorder (DSM-IV-TR) were studied. The severity measure was the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale. The experimental group comprised of psychotropic drug naive patients. Impulsiveness was evaluated with the Barrat Impulsiveness Scale - 11th version (BIS-11). To asses cognitive functions we used CANTAB (Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery). BIS-11 scores observed in the group of psychotropic drug naive patients with panic disorder were higher than the adjusted average for the population and correlated with the number of mistakes in CANTAB (Spatial Working Memory Test); rs=0.949; p=0.0513. The preliminary findings indicate a correlation between impulsivity and cognitive deficits in panic disorder in psychotropic drug naive patients. ","1923":"The American Psychiatric Association is considering listing the 'Psychosis Risk Syndrome' as a diagnosis in its own right in the DSM-5. This decision recognises the paradigm shift in clinical psychiatry to a model of early intervention. However, this decision has aroused much discussion. The controversy which has arisen around this proposal reflects the difficulties in implementing the early intervention paradigm. Here we review the different opinions which have been expressed regarding this issue and consider whether this is the appropriate time to include 'Psychosis Risk Syndrome' as an independently listed psychiatric diagnosis.","1924":"We compare the reported side effects of medication from the trials of prodromal psychosis treatment. We note that the side effects of antipsychotics are those described in the usual pharmacology of these substances and that the severity of side effects are dependent on dosage, with more side effects at higher doses. We report on the search for alternative compounds for the treatment of prodromal psychosis. Omega fatty acids and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy are certainly good adjuvant treatments for suspected prodromal psychosis. With further evidence they may be considered appropriate to use as monotherapy, particularly in the early prodrome. Treatment of prodromal psychosis continues to present a number of risks; therefore the decision to treat ultimately must depend on the symptoms presented by the individual.","1925":"Disorders of the bipolar spectrum (including sub-threshold forms) are very common, more so than is normally considered: these pathologies are often underestimated, not diagnosed or badly treated.

Here, the efficacy of different neuromodulation techniques in alcohol addiction, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is critically evaluated. A broad literature search on electronic databases such as NCBI PubMed, the Web of Knowledge, the Cochrane Library was conducted. Additionally, we searched recent handbooks on neuromodulation and\/or addiction. Studies investigating these neuromodulation techniques in alcohol addiction remain to date rather limited and especially tDCS and rTMS applications have been investigated. Overall, the clinical effects seem modest. The use of VNS and ECT has yet to be investigated in alcohol dependent patients. Neuromodulation techniques have only recently been subject to investigation in alcohol addiction and methodological differences between the few studies restrict clear-cut conclusions. Nevertheless, the scarce results encourage further investigation in alcohol addiction. ","1928":"Comparative study at two years between adults and adolescents aimed at identifying the social, family, personality traits and health locus of control factors influencing physical and mental health, consumption of medications, and frequency of medical consultations. Twenty participants (10 adults and 10 adolescents) were included in a two years long longitudinal study. At baseline, participants' age, gender, family composition, net income, chronic treatments, family dynamics (Family Adaptation and Cohesion Scale), Multidimensional Health Locus of Control, and personality (NEO Personality Inventory) were recorded. Every six months their state of mental and physical health (12 Survey Factors and Hamilton Depression Scale), consumption of medications and number of medical consultations were reassessed. Age has a deleterious effect not only on physical health (r=-0.628*) but also on the frequency of depressive symptoms (r=0.576*). Adults are protected against the above effect by the number of people living in the same household (r=-0.588*). The ideal family or couple is more important than the actual family or couple. The higher these ideals, the healthier the adults (r=0.738*), and the less teenagers go to the doctors (r=-0.648*). Among adults, independence from others is correlated with good mental health (r=-0.829**) and among teens, ability to manage their wishes is positively correlated with good mental health (r=0.718**). Although different mechanisms determine adolescents and adults' levels of health, other common mechanisms involved include age and the need for love. The older we grow, the more our health tends to deteriorate; the more we dream of love, the more it improves. The differences depend on the place that is left to others. Among teenagers, the first factor pertains to how well they manage their own desires; among adults, what matters most is independence from others. ","1929":"This short Paper presents Clare College Cambridge, its history and its Medical and other Traditions to the participants in this symposium.","1930":"Recent research has shown a clear association between schizophrenia and violent behaviour, which cannot be completely explained by co-morbid substance abuse or personality disorders. This increased risk for delinquent behaviour becomes apparent in acts of severe violent crime. Individuals who frequent the penal system often have a history of acute and chronic mental illness, as well as significant rates of co-morbidity; this includes alcohol and drug abuse, lack of motivation in therapy, poor insight regarding their illness, high rates of therapeutic non-compliance, as well as frequent, mostly short-term, contact with general psychiatry prior to forensic institutionalisation.      Forensic psychiatric research has developed assessment and treatment tools which are also of great practical importance to general psychiatry.","1931":"Recovery-concepts have travelled from margin movements into mainstream psychiatry rapidly in recent years. Recovery advocacy has been joined by recovery research resulting in new information on the long-term perspectives of people experiencing severe mental health problems. Emerging data on recovery outcomes as well as processes bring on a paradigm shift from prognostic scepticism and focus on maintenance therapies towards an optimistic outlook and recovery-oriented interventions and services. The emerging evidence-base for recovery-orientation essentially includes the urgent call for a partnership approach allowing the full involvement of users and their families and friends and the exploit of their expertise. Patient self-determination, individual choice of flexible support and opportunities, intervenetions to promote empowerment and hope also in the long-term, as well as assistance in situations of calculated risk are new indicators of quality of services.      The dynamic complexities of recovery and resilience have the ability to capture the progress in biological, psychological, social and political advances in the direction of modern integrated and subject-oriented psychiatry. Cooperative and coordinated efforts together with consumers, carers, their spokespersons and public health advocates offer formidable chances to reduce stigma, discrimination and social exclusion, currently seriously limiting clinical and other efforts towards recovery.","1932":"This article outlines two examples of cognitive-behavior group therapy approaches for an integrative treatment of psychosis: the Integrated Psychological Therapy (IPT) and the Integrated Neurocognitive Therapy (INT). We present their theoretical background, content and conceptualization as well as recent empirical evidence for their efficacy. The article concludes that adapting these approaches to early intervention for people with high risk of psychosis seems promising.","1933":"Schizophrenia is one of the most important diseases in psychiatry. The diagnostic criteria, first formulated more than 100 years ago, have since undergone multiple changes. While the disease was originally named \"dementia praecox\" by Emil Kraepelin, the term \"schizophrenia\" was coined by Eugen Bleuler soon afterwards. DSM-III changed diagnostic criteria dramatically in 1980, relying especially on Kurt Schneider's first rank criteria. These changes were also incorporated into ICD-10. Diagnosis of schizophrenia thus became much more reliable. Yet there remain many problems to be solved: the demarcation towards other psychotic disorders remains arbitrary; the diagnosis is based on multiple, quite different symptoms, enabling two patients being diagnosed with schizophrenia without sharing a single symptom, yet further important symptoms (e.g. cognitive impairments) are not even covered by present diagnostic criteria; until now it was not possible to formulate diagnostic criteria reflecting underlying biological processes or to find a reliable biological marker. These methodological uncertainties are in stark contrast to the persistence of the stigma which accompanies schizophrenia despite all efforts. For the forthcoming publication of DSM-5 and ICD-11 further revisions of diagnostic criteria of schizophrenia are to be expected.","1934":"","1935":"","1936":"Population of online consumers increases rapidly, but the decision-making styles of online consumers and psychiatric denominators such as the personality correlates remain unclear. In 196 traditional, and 196 age-, education- and gender-matched online consumers, we have tested the Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire (ZKPQ) and the Consumer Style Inventory (CSI). After exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, we have defined a five-factor model CSI with 24 items. Online consumers scored lower on ZKPQ Neuroticism-Anxiety and higher on Aggression-Hostility than traditional ones did, and scored higher on CSI Novelty-fashion consciousness and Brand consciousness, and lower on Time consciousness than the traditional consumers did. ZKPQ Neuroticism-Anxiety was positively correlated with CSI Confused by overchoice in both groups, Sociability was positively correlated with Novelty-fashion consciousness and negatively with Time consciousness in traditional group, and Impulsive Sensation Seeking was positively correlated with Novelty-fashion consciousness and Time consciousness in online group. Our study suggests that, regarding the decision-making styles, online consumers display curiosity that lacks security and need other ways to improve their social lives. It also calls further designs to address the contributions of other psychiatric features to the particular decision-making styles in online consumers. ","1937":"Our aim was to evaluate domestic violence among nurses in eastern Turkey. Ninety six (96) female nurses with an intimate partner were enrolled. Modified form of Abuse Assessment Screen Questionnaire was used. Twenty two (22.7%) of the participants reported domestic violence. None of them took legal steps. Most frequent domestic violence type was economic abuse (46%). Nurses, whose mothers were exposed to domestic violence, had significantly higher abuse rates. The abused group had also significantly higher smoking and miscarriage rates. Nurses need to be well informed for taking legal steps in case of domestic violence. Family history, smoking status and abortion rates may be further research focus for risk factors of domestic violence. Legal interventions should be optimized in order to encourage the victims to take legal steps. ","1938":"Clinical research has provided conflicting evidence regarding sexual dysfunction in patients with OCD and PD. This study was undertaken to assess and compare certain parameters of sexual functioning in OCD and PD patients. The study population consisted of 80 patients between 20 and 60 years of age with a diagnosis of OCD or PD who were followed and treated at the anxiety outpatient unit of Bakirkoy Research and Training Hospital for Psychiatric and Neurological Disorders between 2005 and 2006. The total study population comprised of 40 patients with OCD, 40 patients with PD, and 40 healthy volunteers as the control group. Of the two questionnaires used for study purposes, the first provided information on demographic data and certain parameters of sexual functioning, while the second was the validated Turkish translation of the Golombok-Rust Sexual Satisfaction Inventory with transliteral equivalence. Male subjects with OCD had a lower age of first masturbation and first nocturnal ejaculation. Infrequency problem among female and male patients with OCD occurred in 63.6% and 57.1%, respectively. Corresponding figures for PD patients were 36% and 38%. Thus, infrequency problem was more frequent among OCD patients. Sexual avoidance was found in 60.6% of female OCD patients and in 64% of female PD patients. Anorgasmia was detected in 24.2% of the female subjects with OCD. Sexual dysfunction unrelated to pharmacotherapy has been found to occur in OCD and PD. Assessment of sexual functioning in these individuals before treatment may help prevent deterioration of sexual function that may occur upon introduction of psychotropic medications. ","1939":"The theoretical concept of existential\/life positions describes person's basic beliefs about oneself and others. Most of authors on TA postulated that every person has one of four possible basic life positions: I'm OK, you're OK; I'm not OK, you're OK; I'm OK, you're not OK and I'm not OK, you're not OK. The aim of this study was the authentication of Existential positions as theoretical concepts in Transaction Analysis, and it's potential to discriminate clinical from non-clinical examinees, and paranoid from depressive examinees within the clinical population. The research conducted was co-relational. The sample belongs to the convenience sample type, and comprised 200 examinees, 100 from the non-clinical and 100 from the clinical population of adults. The results of the research confirm a statistically significant difference between the non-clinical and clinical part of the sample in the examined theoretical concept. The \"I am not OK\" existential position is more expressed in the clinical part of the sample. The differences between the examinees with depressive and paranoid disorders indicate that the examinees with the depressive disorder are more likely to express the \"I am not OK, you are OK\" and \"I am not OK, you are not OK\" Existential position. In general, we can infer that the assumptions which the research was aimed at testing received partial validation. Examinees from the clinical part of the sample have a statistically significantly higher score at the position \"I am not OK\". Examinees with depressive characteristics have a more pronounced \"I am not OK, you are not OK\" position. ","1940":null,"1941":"Quality of life assessments are increasingly present in health research. Chronic and progressive illness of a family member unavoidably affects quality of life of a family as a whole. The goals of this study were to gain insight into the family burden of chronic disorders, especially possible differences in family quality of life (FQOL) in families that have members suffering from either schizophrenia or Crohn's disease, and families in which none of the members have chronic somatic or mental illness, as well as to pilot an instrument for this purpose. The sample consisted of 53 families with a member suffering from schizophrenia, 50 families with a member suffering from Crohn's disease, and 45 families with no identifiable chronic illnesses. An informant from each family underwent a structured face to face interview, using a questionnaire specially adapted from Family Quality of Life Survey, an instrument widely used to assess FQOL in families with members with disabilities, and which addresses nine areas of family life. In the domain of health, both groups of families with chronic illnesses believe they have significantly different conditions when compared to members of the Control group. In the Crohn's disease group, families had a great deal more of challenges in accessing healthcare services; and see themselves at a disadvantage when compared to both other groups in the domain of finances. Control group offered lowest rating in the domain of support from others. Overall measures of FQOL show significant variation among the three groups, Crohn's disease group offering lowest ratings, followed by families of mental health service users. Overall, FQOL seems to be lower in families that have members diagnosed with Crohn's disease than in families with members suffering from schizophrenia. Illness-specific studies are required, as well as instruments with stronger psychometric properties and studies of determinants of FQOL. Qualitative approach should be emphasised when studying FQOL related to chronic illnesses. ","1942":"Psychiatric care providers should be trained to use current changes in the somatoform disorders criteria. New diagnostic criteria for Somatic Symptom disorders in the proposed DSM-V is discussed and compared with its older counterpart in DSM-IV. A new category called Somatic Syndrome Disorders is suggested. It includes new subcategories such as \"Complex Somatic Symptom Disorder\" (CSSD) and \"Simple Somatic Symptom Disorder\" (SSSD). Some of the subcategories of DSM-IV derived disorders are included in CSSD. While there are some changes in diagnostic criteria, there are concerns and limitations about the new classification needed to be more discussed before implementation. Functional somatic disturbance, the counterpart of converion disorder in DSM-IV, can be highly dependet on the developmental level of children. However, the role of developmental level needs to be considered.","1943":"Depression is a common mental disorder with various symptoms and often accompanied with unexplained painful physical symptoms. Patients, especially in primary care, often present only with somatic symptoms and depressed mood is overlooked. On the other hand, psychiatrists don't pay enough attention to somatic or painful symptoms in patients with depression. The connection between depression and accompanying painful physical symptoms is not completely understood although some common neurobiological pathways are proposed. To achieve good clinical outcome all depression symptoms should be recognized and treated. In this review we focus on painful physical symptoms which could not be explained by somatic illness or the intensity can not be explained by physical disease and are attributed to somatic symptoms of depression. The aim of this review is to provide the basic necessary information for clinicians\/psychiatrists on depression with painful physical symptoms, presenting the terminology, epidemiology, differential diagnostics, neurobiological background, psycho-social aspects and treatment strategies.","1944":"","1945":"Following the initiative and after preparation that lasted about a year, a national association of experts dealing with psychiatry has been formed in our country named Psychiatric Association of Bosnia-Herzegovina (PABH). On March 17th 2008 PABH was formally started with its work that would be since 2009 been actively promoted and profiling as one of the best organized professional associations in B-H. Recognition on the international level and the active role of the PABH were substantially achieved in 2010 in the World (WPA), and from 2011 in European (EPA) Psychiatric Association. The Third Congress of Psychiatrists of B-H with International participation is the first in a series of future Congresses organized by PABH. This retrospective review describes the development and significance of the PABH both nationally and internationally through the documentation and archives of the PABH. The PABH is included in major psychiatric events in the country (active participation in the organization, logistics and scientific programme) and experts from our country are involved in an increasing number of international professional bodies. The PABH is the leading psychiatric association B-H, an active member of the largest and most important international organizations, with a continuous increase of the number of members who recognize the importance, relevance and quality of the PABH and further progress in its development and tendencies to harmonize psychiatric practice in the country and internationally. ","1946":"To present medically assisted treatment for opiate addiction with substitution medicament Suboxone and prevention of social exclusion of young opiate addicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Until recently there was no solution for long-term and comprehensive treatment of young persons who suffer from opiate addiction. This is not an illness that impairs only psychological and physical health of addicts with possible fatal aftermaths, but serious societal problem due to its consequences such as delinquency, crimes and violence that lead young people to social exclusion. There are no capacities within the existing health facilities for long-term stationary treatment, which is necessary for drug addiction. In addition, far less adequate solution is placement of young addicts into penal and correctional institutions, which are stigmatizing and contribute to their exclusion from normal social life.  Hence, the latest medically assisted method of substitution treatment with a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone (Suboxone) is introduced. This medicament, with its characteristics, offers possibility for outpatient treatment, and prompt and effective results of detoxification and weaning of opiates is to be achieved. Opiate addicts that undergo this treatment benefit from \"clear mind\" and capability for occupational and social activities, which significantly improves the quality of their family and social relations. With Suboxone substitution method, the institutional (inpatient) treatment is to be avoided and social exclusion of young addicts treated with Suboxone prevented. Medically assisted treatment for opiate addiction with Suboxone is conducted in outpatient setting with the involvement of close relatives who are not addicted. It brings back \"clear mind\" to previous addicts, does not stigmatize but contribute to re-socialization and prevention of social exclusion of young opiate addicts. ","1947":"Chronology of important historical events in Bosnia and Herzegovina during past two centuries indirectly influenced the incidence and prevalence of different psychoactive substances use and thus the organization of services for the treatment of persons who develop addiction symptoms. The organization of health system in the last war, 1992-1995, suffered enormous damage and the reform process which inevitably followed, included the area of mental health care services and the establishment of network of centers for mental health in the community (CMHC). The centers are functioning within the primary health care almost in whole country, with specialized centers for the prevention and treatment of addicts and the therapeutic communities, which today represents the basic organizational units to help people who have drug related issues. In this paper we will present the possibility of treatment of drug addicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina, from consulting services, psycho-education and early detection of disease, detoxification and substitution programs with Methadone and Suboxone, as well as programs of rehabilitation and resocialization. Although a very complicated political and administrative structure of the country, insufficient financial support, pronounced stigmatization of addicts, insufficient staffing and number of treatment centers are objective obstacles for progress in treatment of addicts, we believe that, with existing resources, these constraints can be converted into new opportunities in terms of improvement of treatment options in the future.","1948":"Psychosis in childhood and adolescence are defines as having delusions or hallucinations, with the hallucinations occurring in the absence of insight into their pathological nature. A broader definition includes symptoms such as disorganised speech and grossly disorganised or catatonic behavior. Negative symptoms such as alogia, amotivation and anhedonia can be present. Cognitive and mood symptoms may also be present. There are relatively few epidemiological studies on child and adolescent onset psychosis. It is generally held that the incidence of psychosis, and especially of schizophrenia, increases markedly during the teenage years, with a preponderance of male over female patients. This is a descriptive review of child and adolescents with psychotic symptoms. It aims to describe their clinical profile, associated risk factors and management strategies utilised. While psychotic disorders are considered rare in children and adolescents, they may severely affect development and long-term functioning. Early identification and intervention are critical to improving outcome. This review suggests that a considerable number of adolescents presenting with psychosis required lengthy periods of inpatient care. There is often diagnostic uncertainty in the first episode of child and adolescent-onset psychosis. Key diagnostic issues relate to distinguishing schizophrenia from bipolar disorder in psychotic adolescents. The differential diagnosis may include psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition, or a substance-induced psychotic disorder. ","1949":"At present time, it may seem that the available therapeutic possibilities and methods have resulted in lower prevalence, and even disappearance, of certain psychopathological entities. The advancement of therapeutic methods has made possible to tackle new issues that are emerging in developmental psychopathology. These issues are directly related to the specifics of the current social sphere, reflecting the turbulent social changes as consequences of globalization and economic instability in the world. Humanitarian crises are ever more often accompanied by increased prevalence of mental disorders and psychological distress of the population in general. Based on child psychiatrists' reports from all corners of the globe, it is evident that the features of developmental psychopathology are constantly changing. The research studies refer to social events and phenomena that in previous decades were not to be found at the fore of clinical entities distribution. Thus, there are research reports on personality disorders in developmental age. Some thirty years ago, opinions were still divided on whether or not there existed personality disorders in developmental age. Nowadays, however, it is an accepted fact among experts that these disorders in youth warrant attention. This prevailing view has instigated research in this domain and now projects are carried out in many countries, so it is safe to say that the research has become global. Furthermore, the researchers' pay much attention to the problem of suicide both in youth and in children. Some special areas of research are being identified, such as the suicide risk assessment in adolescents undergoing short term antidepressant therapy. Latest data show that researchers are more often engaged in parent education, teaching them behaviours they need to raise a child with hyperactivity syndrome. Also, research results on the quality of emotional relationship with adoptive parents have been published with increasing frequency, especially by American authors. The results show that social services are detecting more and more cases of abuse of adopted children. Psychosomatic illnesses and liaison therapy at paediatric wards also feature prominently in current psychopathology. They are followed by issues of mental health of populations in humanitarian crises, including war, hard physical labour and abuse of child labour. The presentation includes a brief overview of psychopathology from the local perspective, with latest examples from clinical practice. The presentation concludes with the constatation that peculiarities of child and adolescent psychopathology follow the dynamic corresponding to the global social changes and increasing economic problems.","1950":"The previous neuropsychological studies have pointed to a significant understanding of the neurobiological correlates of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder with deficits in the functions of the intellect. To establish the existence of intellectual changes in war veterans with developed PTSD and their relationship to PTSD. War veterans are divided into two groups: Group A, war veterans with PTSD and \"B\" groups, veterans without PTSD. Were used: Wechsler's Adult Intelligence Scale (WB-F2); Trauma Questionnaire (UT-PTSD); Questionnaire-socio-biographical data The severity of stress and severity of post-traumatic stress disorder is directly associated with the intellectual functions. War veterans, who had more severe traumatic experience, with a strong and destructive PTSD compared to veterans without PTSD had significantly lower ratio of general, verbal and non-verbal intelligence quotient of mental efficiency, a high level of mental deterioration with significantly pronounced oscillations in intratest and insidetest variability. Veterans with PTSD showed significantly lower scores in the immediate memory capacity, efficient attention, concentration under conditions of mental activity, visual perceptual skills predicted exactly bit of trivial things, of associative elasticity of thinking and short-term learning abilities. These results suggest that deficits in the intellect, are not primarily the result of low intelligence, of premorbid states, but it occurs under the devastating impact of PTSD, which influencing changes in certain centers in the brain and changes in intellectual functioning. ","1951":"Although the description of the PTSD clinical picture dates from history, our professional community has known for about two decades. PTSD is clearly defined in the 10th International Classification of Diseases, World Health Organization and IV Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Together with panic disorder, agoraphobia, specific and social phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder is one of the large groups of anxiety disorders. A superficial approach, we could conclude that in the relation with PTSD is all clear. It was also found that PTSD is often associated with depression, anxiety disorders, and excessive drinking, substance abuse, and personality disorder, dissociative and other disorders.  It is true that our knowledge of PTSD from year to year is larger and larger. However, regarding PTSD, there are many uncertainties, doubts and controversies. Is PTSD a disorder, illness, rent or a passing phase in the development of various diseases? In recent years, there are many studies that are trying to illuminate different aspects of PTSD. Numerous clinical, neurobiological, psycho physiological and MR volumetric studies indicate many uncertainties related to PTSD. About psychotic PTSD is more frequently discussed and written. Whether PTSD is or its symptoms or complications during periods of decompensation may have the character of the psychosis and the psychosis within PTSD or a co-morbid diagnosis? It is certain that about PTSD there are many uncertainties and doubts, that the investigation should continue and that PTSD is a paradigm for new psychiatry.","1952":"The concept of dissociation was developed in the late 19th century by Pierre Janet for conditions of \"double consciousness\" in hypnosis, hysteria, spirit possession and mediumship. He defined dissociation as a deficit in the capacity of integration of two or more different \"systems of ideas and functions that constitute personality\", and suggested that it can be related to a genetic component, to severe illness and fatigue, and particularly to experiencing adverse, potentially traumatizing events. By the late 20th century, various and often contradictory concepts of dissociation were suggested, which were either insufficient or exceedingly including when compared to the original idea. Currently, dissociation is used to describe a wide range of normal and abnormal phenomena as a process in which behaviour, thoughts and emotions can become separated one from another. A complete presentation of mechanisms involved in dissociation is still unknown. Scientific research on basic processes of dissociation is derived mainly from studies of hypnosis and post-traumatic stress disorder. Given the controversies in modern concepts of dissociation, some researchers and theorists suggest return to the original understanding of dissociation as a basic premise for the further development of the concept of dissociation.","1953":"Polarization of biological and psychosocial aspects of psychiatry determines the artificial division of the \"biological\" psychiatrists and psychiatrists \"psychotherapists\". This division resulted from a certain dose of mystification of the psychotherapeutic work of those practicing, and fear of psychological determinism of the functioning, of those who are looking for answers in the biological substrate. The gap of polarization is now described as a form of Cartesian dualism, the division of the mind and the brain. The integration of psychotherapy in psychiatry is the trend in psychiatric specialization, virtually erasing this dualism. This paper describes novelties related to psychotherapy training, as defined by the Section of Psychiatry within the European Union of Medical Specialities and the Psychiatry Residency Review Committee in the U.S.that provided guidelines for the psychotherapeutic competences of future psychiatrists. We are also describing the situation in Serbia, where there was a formal specialization in psychotherapy at the Medical Faculty in Belgrade, for over thirty years, and education in psychodynamics of adults, at the Mental Health Institute, from 1978 to 2007. In addition, there are a number of other schools of psychotherapy, providing training for psychiatrists. This framework allows the authors, based on their experience and previous research, to present their views concerning the future of training in psychodynamic psychotherapy in psychiatric education.","1954":"The same as with many other psychoanalytic constructs, it took a long time to theoretically conceptualize \"insight\". Throughout decades, psychoanalysts and psychotherapists of various techniques, observed and detail discussed transcripts of sessions so to get an insight into what leads to a change in structure of patients during psychotherapeutic treatment. In this article, authors attempted to integrate all developmental achievements on insight in psychoanalytic literature and further on. It is apparent that there are numerous models which contribute to a change in structure of a patient. Additionally, an outline of few situations was given, as a part of therapeutic process which contributes to insight. The aim of this article is to give readers insight into how there is more than one process which leads to insight; it is a complex work and various methods can be used, by using conscious and unconscious ways to help patient achieve liberation from difficulties for which they seek help.","1955":"Today, psychological processes and brain is no longer looked at as something less scientific in comparison with physical processes, so mental diseases will become equal as physical diseases very soon. Until recently, brain functioning could be observed only in patients with cerebral lesions, after surgery, and on animals, but it is possible today to observe it directly with modern imaging techniques. The aim of this presentation is to point out that optimal health and functioning, which are basic assumptions of both neuroscience and psychotherapy is related to increased level of integrity and neural networks growth. Therefore, neurological development can be seen as development determined by experience. More neural networks will be developed during critical periods then, ultimately, will be used. Environment in which child lives and develops determines which networks are going to live through, and those that were not stimulated are susceptible for neural extinction (pruning). Quality of parental relationship has basic impact on brain development. Mother's capacity to regulate newborn's affects is directly linked to future child's capacity to regulate his\/her own affects. Positive experiences from an early childhood, together with positive genetic heritage, ensure proper brain development. First years in human life are also a period of most turbulent brain development, and those early experiences have disproportionally large impact on human brain development. Brain growth and differentiation are not only determined genetically but also with constant interactions with environment. This epigenetic brain information doesn't end in an early childhood. There is a lifelong redistribution of cortical networks, depending on individual experience, including creation of de-novo generation of neurons in adult hippocampus, as recently proved, and neuroplasticity is precondition for any persisted behavioral change, behavior, cognition and emotion. ","1956":"More than half a century ago, Delay and colleagues have discovered, quite accidentally, that antihistamine (chlorpromazine) relieves psychotic symptoms. This discovery prompted further investigation through a series of performed experiments aimed to elucidate the antipsychotic mechanism of action. Initial results have shown that antipsychotic drugs in experimental animals lead to \"neuroleptic effect\" (indifference). However, not until the end of 1960s, it becomes clear that all previously known antipsychotics block dopamine receptors, particularly postsynaptic D2 receptors. The next three decades marked the development and application of these so-called classic neuroleptics in the treatment of psychotic patients. During the nineteen nineties, as a result of ongoing efforts to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the scope of side effects, novel antipsychotics were synthesized (second generation antipsychotics--SGA). As a result the notion of serotonin-dopamine antagonist (SDA) was formulated. According to one of the hypothesis, \"new\", so called atypical antipsychotic drugs strongly block the serotonin (5-HT2), and weakly block the dopamine (D2) receptors. Yet, there is still a debate as to the molecular basis of atypicality, whether it is in dopaminergic and serotonergic antagonism of neurotransmission or it lays exclusively in the modulation of dopaminergic system and dissociation rate at the level of D2 receptors in specific brain regions. Although the synthesis and use of antipsychotics in clinical practice have radically changed not only the basic approach to the patient, but also the quality of life of millions of people, the question remains whether this is just \"old wine in new glasses\".","1957":"It is known that suicidal behaviour has multiple causes. If triggers could be mainly attributed to environmental factors, predisposition could be associated with early stressors on one side such as childhood adversities and genetic predisposition. No convincing animal model of suicide has been produced to date. The study of endophenotypes has been proposed as a good strategy to overcome the methodological difficulties. However, research in suicidal behaviours using endophenotypes entrails important methodological problems. Further, serotoninergic system was studied in patients with suicidal behaviour primary due to its involvement of serotonin in impulsive-aggressive behaviour, which has been shown to be a major risk factor in suicidal behaviour. Not only on the level of neurotransmitters but also the regulation of neurotropic factors could be impaired in suicide victims. Multiple lines of evidence including studies of levels of BDNF in blood cells and plasma of suicidal patients, postmortem brain studies in suicidal subjects with or without depression, and genetic association studies linking BDNF to suicide suggest that suicidal behaviour may be associated with a decrease in BDNF functioning. It seems that especially specific gene variants regulating the serotoninergic system and other neuronal systems involved in stress response are associated with suicidal behaviour. Most genetic studies on suicidal behaviour have considered a small set of functional polymorphisms relevant mostly to monoaminergic neurotransmission. However, genes and epigenetic mechanisms involved in regulation of other factors such as BDNF seem to be even more relevant for further research.","1958":"Psychiatric disorders (PDs) in neurology are more frequent then it verified in routine exam, not only in the less developed but also in large and very developed neurological departments. Furthermore, psychiatric symptoms (PSs) in neurological disorders (NDs) among primary health care physicians and other specialties are often neglected. Anxiety and depression are most common, but hallucinations, delusions, obsessive-compulsive disorder and delirium or confusional state are also frequent comorbidity in many neurological conditions such as stroke, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson disease (PD). Depression and NDs also have a bidirectional relationship, as not only are patients, for example with stroke at greater risk of developing depression, but patients with depression have a two-fold greater risk of developing a stroke, even after controlling for other risk factors.  Dementia or cognitive impairment are part of clinical picture of PD, stroke patients, patients with MS, Huntington disease etc. The prototype of dementia in PD and other NDs is a dysexecutive syndrome with impaired attention, executive functions and secondarily impaired memory. So-called \"functional\" (or psychogenic or hysterical\/conversion) symptoms are relatively infrequent in \"neurological\" conditions, but very often unrecognized and not properly treated.  Treatment of PSs in neurology, basically are not different then treatment of these symptoms in psychiatry and should be include pharmacotherapy and psychiatry. This presentation gives an overview of frequency and type of PSs underlying necessity to recognize these disorders in every day routine exam and properly treatment.","1959":"The last 50 years of researches of biochemism and the CNS functionality are intensively engaged in studying the role of monoamine neurotramsmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamin) (5-HT). The serotonergic receptors function depends on spot where the receptor function, the dynamic relationship with other transmitters and stimulation that can activate or inhibit specific neurons. The results of research in biochemistry, neurophysiology and neuroradiology have provided insight into the complexity of the operation of key structures such as the amygdala, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, whose role varies depending on the received external impulses and the impulses that are sent to relevant areas. This implies that the transmitters and especially 5-HT, have much wider effects that are determined not to structures but by the impulse dynamics. It also means that psychopharmaceutical drugs whose therapeutic effect is based on the change of the concentration of serotonin in the synapse and the postsynaptic receptors depending on where they operate, have an effect on affective or cognitive symptoms. Serotonergic antidepressants by changing the concentration of serotonin change primarily affective manifestations but also they have significant influence on all the spectrum of serotonergic disorders not only emotional, but also the cognitive level, which is also a confirmation that the therapeutic effects do not depend only on the simple change of serotonin concentration but also of the level where these changes occur in dynamic comparison of key transmitters. Atypical antipsychotics which have low affinity for dopaminergic and high affinity for serotonergic receptors are seen through the dynamic relationship of serotonin, dopamine and noradrenalin in nigrostriatal, mezocortical, mezolimbic and tuberoinfudibular pathways.","1960":"Epidemiological studies indicate that only 20% of patients with Bipolar Affective Disorder are diagnosed on time while in 35% of patients diagnosis is 10 years late. Unipolar depression represents the most frequent misdiagnosis. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of BAD in subjects diagnosed with Major Depressive Episode with or without co-morbid disorders. The study was a part of a large international, multi-center, non-interventional study that was conducted in 14 countries between May and November 2008. Sample in Bosnia and Herzegovina included 200 adult subjects with MDE according to the DSM IV diagnostic criteria who consented to take part in the study, who did not exhibit symptoms of acute somatic condition at the time, and who were capable of filling the HCL-32 checklist. The following assessment instruments were used: CRF (Case Report Form) that includes general psychiatric assessment, GAF (Global Assessment of Functioning) and HCL-32 (Hypomania Symptom Checklist). Bipolar Affective Disorder was diagnosed in 67.84% of the study subjects, and MDE in 32.16%. At least one co-morbid psychiatric disorder was present in 77.78% of subjects with BAD and in 22.22% of subjects with MDE. Anxiety disorders co-morbidity was present in 61.9% of subjects with BAD and in 38.10% of subjects with MDE. Our results confirm previous research about underdiagnosing of BAD. This has unforeseen consequences on the course and prognosis of the disorder significantly affecting quality of life of the patients. ","1961":"Early intervention for psychosis services have been a very important area of development in Community Mental Health in recent years. Here we attempt to describe the general principles on which early intervention services are based, the interventions which such services carry out, and the expected outcomes according to the latest literature. While there is consensus that at 3 years after the first episode, outcomes from an ad hoc Early Intervention Team are better than treatment as usual in a Community Mental Health Team. It has been found in most studies, that if patients are treated in an Early Intervention Team for three years, and then transferred back to a Community Mental Health Team, the improvement in outcomes is lost. The reasons for this are described. The Implications for services are that, if outcomes are to be optimised in the treatment of schizophrenia, then assertive treatment in the community needs to be given for as long as possible.","1962":"Acute and transient psychotic disorders (ATPD) first appeared in ICD-10 but classification of acute psychosis has a long historical tradition. The prevalence rate of these disorders varies from 3.9 to 9.6 per 100,000 populations. Systematic clinical information that would provide definitive guidance on the classification of acute psychotic disorders is not yet available. Moreover there is no evidence available to guide the treatment of these disorders. In absence of the reliable epidemiological information the ATPD is treated as a form of 'mini schizophrenia' as if the disorder is an attenuated form of schizophrenia. A systematic review of the literature on acute and transient psychosis was conducted and all studies on epidemiology and treatment of acute and transient psychosis were identified. The existing evidence suggested that ATPD has little relationship with schizophrenia. ATPD is diagnostically unstable over time. Various estimates suggest that about 1\/3 of patients with baseline ATPD retained their diagnosis over 3-12 years, the most frequent re-diagnosis being bipolar disorder and not schizophrenia. There are important differences in the epidemiology of this disorder from schizophrenia. These include gender distribution (ATPD has preponderance of females while equal gender distribution is one of the most established finding in epidemiology of schizophrenia) and much better premorbid level of functioning and social interactions. Other distinguishing features include the age at onset (onset throughout adult life, but usually between the 30- 50 years), development, and duration of symptoms (ATPD have an acute or even abrupt onset and the onset is only rarely precipitated by acute severe stress) and usually a favourable outcome, in spite of the fact that they are frequently recurrent. Literature on the subject is scanty and has serious methodological limitations. Treating ATPD has serious long term implications for the care of those suffering from ATPD. Long term treatments with antipsychotics which can induce metabolic disorders and reduce life expectancy, amongst many other side effects mean that we have to reconsider our approach to the diagnosis of ATPD seriously. Treating the acute and transient psychosis as a mini schizophrenia is seriously hindering research and clinical practice. I will review the epidemiology and phenomenology of acute and transient psychotic disorder, the current gaps in knowledge and its effects on our clinical practice in the light of systematic review of the evidence.","1963":"An increasing amount of empirical studies demonstrates that anomalies of self-experience (self-disorders) are characteristic of schizophrenia and related spectrum conditions, indicating that self-disorders (SDs) are likely to constitute important vulnerability phenotypes. On a clinical level, SDs are non-psychotic alterations of subjective experience that include disturbances of self-awareness (e.g., fading first-person perspective, waning sense of basic identity, depersonalization and hyperreflectivity), autopsychic disorders (e.g., thought pressure or block, perceptualization of mental stream and spatialization of thoughts), loss of common sense (e.g., perplexity), and existential alterations (e.g., solipsistic grandiosity). Such experiences, define essential aspects of the clinical expressions of schizophrenia lending psychopathological coherence to its spectrum manifestations. Furthermore the experiential nature of SDs makes them amenable to the patient's introspection which can be elicited in the dialogical context of the psychiatric interview with important implication for the therapeutic relation. The aim of this presentation is to illustrate the phenomenological core of these experiential anomalies, emphasizing their topicality for the exploration of vulnerability to schizophrenia spectrum conditions and their coherence with the overall clinical picture.","1964":"Society's treatment of psychiatric patients was always a reflection of social development and social awareness, as well as of ethical principles dominating a certain time period in that society. Over the last two and a half millennia, during which principles of Hippocratic ethics applied, attitudes towards psychiatric patients, from an ethical and practical standpoint, were and still are controversial to say the least. During this period thousands of people with mental disorders were abused, tortured, or killed, all of this in accordance to the existing ethical and legislative norms (Malleus Maleficarum, eugenic laws of totalitarian regimes...). In the last forty years many international organizations and associations brought forth a number of resolutions and declarations warning of the position and of the rights of psychiatric patients and giving instructions on the humane, that is to say ethical, treatment of this category of patients. In almost all the western countries laws are passed to protect the rights of people with mental disorders. Thanks to this and maybe even more to the development of psychiatry as a medical and scientific profession, the position of those with mental disorders is improving. However, at the same time over the last 40 years we are witnesses to the destruction of the classic moral principles and the establishment of certain \"new\" ethics which put psychiatric patients at a disadvantage, only in a more subtle way then before. This is why it is important to reexamine many of the ethical questions in psychiatry in the context of present ethical controversy.","1965":"Advocacy for Recovery has been joined by research offering new perspectives on mental health policy, treatment, rehabilitation and anti-discrimination efforts. Chances and challenges of a Recovery model for the mental health field will be presented and discussed. Recovery is currently widely endorsed as a guiding principle of mental health policy. New rules for services, e.g. user involvement and person-centred care, as well as new tools for clinical collaborations, e.g. shared decision making and psychiatric advance directives, are being complemented by new proposals regarding more ethically consistent anti-discrimination and involuntary treatment legislation as well as participatory approaches to evidence-based medicine and policy. Recovery advocacy has been joined by research on recovery and resilience resulting in new data on the long-term perspectives of people experiencing common as well as severe mental health problems. Definitions of remission and recovery as well as the concept of chronicity are under debate. Research questions regarding recovery as a process as well as an outcome warrant scientific efforts enabling the integration of different perspectives as well as different methodologies. Consequences and challenges of the Recovery model need to be tackled from different perspectives by clinicians, researchers, policy makers and - essentially - users and carers and their representatives in order to be fully explored and brought to life. ","1966":"The gap between unmet need and access to care for mental ill-health is wider for adolescents and young people aged 12-25 years than any other age group worldwide. This age group is the peak time of onset for many mental disorders including mood, substance abuse and psychotic disorders. Effective interventions in primary or specialist care are likely to be most cost-effective at this age. Yet in most countries there are few opportunities for young people and their families to gain access to treatment and care for mental ill-health and preventive interventions. This is especially important for young people exposed to trauma and adversity. Few countries give sufficient attention to safeguarding and improving the mental health of young people and few have developed policies and programs to support this.  Policy and practice changes suitable for each country have two essential starting points: improved understanding of youth mental health within communities; and involving young people and their families in decisions that affect them. Using information technology to assist care is another desirable feature of modern service development suitable for any environment.  New directions and models of care to respond to better awareness and help-seeking and new approaches to health promotion are being developed in several countries, and psychiatrists have a central role in supporting these developments.","1967":"War atrocities, natural disasters, community violence, physical abuse and catastrophic illnesses are many faces of trauma and are endemic and the children are the most vulnerable victims. Since 1994, this author has visited war zones and disaster areas 80 times in 18 different countries and has collected data on children's reactions across cultures. Most children around the world show similar responses to the exposure to traumatic experience. Sleep disturbance, nightmares, flashbacks and re-enactment of traumatic events are common. Most children recover from these symptoms in couple of weeks depending on the resiliency and vulnerability factors that they may or may not possess. This author also studied resiliency in children across cultures. In this presentation, the author will present the current understanding of PTSD including the role of amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in symptom formation. Drawing from the lessons learned during his work with children around the world, the author will discuss the role of resiliency in recovery from trauma.","1968":"Environments seen as the physical, chemical, and biological conditions to which organisms are subjected, define the ways we obtain various resources, their quantity and their quality. In interplay with our organisms, environments determine how 'fit' we are. An aspect of that fitness is the quality of mental functioning. Although there is a traditional view that there is something like an 'objective environment' and an 'effective environment', a part of the objective environment that actually affects the organism, the dividing line between the two is rather obscure. Environment in general cannot be defined without taking into account the behaviour of the organism, and it is especially challenging to define what environment means to humans, given the enormous variation and scope of human behaviours; what it is that we require and tolerate. Simultaneously, that physical environment is the broader context of what we usually term 'social environment'. This paper outlines the conceptual problems in determining and evaluating the relationship between environmental conditions and more proximal determinants of mental health, at the same time reviewing the assumptions of some of the well-known examples of that relationship.","1969":"The question of identity of psychiatry as a medical profession as well as of the future of psychiatry has been the subject of much controversial discussion. An overview of available literature on crisis and challenges in contemporary psychiatry as well as on future of psychiatry. In this paper we present our transdisciplinary multiperspective view on psychiatry based on the seven perspective explanatory approaches, on the art and practice of the learning organization as well as on the method of multiple working hypotheses. Conflict between our current knowledge and various concepts and schools in psychiatry will probably bring with itself a new scientific paradigm with new diagnostic phenotypes and refining the old ones. Psychiatry has the historical opportunity to shape the future of mental health care, medicine, and society. ","1970":"Religious method of treatment dominated treatments of psychiatric patients until the start of twentieth century. After psychiatry was recognized as a distinct medical discipline, in nineteenth century, it begun to shift away from religious approach to the treatment of mentally ill persons.  During the twentieth century, it was enriched using psychotherapy, socio-therapy and biological methods of treatment, and completely secularized. The renaissance of religion and religious influence on secular events in the beginning of 21th century and postsecular atmosphere has launched a process of desecularization of psychiatry. It can best be seen through the changes in attitude towards spiritual and religious in the process of patients' evaluation, quality of life assessment, respect for the spiritual needs of patients in the process of clinical treatment, and objective consideration of the phenomenon of religiosity by psychiatrists and other mental health professionals. Without the ambition to precisely explain and define this notion, the basic sketch of what a postsecular psychiatry is and what it is not will be outlined in this paper. The goal is to open a professional debate over the issue, which would contribute that psychiatry, despite the ongoing challenges and provocations, maintains its essence as a medical discipline and adequately respond to all the needs of its patients, including those related to spirituality and religion. Overcoming rigid secular framework, psychiatry becomes more human and more close to human. In this way, psychiatry does not lose its \"scientific component\" because the effects of spirituality, beliefs or religious practices on mental health can be scientifically investigated without crossing the boundaries between the natural and spiritual sciences. Although people often consider that science and religion contradict each other, these are by their very nature convergently moving towards the meeting point even if it is located at infinity.","1971":"","1972":"The Early intervention program for the first episodes of psychotic disorders (RIPEPP) at the Psychiatric Hospital \"Sveti Ivan\" in Zagreb encompasses patients hospitalized due to various psychoses (acute psychotic disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective and delusional disorder, bipolar affective disorder with psychotic symptoms) in the \"critical period\" of illness, i.e. within five years after the occurrence of the first symptoms. The RIPEPP Program consists of an in- and out-patient part, and includes psychotherapeutic and psychoeducative components as well as the administration of antipsychotics. The Psychotherapeutic part, conducted by psychotherapists - group analysts, comprises psychodynamic group psychotherapy for patients and for family members. The Psychoeducative part, led by cognitive-behavioral therapists, is carried out through educative interactive workshops for both patients and their family members. The paper describes the theoretical framework, as well as the professional, personnel, educative and organizational basis of the Program, the principles of evaluation and some experiences after five years of implementation.","1973":"The objective of this retrospective records review was to evaluate the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and Framingham cardiovascular risk scores in adult inpatients taking antipsychotics. Hospital records of 62 patients (27 women and 35 men) taking antipsychotics were retrospectively reviewed for: body height and weight, waist circumference, cigarette smoking, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides (TGA), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), blood pressure, concomitant use of antidiabetic, antihypertensive and antihyperlipidemic medications. MetS was diagnosed in 29.0% (ATPIII), 35.5% (ATPIII A) and 41.9% (IDF) of patients. The prevalence of MetS components was: central obesity 50.0% (ATPIII and ATPIII A), 75.8% (IDF); hypertension 40.3% (ATPIII, ATPIII A and IDF); reduced HDL cholesterol 51.6% (ATPIII, ATPIII A and IDF); raised TGA 38.7% (ATPIII and ATPIII A), 41.9% (IDF); raised FPG 11.3% (ATPIII), 24.2% (ATPIII A) and 24.2% (IDF). Most of cardiovascular risk scores were higher in subjects with MetS. Mean BMI (28.4 kg\/m2) and waist circumference (97.8 cm) were above cut-points for overweight and IDF-defined abdominal obesity. Mean total cholesterol (203.2 mg\/dL) and TGA (159.1 mg\/dL) levels were above upper limit of normal ranges. Overweight or obesity and abdominal obesity (more frequent in women: 88.9% vs. 65.7%; P=0.035) were found in 69.4% and 75.8% of the patients, respectively. Over 60% of subjects with hyperlipidemia (77.4% of the whole group) had no hypolipidemic therapy on discharge. The prevalence of MetS in subjects taking antipsychotics exceeds the prevalence in general population. Its presence increases the risk of cardiovascular events. Increased body weight and metabolic abnormalities were frequent in our group of patients (particularly in women) taking antipsychotics. Most patients with hyperlipidemia had no antihyperlipidemic introduced. ","1974":"People suffering from schizophrenia have a significantly shorter lifespan compared to the general population. The majority of deaths are caused by physical diseases, including cardiovascular events. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to predict the risk of premature cardiovascular mortality and assess the prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors in a sample of Czech patients with schizophrenia and related psychoses. We reviewed data from 129 subjects treated in an outpatient clinic that specialised in psychoses. The main collected variables included basic physical parameters (height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure), smoking habits, laboratory data (glucose level, serum lipid level) and an electrocardiograph (ECG). We calculated the ten-year risk of fatal cardiovascular events using the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) chart. The most prevalent risk factors were being overweight (70% of patients had a BMI over 25), dyslipidaemia (70% of patients) and smoking (43% of patients). According to the SCORE diagram, there was a high risk of fatal cardiovascular events over a ten-year period in 10% of the study group. The percentage was even higher (24%) when the latest European guidelines for cardiovascular disease prevention were used to calculate the risk. Our outcomes indicate even higher cardiometabolic morbidity rates in patients with psychoses than those referenced in the literature. ","1975":"Post-traumatic growth (PTG) refers to the process of attributing meaning to traumatic events and positive changes in life after facing trauma. A number of studies have already demonstrated that demographic- and coping-approaches related variables predict PTG, yet little is known about whether PTG may be predicted by family processes such as flexibility, cohesion, communication and satisfaction. The main purpose of the study therefore was to determine whether family-related factors predict PTG above and beyond demographic variables and coping related processes. The study included 190 women, breast-cancer patients, aged 31 to 83 years. Their educational level was representative of the educational level in the population of this age range. The Participants were members of the Oncology Patients Society. Post traumatic growth index, FACES-IV - family relationships scale, coping response inventory, demographic, and illness-related questionnaires were administered after informed consent was obtained. The PTG index was used as an outcome measure. Congruent with previous findings, analyses yielded weak correlations between demographic- and illness-related variables, and PTG. Also congruent with previous findings, approach related coping strategies were found to predict PTG, R squared =0.16, p&lt;0.001. In addition to previous findings, family related factors predicted unique proportion of variance on PTG, p&lt;0.05, with communication having positive and satisfaction negative load on PTG. Results showed that family related factors predicted PTG above and beyond coping-related strategies and demographics. Communication, however, seems to mediate the association between satisfaction and PTG. Theoretical concerns and practical implications are discussed. ","1976":"Hopelessness is a strong predictor of suicide which is closely associated with PTSD in war veterans. Previous studies showed that if religious faith in war veterans was weakened it contributed to more extensive current use of mental health services. War trauma experience can weaken religious faith as well as strengthen it. It partly depends on religious coping which can be positive or negative. In our work we present correlation between hopelessness (measured with Beck Hopelessness Scale) and style of religious coping (positive or negative, measured with R-COPE) in 111 Croatian war veterans with PTSD and 39 healthy volunteers. Veterans with PTSD were more hopeless than healthy volunteers, and had greater usage of negative religious coping. In PTSD group, less hopeless veterans showed greater extent in use of positive religious coping strategies. These findings suggest that experts treating male combat veterans with PTSD should inquire about religious coping of the individual. Positive religious coping should be encouraged while negative religious coping should be addressed appropriately. ","1977":"Empathy is a powerful and necessary skill for understanding another person's subjective experience. In this study we wanted to explore psychiatrists' attitudes towards PTSD, general empathy, possible differences related to age, sex and regional location in Croatia. 205 psychiatrists from different Croatian regions participated in this study. To define psychiatrists' attitudes towards PTSD patients a questionnaire was devised. It contained 14 items related to psychiatrists' ability to live through emotional and social conditions of PTSD patients. BarOn Emotional Quotient-Inventory Empathy Subscale was used to measure the empathy among the subjects. This study has found statistically significant differences regarding gender in measured variables of the designed questionnaire. Male participants believed they were able to understand war veterans' feeling's and relate to traumatic experience while female participants stated that they had the ability to understand the trivial triggers for suicidal intentions. Regional differences were found in the understanding of war traumatic experience and social deviations occurring in PTSD. Older psychiatrists stated their incomprehension of the social difficulties the PTSD patients were facing. The years of experience in the psychiatric field were associated with inability to understand the patients' feelings'. Differences in empathy among the subjects were not found. The understanding of the empathic process in the therapeutic approach towards PTSD explored in this study was associated with basic variables such as gender and age but the construct of empathy itself is more complex and related with variables not assessed in this study, so our findings are preliminary and further research is needed.

The present brief review will give an overview of molecular genetic research in PTSD yielding support for specific vulnerability genes. Additionally, evidence for gene-environment (GxE) interactions between susceptibility genes of PTSD and traumatic experiences will be reported. Recent studies suggest a pivotal role of epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation in mediating the impact of trauma in the pathogenesis of PTSD. Future approaches to further unravel the genetic underpinnings of PTSD might comprise genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the investigation of the genetic influence on intermediate phenotypes of PTSD (e.g., imaging genetics) as well as pharmaco- and psychotherapy-genetic studies. Genetic research in PTSD will be discussed with respect to its potential benefit regarding innovative and individually tailored therapeutic approaches in PTSD.","1983":"A number of studies have shown that although exposure to potentially traumatic events is common, development of PTSD is relatively rare, which is one of the reasons PTSD still remains a controversial psychiatric entity. The aim of this article was to provide an overview of the research on the role of personality traits in the vulnerability, resilience, posttraumatic growth and expressions associated with PTSD. Personality based approach represents a dimensional aspect of the transdisciplinary integrative model of PTSD. We conducted a systematic search on PubMed, PsycINFO, and Academic Search Complete from 1980 (the year PTSD was first included in the DSM) and 2012 (the year the literature search was performed). Manual examination of secondary sources such as the reference sections of selected articles and book chapters were also conducted. Most of the reviewed studies dealing with personality traits as vulnerability and protective factors for PTSD examined the relationship between basic personality dimensions and severity of symptoms of PTSD. These studies have applied three types of methodological designs: cross-sectional, post-trauma and pre-trauma longitudinal studies, with latter being the least common option. Finding that appears relatively consistent is that PTSD is positively related to negative emotionality, neuroticism, harm avoidance, novelty-seeking and self-transcendence, as well as to trait hostility\/anger and trait anxiety. On the other hand, PTSD symptoms are negatively associated with extraversion, conscientiousness, self-directedness, the combination of high positive and low negative emotionality, as well as with hardiness and optimism, while posttraumatic growth shows inverse relation to most of these traits. Furthermore, a number of studies have confirmed the existence of three distinct personality-based subtypes of PTSD: internalizing, externalizing and low pathology PTSD. These findings may help in further uncovering etiological mechanisms and in building new strategies for prevention, identification and reduction of health risks among this trauma population, as well as facilitating potential posttraumatic growth. However, focusing on just a single dimensional perspective will unable us to generate comprehensive knowledge of the etiology, course and treatment of PTSD.

We have made an overview of available literature on PTSD to identify explanatory models, hypotheses and theories. In this paper we describe our transdisciplinary multiperspective integrative model of PTSD based on the seven perspective explanatory approach, on the fifth discipline, the art and practice of the learning organization as well as on the method of multiple working hypotheses.Trauma vulnerability, strengths, resilience and posttraumatic growth are key concepts that enable an integration of the distinct perspectives into a coherent transdisciplinary multiperspective explanatory and treatment model of PTSD. PTSD is a complex highly disabling and suffering disorder where the past is always present in people haunted by the dread frozen in memory of the traumatic events. However, PTSD also represents an oportunity for psychological and spiritual growth due to the human ability to adapt and thrive despite experiencing adversity and tough times.

On the other side, PTSD is one of the most controversial diagnosis in psychiatry as well as in medicine in general. We have made an overview of available literature on PTSD to identify what is our real knowledge about PTSD with all dilemmas, controversies and challenges. We have various options as to how to evaluate, explain and describe PTSD and other trauma-related mental and somatic disorders. In this paper we compiled an extensive set of facts and meta-facts in order to to understand the real nature of traumatic stress, negative life events and PTSD.

Also, recent reports had suggested that nicotine from smoke may contribute, at least in some parts, to the apparent neuroprotective effect of tobacco use in Parkinson's disease. In this way, in the present study we were interested to examine the effects of low-dose nicotine administration (5 days, 0.3 mg\/kg\/day) in a rat model of Parkinson's disease, on behavioral parameters from Y-maze or shuttle-box task and also on the oxidative stress markers from the temporal lobe, which is one of the most vulnerable cortical area to oxidative stress effects. The administration of nicotine resulted in significant improvements of short-term memory, as seen in the Y-maze task, as well an increase of conditioned avoidance responses and decreased number of escape failures in the shuttle-box task. Additionally, an increase in the specific activity of glutathione peroxidase and a decrease of the lipid peroxidation processes is reported. Moreover, we found a significant correlation between the behavioral results from the Y-maze and shuttle-box tasks and the levels of oxidative stress markers. Taken together our data suggest that short-term administration of low-dose nicotine facilitates memory processes and improves the oxidative stress status of the brain, after a 6-OHDA induced lesion of the SN.

We aimed to evaluate which antipsychotic or antidepressant drugs psychiatrists would prefer for themselves, their partners and children in case of a mental illness. The study was conducted among psychiatrists in Serbia. The sample consisted of 90 psychiatrists who were asked to complete the questionnaire about their drug selection in hypothetical situations of becoming ill with schizophrenia or depression or these conditions occurring in their partners and children. In case of schizophrenia, risperidone was the first choice made by most psychiatrists for themselves, their partners or children, followed by clozapine, haloperidol and olanzapine. In case of depression, SSRIs and SNRIs were generally favored, with sertraline and escitalopram being the preferred medications for psychiatrists, partners and their children. With regards to depression, 82.3% of participants would opt for an antidepressant as monotherapy or in combination, but 13.3% would opt for anxiolytic monotherapy. The preferred doses were slightly lower than the recommended ones, especially for antipsychotic agents. Most psychiatrists would take or administer atypical antipsychotics or SSRIs as the first choice for themselves, their partners or children. These preferences are mostly in accordance with current treatment guidelines, but there is still room to narrow the gap between guideline recommendations and psychiatrists' medication choices in personally meaningful situations. ","1997":"The educational process brings a considerable amount of stress to medical students that can influence mental health status and contribute to further professional burnout. The authors assessed the academic stress influences, mental health status and burnout syndrome, with the intent to find different patterns in female and male medical students. The applied cross sectional study was in the form of an anonymous questionnaire which included: socio-demographic data, self-reported health status and influence of studying activities on stress level in 755 medical students who attended two final years. Mental health status was explored by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), and Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). Female students assessed their physical health status and general stress level as worse compared to males (p&lt;0.001). Exams were described as a high stressor in about 50% of all examined students. However, this stressor was significantly more frequent in female students (p&lt;0.001). Female students frequently declared high stressful effects of contacts with patients (p=0.009) and autopsy (p&lt;0.001). The scores of the GHQ-12 questionnaire were above the threshold or high in 51.5% of all students, and also significantly higher in females (p=0.001). High scores were found among 52.6% of all examined students on MBI subscale of Depersonalization, and 33.6% on MBI subscale of Emotional exhaustion without gender difference. Measures for prevention of academic distress should be targeted at optimization of the educational process, development of the clinical skills and professionalism, with special concern to female students who manifested high vulnerability. ","1998":"It is argued that the total Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) score likely overestimates depression in pregnant women given the overlap between depressive and somatic symptoms during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to explore the structure and the intensity of depression symptoms during pregnancy and two months postpartum. In populations with high incidence of somatic complaints (i.e. chronic pain sufferers) depression is also often related to higher pain intensity. Therefore, the relationships between depression symptoms and expected, perceived and recalled labor pain were also examined. 60 healthy primiparas enrolled the study. BDI-II as measure of depression was completed during the late stage of pregnancy and two months postpartum. Assessments of maximum and average labor pain were completed in three different time periods (before - expected labor pain, during\/immediately after labor - perceived labor pain, and one month postpartum - recalled labor pain). Depression symptoms measured two months postpartum were significantly lower than the ones measured during the late stage of pregnancy (t=8.377, df=49, p&lt;0.01). During the late stage of pregnancy, BDI-II items with highest mean scores were those measuring somatic symptoms of depression. Depression measured during the late stage of pregnancy correlated significantly with maximum labor pain expectancies (r=0.41, p&lt;0.01). The use of standardized questionnaires with a high rate of somatic items such as BDI-II may not be the best solution when screening for mood disorders in pregnant women. Levels of depression share a significant relationship with maximum labor pain expectancies only. ","1999":"There is evidence that blockade of 5-HT 6 receptors can improve cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenic patients. A number of antagonists of 5-HT6 receptors are in development as cognitive enhancers. One of the agents with relatively strong 5-HT6 activity is dimebon. We tested the hypothesis that this 5-HT6 antagonist administered in the early stage of stabilization after an acute episode can improve both neurocognitive and clinical symptoms in schizophrenia. A phase II study of dimebon as add-on to risperidone therapy was conducted. 56 male subjects with paranoid schizophrenia were included in the study. All the patients demonstrated therapeutic response to risperidone as treatment of the acute psychotic episode. After 4 weeks of stability patients were randomized into two groups with placebo or dimebon add-on treatment in a 1 to 1 ratio for 8 weeks. PANSS, CGI-S, CSDS and NSA-16 were used as clinical measures of symptom severity. Different aspects of memory, psycho-motor coordination and executive functioning were assessed with a battery of cognitive tests. Clinical and cognitive assessment was performed twice: after a patient was randomized and 2 months later. Severity of negative symptoms (by NSA-16) were significantly lower in the dimebon group then in the placebo group (p=0.036). Patients in the dimebon group demonstrated improvement in more cognitive dimensions than patients in the placebo group, including working memory, attention, psycho-motor coordination and planning. Dimebon as add-on therapy to antipsychotic treatment in the period of stabilization after an acute episode can improve some aspects of clinical and cognitive status in schizophrenic patients. ","2000":"It is believed that in Alzheimer's disease (AD) some areas of the brain are particularly vulnerable to specific degenerative processes and that they could exhibit neuronal dysfunction in the earliest stage of the disease. The implications of the hippocampus in memory processes are very well known and it is likely that the hippocampus would be among the first areas of the brain affected by the pathogenic mechanisms occurring in AD. However, the distinction between the neurodegenerative changes that accompany normal ageing and those that characterize AD is not clear. Also, the distribution of the hippocampal cell loss in both normal aging and AD is not very well understood. In this context, we focused on the quantification of the neuronal density in the four specific areas of the hippocampus (CA1-CA4) of AD brains, as compared to an age-matched control group, by using the Nissl staining technique. We found a significant reduction of neuronal density especially in the CA1 and CA3 hippocampal areas. The most prominent decrease was found at the CA1 area level, as compared to all other 3 areas which were analyzed. In the present study we managed to demonstrate and confirm a significant neuronal loss of hippocampus in AD, as compared to an age-matched control group. Moreover, it seems that this decrease of hippocampal neuronal density is more prominent especially at the CA1 and also in the CA3 hippocampal areas. This could have important implications in the design of therapeutic and investigative strategies of AD. However, larger samples are necessary in order to provide the basis for firmer conclusions in this area of research.

The study evaluated the medical professionals' knowledge about homosexuality and their attitudes towards it. The sample consisted of 177 participants (physicians n=79 and students n=98). The study respondents anonymously completed three questionnaires (socio-demographic questionnaire, the questionnaire on knowledge, and the questionnaire on attitudes towards homosexuals). Male and religious participants showed a lower level of knowledge and a greater tendency to stigmatize. Furthermore, the subjects who knew more about homosexuality tended to hold less stigmatizing attitude. Age group, specialty (psychiatry, gynecology, internal medicine and surgery), and student's\/physician's status had no effect on stigmatization. The study showed that the final year students\/ residents had more knowledge than the second year students\/specialists did. Knowledge had significant negative predictive effect on attitudes in the analyzed predictive model. To our knowledge, this has been the first study in Serbia and Eastern Europe, which provides information on knowledge and attitudes of health professionals towards homosexuality. We would like to point out the degree of knowledge on homosexuality as a possible, but not exclusive tool in shaping the attitudes towards homosexuals and reducing stigmatization. However, regardless of the personal attitude, knowledge and variable acceptance of the homosexuals' rights, medical professionals' main task is to resist discriminative behavior and provide professional medical help to both homosexual and heterosexual patients.

The search was restricted to information published in the Hungarian language from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2010. All communications were classified into negative, neutral and positive groups depending on their attitude towards the aforementioned treatment methods. Professional or non-professional categories were also distinguished. The total number of communications, which appeared between 2000 and 2010 and contained one of the search words for ECT was 66. The majority of them portrayed ECT in a negative (24; 36.4%) or neutral (25; 37.9%) fashion. Most of the websites (139; 95.2%) related to ECV were reflected positive (120; 82.2%) and neutral opinions (19; 13.0%). Hungarian-language Internet sites mainly view ECT as negative or neutral in contrast to ECV cardioversion, which has almost entirely a positive reputation. Although the effectiveness of both therapies is equally well established, their public image as manifested on the Internet differs significantly. This may have a major impact on the frequency of their use. ","2013":"There is a need for better understanding and research of the comorbidity structure in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. To assess the prevalence of somatic and psychiatric comorbidity in schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder treated at the University Hospital Centre Zagreb. This retrospective study compares the prevalence of comorbid diagnosis of somatic and psychiatric disorders in 192 patients with schizophrenia and 97 patients with bipolar disorder. The diagnoses were established according to ICD-10 criteria. The data were collected from hospital medical documentation. Patients with bipolar disorder had more both somatic (67.1% vs. 50.6%) and psychiatric (29.9% vs. 10.9%) comorbidity than patients with schizophrenia. The three most prevalent somatic comorbidites in patients with bipolar disorders were cardiovascular (22.6%), endocrinological (22.6%), and gastrointestinal (16.4%) disorders while neurological (11.4%), gastrointestinal (10.9%) and endocrinological (9.3%) disorders were the most frequent in patients with schizophrenia. The exact prevalence and nature of the somatic and psychiatric comorbidity in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is still unclear and further research is needed. ","2014":"It has been reported that high levels of sex hormones improve the efficiency in tasks which are usually better performed by females. In contrast, in tasks which are usually better performed by males, the best efficiency corresponds to low levels of sex hormones. The aim of this study was to examine changes of efficiency in tasks of verbal fluency and mental rotations, as well as changes in masculinity and femininity during the menstrual cycle. Seventeen female subjects with a regular menstrual cycle took part in the study. For assesssments of masculinity and femininity, the subjects filled the Bem's Sex Roles Inventory. Endler's Anxiety Scale was used for determining the autonomic-emotional and cognitive-worry components of anxiety. Subjects performed the verbal fluency task and mental rotations tasks during the menstrual and the early follicular phase, as well as during the pre-ovulation and the midluteal phase. The results showed the best performance in mental rotation tasks which included rotations of three-dimensional objects along x and y axis during the phases of menstrual cycle, which are characterized by a low level of sex hormones. The most pronounced during these phases was also the masculinity. Furthermore, the best performance in verbal fluency task occurred during the menstrual and midluteal phase. Anxiety and femininity did not change across the menstrual cycle. Low levels of sex hormones potentiated the typical male cognitive profile. ","2015":"Psychological stress is known to affect the immune system. The Limbic Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal (LHPA) axis has been identified as the principal path of the bidirectional communication between the immune system and the central nervous system with significant psychological activators. Personality traits acted as moderators of the relationship between life conflicts and psychological distress. This study focuses on the relationship between the Big Five factors of personality and immune regulation as indicated by Lymphocyte counts. Our study included 32 professional soldiers from the Slovenian Army that completed the Big Five questionnaire (Goldberg IPIP-300). We also assessed their white blood cell counts with a detailed lymphocyte analysis using flow cytometry. The correlations between personality variables and immune system parameters were calculated. Furthermore, regression analyses were performed using personality variables as predictors and immune parameters as criteria. The results demonstrated that the model using the Big Five factors as predictors of Lymphocyte counts is significant in predicting the variance in NK and B cell counts. Agreeableness showed the strongest predictive function. The results offer support for the theoretical models that stressed the essential links between personality and immune regulation. Further studies with larger samples examining the Big five factors and immune system parameters are needed. ","2016":null,"2017":"Gender issues are extensively explored in schizophrenia. A mounting body of research evidence suggests that there are gender differences in the age at onset, duration of untreated psychosis and presented psychopathology. In recent years, in order to obtain neurophysiologic explanation for the disturbed behavior and thinking in schizophrenia, numerous studies have been performed focusing on the QEEG parameters. However, the results were inconclusive. The aim of this study was to investigate the gender differences in some clinical and QEEG parameters in schizophrenia patients. Thirty schizophrenia patients were enrolled in the study (M\/F ratio 13\/17; mean age 34 years). The QEEG parameters which were analyzed were amplitude, mean frequency and relative power of the main bands of the basic activity. Clinical assessment was performed using the PANSS, BPRS and CGI scales. QEEG parameters demonstrating statistically significant difference were amplitude and relative power in beta activity and lower mean theta frequency over left frontal, temporal and parietal regions in female patients who also had statistically significant differences in PANSS and BPRS scores. Differences in amplitude and relative power in the beta bands in female schizophrenic patients are associated with more severe actual psychopathology. Considering the relatively small sample, the current results must be replicated with a larger group of drug-free patients to confirm the findings.

Data were collected from the following databases: PubMed, China Biological Medicine Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Cochrane Library and Elsevier Science Direct, with the latest report up to May 2011. An effect size with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to assess the strength of various effects of antipsychotics on P50 ratio in the patients. A total of six studies including 315 and 285 schizophrenia patients at the baseline and endpoint, respectively. Overall, no significant effect of these medicines on the P50 ratio was found (overall effect z=1.03, p=0.30; heterogeneity: Chi2=2.81, df=8, p=0.95, I2=0%). In subgroup analysis by drug, we did not find any significant effects on P50 ratio in either first-generation antipsychotics (effect z=0.92, p=0.36; heterogeneity: Chi2=0.00, df=1, p=0.98, I2=0%) or second-generation antipsychotics (effect z=0.55, p=0.58; heterogeneity: Chi2=2.38, df=5, p=0.79, I2=0%). Our meta-analysis suggests that neither the first-generation nor the second-generation antipsychotics had any significant effects on P50 ratio in Chinese patients with schizophrenia. ","2019":"Mental retardation denotes sub-average intellectual functioning, based on IQ, i.e. the inability of normal learning, accompanied by behavioral and developmental disorders. Persons with impairments (cognitive, motor, sensory or psychiatric) have often been, both through human history and today victims of discrimination and deprived of their basic human rights, both in the public and the private life spheres.     Since the end of the 20th century, throughout the developed world, many disabled persons can accomplish their dreams and rights. However, the issue of sexuality is still an obstacle in realizing oneself as a whole person, of course in accordance with personal psychophysical abilities. The greatest problem is present in persons with severe disablement, considered not apt enough for information on sexuality and for expressing themselves as persons with their own sexual needs. Thus it is desirable to observe each disabled person individually and flexibly enough in order to establish parameters for the functioning of an intimate affair on the level of understanding and assent. The legal system must protect the most vulnerable and ensure for them the right of choice and consent, as well as the possibility of fulfilling their sexual needs, so that they could love and be loved. Naturally, the system must be built on foundations that satisfy the needs of its users, but also of persons engaged in work with them. Sex education should contain information regarding biological, socio-cultural and spiritual dimensions of sexuality, including cognitive, affective and behavioral domains. Unfortunately, very few educational programs with such aims provide sex education, not only for the disabled young population but also for the healthy.     This review article is based on international investigations and Croatian legislative postulates. Its aim is to focus the attention of both professionals and non-professionals on this delicate problem.","2020":"This paper summarizes the concept of subjective well-being, from ancient philosophical reflection to the first psychological, empirical research on the construct of positive psychology. The author examined the different conceptual definitions of subjective well-being throughout history as well as the dominant themes in the philosophical theories, concluded with some contemporary philosophical trends in Western culture of the 20th and 21st century.

There is accumulating evidence that both common genetic variants with small effects and rare genetic lesions with large effects determine risk of SZ. As recently shown, thousands of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), each with small effect, cumulatively could explain about 30% of the underlying genetic risk of SZ. On the other hand, rare and large copy number variants (CNVs) with high but incomplete penetrance, variable in different individual, could explain about additional 30% of SZ cases. Although these rare CNVs frequently develop de novo, it is not clear whether they affect risk independently or via interaction with a polygenic liability in the background. Finally, the role of environmental risk factors has been well established in SZ. Environmental factors are rarely sufficient to cause SZ independently, but act in parallel or in synergy with the underlying genetic liability. Epigenetic misregulation of the genome and direct CNS injury are probably the main mechanism to mediate prenatal environmental effects (e.g., viruses, ethanol, or nutritional deficiency) whereas postnatal risk factors (e.g., stress, urbanicity, cannabis use) may also affect risk via use-based potentiation of vulnerable CNS pathways implicated in SZ. In this review, we outline a general theoretical background of epigenetic mechanisms involved in GxE interactions, and then discuss epigenetic and neurodevelopmental features of SZ based on available information from genetics, epigenetics, epidemiology, neuroscience, and clinical research. We argue that epigenetic model of SZ provides a framework to integrate a variety of diverse empirical data into a powerful etiopathogenetic synthesis. The promising future of this model is the possibility to develop truly specific prevention and treatment strategies for SZ.","2027":"Depressive and cardiological disorders present a major comorbidity. Their manifold interrelations may be best analysed within a biopsychosocial model of disease. A systematic research was done on empirical studies published during the last 15 years and dealing with epidemiological, etiopathogenetic and therapeutic dimensions of the comorbidity of depression, anxiety and heart disease. From an epidemiological perspective recurrent depressions are associated with a significantly increased risk of coronary heart disease. Depressive disorders play a major role in triggering critical cardiac events, e.g. myocardial infarction. The prevalence rates of depressive disorders in various cardiological conditions are significantly higher than the frequencies that can be expected in healthy general population. Depression shows a negative impact on the somatic morbidity and mortality during the further course of illness. Anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorders seem to be interrelated with cardiological conditions in quite a similar way, probably contributing even more negatively to critical and lethal cardiological events than depression. From an etiopathogenetic perspective some clusters of depressive symptoms seem to be linked to cardiotoxicity more closely than other, vital exhaustion, anhedonia, and hopelessness probably mediating a special risk. In any case, postmyocardial infarct depression that proves treatment-resistent indicates a negative prognosis of the prevailing cardiological condition. On a level of psychological and psychosocial constructs type-A personality, anger\/hostility, type-D personality, and alexithymia have been explored regarding its proper pathogenetic role. Psychological and psychopathological variables have to be set into a context of psychosocial stressors on the one hand, and have to be simultaneously analysed with various underlying psycho- and neurobiological variables on the other. Above all, HPA- and sympathicomedullary dysfunctions, reduced heart rate variability, altered functions of thrombocytes, and increased proinflammatory processes have to be recognized as significantly contributing to the pathophysiology both of depression and of heart condition. Neurobiological aspects of anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorders must be interlinked with these underpinnings of depression. Differential effects on critical cardiological events must be supposed. From a therapeutic perspective several RCTs demonstrate that SSRIs may safely and efficiently treat depressive disorders in cardiological conditions, and may even improve the general somatic prognosis. Cognitive-behavioural psychotherapies have been empirically validated in treating depression and anxiety with cardiological patients. So far, however, a differential indication of psychopharmacological versus psychotherapeutic approaches has not been proved yet. Depression and anxiety disorders in patients with heart disease paradigmatically define a psychosomatic-somatopsychic challenge to any health delivery system. A psychosomatic perspective may best be practised within a Consultation-Liaison psychiatric service that cooperates continuously and closely with cardiological departments and experts. ","2028":"Depression is a very common mental disorder which often results in relevant negative consequences ranging from impaired quality of life to an increased suicide rate. Unfortunately, non-psychiatric physicians frequently under-diagnose and under-treat depression. Nevertheless, sometime the diagnosis \"depression\" is used for mentally well and other mental disorders (i.e. sometimes depression is over-diagnosed). Screening tools were suggested to improve the recognition of mental disorders in everyday clinical work. Studies have shown that the criterion validity of usual screening questionnaires such as the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) is sufficient, while very short questionnaires consisting of one or two questions must not be used because of high misclassification rates. A meta-analysis of randomized trials of screening for depression indicate that screening for depression is probably effective when it is coupled with additional activities such as educational programs for primary care physicians.","2029":"Depressions are very common mental diseases. The diagnosis is made by psychopathology criteria and the course of the disorder. There is a growing body to the knowledge about etiology and treatment of depression - neuro-imaging, neuroplasticity, CREB and BDNF are all modified by antidepressants treatment and\/or psychotherapy.  As differential diagnoses, depressive syndromes on the basis of organic diseases but also burn-out syndromes may play a role, different therapeutic efforts are necessary.  The treatment of depression consists of psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic strategies, combinations of both are useful. Many psychopharmacological substances with differing mechanisms of action are available - combinations of antidepressants with complementing mechanisms are possible.

The safety plan is a great tool employed to help patients with suicidal urges, but trainees-clinicians and clinician associates alike - should fully understand that it is not a form of treatment. However, since an effective treatment for suicidality does not exist, practitioners should definitely use suicide safety planning. Although more resources are now being provided to individuals with suicidal behavior, more research needs to be done to develop new, effective methods of treatment and prevention of suicidal behavior.","2032":"Burnout syndrome (BS) and stress-related disorders are frequent among medical specialists, but it has been suggested that some health workers are more prone to the BS than others. This study assessed the intensity of the BS among 3 groups of physicians: psychiatrists, general practitioners and surgeons and examined correlation both between the intensity of BS and physicians` personality dimensions as well as between the level of BS and stress coping strategies. The sample consisted of 160 physicians (70 general practitioners, 50 psychiatrists, 40 surgeons). The assessment was carried out by the Maslach Burnout Inventory, The Temperament and Character Inventory and Manual for the Ways of Coping Questionnaire. Dimension of emotional exhaustion was the most prominent in general practitioners (F=5.546, df1=2, df2=156, p&lt;0.01), while dimension of depersonalization was highest in surgeons (F=15.314, df1=2, df2=156, p&lt;0.01), as well as lack of personal accomplishment (F=16.079, df1=2, df2=156, p&lt;0.01). We found that the Harm Avoidance has lead to development of BS while Self-directedness and Cooperativeness were prominent in physicians with low level of BS. The escape-avoidance was in correlation with high depersonalization and lack of personal accomplishment while self-control was prominent in physicians with lower BS. The BS affects personal well-being and professional performance. It is important to identify individuals with a tendency towards its development, in order to undertake preventive measures such as stress management and improvement of the stress coping strategies.

Second generation antipsychotics (SGA), such as Risperidone, have been found to be more effective in the treatment of such patients than the high potency first generation antipsychotics (FGA). This is an open study where the same group of patients was first treated with FGA and then were switched to Risperidone, in controlled hospital conditions, after a wash- out period. The aim of the study was to examine whether patients with schizophrenia who were judged to be stable on long-term treatment with FGA would further benefit from a switch to an atypical antipsychotic drug. Eighty hospitalized patients suffering from Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective disorder (male 54, female 26) were first treated with Haloperidol (N=60) or Fluphenazine (N=20), and then were switched to Risperidone. Their clinical state was monitored using the PANSS scale for Schizophrenia, measuring the Total PANSS score. The KLAWANS scale for assessment of extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS) was also used. Administration and dosage of Trihexiphenidil (THF) was recorded. The study lasted for 8 weeks, with 4 screenings (Visit 0-baseline- FGA, Visits 1-3 Risperidone on Day 14, 28 and 56, respectively). The average age was 38. Patients usually suffered the paranoid form of Schizophrenia (55%). The duration of illness was more than 5 years (38.8%). During the eight- week trial on Risperidone, using the PANSS total scores, we observed clinical improvement where the therapy switch had caused an initial worsening (p&lt;0.05). Also, the compared baseline (FGA) and last visit showed a low, but statistically significant benefit in favor of Risperidone (t=5.45, df=79, p&lt;0.005). Intensity of EPS measured by KLAWANS scores significantly decreased during time (F=4.115; p=0.016; Partial Eta Square=0.058). Average Trihexiphenidil doses followed Risperidone in a dose dependent manner (r=0.748, r=0.661, respectively, p&lt;0.01) with the consequent decrease of patients needing THF corrective therapy (68.8% at the baseline toward 22.5% on last visit). Switch to Risperidone medication provided significant additional improvement in symptom severity, extrapyramidal side effects and need for anticholinergic medication. This suggests that one might expect better compliance in future treatment in this population of chronic schizophrenic patients.

The aim of this study was to examine the relation between the consumption of different beverage types and suicide rates in Russia. Age-standardized sex- and age-specific suicide rate for the period 1980-2005 and data on beverage-specific alcohol sale were obtained from the Russian State Statistical Committee. Time-series analytical modeling techniques (ARIMA) were used to examine the relationship between the sale of different alcoholic beverages and suicide rates. Vodka consumption as measured by sale was significantly associated with both male and female suicide rate. The consumption of beer and wine were not associated with suicide rate. The estimates of the age specific models for men were positive (except for the 75+ age group) and ranging from 0.069 (60-74 age group) to 0.123 (30-44 age group). The estimates for women were positive for the 15-29 age group (0.08), 30-44 age group (0.096) and 45-59 age group (0.057).

Diagnosis of MDD was set by DSM-IV-TR criteria. The severity of MDD was estimated with HAM-D-17 in the manner that mild episode was diagnosed if the score on HAMD-17 was up to 18, moderately severe 18-25 and severe over 25. Concentration of BDNF was determined by the ELISA method. This research could not find a difference in BDNF concentration considering the severity of the depressive disorder in groups suffering from mild, moderately severe and severe episodes of MDD (F=1.816; p=0.169). Factor analysis of HAMD-17 extracted four dimensions of depressive symptoms. None of the symptomatic dimensions was significantly related to BDNF concentration.

A group of 50 subjects took part in the study. The MMPI-2 test and HDRS were used in the study. The HDRS was performed at the therapy onset and reapplied after 8 weeks of its continuation. The MMPI-2 test was applied at the beginning of treatment. Higher scores in Hs (p=0.007), D (p=0.021) and Hy scales (p=0.001) are associated with the higher degree of depression, measured by the HDRS at the therapy onset. The highest performance in Hs scale (p=0.003) and Hy scale (p=0.001) evaluated on admission, was associated with the highest depression level after pharmacological treatment. The higher the degree of hypochondria and hysteria symptoms, measured by the MMPI-2 test at the onset of therapy in patients with depressive disorders, the higher severity of depression is being found after 8 weeks of therapy with SSRI agents, measured by the HDRS scale.

Our study was conducted in order to identify some cardiovascular risk factors among patients with cognitive decline (MCI or Alzheimer disease-AD) and to find if there is any correlation with the degree of cognitive decline. We evaluated the body mass index, total cholesterol, hypertension, history of smoking, alcohol consumption and diabetes mellitus in patients with MCI and AD, compared with an age-matched control group. Regarding the body mass index, we observed a progressive decrease in patients with MCI and AD, in comparison with the control group. Similar aspects were also observed in the case of cholesterol levels, only that post hoc analysis revealed no significantly statistical differences between MCI and AD groups. The systolic blood pressure was increased in the patients with MCI and AD. Also, as in the case of cholesterol levels, post hoc analysis revealed no significantly statistical differences between MCI and AD groups. Pearson's correlation showed significant connections between the cardiovascular risk factors and the results of the cognitive evaluation.

Different methods used to stain senile plaques (SPs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) might account for this discrepancy. Here, brains of 11 patients with dementia were examined. Cryosections and paraffin sections from 6 different brain regions (frontal medial, temporal medial and occipital gyrus, hippocampus, superior parietal lobe and cerebellum) of all cases were stained with Bielschowsky, Campbell, Gallyas and Congo red stains each. The study shows that the Bielschowsky silver stain is insufficient for detecting SPs and NFTs, whereas two other methods proved to be more accurate. SPs were found in similar frequency in all brain regions examined (exception: cerebellum). The highest amount was shown with Campbell silver stain in paraffin sections. In Congo red only 25 percent of these SPs were stained, which is probably due to a great number of them not containing any amyloid. NFTs were found almost exclusively in the hippocampus. The highest number was detected with Gallyas silver stain in cryosections. These results may suggest that Campbell stain for SPs and Gallyas stain for NFTs should be the methods routinely used.

Twenty healthy subjects are included in a two years long longitudinal study. At baseline, subjects' age, gender, family composition, net income, chronic treatments, family dynamics (FACES III), Health Locus of Control (MHLC), and personality (NEO-FFI) are recorded. The adaptability level that we experience in our current couple appears partially to be an inherited value of the adaptability that we had in our family of origin (r=0.694; p=0.026). Moreover, the closer we are to each other in our nuclear family, the closer and more adaptable is our couple (r=0.893; p=0.007). Cohesion in the nuclear family is correlated with a desire for even more cohesion in the ideal family (r=0.898; p=0.000) and in the ideal couple (r=0.732; p=0.016). The only mechanism that slows down this aspiration for \"always more\" cohesion is the cohesion that the current couple is experiencing. Some of these factors seem to affect health indicators: cohesion of the ideal family and of the family of origin as well as cohesion of the current couple have positive effects on health indicators whereas levels of adaptability of the ideal family and the current couple have negative effects on health indicators. At T0 and T6 months, the level of physical health appears to be the more predictable variable.

By providing deeper insight into fibromyalgia, its presentation, biology and treatment, several questions are addressed, ranging from person-centered diagnosis to personalizing the various processes of the fibromyalgia spectrum complex. By reviewing current treatment options and evaluating treatment pitfalls derived from methodological flaws in current research, the authors discuss various possibilities of personalizing treatment and, therefore, propose how the use of these two paradigms could enhance outcomes in chronic pain management.  If we wish to make comments about enhanced outcomes we need to talk about outcomes of pain treatments, we need to discuss what successful treatment is from the patient's point of view as well as in the reviewed models.","2063":"Oxidative stress is the condition arising from imbalance between toxic reactive oxygen species and antioxidant systems. It is believed that increased oxidative stress may be relevant to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. In this way, the main markers of the lipid peroxidation processes include 4-hydroxynonenal and malondialdehyde. On the other side, the potential toxicity of free radicals is counteracted by a number of cytoprotective antioxidant enzymes that limit the damage, such as superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase.      However, the reports regarding the status of oxidative stress markers schizophrenia are very inconsistent, with various authors stating both increased and decreased activities of the main antioxidant enzymes, while others did not observe any significant modifications, as compared to control groups. Similar aspects were also reported in the case of the lipid peroxidation markers, although in here the contradictions are much more reduced than in the case of the antioxidant defences. It is generally believed that the equivocal results mentioned above may be due to different tissues studies, different species or the administrated treatment and the duration of the disease\/treatment. In this context, in the present paper we were interested to review some studies regarding the oxidative stress status in patients and animal models of schizophrenia, by referring mainly to antioxidant enzymes and lipid peroxidation markers.","2064":"Unlike other medical disciplines, psychiatry abounds in conceptual models. All of them are legitimate as there is no conclusive evidence that either is more proper than others in terms of its capacity to explicate the very nature of mental disorders and make possible more efficacious treatment of those with mental illness. There are two major sources of the existence of numerous models in psychiatry: difficulties in discerning the role played by the biological and the psychological in the genesis and treatment of individual mental disorders, and want of a widely accepted theory of the mind-body relationship. The conceptual divide in psychiatry has numerous negative effects: scarce communication or no communication between the advocates of different approaches; over-rating of the benefits of the concept one clings to; lack of interest in other approaches; confusion of clients when confronted with different explanation of the origin of their troubles and most appropriate treatment; tarnished image of psychiatry. There have been several attempts to correct conceptual cacophony in psychiatry. None of them proved successful.","2065":"Psychiatric risk-assessments generally quantify risk using broad, categorical, indicators (e.g., high-risk, low-risk). We examined reliability of such indicators when applied by mental-health professionals. Four versions of a questionnaire were used, each specifying a different clinical outcome along with a range of different probabilities at which that outcome might occur. Respondents classified each probability, allowing a comparison of the level of likelihood at which different professionals would apply the terms 'high-risk', 'medium-risk' and 'low-risk'. We found little consistency among professionals who assessed risk for the same outcomes. Moreover, there were also large and unpredicted differences in response-profiles between the 4 clinical outcomes. These findings raise concerns about the communication value of current risk-assessment terminology.","2066":"Emerge is an innovative Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service that provides support for 16-17 year olds. The team provide a community based multi-disciplinary, open access model, texting young people and travelling to locations convenient to them. There is an enhanced duty system providing a rapid flexible response within working hours. To examine the referral data as part of the ongoing annual audit cycle and to establish prevalence of alcohol, cigarettes and substance use among young people referred to the service. Data from the case notes was analysed using Statistical Package for Social Science. Demographic details, referrer profession, reason for referral, other services involved and substance use were examined. There were 437 patients referred to Emerge between 1\/4\/2010 and 31\/3\/2011, and 387 patients were accepted while 50 were signposted on. Cases were not accepted if they fell outside the age and geographical area, or were not in need of a mental health service. Overall, 24% of young people were reported to consume alcohol, 19% used cannabis and 9% reported using cigarettes. In all categories there were areas where documentation was not complete, and we suggest that these figures are an underestimate. This data has been fed back to the team, a full morning of teaching regarding drugs and alcohol has been delivered. Emerge often works with young people who are marginalised and may be harder to reach, consequently early sessions require neutral and supportive questions, thus if young people do not return after the first appointment, histories may be incomplete. The team will be reflecting on the lessons learned and considering ways to optimise their work. ","2067":"Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a condition with a prevalence of around 1-2% (3-4% in some studies) with a recognised protocol for its treatment produced by the national institute for health and clinical excellence (NICE). NICE recommends that all patients with OCD are first offered treatment with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) concentrating on exposure and response prevention (ERP) before proceeding to selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Treatment may later be augmented with clomipramine and\/or an antipsychotic. This study focuses on the biological treatment received after, or in parallel to, the psychological. We aimed to collate and evaluate the levels of biological treatment currently received by OCD outpatients in the Bedford East catchment area of SEPT. In particular we wished to establish how many of the patients were receiving an atypical antipsychotic as well as maximal SSRIs. Hence we have attempted to assess the types of treatment received by patients under our care, and the difficulties associated with the treatment of this illness.","2068":"It has recently been suggested that memory and theory of mind may share the characteristic of mentally projecting oneself into another time or place to imagine alternative perspectives. This study examines this possible relationship by investigating individual differences in performance on a reality monitoring task and two mentalising tasks: the faux pas task and the reading the mind in the eyes test. Consistent with recent functional neuroimaging studies that have observed activity during reality monitoring tasks in the same region of prefrontal cortex that was activated in previous mentalising studies, a significant positive correlation in performance was observed between memory for agency and faux-pas recognition. No correlation between memory and performance on the reading the mind in the eyes test was observed. The significance of these findings is discussed with respect to the suggestion that memory and theory of mind rely on a common set of processes.","2069":"The proper label to describe people receiving care has evoked considerable debate and controversy among providers and bio-ethicists. Fashionable terms in current use include \"patient, client, consumer, customer and service user.\" There is little evidence to show that changes in nomenclature actually take patients preferences as to how they would like to be addressed into account This aim of this study is to survey the views of the people with learning disability in inpatient settings to establish the term they prefer. This is the first study of its kind looking at the views of people with learning disability about how they would like to be addressed and to identify factors associated with various preferences. Approval was obtained from the local clinical governance board. The target population covered a tertiary level inpatient service including acute assessment and respite services, forensic (male\/female and low\/medium secure services) and CAMHS LD covering the Coventry, Warwickshire and Birmingham areas (rural and inner city population). Participants were provided with an information sheet on the research project. The questionnaire was administered by means of a joint interview carried out by the authors of the study. Dictionary definitions were analyzed as to the derivation and connotations of various terminologies. A questionnaire was developed which was tailored for use in PWLD after consultation with Speech &amp; Language Therapists and local peer review. Responses were than analyzed to identify factors associated with various preferences. Evidence indicates lack of universality in preferences for terms and suggests the need for dialogue about preferred terms between service providers and recipients. This study shows a preference for the term \"patient\" in all categories that were measured within an LD inpatient setting and very interesting demographic preferences were identified. A more differentiated approach may be suggested by taking professional background and some demographic characteristics into consideration. A positive therapeutic relationship is a fundamental component of psychiatry and should take into account patients' preferences regarding how they are addressed by professionals. ","2070":"Anorexia nervosa is a mental health disorder characterised by deliberate weight loss (through restrictive eating, excessive exercise and\/or purging), disordered body image, and intrusive overvalued fears of gaining weight. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence recommends that family interventions that directly address the eating disorder should be offered to children and adolescents with anorexia nervosa. To perform a literature review to assess whether family therapy is a more effective intervention than other treatments in the management of adolescents with anorexia nervosa. Search of PubMed, The Cochrane Library and NHS Evidence for randomised controlled trials that compared a family intervention with another treatment for anorexia nervosa in adolescence. This literature search revealed only six randomised controlled trials investigating the use of family therapy in the treatment of adolescents with anorexia nervosa, and these all had small sample sizes. Some, but not all, of these trials suggest that family therapy may be advantageous over individual psychotherapy in terms of physical improvement (weight gain and resumption of menstruation) and reduction of cognitive distortions, particularly in younger patients. Due to the small sample sizes and the significant risk of bias (particularly information bias) in some of the studies the evidence in favour of family therapy over individual therapy is weak. In the future, larger randomised controlled trials with long term follow-up are required to assess whether family therapy is the most effective treatment for anorexia nervosa in adolescence. ","2071":"In recent years, there has been particular interest in the use of augmentation. Potential augmentation regimes include the addition of atypical antipsychotics (e.g. risperidone\/olanzapine) or other antidepressants (e.g. mirtazepine). The purpose of this audit was to compare patient outcomes between groups receiving different augmentation strategies. Overall we found that augmentation with mirtazepine resulted in better outcomes in terms of both discharge rates and in terms of reduction in suicidality than augmentation with atypical antipsychotics.","2072":"In recent years, there has been particular interest in the use of augmentation as a strategy for the treatment of refractory depression. The purpose of this audit was to define patient factors among people receiving augmentation therapy with either mirtazepine or atypical antipsychotics. We searched an anonymised database of patients and identified those with receiving augmentation with mirtazepine (group A), atypical antipsychotics (group B) or both (group C). The audit reveals some interesting differences in patient factors between the three groups. Knowledge about such differences is useful in practical terms because it allows doctors in the BCMHT to target therapy for different patients towards their specific needs. However, the audit cannot explain the underlying reasons for these differences.","2073":"Treatment for Bipolar Affective Disorder is at present largely empirical, in the lack of a definitive understanding of the biological basis of the condition. Many theories have been proposed regarding the underlying neurobiology. These have included aetiologies relating to altered neurotrophic factor expression, mitochondrial endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction with related calcium changes, and loss of inhibitory interneurons. Here an attempt is made to integrate such current understanding, in part by considering the changes observed in migraine - a condition which has a number of similarities with bipolar disorder.","2074":"Effective communication between patients, their families, their carers and health care professionals is paramount to the delivery of high quality care. Addressing the ideas, concerns and expectations of these groups may improve their healthcare experience. We propose that opening a new channel of communication between patients, families, carers and healthcare professionals on the wards would improve the delivery of healthcare. We present a novel written communication aid- the Care Communication Aid (CCA), with preliminary data from secondary and tertiary healthcare trials demonstrating its efficacy and shortcomings, and the reaction of both recipients and providers of healthcare to this novel approach.","2075":"Cognitive deficit is a core feature of schizophrenia mostly grasping memory, psychomotor processing, attention, thinking, and executive functioning and is already present in the prodromal phase of the illness and is detected at the onset. Recent studies have been focused on the differentiation of cognitive functioning in relation to the diagnostic categories, which reveal cognitive heterogeneity in schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The study demonstrated that along with changes in the clinical state, specifically, with reduction of psychopathological symptoms, patients with schizoaffective disorders show more positive dynamics with better chances to back up while in schizophrenia the cognitive dysfunction is more defined and less prone to improvement.","2076":"Long term group work with outpatients with psychosis who attended groups in the last ten years was evaluated regarding their physical activity, quality of life and medication treatment. Outpatients with psychosis who attended long term psychotherapeutic groups were evaluated regarding their medication, quality of life and physical activity. A modified, non-structured, psychoanalytic group technique which includes psycho education, cognitive techniques, non-structural conversation and clarifications was used in group therapy. For evaluation purposes Quality of life Bref and a self-designed physical activity questionnaire along with clinical observation and Drug Attitude Inventory was used. Each patient's medication was noted at the time of the study and the dosage was transformed into chlorpromazine equivalents. Several therapeutic group factors are important for improving attitudes towards physical activity, improving quality of life and attitude towards medication. The physical activity questionnaire gave us some preliminary information on our patients' current physical activity. We explore the patients' Quality of life, medication and attitude towards physical activity. The results show that there is a relevant correlation between physical activity, quality of life and medication treatment. Therefore treatment in a team setting and a multidisciplinary approach could lead to the best results in this respect and better physical health of patients with psychosis. ","2077":"The global financial and economic crisis starting in 2007 led to a deterioration of several socio-economic determinants of mental health. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine the impact of the present economic crisis on the depression and anxiety levels of the employed in the private and public sector in Slovenia. Altogether 1592 employees completed an internet based self-reported questionnaire. Data about perceived impact of the economic crisis, several socio-demographic, socioeconomic, and health parameters were collected. Depression symptoms were assessed by the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale and anxiety symptoms by the Spielberger State-Inventory. Regression models were used 1) to explore the associations of the economic crisis with the level of depression and anxiety symptoms while controlling for some sociodemographic and work characteristic variables, and 2) to understand the relationship between some potentially important socioeconomic variables and the perception of the economic crisis. Depressive and anxiety scores were significantly increased among 590 (46.6%) employees being affected by the economic crisis. The level of depressive symptoms was significantly associated with perceived impact by the crisis, recent sick leave, reported injuries sustained at work, benzodiazepine and analgesic use, the lack of emotional support, and trust in crisis telephone lines. The level of anxiety symptoms yielded the robust association with the level of depression symptoms, reported injuries sustained on the way to work and education. The economic crisis poses an additional risk factor for mental health problems which clinicians should internalize and become more aware of them. Symptoms of depression and anxiety can be masked in high-utilizers of medical care with physical complaints or psychoactive drug use. ","2078":"The World Health Organisation predicts that Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) will be the second greatest contributor to the global burden of disease by 2020, however, the neurobiological mechanisms behind the disease and the risk factors for it are yet unknown. NewMood (New Molecules for Mood Disorders) was a research project funded by the EU, collaborating work from 10 European countries with the aim of finding new molecular mechanisms behind MDD to develop more effective treatment options. This review explains the aims and objectives of NewMood and how it intends to achieve them with regards to the current literature. It also outlines two of its most recent projects: genome wide association replication study for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) increasing susceptibility to MDD and stress related pathways in depression using the cortisol awakening response (CAR). Both of these studies had significant results and could further contribute to our current understanding of MDD.","2079":"We assess the effectiveness of return to employment, and hence social inclusion in patients with chronic schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder within a British community mental health team.","2080":"This is a study of the prevalence and impact of co-existing bipolar affective disorder on patients with OCD, and the effect on their management within a community psychiatric team. We found that 16% of patients who visited psychiatric outpatients with a diagnosis of OCD had co-existing bipolar affective disorder. Of these the majority had bipolar affective disorder II (67%). Co-morbidity raised a number of challenges to patient management. Compared to the control group the patients with co-morbid bipolar affective disorder required a greater number of outpatients appointments, had a greater number of hospital admissions, were more likely to have been allocated a care coordinator and to have received psychological input.","2081":"Behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia (BPSD) are common and distressing. Anti psychotic medication has been shown to have modest efficacy but is associated with well documented risks including excess cardiovascular events and increased mortality. The current NICE recommendations are that antipsychotics should only be prescribed to those with severe BPSD after exploring other possible interventions. There should be adequate counselling of the patient\/family, an explicit risk-benefit analysis and regular review. As part of the POMH-UK National Audit on antipsychotic prescribing in dementia we reviewed the notes of 67 patients in the Cambridgeshire area who had a diagnosis of dementia. Of the 67 patients reviewed, only 9 (13.4%) were currently being prescribed antipsychotics for BPSD. Of these patients, all were living in their own homes and were experiencing multiple distressing target symptoms. 5 had been prescribed an antipsychotic for less than 3 months and only 1 had a total duration of treatment of more than 1 year. There was good evidence in all cases that alternative diagnoses and management strategies had been explored before prescribing an antipsychotic. However, in none was the full range of potential causes or interventions explored. In 6 cases a risk\/benefit analysis for use of antipsychotic medicine was recorded and in 5 cases there was documented discussion of this with family or carers. Of the four patients who had been prescribed an antipsychotic for more than 3 months, three had had two or more medication reviews. The fourth patient had had a trial of stopping the medication. Prescribing of other psychotropic medication was also reviewed. Benzodiazepines were used sparingly (7.5%). Of note a significant minority of patients (10.4%) were prescribed 3 or more different psychotropic medications. These results suggest that within this service antipsychotics are being used appropriately to enable patients with distressing and difficult behaviour to continue to remain at home. They were generally prescribed for a short time and reviewed. Areas for improvement include a documented discussion of risk in all cases and ensuring that all possible causes of BPSD have been ruled out. Regular review of efficacy and tolerability is essential for all pharmacological treatments for BPSD particularly for those prescribed multiple psychotropic medications. ","2082":"In patients with a dual dependence on alcohol and tobacco, the spontaneous discourse among doctors is not to encourage them to consider preparing to give up both substances. The argument put forward is that withdrawal would be more difficult. We wanted to compare the intensity of withdrawal symptoms in patients hospitalised for alcohol detoxification between smokers and non-smokers. We compared patients hospitalised for alcohol detoxification who smoke versus non-smokers who received replacement therapy through benzodiazepines and not nicotine replacement. The blood pressure and the cardiac frequency measure on the first day of hospitalisation, the doses of Diazepam dispensed on the first day, and the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Scale Revised (CIWA-Ar) score on the second day were compared. A trend emerged whereby smoking patients undergoing alcohol detoxification showed higher blood pressure, higher cardiac frequency and required higher doses of benzodiazepines on the first day of hospitalisation. Patients who smoke also had higher CIWA-Ar scores on the second day of hospitalisation. From a physiological point of view, the intensity of the symptoms of alcoholic withdrawal seems to be greater in hospitalised patients who smoke vs. non-smokers in the first two days. Does giving up both substances at the same time result in fewer withdrawal symptoms? And in this case, should a double replacement be recommended: benzodiazepines and nicotine replacement therapy? To be able to refine the recommendations on alcohol-tobacco dual withdrawal programmes, other studies are needed to compare giving up both substances with or without nicotine replacement. ","2083":null,"2084":"The aim of this article is to better understand the role of the liaison psychiatrist regarding the pulmonary pre-transplantation assessment for a patient treated by methadone. At the beginning, we collected data concerning the different habits of patients requiring pulmonary transplantation. Through a literature review, we studied the possible guidelines related to this subject, the effects of methadone, the side-effects explaining the psychiatrist's concerns. Finally, this problem is involved in the bio-psycho-social model to underline the influence of methadone on post-operative prognosis. In our database, only 4.3% of patients were treated by methadone. However, this addiction is one of the most important stressors for psychiatrists and involves a great deal of multidisciplinary staff time. There are absolutely no guidelines on this topic. Due to the action of methadone, the pulmonary, cardiac, urologic, drug and immune side effects are more understandable. Thanks to clinical labels, we are able to handle this dual problem. Different parameters are considered such as patient's history, drug addiction, deterioration of physical condition, possible surgery and its consequences, choice of treatment to better estimate the post-operative prognosis. Until now, there is nor indication or contra-indication regarding the duration of treatment by methadone for patients requiring pulmonary transplantation. The main advantage is the patient's stabilization by minimizing possible relapses. This advantage is to compare the following major inconvenience: increased confusional risk, delicate management of the post-operative pain, negative impact on the immunity. The support, a double psychoeducation and the patient's decision making are to be encouraged. ","2085":null,"2086":"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can develop following exposure to a stressful event of an exceptionally threatening or catastrophic nature. Symptoms experienced by PTSD suffers can include re-experiencing the trauma through intrusive 'flashbacks' and recurrent dreams or nightmares, avoidance of stimuli associated with the stressor, hyperarousal, emotional blunting and an inability to remember aspects of the period of exposure to the stressor. We performed an audit of the treatment of PTSD in patients under the care of the Bedford East Mental Health Team to examine the psychological and pharmacological treatments currently being used and compared these with data collected in 2008. In summary, in the last 2 years there has been an increase in the identification of PTSD patients in Bedford East. These patients are a group with high levels of comorbidities and risk factors, and are challenging to treat. As a result of this, a wide range of agents including antidepressants with augementation, mood stabilizers and antipsychotic agents are used in their treatment, many of which are outside of NICE guidelines. There appears to be less availability of psychological therapy in these patients than we would expect. We discuss reasons for this and suggest possible solutions.","2087":"To review current practice at the John Connolly Wing ECT clinic and to explore compliance with NICE ECT guidance. Standards used included the ECT TA59 guidelines of 2003 with the updated depression guidance CG90 of 2009. To recommend a programme of action to the Trust which would ensure that clinical practice and service delivery within the Trust complies with NICE guidance. A retrospective baseline Trust wide audit was conducted between the period of January 2010 to July 2010 inclusive. Cases were identified using ECT clinic record then computer Rio notes explored for evidence of compliance with NICE guidelines as set out in the audit standards. All data was extracted from the case notes on the Rio system. An audit tool was completed for each case. The data recorded on the audit tool was explored and entered onto an Excel spreadsheet for analysis. A total of 14 patients were identified. Of these, 6 were male and 8 were female. They comprised of 8 inpatients and 6 outpatients. The majority of patients had a diagnosis a severe depressive episode. 13 patients received bilateral ECT. In 1 case the first 3 sessions were unilateral and the rest were bilateral due to patient choice. 9 patients consented to ECT; 5 lacked capacity to consent and 1 of those was treated under Section 62 of the Mental Health Act. The number of treatments ranged from 0-15 with an average number of 7. This included 1 patient who did not receive ECT at all due to concerns raised by anaesthetist once at the ECT clinic. Reasons for stopping ECT included a response being achieved in 5 patients; anaesthetic risk in 3; withdrawal of consent in 2; T6 no longer valid in 1; no reason documented in 3 patients. Compliance with NICE guidelines was particularly good regarding the indications for ECT. An adequate trial of treatment was evidenced prior to consideration of ECT. Documentation of the exploration of the risk to benefit ratio both amongst the team and with the patient was poor. Assessment of the patient after each ECT and on-going cognitive assessment was poor. This audit highlights the need for sound documentation of our practice. It also stresses the need for further clarity regarding the roles and responsibilities of the RMO and their team and the ECT team. An ECT Care Pathway document has been produced to improve compliance with NICE guidance and improve documentation of practice. This document has been introduced for use in the Trust. We plan to re-audit for improvement in compliance. ","2088":"The purpose of this project is to optimize early detection and early intervention in psychosis, in adolescents and young adults. The goal is to reduce DUP (Duration of Untreated Psychosis) through the integrated work of trans-disciplinary teams and youth-friendly (health and social) services. This should lead to a reduction of stigma and an improved accessibility to appropriate care. The aim we wish to achieve is a reduction of the incidence and prevalence of psychosis in the area covered by the Department of Mental Health of Trieste.","2089":"It has been estimated that the heritable component of bipolar disorder ranges between 80 and 90%. However, even genome-wide association studies explain only a fraction of phenotypic variability not resolving the problem of \"lost heritability\". Although direct evidence for epigenetic dysfunction in bipolar disorder is still limited, methodological technologies in epigenomic profiling have advanced, offering even single cell analysing and resolving the problem of cell heterogeneity in epigenetics research. Gene overlapping with other mental disorders represents another problem in identifying potential susceptibility genes in bipolar disorder. Better understanding of the interplay between multiple environmental and genetic factors involved in the patogenesis of bipolar disorder could provide relevant information for treatment of patients with this complex disorder. Future studies on the role of these factors in psychopathological conditions, subphenotypes and endophenotypes may greatly benefit by using more precise clinical data and a combined approach with multiple research tools incorporated into a single study.","2090":"The target of this work is to consider if depressive symptoms intercurrent with patients suffering from Anorexia Nervosa (AN) and Bulimia Nervosa (BN) form a depression complex or whether they are physiological depression accompanying adolescence. We wished to observe the perception of these patients,of their functioning, both social and within their families and also looking for common point in the issues mentioned above trying to locate them within the course of the basic illness. We studied 19 patients suffering from eating disorders, and aged between 12 and 24 years old. 15 of them suffered from the restrictive form of AN and 4 suffered from BN. The control group consisted of 30 healthy girls in the same age interval. In the study authors used the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Quebec Quality of Life Questionnaire. Comparison of a number of points acquired in the survey using Beck Depression Scale revealed statistic significance at the level p&lt;0.001 which points to a more frequent occurrence of depression symptoms among persons with eating disorders comparing to control group. The survey using the Questionnaire for Social Quality showed no statistically significant differences between study and control groups (p&gt;0.05). The authors observed a statistically significant increased frequency of suicidal thoughts in the study group compared to the controls. To diagnose depression, depressive symptoms presented by the patients must give the image of depression at the clinical level. The result of the Beck's scale needs to be confronted with the clinical picture. Depression in adolescence requires differentiation from depressiveness. ","2091":"The objective of our study was to evaluate the effect of olanzapine treatment on selected cognitive functions in patients suffering from schizophrenia during an observation period of six-months. Twenty patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia according to ICD-10 criteria for research were examined. One day before initiation of olanzapine a baseline assessment was performed. The neuropsychological examination was repeated 28 days, 60 days, 3 months, and 6 months after the beginning of treatment. Cognitive function measurements were performed using Signal, COGNITRON and RT tests, being a part of the computer-based Vienna Test System (VTS). Our study showed an improvement in the assessed cognitive functions. Impairments in cognitive domains were observed at baseline as compared to published normative data, and enhancement in achieved results was observed subsequently in all stages of the treatment until the 6th month. The above results are consistent with a number of other studies on the impact on cognitive functioning in patients with schizophrenia treated with olanzapine.

From these we deduce the reasons why collaborative care may offer better treatment outcomes than the issuing of guidelines to GPs.","2093":"The management of depression has recently been the focus of several articles, in particular regarding the efficacy of pharmacological and other treatments. In order for these to be effective as possible, correct diagnosis, consideration of the underlying neurobiology and an appropriate provision of healthcare services must be ensured.","2094":"As a group of four clinical medical students from Cambridge University, we undertook a Student Selected Module (SSC- \"OpenMinds\") whereby we designed and delivered a workshop about mental health to year 9 pupils. The aim of our SSC was to produce an interactive, informative lesson which addressed the complex issues of stigma and discrimination against those suffering from a mental illness as well as teaching the pupils how to recognise mental health problems and provide them with guidance on how to seek help. We split a fifty minute session into the following sections: tackling stigma; how common mental illness is; celebrity examples; real life examples; role play; and small group work. To engage the pupils we used a combination of teaching modalities targeting all learning. We delivered the workshop to four separate classes and received feedback from the pupils after each. We used this feedback to adapt and improve our presentation and assess the efficacy. Feedback was overwhelmingly positive with the striking results of 101\/109 pupils saying that they would recommend the workshop to a friend and 68\/109 pupils saying they enjoyed all aspects. Our SSC built upon work by a contingent of trainee Psychiatrists who undertook a similar project of mental health education for teenagers, called \"Heads above the rest\", in Northern Ireland with great success. By continuing their work we were able to demonstrate that medical students can successfully complete the same project under the guidance of a Psychiatrist, thus increasing the sustainability of the project by reducing the time burden on the Psychiatrists. Participating in the project was also valuable to our own personal development of teaching skills.","2095":"\"We of the craft (poets) are all crazy,\" remarked the 18th century British romanticist Lord Byron (George Gordon) about himself and his fellow poets. Implied in this statement is the notion that there exists a special kind of relationship between poets and being \"crazy\". A relationship between psychopathology and the artistic temperament is one of the oldest and most persistent of cultural notions; it is also one of the most contentious and controversial. The purpose of this exposition is to investigate if a correlation between bipolar disorder and poetic genius really does exist. A literature search was conducted along with a review of Professor Jamison's treatise Touched with Fire: Manic Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament. A detailed case study of Lord Byron was also performed in order to gain a qualitative insight into the psyche of a notorious poet who was alleged to suffer from bipolar disorder. Recent research employing systematic and biographical methodology has given strong support to a much higher rate of mood disorders in artistic populations than could be expected from chance alone. A British study spearheaded by Professor Jamison on living writers and artists revealed many overlapping mood, cognitive, and behavioral changes between hypomania and intense creative states. In the case of Lord Byron, the clinical hallmark of manic-depressive illness is its recurrent, episodic nature, which Byron had in an almost textbook manner. Byron also had a family history remarkable for its suicide in itself more likely to be associated with bipolar disorder than with any other condition. Not all writers and artists suffer from major mood disorders. Likewise, most people who have a major mood disorder are not writers or artists. It seems counterintuitive that melancholy could be associated with artistic inspiration and productivity; the milder manic states would seem, at first thought, to be more obviously linked. In the case of Lord Byron, his temperament made him exquisitely responsive to virtually everything in his physical and psychological world; it gave him much of his great capacity for passion and understanding, as well as for suffering thus giving credence to the notion that there exists a correlation between bipolar disorder and poetic genius. ","2096":"Re-audit of the physical examination of older adults admitted to one of two inpatient Older Adult wards at the Maudsley Hospital found that on admission, only 58% of patients had a brief physical examination and 43% had a full physical examination, and after 72 hours only 65% had a full physical examination. This is a slight improvement on the previous audit but still falls short of the target of 90% of patients having a full physical examination within 72 hours of admission. Recommendations include education of junior and senior doctors of the need for physical examination via presentation of audit and distribution of results, consideration of the use of a proforma to gather information on physical examination which may have been done in an acute hospital and a further re-audit to see if outcomes have improved.","2097":"Prescribing Observatory for Mental Health (POMH-UK) runs national audit-based quality improvement programmes open to all specialist mental health services in the UK to help improve prescribing practice in discrete areas. The baseline sample and this re-audit represent the largest audits of antipsychotic prescribing in PWLD that have been conducted to date; and thus provide the most generalisable picture of such prescribing nationally. A case note audit of use of antipsychotic medication in PWLD was conducted using standard data collection tool provided by POMH-UK. Trust wide, 7 clinical teams in Essex and Bedfordshire &amp; Luton, participated in the re-audit. Analysis and benchmarking was conducted centrally by POMH-UK and an individualised Trust report was compiled by POMH-UK for local review and consideration. The indication for treatment with antipsychotic medication should be documented in the clinical records (Deb 2006). The continuing need for antipsychotic medication should be reviewed at least once a year (Deb 2006). Side effects of antipsychotic medication should be reviewed at least once a year. This review should include assessment for the presence of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), and screening for the 4 aspects of the metabolic syndrome: obesity, hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance and dyslipidaemia (NICE schizophrenia guideline update CG82, 2009). Out of three standards measured, Standard One maintained 100% throughout the baseline and re-audit and Standard Two achieved over 90% throughout baseline and re-audit. Standard 3 has improved from baseline to re-audit. Overall, there has been clear improvement in all 3 standards from baseline audit. ","2098":"The stigmatizing of the mentally ill is quite common and has numerous social and economical consequences for these individuals. The aim of this paper was to examine young peoples' beliefs regarding the mentally disordered. The authors' questionnaire regarding the interviewees' age, gender, social background and their opinions on the mentally ill was conducted among a popular portal's users. 11900 people were questioned, including 71% women. 30% of the interviewees were under the age of 19, while 34% of them were between 19 and 24 years old and 36% were over 24. 39% of the interviewees stated they closely knew at least one mentally ill person. 44% of the questioned believed a lot of criminal offenders were mentally ill. 66% of interviewees would not mind sharing a flat with a mentally disordered person, 64% would agree to work with one. Those who personally knew a mentally disordered person were more inclined to share a flat or start a relationship with such an individual, than the rest of the interviewed (51% vs. 37% for flat sharing and 38% vs. 26% for starting a relationship, p&lt;0.001). More questioned under the age of 19 believed that significant number of criminal offenders were mentally ill, than those over the age of 24 (50% vs. 37%, p&lt;0.001). According to the acquired data, many young Poles believe that the mentally disordered are inclined to break the law and behave aggressively. These opinions seem to be related amongst others to age and gender, and they result in unwillingness to have relations with the mentally disordered. ","2099":"Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome is one of the life threatening complications of antipsychotic psychotropic medication. We here report a case of a 39 years old male who has had a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia since the age of 18. He had been on antipsychotic therapy since then. He was stable on a combination of antipsychotics. He had mild hyper-salivation for a long time but was not very concerned about it. He requested and was prescribed Hyoscine Hydrobromide 300 mcg BD for hyper-salivation. There was no other medication change. After 5 days of starting Kwells, the patient presented with Neuroleptic Malignant syndrome. One has to watch for NMS while starting Hyoscine Hydrbromide for someone on antispychotics.","2100":"Through effects of catecholamines upon the heart, blood vessels and platelets, sympathoadrenal hyperactivity contributes to the development of cardiovascular diseases in elderly depressed patients. To assess the cardiovascular effect of Citalopram in elderly depressed patients, data from an open multicenter study in Belgium and Luxembourg, in which a total of 811 patients were evaluated, was retrospectively analysed. Although the aim of the study was to assess the efficacy and safety of Citalopram, blood pressure and heart rate were also monitored. Patients included in the study were referred either by psychiatrists, geriatricians or general practitioners. Clinical assessment included ratings on the Hamilton Rating Depression Scale, the Clinical Global Impression Scale, the UKU Side effect rating scale and the assessment of side effects spontaneously reported. With few side effects, Citalopram significantly improves the clinical condition of elderly patients suffering from depressive symptoms. A series of repeated multivariate analyses of covariance were performed on heart rate and blood pressure controlling for the effect of age. Interestingly, a sustained decrease of these parameters was shown during the whole study period reaching significance for systolic blood pressure (p&lt;0.05). These effects were observed both in responding as well as non-responding patients, and were somewhat more marked in responders for heart rate (p=0.058). The slight but significant decrease in systolic blood pressure and heart rate suggests that citalopram may reduce sympathoadrenal hyperactivity and the related increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with depression. ","2101":"GBL (gamma-butyro-lactone) is converted to Gamma hydroxyl butyrate (GHB) in the body. GBL and GHB are available in liquid form and powder form. Once categorised under \"legal highs\", these two are not associated with any dependence or withdrawal in animal studies. But there are case reports indicating their high dependence potential in humans. We here present a case of a 29 year old who came to the attention of psychiatric services with very bizarre presentation and needed a host of investigations and expert views from various medical disciplines. He was treated mainly symptomatically followed by a sudden dramatic recovery on the 11th day after presentation. GBL is getting popular as a recreational drug and its withdrawal should be seriously considered in the list of medical causes leading to Delirium.","2102":"Our study aims to make inferences from inpatient admission of conversion disorder with regards it's age and sex distribution, clinical presentation, yearly distribution of admission and morbidity of conversion disorder in comparison to total psychiatric admissions. It also compares it's results with those of previous studies in this country, neighbouring countries and western studies. A case notes review was done for admissions of this disorder for five years in Mosul University Hospital. The data were inputted into SPSS programme and analysed. The statistical analysis was by t-test, Anova and regression. Two hundred seventy five patients were admitted during the period; 224 women and 51 men. The majority of men came from Urban areas compared to 58% of women. Single status was over represented; 59% compared to 34% married. Women formed 82% of the singles, 90% of the widows and 83% of the divorced. Pseudo-fits was the most frequent diagnosis. There was no significant change in the number of yearly admissions apart from the first year. The proportion of conversion disorders compared to total psychiatric disorders admissions was 7.4%. Results were consistent with national studies but showed higher figures than neighbouring countries. What was interesting was that, results were consistent with figures in United Kingdom before 1950. ","2103":"Agitated Depression and Bipolar mixed states combine depressive and manic symptoms, reflecting severe forms of affective disorders with an increased suicide risk. These states have not been defined with adequate consensus and hence present a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. In this study, we argue that both states are part of the bipolar spectrum rather than a distinct affective syndrome or a mixed anxiety-depression state. The current literature has been reviewed and suggestions are made for a unified definition of this entity, which would be valuable in recognising this dangerous state. We have then studied 17 cases of mixed states identified from a database held by a UK community mental health team. We have studied the treatments offered and estimated the time these treatments have taken to end the mixed state and so reduce the risk of suicide. Not surprisingly, there are no clear recommendations for treatment of these mixed states. We found that The best results were achieved with a three pronged regimen including increasing\/adding mood stabilisers; and\/or increasing\/adding antipsychotics; as well as decreasing antidepressants. Resolution was achieved in two and a half weeks. From this work we have deduced several general principles, which are here reviewed and hence we have been able to suggest possible treatment strategies. Because of the close link between affective mixed states and suicidality, it is of great importance that patients be brought out of the mixed affective state as soon as possible, hence we believe that our findings are of importance in managing these patients. However we recommend further study on a larger sample in order to confirm our findings. ","2104":"Current literature suggests patients with bipolar disorder are at increased risk of developing migraine compared with the general population and patients with other affective disorders. This study examined whether this finding was evident in the outpatient department of a regional psychiatric hospital. Using a patient database (n=1083), records were screened for bipolar disorder (n=169) or self-report of migraine (n=46). 8 cases of co-morbid migraine and bipolar disorder were revealed (4.7% prevalence). This and the general prevalence of migraine (4.2%) are substantially lower than previously reported. Reasons for and implications of this finding are discussed.","2105":"The authors put forward the hypotheses that during a three-month treatment with tianeptine in patients with depressive disorders there is an improvement in the short-term memory, reaction time and attention. 20 patients suffering from depression, were included in the study. During the entire research period all patients were treated with monotherapy with tianeptine. Cognitive function measurements were performed using the Vienna Test System. Our study showed an improvement in the all the assessed functions: patients treated with tianeptine had better performance in tests measuring short term memory and learning processes as well as reaction time and attention. In conclusion, the study shows that tianeptine improves cognitive functions in depressed patients. ","2106":"Atypical antipsychotics commonly cause isolated asymptomatic increase in the aminotransferase levels. Furthermore, the strategy in the choice of antipsychotic agent must take into account hepatic tolerance because of the non-negligible incidence of liver disorders among the psychiatric population. The aim of this article is to better understand the strategy to adopt during an increase of liver enzymes in a psychotic patient under atypical neuroleptic treatment. A clinical case is presented of a female patient treated for psychotic decompensation with increase of liver enzymes (Olanzapine). Her treatment was changed several times over a period of 7 years and laboratory investigations were conducted simultaneously. It seems that the increase of liver enzymes is slightly more frequent with Clozapine and Olanzapine than Risperidone, Perazine and Haloperiol. The different mechanisms of hepatotoxicity are unknown at present but it seems that the hypersensibility mechanism is likely to be dose dependent. During an increase of enzymes, it is important to combine a control of hepatic enzymes with a reduction of neuroleptic dosage. Discontinuation should be considered if a continued increase of enzymes above certain values is shown or if a clinical symptom appears. We note also that some risk factors were found, including geriatric or pedopsychiatric age, obesity, and association with active ingredients or addictive substances responsible for hepatic disorders. ","2107":"Four-hundred and twenty three consecutive patients who have been seen in a private psychiatric clinic were assessed for bipolar disorder. A large proportion of these patients were found to demonstrate a number of somatic syndromes. The main somatic syndromes found on the patients' \"first visit\" have been: colitis (45% of the patients), gastritis (25%), migraine (8%) others (above all with dermatological symptoms: 2%). All the patients presented muscular tension at their \"first visit\". Somatic syndromes constitute an important pointer for the diagnosis of bipolar spectrum disorders.","2108":"To identify the social, family, personality traits and health locus of control factors which influence physical and mental health, consumption of medications, and frequency of medical consultations. Twenty participants were included in a two years long longitudinal study. At baseline, the participants' age, gender, family composition, net income, chronic treatments, family dynamics (Family Adaptation and Cohesion Scale), Multidimensional Health Locus of Control, and personality (NEO Personality Inventory) were recorded. Every six months their state of mental and physical health (12 Survey Factors and Hamilton Depression Scale), consumption of medications, and number of medical consultations were reassessed. Regarding mental, and physical health, and scores on the Hamilton Depression Scale we can explain 50% of the variance, of which 25% accounts for age or for the number of persons living together, 15% accounts for the cohesion of the actual couple or nuclear family and 10% on account for neuroticism or on the Internal HLC. With regard to the number of medications and consultations only 30% of the variance is accounted for: 10% for gender, 10% for the cohesion of the ideal family and 10% for neuroticism or extraversion. These results can obviously be used in the field of secondary prevention, for example in raising GPs' awareness to the typical profile of patients who are at risk of mental or physical health problems. Ideally these results should also serve for primary prevention, but how can we influence demographic variables, family cohesion or personality?

The syndrome may occur in association with a number of psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, organic mental disorder, or even in dementia with behavioral and psychological symptoms. Evidence of efficacy of treatment options is weak and there is little known about the specific use of typical and atypical antipsychotics. We report on a case of primary DP in a 75-year-old Caucasian woman with a 3-year-long history of dermatological consultations due to unspecified complains who responded to the typical antipsychotic promazine. This case is unique in pharmacological respect as it presents the first reported DP treatment with promazine. It also raises the issue of efficacy and safety of low-potency typical antipsychotics in the elderly population.","2112":"Dermatological side effects of psychopharmacological drugs are fortunately not so often. They are mostly presented in the group of mood stabilizers and antiepileptic drugs, particularly the carbamazepine and lamotrigine, and can be manifested through the Stevens Johnson syndrome, Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN)\/Lyell's syndrome with about 30% lethality. According to the literature the group of phenothiazines is the category of drugs with rare appearances of skin reactions. Promazine, aliphatic phenothiazines antipsychotic, including less frequent side effects in the leaflet states increased skin sensitivity to sun, skin rash-associated with contact dermatitis, allergic reactions, cholestatic icterus. The only reported dermatological side effect of promazine is its metabolites deposition in the cornea. Analyzing the e-data basis we have not found references connecting the Exanthema medicamentosum as a side effect of promazine. A forty-two years old female patient was admitted to the Dermatological Clinic because of suspected exanthema, undoubtedly caused by promazine as a medication for Sy. Borderline.","2113":null,"2114":"The aim of this study was to explore the association between age and care of patients with depression in primary care setting. A comparison was made among the groups of elderly patients, middle aged patients and younger patients with diagnosis of depressive episode (F32). Patients (17.290) from ten GP offices in the city of Zagreb formed the representative sample for this study according to the estimated depression prevalence in Europe of 5%. A group of 231 (60%) patients with diagnosis Depressive episode (F32), out of 383 patients with Depression diagnosis according to ICD-10, were reviewed and extracted from GPs' standardized medical files. They were divided in three age groups: &lt;45 years (n=58), 45-65 years (n=97) and &gt;65 years (n=76). Data were tracked longitudinally and obtained retrospectively for one-year period from 1st January to 31th December 2009. Pharmacotherapy was classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification index. The youngest and the oldest age group mainly used only one drug in their therapy (47% vs 64%), but middle age group almost equally used one or two drugs (42 vs 45%). About 50% of all patients used SSRIs. Benzodiazepines were used most frequently in middle and in the oldest age group (71% vs 60%). The most frequent combinations of antidepressants in the youngest age group were SSRIs and combination of SSRIs and benzodiazepines; in middle age group it was combination of SSRIs and benzodiazepines and benzodiazepines; and in the oldest benzodiazepines, and SSRIs. Benzodiazepines were used mainly discontinuously in oppose to significant continuous usage in middle age group (P 0.043). In the oldest age groupe, depression diagnose was mostly given by GP and the most frequent therapy was combination of pharmacotherapy and GP's support. Unaided clinical assessment of depression outcome by GP did not differ significantly between age groups although some differences existed. Number and sort of antidepressants as well as sort of physician: GP or psychiatrist differed between age groups of depressed patients. Further investigation of specifical depression treatment compared with outcome measures should give answer whether those differences are justified. ","2115":"The ratio of anxiolytics to antidepressants is an indicator of the quality of treatment of depression and anxiety in primary care. The objective of the study was to investigate the prescription of anxiolytics and antidepressants among Slovenian family physicians, including patient demographics and possible time-trends. An exploratory survey and register-based analysis of anxiolytic and antidepressant prescriptions in 2005 and 2008 was performed. Drugs included in the study were classified according to an Anatomical-Therapeutic-Chemical (ATC) drug classification system, and ATC data were used to calculate defined daily doses (DDD) per 1,000 practice population per day. Descriptive analysis of anxiolytic\/antidepressant ratio by patients' age, gender and region of residency was performed. Total amount of prescribed antidepressant drugs increased by 45% during the observed 3-year period, while total prescribing of anxiolytics decreased by 14%, leading to the anxiolytics\/antidepressants ratio diminishing from 1 to about 0.5. The highest reduction in the ratio was observed in the northeast region, characterised by high social deprivation and one of the highest suicide rates in Europe. The highest prescribing of anxiolytics and antidepressants was observed in the central region around the capital Ljubljana. The reduction of anxiolytic prescribing and increase in antidepressant prescribing indicates improvement in prescribing practice of Slovenian family physicians. There are big variations in prescribing among different Slovenian regions, which are attributable to the number of psychiatrists and access to psychiatric treatment. ","2116":"The media have an important role in maintaining and creating social relations and social environment. This especially refers to the war and post-war period in which the media can form a part of the prevention context, i.e., the media can facilitate the process of recovery from war trauma, but they can also contribute to stigmatization and retraumatization. Our aim was to analyze Croatian newspaper reports about Croatian war veterans and to determine the differences in ways of dealing with the subject during 1996 and 2006. The data were gathered by reviewing two daily papers, Novi list and Ve?ernji list and Globus weekly. The analysis included newspaper reports related to the subject of Croatian war veterans, published in the first six months of 1996 and 2006. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to analyze both the form and the content of the reports. A total of 538 newspaper reports were published in the above-stated periods. In the first half of 2006 the number of reports related to the subject of Croatian war veterans dropped 6.5 percent compared to the first half of 1996. Topics prevalent at the end of the war were different from those ten years later. The 1996 articles mostly reported on activities organized by various associations, medal-awarding ceremonies, military operations etc. Ten years later the topics focused on war crimes, trials of Croatian war generals and dissatisfaction with veterans' rights and legislation. Moreover, articles relating to crime and reports about suicides and attempts of suicide increased significantly in 2006. During the ten-year period, the media image of Croatian war veterans significantly changed, which was expected owing to different social circumstances immediately after the war and ten years later. The prevalence of topics negative in tone and a lack of proactive stories reflect, but also create, a social context which can affect the process of recovery from traumatization. ","2117":"The disorder of biogenic amine metabolism (serotonin - 5-HT and dopamine - DA) is expected in the brain (neuron) damage caused by acute ischemia. It is known that long-term abuse of ethyl-alcohol damages the quality of neurons diffusely in the brain. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and its biochemical content, 5-HT and DA, are reliable indicators of the vitality of neurons. The main objective of this research was to demonstrate that the elevated content of metabolites 5-HT and DA in the CSF in patients with acute brain infarction, who were pre-morbid alcohol-dependent patients, is additionally emphasized by diffusive damage of neuron vitality caused by alcoholism. Study sample consists of two groups - 50 alcohol-dependent patients with acute brain infarction under the age of 65 (group A) and 50 patients with acute brain infarction who were not alcohol-dependent (group B). All subjects underwent the same procedure - CSF was taken during admission to the hospital and history was obtained through anamnesis, heteroanamnesis and clinical examinations. Metabolism of DA and metabolic turnover of DA (3, 4 dihydroxyphenylacetic acid + homovanilic acid; DOPAC + HVA) was elevated in the liquor of both patient groups. The statistically significant difference between the groups was found in metabolic turnover of 5-HT (p&lt;0.05), and metabolic turnover of DA (p&lt;0.001). The metabolic neuron disbalance, i.e. their pathophysiological-biochemical dysfunction as a result of acute brain infarction, is present in a higher degree in patients with pre-morbid long-term alcohol abuse.

This is a cross sectional survey conducted in Primary Health Care centers, Qatar from October to June 2009. A representative sample of 3000 Qatari and non-Qatari Arabs above 20 years of age were approached and 2514 subjects (83.8%) gave consent to participate in this study. More than non-Qatari Arabs, a significant proportion of Qataris thought that mental illness can be a punishment from God (44.5% vs 50.6%; p=0.002) and that people with mental illness are mentally retarded (35.1% vs 45.1%; p&lt;0.001). Qatari nationals had a poor knowledge about causes of mental illness compared to non-Qatari Arabs such as a belief that mental illness is due to possession of evil spirits (40.5% vs 37.6%) and psychiatric medication will cause addiction (61% vs 57.3%). The study revealed that there is an ethnic diversity within Arab societies in their knowledge, attitude and practice towards mental illness. ","2119":"This review clarifies the fact that basal ganglia diseases are psychiatric as much as neurological diseases. It illustrates psychiatric aspects in Parkinson's disease and other hereditary basal ganglia diseases such as Wilson's disease, Huntington's chorea and others. In these diseases, psychological disorders can be difficult to diagnose, whether they are concomitant with the primary (neurological) disease, they are its consequence, or they are the result of a specific pharmacotherapy prescribed for these disease, etc. Thus, the choice of appropriate psychopharmacotherapy for these disorders represents a very subtle problem.","2120":"Owing to the fact that the Internet is spreading rapidly and influencing all aspects of everyday life, a task is assigned to the academic and clinical circles to establish a diagnosis and provide treatment for disorders brought about by its dysfunctional use. This paper presents a review of the most frequent problems and difficulties in dealing with individuals complaining of the symptoms of Internet use disorder, as well as some suggestions for overcoming and alleviating these problems. For the diagnostic criteria problem, a solution can be provided in the form of behavioural addictions category in order to solve the problem of the classification of not only this disorder but also other forms, such as pathological gambling, compulsive shopping etc. However, since there are obvious similarities with the compulsive behaviour, we suggest the term Internet Use Disorder, which appears most acceptable in terms of avoiding beforehand the indecisiveness of this disorder nature. Certainly, in the practical work with each client, by means of a precise and complex clinical interview, it would be further determined which subtype is under question and whether the mechanism of its realisation is more that of a compulsive or addictive nature. We also suggest an approach of defining a set of minimal key symptoms and manifestations of this problem, rather than singling out the personality profiles of individuals who constitute the population at risk. By prevention, the attentiveness of the public would be in that way directed towards the critical aspects of behaviour, and not towards a vague picture which causes panic and doubt, rather than reasonable ways of the problem solution.","2121":"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders with lifelong impact of the affected individuals. It is usually co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders. This paper aims to review current knowledge about ADHD in imprisoned individuals. The rate of ADHD in prisoners ranges from 10% to 70% and it has been suggested that ADHD, even without co-morbidity with conduct disorder, is a risk factor for imprisonment. Based on these findings, it may be wise to include the assessment of ADHD symptoms in all adult and adolescent prisoners. This is while available psychiatric resources for the adequate management of ADHD in prisoners are limited. Most of current knowledge on the topic comes from western countries. There is an urgent need for studies that will explore the effect of other cultures on the interactions between ADHD and imprisonment, especially in developing countries worldwide. At this point, ADHD seems to be an ignored research area in developing countries.","2122":"","2123":"","2124":"Often, long-term treatment with benzodiazepines is a subject of discussion due to potential side effects, with dependence on benzodiazepines as the most serous one. After longer period of benzodiazepines tolerance on their anxiolytic effects develops. Discontinuation is usually beneficial as it is followed by improved psychomotor and cognitive functioning, particularly in the elderly. Previous studies confirmed occurrence of physical dependence in high percentage of patients in long term treatment with benzodiazepines at therapeutic dosages. Benzodiazepines are relatively well-tolerated medicines but can induce serious problems of addiction and that is why their use is regulated. The aim of this article is to report a case of a patient who was taking 15 tablets of oxazepam daily for a period of time, during which reinforcement of irritability occurred. It is necessary to warn patients who take benzodiazepines in therapy that reinforcement of irritability may occur in case of higher dosage of benzodiazepines, which may be misinterpreted as worsening in mental condition. ","2125":"Communication with person with dementia (PWD) is becoming worse and worse during the course of illness, and at the end may be totally lost. Non-pharmacological interventions may be beneficial in increasing the behavioural disturbances which appears frequently during the progression of dementia, and combination of non-pharmacological techniques and drugs is usually more efficacy than psychopharmacs alone. Mr. Zvonko, the PWD diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease of moderate stage, is presented in this case report. Although Mr. Zvonko was treated with antidementia drugs, the behavioural disturbances were present. The introduction of low doses of conventional antipsychotic was accompanied with extrapiramidal side-effects, and atypical antipsychotics were not used due to the FDA warning and non-willingness of caregiver and family to take that risk. After his individual and family status was evaluated, he was advised to attend the daily care centre and to start with art therapy. Despite he was never drawing pictures before developing AD, everybody, including his wife who is also a caregiver, was surprised with his talent and creativity. While drawing the pictures he was calm and satisfied and his behaviour in the daily care centre, but also at home, became much more adequate. There was no need to add psychopharmacs for behavioural disturbances. In this case the art therapy was shown to be an excellent add-on non-pharmacological intervention, beneficial for reducing stress-related behaviours in PWD taking antidementia drugs.","2126":"Alprazolam belongs in the group of anxiolytics, medicaments used for reducing anxiety. As most other drugs, it can cause various adverse events, including hormonal disturbances and imbalance. Prolactin elevation is one such hormonal adverse event that can lead to galactorrhoea, or abnormal milk discharge from the breast and amenorrhoea. In this case report we will present the case of a female patient that developed galactorrhoea while treated with alprazolam, after all physical factors that can also cause these symptoms were excluded.","2127":"The treatment of dysthymia in itself poses a problem in the everyday psychiatric practice and it can be further hindered when accompanied by pronounced personality traits (which are indicative of disorder). Due to its pathology and duration dysthymia interferes with the patient's quality of life and the ability to function in some segments of everyday life. These interferences enticed our patient to opt for psychiatric treatment. During a three-year period, despite all the efforts made by psychiatrists in this comprehensive and challenging dysthymia treatment (psychotherapy, group psychotherapy, psychopharmacotherapy), the expected outcomes of the treatment did not occur. The patient's goals and expectations included lifestyle change, achieving life satisfaction and mood improvement. The patient was refusing suggested psychopharmaca until confronted, in psychotherapy, with the fact that she is the one prolonging her own helplessness and directing her passive agression at the members of the group. In the end the patent agreed to take psychopharmaca. Therefore, sertraline was introduced in the treatment, but the patient experienced a severe allergic reaction (Qiuncke's oedema). After four months the second attempt was made and escitaloptam was introduced, which resulted in urticaria. Due to these allergic reactions to antidepressants, the patient decided not to pursue the psychopharmacological treatment.","2128":"Dual-action antidepressants serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SRNIs) are widely used to treat depression. Owing to its efficiency and safety, venlafaxine holds a prominent place in this group of depressants. Abrupt venlafaxine discontinuation involves a high risk of withdrawal syndrome. Mechanism of its development is similar to that of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), but of higher intensity. Venlafaxine withdrawal symptoms may include several somatic symptoms as well as several psychiatric symptoms. In some cases, symptoms may look like a stroke. A treatment option is re-inclusion of venlafaxine or a SSRI antidepressant. The paper presents the case of a 70-year-old patient who discontinued of her own accord to take venlafaxine, which she had been taking regularly at a daily dose of 225 mg for more than a year. A few hours after taking the last dose, withdrawal syndrome occurred with severe symptoms resembling a stroke. The patient was examined by a neurologist and the CT and laboratory parameters showed no irregularities. Diagnosis was made after psychiatric observation. Venlafaxine, 150 mg per day, was prescribed, the symptoms disappeared relatively quickly, and the patient fully recovered. Withdrawal syndrome is a real risk for each venlafaxine treated patient. The possibility of its occurrence should be always kept in mind and patients should be timely informed about it. In this way, the risk of venlafaxine withdraw syndrome could be reduced, unnecessary stress to patients prevented and the costs of medical treatment lowered.","2129":"Side-effects arising on the grounds of antidepressant administration pose as a substantial obstacle hindering successful depressive disorder treatment. Side-effects, especially those severe or those manifested through dramatic clinical presentations such as panic attacks, make the treatment far more difficult and shake patients' trust in both the treatment and the treating physician. This case report deals with a patient experiencing a moderately severe depressive episode, who responded to duloxetine treatment administered in the initial dose of 30 mg per day with as many as three panic attacks in two days. Upon duloxetine withdrawal, these panic attacks ceased as well. The patient continued tianeptine and alprazolam treatment during which no significant side-effects had been seen, so that she gradually recovered. Some of the available literature sources have suggested the possibility of duloxetine administration to the end of generalised anxiety disorder and panic attack treatment. However, they are outnumbered by the contributions reporting about duloxetine-related anxiety, aggressiveness and panic attacks. In line with the foregoing, further monitoring of each and every duloxetine-administered patient group needs to be pursued so as to be able to evaluate treatment benefits and weigh them against risks of anxiety or panic attack onset.","2130":"Epilepsy often occurs in comorbidity with mental diseases and disorders. Early detection and\/or treatment of such disorders in patients affected by epilepsy, as well as their socialisation are crucially important since epileptic patients tend to suffer more due to lack of social support than to frequent epileptic seizures. Prevalence of psychiatric disorders is higher in patients with epilepsy than in general population, the most frequent being: anxiety, depression, panic attacks, behavioural disorders as well as psychotic states with paranoid elements. The efficacy of AE treatment of patients affected by epilepsy and mood disorders has also directed clinicians to investigate possible AE benefits in treating other mental disorders such as anxiety states, depression and bipolar disorder. The examined case displays complex partial epilepsy and comorbid mental disorder. The use of lamotrigine, a fourth-generation antiepileptic, which is also a mood stabilizer, has assured a favourable remission of symptoms related to both epilepsy and mood disorders. Side-effects caused by lamotrigine were only temporary and dose reduction was sufficient to eliminate their symptoms.","2131":"Akathisia is a syndrome characterized by the unpleasant sensation of \"inner\" restlessness that manifests itself in the inability of sitting still or not moving. Many types of medicaments can cause akathisia as an adverse event of their use and they include: antipsychotics, antidepressants, antiemetics, antihistamines, and psychoactive substances. We will present the case of a 50 year old patient, treated on two occasions for psychotic depression. During the second hospitalization it is possible that antipsychotic treatment combined with an antidepressant caused akathisia or there were symptoms of agitated depression and akathisia present at the same time, which is very difficult to determine in everyday clinical practice. We can conclude that in this case, as in many others, akathisia as a possible adverse effect of psychopharmacs was very hard to identify. Therefore, it is necessary to have akathisia in mind when using certain medicaments, especially when combining several that use the same enzymatic system and consequently raise levels of at least one of them.","2132":"Rapid weight gain among patients with mental disorders can further compound psychological distress and negatively influence compliance. Weight gain associated with treatment with atypical antipsychotic medication has been widely recognized as a risk factor for the development of diabetes type II and cardiovascular diseases. This paper describes a 33-year old female patient treated for schizoaffective disorder. Within two months after introducing quetiapine the patient experienced considerable weight gain amounting to 19 kg. The replacement of antipsychotic during inpatient psychiatric care resulted in weight loss.","2133":"Children and adolescents are being treated with antipsychotics more often than before, although the risk of adverse events in this age group still remains unclear. Because of increased use of antipsychotics in children and adolescents, their endocrine and metabolic side-effects (weight gain, obesity, and related metabolic deviations) are of particular worrying, especially within pediatric and adolescent population that appears to be at greater risk comparing with adults for antipsychotic-induced metabolic adverse events. In this work we will present the course of treatment of an adolescent girl with psychotic symptoms, within the clinical diagnosis of Organic delusional disorder, who had a considerable weight gain after one year of olanzapine treatment.","2134":"According to current medical opinion chronic mental diseases such as schizophrenia require life-long treatment. The choice of antipsychotics is an important treatment factor, since their side-effects often influence patients' compliance with treatment. Severe side-effects may cause the patients to reject such treatment, the latter being their right. In case a psychiatrist does not agree with the patient's decision to interrupt his antipsychotic treatment regardless its serious side-effects, the former should be persistent in convincing the patient to replace such drug with a more appropriate therapy.","2135":"Like any other patient, a schizophrenic patient can get a physical illness, too. As such patients tend to ignore reality and neglect themselves and are stigmatized by society, due to which their physical symptomatology is often ignored, physical illness can remain undetected. If the schizophrenic patient is observed and adequate care is provided by the family, family doctor and a psychiatrist, it is possible to recognize the physical illness and intervene promptly. We are presenting a case of a female patient who has been treated for schizophrenia for a number of years. The treatment was mostly ambulatory (i.e. the patient was hospitalized twice) and consisted of first-generation antipsychotics. During the past two years, for reasons unknown, the patient stopped taking regular meals and as a result lost significant body weight, became apathetic and withdrawn, started avoiding social contacts and neglected personal hygiene. She reportedly took the psychopharmaca regularly, but rarely attended psychiatric follow-up consultations. Due to substantial weight loss and hypotonia, correction of antipsychotic was made and internist treatment administered. The choice of olanzapine was not an accidental one. We decided to take advantage of its side effect for the treatment of an anorectic syndrome. Interdisciplinary cooperation proved to be a justified decision.","2136":"Psychopharmaca are used in treatment of psychiatric illnesses and disorders, among other therapeutic possibilities. The choice of the psychopharmaca is determined by the specific psychopathology of the patient, within the diagnostic categories, according to the current classification of diseases and disorders. With the advances in pharmaco industry, the range of drugs used in the everyday clinical practice is occurring at a very rapid pace. Antipsychotic medications are used in treatment of mainly psychotic disorders. However, the new generation of antipsychotics, due to their specific receptor affinities, is sometimes used in treatment of affective disorders as well. We are reporting a case of a female patient who was hospitalized several times. Amisulpride was introduced in the treatment and due to a series of unfortunate events and changes that followed (i. e. frequent hospitalizations and changes of therapists, different mental institutions) dose of amisulpride was gradually increased to its antipsychotic doses, which did not help achieve therapeutic benefits, but serious side effects.","2137":"Depression is a disorder held responsible for high morbidity in the overall population. Causes of depression vary, but lifestyle and stress can greatly contribute to its morbidity. Consumption of antidepressants is showing a trend in the economically developed countries. Apart from antidepressants, the treatment of depression can consist of other psychopharmaca. Depending on the severity of a disorder, that is - of psychotic symptoms, antipsychotics can be introduced in the treatment. Among those atypical antipsychotics have an advantage. This paper will illustrate a course of treatment of a female patient, diagnosed with psychotic depression and treated with antipsychotics (i.e. olanzapine, ziprasidone), to which she developed side effects. To each of the antypsychotics the patient developed side effechts, causing in prolonged treatment and affected its course.","2138":"Depression is associated with increased physical morbidity and overall mortality. The results of a previous investigation on the relationship of the metabolic syndrome and its single components with coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and all-cause mortality suggested that the metabolic syndrome is a marker of CVD risk, but not above and beyond the risk associated with its individual components. The aim of this article is to review literature regarding prevalence of metabolic syndrome in patients with depressive disorder, and association between metabolic syndrome and depression. Literature research included structured searches of Medline and other publications on the subject of metabolic syndrome, particularly prevalence of metabolic syndrome in patients with depressive disorder, and association between metabolic syndrome and depression. Prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in patients with depression is high and varies among the analysed studies. Some investigations showed association between metabolic syndrome and depression. Further investigations are necessary in order to clarify the association between metabolic syndrome and depression. ","2139":"Motor fluctuations and dyskinesia in later stages of Parkinson's disease (PD) are caused by pharmacokinetic as well as pharmacodynamic factors, intermittent dopaminergic stimulation being one of the most important. In the healthy brain, dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta fire tonically at a steady rate of about 4 cycles\/second. In later stages of PD, steady firing is replaced by pulsatile stimulation which causes molecular and physiologic changes in the basal ganglia. Continuous dopaminergic stimulation has been shown to dramatically improve motor fluctuations and dyskinesia by modifications of oral treatment (dopamine agonists, smaller, more frequent levodopa doses, controlled-release formulation of levodopa, addition of agents that slow down the catabolism of dopamine, such as inhibitors of catechol-O-methyl transferase and monoamine oxidase), transdermal delivery (rotigotine), infusion therapies (intravenous levodopa, subcutaneous application of apomorphine and lisuride, duodenal infusion of levodopa) and deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus.","2140":"Zolpidem is a non-benzodiazepine property which binds selectively to the ?1-GABAA receptors, and has been widely prescribed to patients suffering from insomnia. We report two cases of zolpidem dependence with withdrawal seizure in the Asian population. The first case is a 43-year-old woman who took zolpidem up to the dosage of 200 to 400 mg per night. The second case is a 35-year-old woman who even began to take zolpidem every 15 to 30 minutes to get euphoric and relaxed, and she gradually increased the dosage to 400 to 500mg per day. After abrupt discontinuation of zolpidem, both cases immediately developed anxiety, global insomnia, restlessness, and tonic seizure. The purpose of this case report is to suggest that clinicians should pay close attention to the potential of zolpidem tolerance, abuse and dependence. The possibility of withdrawal seizure cannot be excluded especially at high doses.","2141":"Dermatitis artefacta is a disease that occurs as a result of a self-inflicted injury to the skin. The problem quite often is undiagnosed for a long time until the clinical look of bizarre skin lesions combined with non-specific histology and normal blood tests lead to the final identification. This report presents the case of a 62-year-old man who was diagnosed after 10 years of duration of disease. We discuss the reasons for such behavior and the possibilities of dermatological and general interventions.","2142":"Stalking behaviour may find its roots in an individual's psychological development and culture-related factors that facilitate it. Psychiatric disorders may underlie some stalking cases, but no reports exist of the relationship of actual psychiatric status with the expression of stalking behaviour. A 22-year-old adoptive woman perpetrated stalking towards her gynaecologist, who took legal action to protect herself. She was admitted to a general hospital psychiatric department and diagnosed with bipolar disorder-I, manic phase, and personality disorder, not otherwise specified. She was prescribed lithium and valproate combination and followed-up as an outpatient. She underwent cognitive-behavioural therapy incorporating Bowlby's concepts. Stalking behaviour did not reemerge. Exacerbations of psychiatric episodes may trigger stalking behaviour. Drug treatment may prevent its clinical expression, but underlying ideation and affect may need long-term psychotherapy focusing on attachment. ","2143":null,"2144":"Polypharmacy in psychiatry is becoming the rule rather than the exception. Using more drugs at same time usually occurs where single drugs are considered insufficiently effective. The sample consisted of 216 patients: 85 from Sarajevo, and 44 and 87 respectively from Mostar and Tuzla. All schizophrenic patients who were hospitalised in three University Centers of F\/BiH (Sarajevo, Tuzla, Mostar) on a particular day are included in the study. This included patients of both sexes (131 (60.65%) males and 85 females (39.35%)), 20-60 ages, who were on antipsychotic treatment with an established diagnosis of schizophrenia by the treating psychiatrist. The research was performed in the year 2004. The census of patients was conducted simultaneously in all three Centers, using a questionnaire in which all routine prescribed antipsychotics were registered, as the common method of the administration, and the doses as well saving as data for other medications that were simultaneously prescribed to the patients that day. Within the total sample the most frequently applied classical antipsychotics were haloperidol, promazine and from the group of new antipsychotics clozapine. The most frequently used other medications were biperidine and diazepam. The administration of all medication was followed through recording of individual doses, daily doses and frequency of administration. There are statistically significant differences regarding the frequency of biperidine use between the centers (p=0.008). In three University Clinical Centers of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Sarajevo, Tuzla and Mostar), the applied rule is that more drugs in the treatment of schizophrenic psychosis and doing polypharmacy is the inevitable approach to treatment. The concept behind the polypharmacy is based on the fact that antipsychotic drugs do not cover all the symptoms of schizophrenic psychosis, and that additional medications may correct iatrogenic side effects caused by antipsychotic drugs. It is expected that the new atypical antipsychotics will treat much broader symptoms of psychosis and will not cause extrapyramidal side effects, as do the typical antipsychotics. ","2145":"As a result of long-term heroin abuse we can see impairment of cerebral structures, that leads to specific psychopathological and neuro - physiological deficits in the cognitive and connative areas. There is a positive correlation between the mentioned deficits and the duration of heroin abuse. The memory is a cognitive function highly sensitive to toxic effects of opiates. The aim of this study was to establish the psychiatric and psychological consequences of heroin abuse, in the sense of verbal memory deficits, and the specific relation between mentioned deficits with the duration of abuse. The research was devised as a prospective study, including ninety heroin addicts, divided into three groups, based on the abuse duration. The following instruments were used for data collecting: questionnaire, with basic social-demographic and addictive characteristics of subjects and Rey Test of Verbal Learning, a neuropsychological test for verbal memory estimation. Only the examinees who have abused heroin for less than a year obtained scores within the domain of the expected performances within the part of the test which relates to the direct verbal memory, as well as, the part of the test that relates to delayed verbal memory. With regard to the mentioned criteria, the difference between examinees with different length of opiates abuse is statistically important (direct memory: F=2.706; p=0.063, delayed memory: F=2.538; p=0.045). With the increase of heroin abuse length the number of examinees with a rising learning curve is decreased significantly, and the number of examinees with a flat learning curve is increased (Chi-square=19.589; p=0.003). Heroin abuse, lasting longer than one year, is connected with impairment of short-term and delayed verbal memory. The intensity of the mentioned effects is higher with addicts who use a higher daily dose of heroin. ","2146":"The purpose of the study was to research gender differences in suicides committed in Podgorica between 2000 and 2006, including sociodemographic variables (e.g. age, marital status, education etc.), methods of and motives for committing suicide. Data were taken from the Police Directorate of Montenegro. We used data on 220 males and 83 females who committed suicide. Statistical analysis was done by using the crude specific rate. Significance between two independent crude rates is constructed around their 95% confidence intervals and it utilizes the difference between the two rates (D) to determine significance. The incidence of suicide in males was found to be higher than in females (the male to female suicide ratio is 2.6 to 1). Females were older than males. Females had completed elementary education more frequently , and they were single or divorced or widows. Males had completed secondary education more frequently and they were married. The most frequent employment status of both gender groups implied pensioner and unemployment statuses. There was a significant difference in suicide rates between the genders during the reporting period. Suicide rates increase with age in both genders. Males chose firearms, hanging, strangulation and suffocation and jumping. Females chose hanging, strangulation and suffocation, jumping and drowning as the most frequent methods of suicide. The most frequent motive for suicide in both gender groups was physical illness. The second most frequent motive was mental illness. Emotional and financial difficulties were motives which were more common in males, whereas family problems appeared to be motives two times more frequent in females. The complex multifactorial etiology of suicide suggests the need to consider gender differences when developing effective strategies for the therapy and the prevention of suicide.

Impulsive behaviours were assessed upon hospital admission, discharge, and three and six months after, using the internal ward questionnaire. Aggression and impulsivity traits were evaluated three months after discharge using Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory and Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, 11th Revision. In all patients, the expressed impulsive behaviours were most frequent upon admission, when bingeing, striking and quarrelling were more expressed in bulimic patients. Later, patient groups did not differ regarding any impulsive behaviour. These all substantially resolved till discharge, and showed further decline at later assessments. All patients had a higher level of aggression and impulsivity traits and lower overt and higher covert aggression than controls. Patient groups had similar within group distribution of aggression and impulsivity intensity levels. Regarding individual dimensions of these traits no difference was found between them, except for the higher level of suspiciousness in anorectic individuals. Purgative anorectic and bulimic patients show similar dynamics of impulsive behaviours which substantially decline over time-course of eating disorder treatment. They both present similarly heightened levels of aggression and impulsivity traits, with some minor differences regarding their individual dimensions, possibly reflecting higher overt aggression in bulimic and higher covert aggression in anorectic patients. ","2149":"In the past, the first goal of bipolar disorder treatment was the reduction of symptoms of mania or depression, rather than the recovery of social functioning. Recently, as a result of an increased emphasis on patient needs, the concept of quality of life (QoL) has been brought into the treatment of physical illnesses. The purpose of the present study was to examine QoL data in patients with bipolar disorder in clinical remission and to determine the extent of the effects of demographic and clinical data on QoL in these patients. The second aim was to compare the QoL data of these patients to that of patients with schizophrenia in clinical remission and to that of healthy controls. Data were obtained using a QoL questionnaire (Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire, or Q-LES-Q) for 41 bipolar patients in clinical remission. The data were then compared with the data of 40 schizophrenic patients in clinical remission and with 40 healthy controls. There were higher mean scores in most Q-LES-Q summary scales in the bipolar patients than in the schizophrenic patients. There were higher mean scores in the bipolar patients in some summary scales than in the healthy controls. Our results suggest the same or higher subjective QoL in bipolar patients in clinical remission in comparison with healthy controls and higher subjective QoL in bipolar patients in clinical remission than in schizophrenic patients in clinical remission.

This article discusses chronobiological aspects of psychiatric treatment, particularly related to depression. It is concerned with chronotherapeutics and pharmacological interventions to resychronize circadian rhythms, particularly focused on agomelatine, an innovative antidepressant targeting melatonergic M1\/M2 and serotonergic 5-HT2c receptors. Depression can be explained as dysfunction at the nexus of the body, brain and mind, three mutually very dependent components, associated through circadian pace makers at the molecular, cellular, physiological and behavioral levels. Mental disorders, particularly depression, are common in people with circadian rest-activity cycle disturbances and sleep-wake problems. The circadian rest-activity and sleep-wake cycle disturbances are risk factors for developing and recurrence of mental disorders as well as, what is very important, they are associated with worse outcome. The interrelationships between circadian rhythm disturbances and depression is very complex, and the fundamental question is whether they trigger depression or whether these disturbances arise as a consequence of the disease. However, both depression and circadian rhythm disturbances may have a common aetiology: a decreased cellurar resilience associated with lower resistance to stressful events. Treating depression pharmacologicaly through the restoration of circadian rhythms may open a new era of superior management of depression and other mental disorders. Chronotherapeutic strategies that reset the internal clock may have specific advantage for the treatment of depression and other mental disorders. There is still a lot of research to be done on utilising chronotherapeutic principles in clinical practice, particularly regarding the specific indications. Agomelatine seems to be an promising resynchronizing agent expanding the field of chronopharmacology and inducing new treatment strategy.

A single HF-rTMS session selectively influenced the processing of positively and negatively valenced baby faces. In essence, our results indicate that the effects of one left-sided HF-rTMS sessions results in improved processing of positive emotions and reduced negative emotional processing in never depressed female subjects.","2158":"Research on DBS for psychiatric disorders is being carried out in several areas, including obsessive- compulsive disorder, major depression, addictions, Tourette's syndrome and eating disorders.

The study was carried out in Federal Neuropsychiatric Hospital Enugu (FNPHE) and in a Private Psychiatrist's Office (PPO) in Enugu, South East Nigeria. 94 patients were recruited to take part in the study. 49 patients were included from the FNPHE and 45 patients from the PPO. The two groups of patients differed only in terms of mood at study entry. Patients were included in the study if they had been diagnosed bipolar, if they were attending the FNPHE as outpatients, inpatients or were receiving emergency treatment or if they were attending the PPO for follow-up and if they had given their consent to participate in the study. The patients responded to a structured questionnaire used to elicit demographic and diagnostic characteristics. This questionnaire was administered by one of the authors (EJ). Each patient was also interviewed with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) for Bipolar Disorder Studies version 5.0.0. This MINI assessment was done by (MO). All the data were collected in a specially prepared data collection form. The demographic factors reported on included gender, age, marital status, level of education and employment status. The reported diagnostic and illness characteristics included age at onset of illness, mood at study entry and mood at onset of illness. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 11.5. Frequencies were run on demographic characteristics while means and standard deviations were calculated for continuous variables. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the FNPHE. the majority of the sample (68.1%) met the criteria for bipolar I disorder.

Despite appropriate medication, about 1\/4 of patients suffer for refractory positive and\/or negative symptoms, which are associated with functional handicap, increase of duration and of the number of hospitalizations. Numerous studies have suggested that the pathophysiology of auditory hallucinations (AH) is related to a hyper activity of the left temporoparietal cortex (TPC). On the other hand, negative symptoms are associated with a prefrontal hypoactivity and the efficiency of pharmacological treatments is frequently partial. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation tool with excellent tolerability and safety. Given its hypothesized mechanisms of action and the clinical beneficial effects obtained in several types of pathology (Aleman et al. 2007), the efficacy of rTMS has been investigated for drug-resistant SCH symptoms. our objective is to expose the knowledge concerning the rTMS use in the treatment of these symptoms and to purpose a critical analysis of these data. a systematic review of the literature has been conducted using NIH Pubmed. The following search terms were used: TMS - rTMS - Schizophrenia - negative symptoms - hallucinations. concerning the treatment of AH, 16 publications and 4 meta analyses were selected. For the negative symptoms, we retained 16 studies and 3 meta analyses. The most extensively investigated application for rTMS in SCH is the use of low-frequency stimulation to the left TPC with the aim to improve AH symptomatology. When compared to sham, this type of acute course of rTMS has been proven to induce a substantial and significant reduction in AH. But this effect does not seem long-lasting and maintenance protocols must be developed. Concerning negative symptoms, the results are less solid but we find some works which demonstrate an improvement of these symptoms while various stimulation parameters were used. Recently, new parameters of stimulation in particular the theta burst stimulation have permitted us to obtain larger effects with longer duration. The interest of these new parameters will be discussed here. overall, rTMS studies have demonstrated some promise in the treatment of SCH. However, more research is required to enhance rTMS efficacy and increase its beneficial effect duration and to test new therapeutic strategies in this topic.

Old age depression may also occur after life events: the death of the significant other, economical reasons, health problems (neurological and\/or cardiovascular diseases, arthritis, cancer, nutritional deficiency) and can develop into a depressive state. Old age depression is often mistreated, or undertreated, and also underdiagnosed, and this for several reasons: older people reduce their social relations, depression very often presents as a comorbidity with organic diseases (that cover and mask depressive symptoms); finally,the patient may believe that a depressive state is a normal course of life in older people. Recovering from depression is really feasible both in young\/adults and in old people, but in older people we can find a higher frequency of admission to hospital, or mortality or suicidality. The depressive symptoms in old age depression is similar to those in adults, however the following aspects require special care, in order to ensure a correct diagnosis despite the presence of comorbidities: - the mood: in contrast with the young and adult, old people often do not complain about their low mood; - the psychotic simptoms: hypocondriacal and psychotic, including hallucinatory symptoms are often present; - the anxiety symptoms: these are often present together with neuro-sensory symptoms; - the somatic symptoms: the comorbidity with organic diseases can mask and overlap the depressive state; - reduction of congnitive functioning: in these cases, which are quite frequent, it is essential to make a differential diagnosis from \"pseudodementia\" and \"dementia\". In conclusion, several factors contribute to the onset of depression in old age, so that we can assert that it is a really a multifactorial disease.","2171":"cooncurrent alcohol and tobacco dependency appears to be a common phenomenon yet medical literature often focuses on only one substance at a time when examining the question of withdrawal and illustrates that the evaluation of tobacco consumption appears to be overlooked in psychiatry. in this study, we analyse perceptions among first-year postgraduates in Psychiatry, before and after training in Motivational Interviewing, with regard to the idea of suggesting that patients might consider simultaneous dual alcohol-tobacco withdrawal. the trend is to disregard the systematic history of substance consumption and to not recommend concurrent alcohol-tobacco withdrawal. Motivational interview training tends to reverse this trend. the lessening of the therapist's feeling of powerlessness in the face of relapse is one of the explanatory factors behind this change of approach. A study design is proposed focusing on the patient's perceptions. guidelines concerning dual alcohol-tobacco withdrawal programs are to be developed.

In the F32 and F33 group just over a third of the patients (35.8% and 37.1%) were on augmentation therapy and in the F41.2 group over a half of patients (56.7%) were on augmentation therapy. There does seem to be a relationship between the number of risk factors a patient has and the likelihood that they are on augmentation.

They should learn to investigate and treat the sexual dysfunctions while assessing and treating the depression symptoms. Moreover they must be aware about the sexual adverse effects of many commonly used antidepressants drugs, especially SSRIs. the multi factorial origin of both depression and sexual dysfunctions suggests that the right approach and treatment of the depressed patient includes not only the prescription of an antidepressant but also a global approach based on several axis that are concomitants namely: physiological, cognitive, emotional, behavioural and relational factors.

Early- onset depression has been mainly correlated to a family history of depression while late-onset depression has been principally correlated to vascular dysfunction. The same cortical and sub-cortical areas are involved in both types of depression. However, lesions in these brain areas and cognitive impairment are most pronounced in late-onset depression. Based on these observations we propose a common neuroanatomical substrate but different pathophysiological processes implicated in these two types of depression.","2176":null,"2177":"In the following article CAPRI presents its current research projects. The team leaders were asked to present and summarize the project they had been working on. The fields in which research was conducted are: Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Cognitive and Psychomotor Dysfunctions in Schizophrenia, fMRI in Schizophrenia, Cognitive and Psychomotor Dysfunctions in Major Depressive Disorder, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Addiction Medicine and Forensic Psychiatry. An overview of recent and ongoing research projects is provided and the main results are summarized. ","2178":"The Early Intervention Centre (First episode clinic, FEC) that provides specific service programs to this particular target group of patients with early psychosis opened in November 2000 as a day clinic at the Moscow Research Institute of Psychiatry. To date, FEC programs consistent with the developed model have been established in 30 regions across Russia. 5-year follow-up data are available for 114 patients who received such care in the FEC. In more than 30% of cases complete remission was maintained over the 5 years. The number of relapses increased on the 2nd and 3rd years, but later decreased more than by one half. The relapses were mostly treated in day clinic or outpatient settings and did not require hospital admissions. More than 73% of the patients maintained their social achievements with no losses. By the end of the 5th year only 1\/5 of the cases were formally recognized as unemployable due to psychiatric disability. Significantly better clinical and psychosocial outcomes have been shown in comparison with a control group of patients, treated in routine psychiatric services.","2179":"Outpatients with psychosis who attended long term psychotherapeutic groups were evaluated regarding their quality of life and attitude towards medication with self-report questionnaires. The DAI-10, Quality of life Brief questionnaires and clinical observation were used for evaluation. Most of the patients' participation in group therapy was rated as satisfactory or very productive by their group therapist. More than half of our patients rated the group therapy's influence on their life as important; only three of them noticed no importance of the group therapy on their life. The sample may be too small to show a statistically significant correlation between participation in the group and time spent in group therapy and attitude towards medication.","2180":null,"2181":"early Intervention in Psychosis (EI) was introduced into the British NHS as a result of the NHS Plan, about eleven years ago. The intention was to provide thebest possible care or patients with a first episode of psychosis. Recently however, long term studies over five years have suggested that early gains may be lost. we wished to establish whether our own group of patients who had received Early Intervention continued over six years to have better outcomes than patients treated in Community Mental Health Teams. To do this we analysed statistically the data on the readmissions and bed days used by our patients over the first six years of illness. We found that patients, both in the whole two groups and in different sub-groups appeared to demonstrate a number of advantages, not always statistically significant, in favour of the EI treated team. in many cases, the small size of the samples may have impeded us observing statistically significant differences, however, in general, it appeared that there were a number of advantages in favour of the EI treated team. our study, though small, does appear to support the view that Early Intervention Services do improve outcomes and that some of the improvement may endure after the patient leaves EI services. Much larger studies ae however required. ","2182":"Sexual dysfunctions as side effects of antidepressant treatments are being reported more and more frequently: they are one of the main reasons of dropout from therapy. These side effects are reported in between 20% and 40% of cases. The aim of this study is to highlight, following the actual evidence from the field of psychopharmacology, how these side effects may not be directly related to the antidepressant treatment; on the contrary we show that, following the observational clinical data obtained in our Mental Health Dept., a careful clinical interview about the sexual behaviour of the patients allows psychotherapy to interact with pharmacotherapy, in order to reduce the drug dosage, or replace it with another drug, and\/or to combine an erectile dysfunction treatment with the psychopharmacological therapy. This careful clinical interview about the sexual behavior of the patients will more clearly determine the percentages of sexual dysfunction side effects, and also avoid drop-out from antidepressant therapy.","2183":"in recent years there has been a general move towards treating depressed patients in the community if at all possible. One factor that may reduce the likelihood of discharge from secondary care is suicidality (Butler et al. 2010). The aim of this audit was to identify factors associated with continued suicidality among patients in a CMHT. we searched an anonymised database of patients and identified all those with previously documented suicidal thoughts or attempts. We also noted the presence of factors such as alcohol problems, drug problems, augmentation therapy and 'other risk' factors (e.g. financial problems or homelessness). We then looked at clinical notes to find out whether or not, according to the latest clinic letter, patients were still reporting suicidality. This facilitated comparison of the aforementioned factors between the group of patients in which suicidality was still present (group N) and the group of patients in which suicidality was no longer a feature (group Y). of the 56 patients with suicidal thoughts or attempts there were 44 in group N (79%) and 12 in group Y (21%). Overall, alcohol problems, drug problems and 'other' risk factors were proportionally more common among group Y than group N, although sometimes the difference was marginal. Conversely, the percentage of patients on augmentation therapy was greater in group N than group Y. When considering individual diagnostic categories the above trends generally stood for the F32 category, although not necessarily for the F33 category. the audit provides an insight into the sorts of factors that might influence outcomes among depressed patients. However, there are limitations to the audit such as small sample size and lack of a fixed follow-up period. Although the results are suggestive, it is difficult to make firm conclusions about patient outcomes on the basis of this data. The audit provides a useful starting point, especially in considering the treatment of patients within the BECMHT. However, further research on a wider scale is required before more general conclusions can be made about factors influencing response to treatment among depressed patients. ","2184":"there are now many existing studies which assess the treatments available for 'at risk mental states', as patients who are believed to be in the prodromal phase of psychotic illness are referred to. However, concerns regarding side effects of possible treatments remain. We here conduct a meta-analysis of the studies available up to October 2010. The aim of this study is to decide what would be the best treatment for 'at high risk patients'. all the available studies examining potential treatments during the prodromal phase of psychotic illness were collected. They all showed comparable efficacy, which reached statistical significance, excluding the one study using olanzapine, which in fact 'tended towards significance'. treatments appear promising but a balance needs to be kept between adverse events and effectiveness of preventing psychosis. it is necessary to search further for treatments in order to identify effective treatments with fewer adverse side effects in this phase of psychotic illness. ","2185":"We describe a patient with Schizophrenia and secondary enuresis. The enuresis settled with resolution of his psychotic symptoms but later remerged after starting Clozapine. We explore the mechanisms of incontinence in Schizophrenia and those due to Clozapine. This case highlights the need to inquire about incontinence in patients with schizophrenia prior to prescribing clozapine.","2186":"clinicians have long noticed a correlation between physiological markers of inflammation and depression. The best-known example is the activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and cortisol secretion; however more recent studies have demonstrated increased salivary prostaglandins and plasma acute phase proteins in depressed patients. To date four randomised controlled trials have used celecoxib or rofecoxib as adjuncts to serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors in the treatment of depression. These suggested a statistically significant decrease in depressive symptoms in the patients taking NSAIDs and SSRIs, compared to patients taking SSRIs alone. Interpretation of these results is limited by the small sample size and short duration of these preliminary studies. The research only considers depressed patients receiving treatment in secondary care; no study has examined the effectiveness of NSAIDs as an adjunct in primary care, even though most cases of depression in the UK are managed in the community by general practitioners. we propose a multi-centre double-blinded randomised controlled trial with two objectives: to determine whether citalopram plus celecoxib dual therapy achieves a greater reduction in depressive symptoms (quantified using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS)) within four weeks, compared to citalopram monotherapy; and to determine whether citalopram plus celecoxib dual therapy is more likely to achieve remission (HDRS score ?7) of moderate to severe depression within six months, compared with citalopram monotherapy. The endpoints will be the reduction in HDRS score after 4 weeks of treatment, and the HDRS score after 26 weeks of treatment. The study will enrol 452 participants from general practices who have a moderate or severe, current or recurrent major depressive episode when medication with an SSRI is considered. The study population will be stratified according to age, sex, HDRS score, age of onset of first episode, number of previous depressive episodes and duration of current episode. The population will then be randomised into two groups. Subjects will be interviewed to determine HDRS score, measure blood pressure, count pills and discuss side-effects. This will occur weekly for the first four weeks, and every four weeks thereafter. ","2187":"a Metanalysis by Cipriani recently showed that certain antidepressants were more effective and better tolerated than others. We wished to see whether these findings were reflected in the outcomes of depression treatment in our Community Mental Health Team (CMHT). we related medication choice and dosage range to outcomes of treatment as reflected by discharge rates and suicidality. in this paper we emphasize the relationship of Dose Range to outcome. Our results are in accord with those of Cipriani. We note that Prescription of 'the four' was associated with a greater percentage of patients discharged from the clinic than 'the others'. Sertraline was the antidepressant most likely to reduce suicidality in our sample. For patients with unipolar depression, discharge rates were higher when they were prescribed one of the four medications indicated by Cipriani and highest when prescribed escitalopram. For patients who also had other indications, discharge rates were higher for the group other than the four antidepressants identified by Cipriani and highest for fluoxetine. Regarding Dose Ranges, we note that wheras many patients had their dosage titrated upwards from the starting dose, most did not have the dosage titrated to the highest dose of the relevant medication. it does appear that the antidepressants identified by Cipriani are effective compared with other monotherapies. Medication doses need to be optimised in order to achieve optimal treatment in Depression. Our results suggest that co-morbid undiagnosed other mental illness may often be a cause of 'resistant depression'. We recommend that all CMHTs should carry out audits of their prescribing practice in order to optimise treatment outcomes. ","2188":"guidelines are important to the effective implementation of modern psychiatry. review Article, using various sources. the writer's own experience of drafting guidelines is drawn upon, while pubmed articles have been searched on how to implement guidelines. the utility of guidelines are discussed and the relationship of guidelines to audit is explained. guidelines need to be effectively researched in order to have credibility; they need to be properly implemented in order to achieve desired improvement in practice and their implementation needs to be audited. ","2189":"there is a need for outcome measurement in Psychiatry. a literature Review was carried out. a number of different methods for outcome measurement were identified; their depended on the aims of the outcome measurements, hence functional outcomes of services could be measured,including mumbers of patients returned to employment or education. Some tools could measure administrative outcomes of service; these include HONOS and HONOS-pbr, while symptom rating scales, some of which could be used by patients and some by clinicians would be used with individual patients to measure patient improvement. Recovery tools included measures of patient understanding and empowerment. these different forms of outcome measurement are complementary, not mutually exclusive. a range of outcome measures should be used in services, since all the above approaches complement each other. This methodology will give a global assessment of the efficacy of a mental health service in the real world. ","2190":"bipolar disorder is frequently misdiagnosed or diagnosed late. Misdiagnosis of Bipolar Disorder can have serious implications for prognosis and treatment of this condition. patients in a Community Mental Health Team were systematically screened for Bipolar Disorder. There was a substantial increase in the number of bipolar patients diagnosed in the Community Mental Health Team. the frequent misdiagnosis of Bipolar II disorder frequently leads to the treatment of these patients with anti-depressants only.This leads to the possibility of patients becoming elated in mood, or going into mixed states, which can lead to increased suicidality. appropriate diagnosis of bipolar II disorder requires skills at present found in secondary care. Such patients should therefore be referred to secondary care. Both Primary and Secondary care should be more aware of this diagnosis and its consequences. ","2191":"depression has a significant prevalence in patients following a stroke. Studies have found rates to be between 25-54%. Within this audit we aimed to ascertain the proportion of patients who have been identified as having depression, and explore the methods employed to identify depressed patients. We also looked to assess the number of these patients who have been treated for depression and to explore the medications used for the treatment of depression. this audit was conducted in two phases. Initially an audit was conducted to establish the current prevalence, screening and management of depression in post-stroke patients. Following this, we introduced the PHQ-9 as a screening tool for depression and a re-audited at four months. In phase 2, All patients admitted to the stoke ward in Bedford hospital between 10\/9\/09 and 13\/12\/09 were included in the audit. Patients were screened for depression using the PHQ-9 questionnaire two weeks after admission. the incidence of depression within the phase one group was 28%. In 9 of these cases there was no record of mood assessment or diagnosis of depression in the medical notes. Thirteen out of 60 patients were prescribed psychotropic agents during their stay. In phase 2, Of the 18 patients screened, 10 patients (56%) scored 5 or above, which according to the scoring system of the PHQ-9 is indicative of depression. One patient scored 10 indicative of moderate depression and one patient scored 19 indicative of moderately severe depression. phase 1 of this audit revealed that there was no formal screening tool in use to identify depression in post stroke patients. Consequently we found the prevalence to be 28%. This correlates with the lower end of the rate expected within this group according to the literature. As no screening tool was being used, practice was not in accordance with the standards set by NICE guidelines. This led us to introduce the PHQ-9 screening tool in phase 2. Following this, we found the prevalence of depression had increased from 28% to 56%. these results highlight the importance of formal screening in order to reliably identify patients who have signs of depression. ","2192":"the UK has one of the highest rates of self harm in Europe, around 400 per 100,000 people (Horrocks et al. 2002). It accounts for 150,000 attendances to the Emergency department each year and is one of the top five causes of acute medical admissions in the UK (NICE 2002). objectives included to explore the method of self harm and the demographic factors of those presenting the Emergency department with self harm. In addition we wanted to review the exploration of suicide risk factors and suicide intent by the Emergency department doctor and ascertain whether a psychiatric assessment with full mental state examination had been conducted with referral to psychiatric services if deemed necessary. We wanted to explore the current practice around self harm presentations in the Emergency department accordance with NICE guidelines. data was collected retrospectively from February to August 2009. Twenty-five sets of medical notes were collated at random for patients who had presented with self harm to the Emergency department. Notes were reviewed for evidence of exploration of the event, psychiatric assessment, risk factors for suicide and further referral. 14 of the 25 patients presented having taken an overdose. 9 had inflicted some other form of self injury, namely lacerations to self. In 2 cases a mixed presentation was found. Previous psychiatric history was documented in 16 cases. 11 had a previous history of depression or anxiety disorder; 1 was known to have bipolar affective disorder; 1 was diagnosed in the past with borderline personality disorder; and 3 patients had no previous history. In 9 cases previous history was not documented. twenty-five sets of medical notes were reviewed from February to August 2009 for individuals presenting to the Emergency department with self harm. Of those, 12 fell into the over 25 age group. 17 were female and 8 were male. The majority of patients were of white British ethnicity. 14 had taken an overdose; 9 had inflicted some other form of self injury; and 2 had a mixed presentation. Suicide risk factors and suicidal intent was poorly documented with mental state examination found not to be documented in all 25 cases reviewed. 18 were deemed medically fit in the Emergency department and were referred for psychiatric review. These unfortunate findings may be a reflection on the time pressures faced by Emergency department doctors, namely the four hour targets, and perhaps lack of adequate training in psychosocial risk assessment. With such poor documentation made by the Emergency department doctors, a proforma was produced which incorporates suicide risk factors and assessment of suicide intent in addition to a brief version of the mental state examination. concerns have been raised by the recent Royal College of Psychiatrists report on self harm, that current level of care provided to service users fall short of the standards set out in policies and guidelines, with poor assessments, unskilled staff and insufficient care pathways (Royal College of Psychiatrists. Report CR 158. 2010). Indeed evidence suggest that appropriate training and intervention given to A&amp;E staff can lead to improvements in the quality of psychosocial assessment of patients with deliberate self harm (Crawford et al. 1998). ","2193":"the mental Health Assessment Unit (MHAU) is a unit set up in 2009 as a gateway between community services and in-patient services. The aim of the MHAU is to provide an acute setting in which to assess patients within 72 hours, with the view to reducing in-patient hospital admissions. to ascertain the number of referrals made to the MHAU and admissions during a one month period. The presentation and length of stay was investigated and the diagnosis and follow up plans made were explored. data was collated from a one month period, from the 1st June to 2nd July 2010 inclusive. Crisis and home treatment team (CRHT) notes, medical notes and nursing notes were reviewed. 100 referrals were made to the MHAU; 48 patients were admitted. 25 patients had care coordinators. Despite this, in the majority of cases the source of referral was through the Emergency Department. There was a range of presenting complaints ranged and diagnoses included a wide variety of nature and severity. Average length of stay was 2 nights. Patients deemed to require in-patient management had shorter length of stay with swift transfer to treatment units. Shorter stays were also associated with milder degrees of illness. Longer length of stay was associated with more complex illness. 37 patients were discharged home from the MHAU, 8 were transferred to in-patient treatment units and 3 were transferred to in-patient units elsewhere. The majority of patients discharged home were followed up by the CRHT. 5 patients were admitted to the MHAU more than once. 4 were admitted twice, and one was admitted three times. 4 of these patients were discharged home but one was admitted to in-patient unit on his second admission. This may represent a subgroup of more complex patients. we recommend further study into patients' experiences with care coordinators particularly at times of need. We also plan to re-audit for a longer time frame with the view to compare data to in-patient admissions and bed occupancy. ","2194":"shared or Collaborative Care in the treatment of Depression is an evidence based intervention which has been shown to be more effective than ordinary general Practitioner care in the treatment of Depression, however, it is not yet Government policy in the United Kingdom. We aimed to bring together in one place all the studies which have been carried out, up till mid 2009, in order to demonstrate the evidence that shared collaborative care has important advantages in terms both of depression outcomes and cost benefits, in order to argue for the adoption of this approach in the United Kingdom and n Europe. we carried out a literature search using PUBMED in order to identify and describe all trials, systematic reviews and Metanalyses which have been carried out on shared care until mid 2009. We also described a shared care service for depression which some of us had been involved in developing and working in in Luton in the late 1990's. We have excluded papers which describe trials which have not yet been carried out, and instead focussed on the trials which have reported. it has been demonstrated in numerous recent studies that shared care in the treatment of depression, which includes the training of General Practitoners in the treatment of depression, and the provision in Primary Care of a Nurse specialist or another professional who will impart psycho-education, ensure concordance with medication, and may provide psychotherapy, leads to both improved treatment outcomes and increased doctor and patient satisfaction, as well providing some cost-benefits, despite somewhat increased immediate costs. This is the case in both adult and adolescent patients, while in the case of diabetic patients depression is improved, despite the lack of improvement in glycaemic control. The shared care intervention continues to be useful in the case of patients with resistant depressive symptoms, though a longer input will be necessary in such cases. Patients with subthreshold depression will not benefit as much, and patients expressed more satisfaction when psychological interventions were offered. It is also the case that collaborative or shared care is effective in treating depression in the elderly. This is shown by studies which include older patients who also suffer from multiple health conditions, arthritis, diabetes, anxiety and PTSD, the poorer, those with suicidal ideation, and also in Ethnic Minorities. The results described above are mostly based on studies carried out in the USA, but similar studies have been reported from the United Kingdom, and are consistent with the experience of the service in Luton which we describe. From these results it would seem important that shared, collaborative care, with primary and secondary care doctors (General Practitioners and Psychiatrists) working as part of a single team, with the help of mental health practitioners attached to primary care, but with easy access to secondary care is a productive way of optimising the treatment of depression. In the UK, however, it has not yet been possible to develop such a service for the whole population. This is becausein the UK, General Practice is managed by Primary Care Trusts, while Secondary Care, including Psychiatry, is managed by Mental Health Trusts. This has led the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence, and indeed local commissioners of care to focus on a Stepped Model for the treatment of depression, with one key issue being access (or referral) to secondary care, and discharge back to primary care, with a group of Mental Health workers focussing on the facilitation (or gate-keeping) of these processes, rather than focussing on actually optimising outcomes of care. the evidence argues for the development of collaborative care between primary and secondary care for the treatment of Depression. This will require common medication guidelines across both Primary and Secondary Care, easy access so that General Practitioners can receive advice from Psychiatrists about patients, and the use of Mental Health Professionals to provide patients with psycho-education, support of concordance with treatment, and psychotherapy. It may be that, in order for this to be achieved, services may need to be re-structured, to allow easy communication between professionals. ","2195":"there is a public health issue regarding the correct diagnosis of BSD: these diseases are often underreferred, underdiagnosed and undertreated\/mistreated. To fail to treat BSD may result in serious complications (loss of work, relationship crisis, substance-abuse, suicide, rapes, etc). In order to correctly diagnose Bipolar Spectrum Mood Disorders, it is important to know the patient's premorbid personality and past history: it is essential to know the longitudinal history and the full family history. 423 patients, who were recruited and assessed over six years have been reassessed to demonstrate their temperaments, as these emerge from their personal anamnesis. more patients within the series appear to have a soft bipolar illness than a major unipolar depression; the depressive episodes are now considered as only one phase of the bipolar spectrum. Furthermore, every patient with bipolar spectrum disorder already presented in their personal history of the illness a sub-clinical evidence of one of the temperaments (hyperthymic temper.: 35%; cyclothymic temper.: 49%; depressive temper.: 16%). the different temperaments are described, and their significance elucidated. the subthreshold presence of the temperaments in the history of the patients with bipolar spectrum disorders leads us to consider this to be an important method of early diagnosis of bipolar spectrum mood disorders.

Psychological camp recommending that \"psychological disorders\" require psychological treatments, whilst biological camp argued for biological treatment for \"biological disorders\". Here, I will provide emerging evidence that both forms of treatments have similar underlying neurobiological basis. Beginning at the molecular level, the fields of gene expression, functional genomics, epigenetics have become increasingly important in expanding our knowledge and providing an understanding of the mechanisms that are likely to be involved in changes that occur as result of psychological treatments. Understanding the biological basis of memory systems that include, the concepts of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) through which synaptic plasticity is thought to occur go some way towards explaining how various psychotherapies modify memories and learning in a positive way. Finally various neuroimaging studies have provided a further insight in to the neural changes occurring as a result of psychological treatments.","2198":"We describe the increasing prevalence of chronic illnesses such as obesity and type 2 diabetes have markedly increased in both developed and developing countries.

The extant literature suggests a critical need for innovative treatments targeted to individuals with comorbid diabetes and mental illness. Given the complexity and challenge of both of these disorders in tandem with the interactive challenges and burdens of psychiatric and medical comorbidity, it is essential that interventions address the issue of mental and medical health from the perspective of the individual with the disorder, engage individuals to actively participate in illness self-management, and include consideration of the multiple barriers to care.","2199":"","2200":"","2201":"Chronically institutionalized patients demonstrate a behavioral pattern characterized by unwillingness to get discharged from the hospital and severe anxiety during such attempts leading to continued hospitalization.

If a drug could alleviate a wide range of symptoms, it would be more suitable. In these disorders drug addiction is very common. This fact makes the symptoms complicated and the treatment more difficult. This study is designed to evaluate the effect of Olanzapine and Sertraline in patients suffering from personality disorders who are on methadone maintenance therapy. This study is a clinical trial. 120 males and females were chosen for methadone maintenance therapy through interview by a psychiatrist based on DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for BPD. Afterwards they were randomly divided into two groups. These groups separately received Olanzapine (5-10 mg daily) and Sertraline (50-100 mg daily) therapy. The SCL-90 questionnaire was filled by all participants before treatment and at the 4th, 8th and 12th weeks of treatment. According to this clinical trial, Olanzapine and Sertraline are effective in ameliorating symptoms of depression, anxiety and aggression, reducing sensitivity in interpersonal relationships and alleviating obsessive symptoms, pessimistic behaviors and somatization disorders in patients with personality disorders on methadone maintenance therapy. As result of this study it appears that Olanzapine and Sertraline are definitely effective in alleviating symptoms of patients with personality disorder, prescribing theses drugs are recommended for these patients.

The secondary aim is to point out the most important consequences of treatment delay. The study was conducted on 28 patients hospitalized for FEP of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder in the Psychiatry Clinic of Timisoara and Day-care center 2009. The corresponding sample of relatives consisted of 25 relatives, and the sample of health care providers of 10 general practitioners and 11 psychiatrists.

We included patients with ASD that were seen in adult psychiatric clinical settings during a 15-year period. The sample was further grouped according to the existence of a comorbid diagnosis of schizophrenia. Clinical and epidemiological features were assesed in in the whole sample, and further compared between the two groups. We identified 26 patients with first-time diagnosed ASDs. Among the 22 cases who manifested psychotic symptoms (84.6%), 16 had a concurrent diagnosis of schizophrenia (72.73%) and 6 of mood disorders (27.27%). Compared with patients with schizophrenia patients with comorbid ASDs and schizophrenia were more often men, of younger age, and more frequently developed motor side effects to antipsychotics. Adult psychiatric service users with ASDs are often misdiagnosed. This could be in part due to the fact that adult psychiatrists are not familiar with the diagnosis of ASDs. The high prevalence of psychotic symptoms in this sample is likely to depend on the specific setting of the study, i.e., that people with more severe forms of ASD than those typically followed-up in the national health service were reaching our public inpatient and private outpatient services. The high comorbidity rate between ASDs and schizophrenia could be related to shared neurobiology, but also to arbitrary restrictions imposed by current diagnostic systems.

He proposes three main bipolar dimensions of interpersonal relationships: Independence - Dependence, Connectedness - Alienation and Reciprocity - Self-absorption. The author also proposes that it is important to distinguish between two main types of adult interpersonal relationships: object and subject relations. Object relations describe relationships in which the other person is perceived as an object that serves the satisfaction of the first person's needs. Object relations are a manifestation of the right pole of the three main dimensions of interpersonal relationships (Dependence, Alienation and Self-absorption). Subject relations are a counter-pole to the concept of object relations. They describe relationships with other people who are experienced as subjects with their own wishes, interests and needs. Subject relations are a manifestation of the left pole of the main dimensions (Independence, Connectedness and Reciprocity). In this article the author specifically focuses on definitions of object relations in adulthood through a description of six sub-dimensions of object relations: Symbiotic Merging, Separation Anxiety, Social Isolation, Fear of Engulfment, Egocentrism and Narcissism.

In the domain of mental health, increasing the quality of treatment can be demonstrated through improvements of QOL of those using the mental health services.

The research data from studies on quality of life in psychiatric patients, published in Serbian medical journals from 2000 to 2009, were obtained by searching the databases Kobson and Medline. We found eight studies on QoL in psychiatric patients published in Serbian medical journals from 2000 to 2009. The reviewed articles were focused on the comparison of QoL between psychiatric patients and healthy controls, or somatic patients, the research on the relationship of QoL and general psychopathology, and the research on QoL and medical treatment. QoL in patients suffering from mental disorders, as the outcome variable, is of a paramount interest in the follow-up treatment studies in psychiatry targeting critical issues of mental illness management strategies. QoL of psychiatric patients in Serbia is still under-researched, and it would be important to measure QoL from both a patient's and observer's (i.e. family members, friends, nursing staff, mental health professionals, etc.) perspective, in the context of social, economic, and cultural background of the patient. In the future, the studies on QoL in psychiatric patients in Serbia should also rely on \"disease specific\" assessment scales, which would consider particular aspects of psychopathology, and eventually follow up longitudinal course of mental illness, treatment outcome, and recovery. ","2212":"A hundred years after psychoanalysis was introduced, neuroscience has taken a giant step forward. It seems nowadays that effects of psychotherapy could be monitored and measured by state-of-the art brain imaging techniques. Today, the psychotherapy is considered as a strategic and purposeful environmental influence intended to enhance learning. Since gene expression is regulated by environmental influences throughout life and these processes create brain architecture and influence the strength of synaptic connections, psychotherapy (as a kind of learning) should be explored in the context of aforementioned paradigm. In other words, when placing a client on the couch, therapist actually placed client's neuronal network; while listening and talking, expressing and analyzing, experiencing transference and counter transference, therapist tends to stabilize synaptic connections and influence dendritic growth by regulating gene-transcriptional activity. Therefore, we strongly believe that, in the near future, an increasing knowledge on cellular and molecular interactions and mechanisms of action of different psycho- and pharmaco-therapeutic procedures will enable us to tailor a sophisticated therapeutic approach toward a person, by combining major therapeutic strategies in psychiatry on the basis of rational goals and evidence-based therapeutic expectations.","2213":"","2214":"Humans were evolved to move. We need physical movement to remain healthy and to maintain performance. Pain limits our inborn ability to move and express ourselves. As we move less, the pain grows, immobilizing us further in a vicious cycle. Pain-including psychological pain-is experienced through the body, manifesting in physical postures, tensions, breathing patterns, etc. A holistic movement programme incorporates both physiological and psychological dimensions of the experience of pain. Our understanding of pain must take into account both the physical regulation of the body as well as the regulation of consciousness. Sport and regular movement at appropriate levels of intensity create a positive body sense and deepened body awareness. This is the basis for analyzing, managing, and transforming pain. In the treatment of chronic pain by means of therapeutic sport, functional exercise goals are complemented by awareness practices and an active attitude towards pain.","2215":"Extreme psychological and physical traumas cause dramatic symptom patterns which are insufficiently described by the psychiatric diagnostic criteria of post traumatic stress disorders (PTSD). Additionally, due to the neurobiological proximity and similarity of processing mechanisms of physical and psychological pain stimulation and extremely negative emotions, the patients often suffer from persistent pains even after the somatic healing process is completed. Epidemiological studies confirm the joint occurrence of pain and PTSD. The close relationship and the etiological and behavioral similarities of both disorders have led to the development of joined vulnerability and mutual maintenance models. The particular suffering of patients with PTSD due to chronic pain necessitates pain-therapeutic interventions. On the other hand, in chronic pain patients, the etiological role of severe traumas should be considered.","2216":"Approximately 80 per cent of primary care patients seek their physician's attention due to pain. A fifth of the population suffers from chronic pain with medium to high intensity, and longer than 3 months. Especially those patients are treated insufficiently when only non-opioids and opioids are applied. Therefore it is necessary to tailor pain therapy by using an interdisciplinary, multimodal treatment regimen. This article presents a holistic concept to chronic pain treatment by using the five columns of pain therapy. Based on the bio-psycho-social approach, pharmaceutical, complimentary (first column), physio- and psychotherapeutic (2(nd) and 3(rd) column), social and invasive interventions (4(th) and 5(th) column) have to be considered. The 1(st) column includes the WHO ladder, in chronic pain patients with a large focus on co-analgesics like antidepressants or antiepileptics. Based on the individual history and factors achieved from the bio-psycho-social diagnosis, components of these 5 therapeutic are selected, always in agreement with the patient, and put together to one interdisciplinary therapeutic concept.","2217":"Patients with severe and disabling pain and bodily distress which cannot be explained by underlying organic pathology are common in all levels of health care and are typically difficult to treat for physicians as well as for mental health specialists. Beside pain in different locations, not fully explained by specific somatic pathology, specific functional complaints such as dizziness, fatigue or vegetative disorders are common. A great proportion of patients with somatoform pain complain of comorbid depressive or anxiety disorder. Psychodynamic-interpersonal psychotherapy particularly emphasises interpersonal processes as well as disturbance of body awareness and self regulation already in childhood. Cognitive-behavioral models focus on the phenomenon of somatosensory amplification. The patients do have a strong believe in an underlying somatic illness, therefore seeking for further diagnostic and somatic therapy. This frequently leads to multiple but ineffective therapeutic attempts in the field of somatic medicine resulting in frustration of the patients and a difficult doctor-patient-relationship. General therapeutic recommendations include an active therapeutic approach with paying tribute for the patients' suffering and giving support to cope with the pain. A specific psychodynamic approach furthermore focuses on improvement of affect differentiation and the interaction of somatoform pain and interpersonal relationships.","2218":"","2219":"The main clinical feature of dementia in Parkinson's disease is a dysexecutive syndrome. The neuropathology of PD dementia (PDD) is likely multifactorial and affects several neuronal populations. There is evidence that Parkinson's disease dementia is associated with a cholinergic deficit, supporting the therapeutic role of cholinesterase inhibitors, which are already first-line agents in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The paper includes short report on a pilot study with description of cognitive and imaging profiles in patients with mild to moderate stage of Parkinson disease dementia (PDD). A random sample of 16 patients with clinical diagnostic criteria for probable PDD was included in the study. Patients were characterized with mild to moderate cognitive decline slightly depressive mood and moderate motor performance. Brain perfusion [(99m)Tc]ECD \/ SPECT and structural MRI with emphasis on evaluation of the degree of cortical atrophy and the medial temporal atrophy index was performed. All patients had detailed neuropsychological evaluation using a \"cognitive process approach\". Neuropsychological data were correlated voxel-wise with normalized brain perfusion images, creating whole-brain correlation maps. Previously reported generalized cognitive impairment in PDD with predominant executive, visouspatial and attentional deficits was confirmed. Performance on specific cognitive measures was correlated with perfusion brain SPECT findings. It could be speculated that different pathological mechanisms underlie widespread significant brain perfusion decrements in temporal, parietal and frontal regions. ","2220":"The objective of analysis of ADRs caused by drugs that pertain to the ATC group N (nervous system), as reported to the Croatian Agency for Medicinal Products and Medical Devices for the period from March 2005 to December 2008, was to examine the types of ADRs collected in said period, the profile of reporters and the possible impacts this could have on prescribing this group of medicinal products in the future. A retrospective observational study of ADRs was performed. Drugs causing ADRs were grouped according to the ATC drug classification, and subsequently entered into a database. Data were analyzed in respect of total number, gender, age, type, seriousness, expectedness, outcome, system organ class, suspected drug and reporter. The findings showed that 15% of all reported ADRs were caused by drugs from the ATC group N. 60% of these were caused by drugs belonging to the ATC subgroups N05 (psycholeptics) and N06A (antidepressants). A significant increase in the percentage of serious ADRs in the examined groups of medicinal products was observed. Analysis of expectedness showed that the share of unexpected ADRs is very high. The distribution of reporters is not satisfactory. The Agency, as regulatory authority, cannot undertake certain measures to improve the safe use of medicinal products without having reports. Only reporting of ADRs can result in changes to benefit all patient populations. Our joint aim should be avoiding a great number of ADRs and maintaining overall safe use of medicinal products. ","2221":"Psychological interactions between parents,children and social environment are very important for childhood health. The type of personality and stressful events are probably also cancer risk factors. We investigated personality types A\/B and D (negative affectivity and social inhibition) in parents of children with cancer (PCC), as well as social environmental factors, and family \/ children's stressful events before the appearance of cancer. Bortner Type A Scale for evaluating parental type A\/B personality, and 14 question personality test (DS14) for parental type D personality (negative affectivity and social inhibition score) were performed. Questionnaire eligible information about stressful events and social environmental factors in children with cancer (CC) were analyzed. Analyzing 127 PCC and 136 parents of healthy children (PHC) we found no significant differences in A\/B type personality and social inhibition. There was significant difference in negative affectivity. PCC had more negative affectivity than PHC. We found more stressful events before cancer appearance in the families of children with cancer (FCC) than in healthy families (FHC), and more children's stressful events in CC then in healthy ones (HC). There were more quarrels in FCC, while CC were more \"easy good-mannered children\" than HC. Our results support the hypothesis that stress is a cancer risk factor and the idea that impaired parental functioning may be a mechanism linking family stress with the aetiology of cancer. ","2222":"Research data from studies of functional neuroanatomy and neurochemistry indicate various dysfunctions in certain areas of the brain in individuals who suffer from chronic Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. These abnormalities are involved in the evolution of symptoms of PTSD, deterioration of cognitive functions and decreased quality of life of the survivors. The intensity of these symptoms is in direct correlation with the degree of dysfunction in the central nervous system. The aim of our study, was to evaluate the subjective perception of the Quality of life in subjects suffering from chronic PTSD and to compare prior to treatment results to results three and six months after receiving therapy, as well as to analyze whether perception of the Quality of life change related to treatment. The study was conducted at the Psychiatric Clinic of the Sarajevo University Clinical Center. The sample consisted of 100 male persons, with war trauma experiences, whose age range was between 35 and 60 years, who were seeking treatment at the Psychiatric Clinic, University of Sarajevo Clinical Center and met the criteria for the diagnosis of chronic PTSD (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder) according to ICD-10. (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision). The exclusion criterion was prior psychiatric illness (traumatization before the war) and less than 8 years of education. All subjects received out-patient treatment. Their treatment involved psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic therapy. The subjects were assessed using the following instruments: Sociodemographic Questionnaire designed by the authors for registering the social and demographic characteristics of the subjects (age, years of education, current employment, and socioeconomic status) and Manchester Quality of Life Scale (MANSA) as a self-report scale. The subjects were assessed prior to treatment, and three and six months after beginning the treatment (follow-up). There was an increase in the mean values of subjective perception of Quality of Life between the first (3.2352), second (3.4447), and third test (3.6090). Differences between these mean values were not statistically significant between the first and second test, but significant between the second and third test. Also differences between sociodemographic characteristics prior to treatment and during six month follow-up were not statistically significant. A significant increase has been noted in the number of contacts with close friends between the first, second and third test. Also, we recorded a decrease in pertaining aggressive and criminal behavior between the three tests. The results of our study indicate that subjects who are suffering from chronic PTSD have a lower subjective perception of their quality of life. Combined psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatment over a period of six months lead to improvement in the perception of quality of life. This may indicate the need for longer treatment of individuals suffering from chronic PTSD. A significant increase has been noted in the number of contacts with close friends between the first, second and third test, reflecting positive treatment effects on everyday life functioning and coping skills. ","2223":"This paper reports on some factors correlated with sexual satisfaction and on differences between female and male university students. A convenience sample of 174 female and 74 male Slovene undergraduate university students was studied. It has been found that an increased frequency of sexual interaction and agreeableness in sexual interactions increase sexual satisfaction, while a desired frequency of sexual interactions and estimation of a partner's agreeableness in sexual interactions decrease sexual satisfaction. Sex was not found to be an important predictor of sexual satisfaction. Male students' agreeableness in sexual interaction is significantly higher than that of female students. Male students are significantly more conservative in their attitudes towards abortion and concerning sexual myths. Female students are less satisfied with their sexual life than their male colleagues. In conclusion, the findings of the study demonstrate that there are some differences in problems with sexuality between both sexes. Female students are in general more dissatisfied. On the basis of the findings of the present research it should be possible to plan interventions for increasing satisfaction with sexuality, specifically for each gender. ","2224":"Numerous studies have suggested that 54%-100% of patients with IBS may have associated psychiatric illness and personality pathology. This transversal controlled study was realized in order to evaluate anxiety and depression levels, as well as the personality characteristics of patients with IBS and to compare the results obtained with patients with episodes of depression and healthy individuals. The experimental group consisted of 30 IBS patients, while two control groups consisted of the same number of inpatients with episodes of depression and healthy individuals from the general population. There were equal number of men and women in the study sample and all subjects were aged between 25 to 65 years. Standard psychometric instruments employed included Hamilton anxiety scale, Zung depression scale, Hamilton depression scale, Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), Eysenck Perosonality Inventory (EPI). The average Hamilton and Zung depression scores were significantly higher in patients with depressive episodes compared with the IBS patients, while the mentioned scores among them were also significantly higher compared with the healthy controls. There were no significant differences between IBS and the group with depressive episodes in the average Hamilton anxiety levels, EPI neuroticism and extraversion levels and MMPI neurotic scales levels (Hs, D, and Hy). The significant differences were observed comparing the IBS patients to healthy individuals. The patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome who asked for medical help (consulters) because of their intestinal symptoms, presented emotional problems such as depression and anxiety and expressed neurotic personality characteristics. ","2225":"In this study we wanted to determine the efficacy and tolerability of venlafaxine extended release in patients with major depressive disorder. 161 patients with major depressive disorder were included in an open-label, multicentre clinical study. All patients were treated with venlafaxine extended release in flexible doses ranging from 75 to 325 mg daily over an 8-week period. Efficacy measurements included the 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale, the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I), the Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S), and the Depression and Somatic Symptom Scale (DSSS). All scales were administered at baseline and at weeks 2, 4 and 8. A total of 148 (91.2%) patients completed the study. After 8 weeks of treatment with venlafaxine extended release, response and remission rates were 93% and 45% respectively. At the end of the study, 52.7% of patients were rated on CGI-S with 2 or 1 (not ill\/mildly ill) and on CGI-I 81.1% of patients were rated by the physician as much\/very much improved. The severity of somatic symptoms such as headache, back pain, chest pain, tenderness of more than a half of body muscles, and fatigue or loss of energy decreased towards the end of the study (p&lt;.0001). Adverse events caused discontinuation in 4.7% of patients. No significant changes of body mass (p=.237), Body Mass Index (p=.281), and heart rate (p=.840) were present, but systolic and diastolic blood pressure significantly decreased (p&lt;.0001) towards the end of the study. The data from this study indicate that venlafaxine XR is an efficient and safe therapeutic option for patients with major depressive disorder, with the additional effect of reducing associated painful physical symptoms.

In order to bring this subject to the attention of mental health professionals, this paper presents a contemporary synthesis of the biopsychosocial dynamics and recommendations for treatment of Malignant Narcissism. We reviewed the literature on Malignant Narcissism which was sparse. It was first described in psychiatry by Otto Kernberg in 1984. There have been few contributions to the literature since that time. We discovered that the syndrome of Malignant Narcissism was expressed in fairy tales as a part of the collective unconscious long before it was recognized by psychiatry. We searched for prominent malignant narcissists in recent history. We reviewed the literature on treatment and developed categories for family assessment. Malignant Narcissism is described as a core Narcissistic personality disorder, antisocial behavior, ego-syntonic sadism, and a paranoid orientation. There is no structured interview or self-report measure that identifies Malignant Narcissism and this interferes with research, clinical diagnosis and treatment. This paper presents a synthesis of current knowledge about Malignant Narcissism and proposes a foundation for treatment. Malignant Narcissism is a severe personality disorder that has devastating consequences for the family and society. It requires attention within the discipline of psychiatry and the social science community. We recommend treatment in a therapeutic community and a program of prevention that is focused on psychoeducation, not only in mental health professionals, but in the wider social community. ","2228":"","2229":"Many patients in Community Mental Health Teams have a diagnosis of depression F32, recurrent depression F33, and depression and anxiety F41.2, and such patients are often considered by team managers as being suitable for discharge to primary care. It is necessary to describe factors that influence outcomes, specifically discharge, in order to identify suitable patients who might continue their treatment in primary care. We aimed to assess the influence of suicidality, alcohol and drug abuse and augmentation strategies on the discharge status of patients treated by the Bedford East Community Mental Health Team (BECMHT) who have been diagnosed with depression in each of the three groups F32, F33, and F41.2. Using the team database, we identified 168 patients with depression F32, recurrent depressive disorder F33 and depression and anxiety F41.2. We then established their discharge status (discharged, enhanced CPA and normal CPA) and identified factors that may influence the discharge status (suicidal ideation, alcohol and drug problems and augmentation therapy). Outcome as measured by patient discharge and the prevalence of each factor was compared in the three groups. The group who had been diagnosed with a depressive episode, F32 , were less likely to be discharged and appeared to be more likely to suffer from alcoholism, illicit drug abuse, and suicidality. Arguably, the F32 group could be a more heterogeneous group of patients, F32 becoming a 'default diagnosis' into which both patients with a discrete 'depressive episode' and patients with a 'depressive episode plus other problematic factors' were put, while the F33 and F42.1 groups were more clear cut. Suicidality, alcoholism, and illicit drug use clearly impact on the outcomes of patients in the diagnostic groups studied. ","2230":"Degeneration of cholinergic receptors causes memory disorders and irreversible impairment in cognitive functions, whose advancement can lead to clinically recognizable Alzheimer's disease (AD). Very often, the first symptoms of AD are mood swings and hence depression should be excluded by differential diagnosis since it can also cause memory disorders and cognitive deficits. Due to the characteristic clinical picture of AD, its diagnosis should not be a problem, except at the very beginning of the disease. Many AD patients are never diagnosed and therefore are not adequately treated in clinical practice. Agents used for general anaesthesia reduce cholinergic transmission, which is manifested by loss of consciousness, pain, voluntary movements and memory. In patients with compromised memory and cognitive functionality, general anaesthesia can postoperatively have an adverse effect on the prognosis of degenerative cerebral disease. A patient is described whose preoperative impaired memory and cognitive functioning deteriorated after general anaesthesia and whose clinical picture reached the extent of AD.","2231":"Mood disturbances are characteristic and dominant feature of Mood disorders. Bipolar Affective Disorder (BAD) is a mood disorder which occurs equally in both sexes. BAD may occur in co morbidity with other mental diseases and disorders such as: Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia Nervosa, Attention Deficit, Panic Disorder and Social Phobia. However, medical disorders (one or more) can also coexist with BAD. Metabolic syndrome is a combination of metabolic disorders that increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. A 61-year old female patient has been receiving continuous and systematic psychiatric treatment for Bipolar Affective Disorder for the last 39 years. The first episode was a depressive one and it occurred after a child delivery. Seventeen years ago the patient developed diabetes (diabetes type II), and twelve years ago arterial hypertension was diagnosed. High cholesterol and triglyceride levels as well as weight gain were objective findings. During the last nine years she has been treated for lower leg ulcer. Since metabolic syndrome includes abdominal obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, increased cholesterol and serum triglyceride levels, the aforesaid patient can be diagnosed with Metabolic Syndrome. When treating Bipolar Affective Disorder, the antipsychotic drug choice should be careful and aware of its side-effects in order to avoid the development or aggravation of metabolic syndrome.","2232":"In clinical practice with adolescents we often come across with prepsychotic and psychotic disorders. When an adolescent patient has a positive hereditary burden for psychiatric illnesses in both parents, then the qualification of adolescent's mental disorder seems closer to psychotic. We must have in mind that hereditary burden is only one of many etiological factors that contribute to mental decompensations in adolescent age, that can, but don't have to be the prodrome of psychosis in the future. Whether is characterised as psychotic or not, the treatment of an adolescent in critical situation must be personalised, considering biological, social and individual factors of a patient. We believe that clinician's experience in treating psychotic adolescent patients and personalised and integrative approach to a patient is of great importance. In this article we will present the therapeutical process of a 19-year old female adolescent, with psychotic symptoms, whose both parents are psychiatric patients. A personalised and integrative approach in treatment of this patient made possible the overcome of crisis, termination of high school education and an employment. These achievements, no matter what the future can bring to this patient, create better conditions for her functioning in life.","2233":"Metabolic syndrome can contribute to significant morbidity and premature mortality and should be accounted for in the treatment of mental disorders. Patients with schizophrenia are at risk of undetected somatic comorbidity. Patients with schizophrenia have metabolically unfavorable body composition, comprising abdominal obesity, high fat percentage and low muscle mass, leading to increased risk of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Smoking, poor diet, reduced physical activity and alcohol or drug abuse are prevalent in people with schizophrenia and contribute to the overall cardiovascular disease risk. Side effects of antipsychotics may cause diagnostic problems in deciding regarding the origin of particular symptoms (somatic illness vs. side effects) during treatment of psychotic disorders. Bearing in mind frequent comorbidity between of psychotic and somatic disorders, early recognition of such comorbidity is important, as well as the selection of antipsychotics. The aim of this article is to report a case of changes in values of cholesterol and tryglicerides after weight loss, during treatment with aripiprazole in a patient with schizophrenia. This case report emphasizes the importance of regular monitoring of values of cholesterol and tryglicerides during treatment with antipsychotics.","2234":"Integrative approach to treatment of psychiatric patients incorporates a variety of therapeutic procedures that overlap and are not mutually exclusive. Their objective is unique: to heal and to restore patients' proper functioning in their family, work and social environments alike. Treatment often requires integration of various therapeutic approaches. In this paper we report the efficacy of an integrative model in the case of a female patient who developed a clinical picture of psychotic depression after giving birth. Taking an individual approach alongside the continuous use of psycho pharmacotherapy enabled us to look for an appropriate model of hospital and ambulatory treatment, namely psychotherapeutic setting. This example proved individual psychotherapy to be a complementary method to psycho pharmacotherapy. This was due to a strong feeling of shame that prevented the patient from opening up and dealing with her inner conflict in the previous group treatment. Integrative and personalised treatment has resulted in a relatively quick recovery and return to her everyday duties.","2235":"We discuss the case of a 51 year old former mid-wife presented to the NHS Luton and Bedfordshire psychiatric services with a 2 year history of increasing forgetfulness with significant impairment to her daily function. She was diagnosed with non-familial early-onset Alzheimer's Disease (EOAD) and started on 8mg daily of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor Galantamine. The information for this study was gathered from patient notes, consultant, collateral and personal accounts. Periodic outpatient consultations at the NHS Luton and Bedfordshire psychiatric services were used to monitor Mrs LF's global, functional and behavioral progress. These were supplemented with the mini mental state examination (MMSE) at each outpatient appointment. The graph of MMSE scores illustrates severe decline in scores, followed eventually by increase in score to sustained improvement while continuing on galantamine. Functionally, this lady has successfully negotiated a divorce, moved into her own accommodation, began travelling on holidays, including abroad, with friends, and has now embarked on a new relationship. Whilst only being a single case study, this demonstrates the significant benefits which are attainable with Galantamine in EOAD. The extent of this improvement may be a result of individual variation, or perhaps a greater efficacy for this drug in the subset of 'early-onset' AD patients, which has long been thought to share the same mechanism as traditional AD. The responsiveness to Galantamine in this patient may suggest an alternative mechanism of Early Onset Alzheimer's Disease to typical Alzheimer's Disease in the over 65's. The case raises interesting questions as to whether EOAD should be considered distinct to typical (over 65's) AD, given the greater than expected response to Galantamine. ","2236":"The current clinical view on pharmacological treatment and the Croatian reality regarding approved antidementia drugs is presented. Dementia is a syndrome of high incidence and Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. New data show that dementia prevalence will nearly double every 20 years, and we believe that current estimated number of persons with dementia (PWD) for Croatia is more than 80,000. The standard treatment with antidementia drugs is unavailable in Croatia, for the majority of PWD, because antidementia drugs are not on the reimbursement list, although Croatian algorithm for psychopharmacological treatment and Alzheimer Disease Societies Croatia recommend early and adequate treatment. Alzheimer's dementia is becoming a world's health priority in 21st century, so we strongly believe that antidementia drugs should be reimbursed in Croatia.","2237":"PTSD is a complex disorder, which frequently occurs in comorbidity with anxious disorder, personality disorder, addiction or substance abuse disorder, depressive disorder with or without psychotic symptoms and psychotic disorder. PTSD symptoms may result from deregulation of several different neurotransmitter systems. Pharmacotherapy of PTSD depends on clinical features and the presence of comorbid disorders. Pharmacotherapy of PTSD involves use of anxiolytics, adrenergic receptor antagonists, antidepressants, anticonvulsants and novel antipsychotics. Serotoninergic effect of antidepressants is not only effective in treating depression, but also appears to be helpful in PTSD treatment, particularly in reduction of intrusive symptoms, emotional reactivity, impulsiveness, aggression and suicidal ideation. Anypsychotics with serotoninergic-dopaminergic antagonism are being prescribed often in treatment of psychotic depression, while in PTSD treatment they are proved to be efficient in relieving intrusive symptoms and nightmares. Quetiapine as serotoninergic-dopaminergic antagonist is efficient in treatment of chronic insomnia as well as in reduction of aggressiveness. Considering PTSD refractoriness to therapy, high incidence of comorbidity and significant functional impairment, it is important to search for new psychopharmacological combinations in order to improve mental status of the patient. The paper presents 46 years old male patient with the diagnosis of Enduring personality changes following war PTSD (F62.0) in comorbidity with Recurrent depressive disorder with psychotic symptoms (F33.3), who was treated with combination of venlafaxine and quetiapine.","2238":"There is presently concern that patients treated for depression with venlafaxine have a higher suicide rate than those treated with other antidepressants, based on results from observational studies. The aim of this study was to determine whether higher suicide risk, defined as previous suicide attempt or suicidal ideation, influenced the choice of antidepressant prescribed in an outpatient mental health unit, the Bedford East Community Mental Health Team. A database held by a the Community Mental Health Team was used to identify patients with Depression who have been treated with Venlafaxine, Citalopram, and patients diagnosed with bipolar II affective disorder. The data was analysed in terms of presence of suicide risk, gender, and whether bipolar II patients on venlafaxine were treated with mood stabilisers. The results showed that a risk of suicide did not prevent the prescription of venlafaxine, that less venlafaxine was prescribed to male patients than females, and that bipolar II patients were indeed treated with mood stabilisers. It appears that in this Community Mental Health Team, the possibility of suicide risk with venlafaxine therapy is considered and appropriately managed. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of bipolar disorder is likely to be the most effective step that we can take to reduce the risk of suicide in patients with bipolar disorder .Appropriate care regarding the judicious use of Venlafaxine as a first line treatment in Unipolar Depression is secondary to this. ","2239":"To accomplish therapeutic goal it is necessary to adjust the dose of medication to be right for every single patient. This procedure of dose adjustment is individualized dose regimen. First of all, pharmacokinetic aspects should be revised, including parameters such as resorption, distribution, metabolism and secretion of drug. For these purposes, the authors developed and clinically assessed the modified Bayesian method supported by original basic computer program. The aim of research was to compare frequency of adverse events in cases of individualized and empiric dose regimens of amitriptyline in the treatment of major depressive episode. Sixty subjects (32- 65 years old), with major depressive disorder (International Classification of Disease, 10th revision), were randomly assigned and single- blinded to take individualized (experimental group, n=30) or empiric (control group, n=30) doses of amitriptyline for 8 weeks. CGI scale and originally designed questionnaire were used for adverse events assessment. In experimental group, 69 complaints on nine different types of adverse effects were recorded during eight-week treatment period. Severe adverse events, such as confusion or arrhythmia, were not registered in this subgroup. In control group, 111 complaints on twelve different types of adverse effects were recorded. Most common were anticholinergic effects, but during the third and fourth week from baseline, some severe adverse events were observed: tremor (16%), fatigue (16%), in one of the subjects confusion occurred and arrhythmia in another. Analyzing of the results according to CGI scale for adverse events showed that, during the treatment period, adverse events were less frequent in experimental group. This was particularly obvious in the first four weeks of treatment, when statistically significant difference (p&lt;0.05) was observed.","2240":"It has been demonstrated that there are differences in efficacy and acceptability of commonly prescribed antidepressants (Cipriani et al. 2009). This meta-analysis showed that escitalopram, sertraline, venlafaxine and mirtazapine were the most effective antidepressant monotherapies in the acute treatment of unipolar depression in adults. We aimed to analyse prescribing patterns of antidepressant monotherapies in Bedford Hospital. We intended to compare the efficacy of antidepressant monotherapies in patients with unipolar depression at Bedford East CMHT, using discharge rates and rates of reduced suicidality (including suicidal ideation and Behaviour) after treatment by the CMHT as the outcome measure. We also decided to compare the efficacy of 'the four' versus 'the others' in patients with unipolar depression in Bedford East CMHT, using discharge rates and rates of reduced suicidality (including suicidal ideation and Behaviour) after treatment by the CMHT as the outcome measures. We identified and included all patients with unipolar depression prescribed an antidepressant monotherapy in Bedford East CMHT. We identified patients who were discharged after treatment, as well as patients who were suicidal before treatment, and after treatment. Hence we could work out discharge rates and reduction in suicide rates for each antidepressant monotherapy. These were then compared, using graphs. The most frequently prescribed antidepressant monotherapy was citalopram. Prescription of 'the four' was associated with a greater percentage of patients discharged from the clinic than 'the others'. Sertraline was the antidepressant most likely to reduce suicidality in our sample. This audit in a small group of patients suggests that prescription of 'the four' leads to a higher discharge rate than 'the others'. Regarding suicidality, this audit in a small group of patients suggests that sertraline is the most effective antidepressant monotherapy in reducing suicidality in patients with unipolar depression. The study has several limitations, however it does appear that the antidepressants identified by Cipriani are effective compared with other monotherapies. We recommend that all CMHTs should carry out audits of their prescribing practice.

We also aimed to compare the efficacy of antidepressant monotherapies in patients with unipolar depression or patients with depressed mood and also other psychiatric indications within Bedford East Community Mental Health Team, using discharge rates from the out-patient clinic as the outcome measure. We aimed to compare the efficacy of 'the four' versus 'the others' in patients with unipolar depression patients with depressed mood and also other psychiatric indications at within Bedford East Community Mental Health Team , using discharge rates from the out-patient clinic as the outcome measure. We included all patients on an antidepressant monotherapy in Bedford East Community Mental Health Team in our analysis (206 patients in total) (Figure 1). We examined the clinical notes for each patient to assess whether they were diagnosed with unipolar depression or another psychiatric condition, and whether they had been discharged from the out-patient clinic after being prescribed the antidepressant. This allowed us to calculate discharge rates for each antidepressant monotherapy. For patients with unipolar depression, discharge rates were higher when they were prescribed one of 'the four' and highest when prescribed escitalopram. For patients with other indications, discharge rates were higher for 'the others' and highest for fluoxetine . A greater percentage of patients with unipolar depression were discharged from clinic compared with patients treated with antidepressant monotherapy for depressed mood and also other psychiatric indications. These results suggest that co-morbid undiagnosed other mental illness may be a cause of 'resistant depression'. ","2242":"Algorithms and guidelines in treatment of schizophrenia behind which is the consensus of experts, institutions and associations are more and more in use among psychiatrists. However, the final conclusion about them will be possible only after their use in everyday practice with full freedom of psychiatrists to make changes according their personal judgment about risk and benefit of treatment.","2243":"Acute psychosis is diagnosed by clearly defined operational criteria embedded into international classification systems. Many studies have tried to determine the role of gender in psychosis but mainly in terms of epidemiology and course of illness, most often schizophrenia. There are however also important gender-specific differences in clinical symptoms of acute psychosis. No guidelines or treatment recommendations suggest gender as an important factor in the choice of antipsychotic treatment, which is true for all treatment modalities (antipsychotic, dose, duration). We will review shortly available literature and present some of our own research data on gender differences in clinical presentations of acute psychosis. When the diagnosis of an illness depends almost entirely on symptoms and their presentations as in the case of acute psychosis, important gender specific differences might challenge the diagnostic process as well as treatment choice and course of psychosis. Our as well as other data confirm that acute psychosis manifest itself differently in males and females. To define further the impact of observed differences we need further research into gender specific clinical and not just epidemiological variables.","2244":"The concept of personalized drug therapy on the basis of genetic investigations has become a major issue in psychopharmacology. Pharmacogenetic studies have focused on polymorphisms in liver cytochrome P450 isoenzymes that metabolize many antidepressant and antipsychotic medications. The most significant results are the association between drug metabolic polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 with variations in drug metabolic rates and side effects. Additionally, polymorphisms in dopamine and serotonin receptor genes are repeatedly found associated with response phenotypes, probably reflecting the strong affinities that most antipsychotics display for these receptors. The contribution of kinetic factors to the clinical outcome of antipsychotic treatment has a strong evidence base. Genetic tests for the pretreatment prediction of antipsychotic response have obvious implications for the selection of most appropriate drug and dose and contribute for the optimization of antipsychotic treatment. The pretreatment determination of individual's drug metabolic rates by CYP genotyping is the leading field. This review summarizes the present knowledge of associations between cytochrome P450 isoenzymes and the efficacy and side effects of antipsychotics.","2245":"Antipsychotics are the lodestar in the treatment of schizophrenia despite the variability of the therapeutic response and drug-induced adverse effects (especially extrapyramidal symptoms, gain weight, and metabolic disturbances). More and more data are supporting the notion that genetic factors - as well as often overlooked personal and environmental factors - that define the inter-individual differences in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic treatment response. At present, there are no practical pharmakogenetic tests that could be used in everyday clinical practice; however, in the field of psychiatry they are expected within a few years. Pharmacogenetic tests will indubitably become an important tool for personalized prescription.","2246":"A number of large naturalistic trials have reported in recent years comparing second generation antipsychotic drugs with their predecessors. The conclusions they draw have rightly sparked much debate, but are these studies truly comparable? If not, which of them are most methodologically robust and are these the studies most suitable as a foundation for clinical care guidelines with a strong evidence base. We aimed to conduct a review of the current literature to establish the appropriateness of several recent major clinical studies being used as the basis for clinical guidelines. A literature search using the PUBMED database was carried out. Five major studies comparing antipsychotic efficacy were selected as possible candidates and subjected to further analysis. The studies were: * CUTLASS (Cost Utility of the Latest Antipsychotic Drugs in Schizophrenia study); * CATIE (Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness study); * SOHO (Schizophrenia outpatients Health Outcomes study); * CAFE (Comparison of Atypicals in First Episode study); * EUFEST (European First Episode Schizophrenia Trial). The trials: * CAFE - the trial, although well randomised and blinded, uses discontinuation as a primary endpoint - this is hard to draw conclusions from: patients may discontinue due to side effects, due to lack of efficacy or with against medical advice for a multitude of reasons. As a secondary endpoint, the study does make use of a PANSS scoring system to measure efficacy, adding some weight to the conclusion that olanzapine, quetiaine and risperidone in early psychosis patients have equivalent efficacies. * CATIE - This trial was a comparative study, and so lacked a control arm and used discontinuation of medication an inverse measure of efficacy - an easily quantifiable event, but making for difficult interpretation. However most criticism has been directed at the unusually low (quitiapine, ziprasidone) and high (olanzapine and perphenazine) doses of drug used, which were reflected in their differing rates of efficacy. * CUtLASS This trial allows for less generalisation of its findings to the general population as it makes use a specific sub-population (those switching from one medication to another after a period of treatment). Also some patients were prescribed oral medications and some depot injections - making comparisons difficult due to possible differences in compliance. * EUFEST This trial makes use of discontinuation as an endpoint with the weaknesses we have described. Treatment of first episodes of psychosis is shown to be feasible, but it could not suggest if haloperidol or second generation drugs may be more efficacious. * SOHO - This trial hindered by the observational design of the study and small numbers reaching the primary end point (4%) caution should be exercised in the conclusion that olanzapine is superior to risperidone, quetiapine or typical antipsychotics. There is much information useful for clinical practice to be gathered from the results of these major studies, however, interpretation is hampered by both variations and weakness in study design. On balance it does appear that different antipsychotics possess differing efficacy, but also of relevance to the development of sound clinical guidelines is their differing side effects profile. ","2247":"Recently there has been pressure on Secondary Psychiatric services to discharge patients back into Primary care. This project is to show what depression treatments are used by Bedford East Community Mental Health Team (BECMHT) and therefore identify whether some of these patients could be appropriately managed in Primary care. We identified, using an anonymised database, patients being treated with different anti-depressant regimens in BECMHT. We compared these treatments with the steps described in NICE Guidelines, and other evidence based treatment modalities which we found on literature search. Based on this data, we attempted to predict which patients it might be safe to discharge to primary care for ongoing treatment. Many different combinations of medications were found. Many patients had other intercurrent mental health diagnoses. There are many possible evidence based treatments for depression which can be employed once those listed by NICE are exhausted. We review all of these. Some patients are, accordingly, on combinations of medication as augmentation strategies.It is responsible to only discharge patients into Primary care when their symptoms are controlled. We identified groups of patients who might be transferred back to primary care for maintenance treatment, provided that shared care protocols are in Place, and there is easy access to secondary care services should the need arise. ","2248":"Despite advances in psychiatry, treatment outcomes are still a big problem, and are not always substantially better than it was in the past time. Treatment resistance remains a serious psychiatric problem. One of the reasons for that is that the pendulum has swung from a psychodynamic framework to a biological one, and the impact of meaning (i.e. the role of psychodynamic and psychosocial factors in treatment-refractory illness) has been relatively neglected. Dynamic factors in psychopharmacology play a pivotal role in pharmacological treatment responsiveness. There is a small but impressive evidence base that shows that psychological and interpersonal factors play that role. Psychodynamic psycho pharmacotherapy combines rational prescribing with tools to identify irrational interferences with effective use of medications, i.e. to resolve the problems of the pharmacological-treatment resistance. Psychodynamic psychopharmacology represents an integration of biological psychiatry and psychodynamic insights and techniques.","2249":"There is a huge gap between possibilities for achieving high treatment effectiveness and poor results in clinical practice. It is possible to achieve a more positive impact and better treatment outcome by individualizing and personalizing treatments in a more creative and rational manner. This review describes the short history and principles of creative psychopharmacotherapy.","2250":"Movies are a complex entity representing simultaneously an art form, a powerful industry, and a social phenomenon. The movie industry has always shown keen interest in physicians and medicine in general, and psychiatry in particular has often been in the spotlight. While there can be positive aspects of interaction of the movies and the psychiatry, stigmatization and negative public perception are also the results we often have to consider. Movies exploit psychiatric topics, at the same time portrayal of mental conditions, psychiatrists, and psychiatry on big screen could be used in different kinds of education in psychiatry. We present our initial experience with introducing movies in education of psychiatry residents in Psychiatric Hospital Vrapce.","2251":"This study investigates association between psychosomatic and traumatic symptoms among adolescents. This cross-sectional survey using self-completion questionnaires was conducted among 868 adolescent in grade 6th, 7th and 8th of primary schools in Mostar (Bosnia and Herzegovina). Psychosomatic symptoms are strongly associated with traumatic symptoms, with exception of symptom of anger. The association is the highest between anxiety, depression and PTS symptoms on the one side and cardiovascular symptoms on the other side. According to our results, psychosomatic symptoms are strongly associated with psychosomatic symptoms in early adolescence. ","2252":"Numerous epidemiological and clinical studies found a high incidence of comorbidity in children and adolescent psychiatry. In population of children and adolescents is most often described and researched comorbidity of depression, anxiety disorders, than in hyperkinetic and behavioral disorders, and finally the difficulty in reading (dyslexia) and antisocial behavior disorders. The common occurrence of two diagnoses may be the result of a disorder that has a complex pattern of symptoms, which apparently seems to be two disorders, but in fact is a single disorder. Comorbidity may be two disorders that share the same set of risk factors or is it possible that a one disorder is a risk of development of other disorder. Knowledge and understanding of comorbidity is important as a preventive and therapeutic point of view. Comorbidity is particularly important because complicates diagnostic process and influences the course, prognosis and treatment of children and adolescents.","2253":"There are connection between use of cannabis and many psychiatric disturbances in adolescents, especially \"cannabis psychosis\", depression, panic attacks and suicide. Negative effects could occur either as a result of a specific pharmacological effect of cannabis, or as the result of stressful experiences during the intoxication of cannabis in young people. Potentially is very dangerous high frequency suicidal ideation among cannabis users.","2254":"Psychophysical dermatitis is frequently manifested in patients that suffer from psychiatric illnesses and disorders as well as in patients that suffer from depressive disorders. These diseases occur or worsen after acute stress that may trigger them. Difficulties in expressing feelings or impossibility to verbalise them are connected to somatic diseases. In order to emphasize their importance, we will present a case of a 58 years old woman who has been suffering from alopecia areata that developed after her husband's death. The patient doesn't function well since then - she is socially isolated, she has lost self confidence and self esteem. As she has realised it was impossible to live like that, she decided to seek psychiatric help. The patient should be examined through the prism of the interdisciplinary treatment and as an integral structure of the mind and body.","2255":"The concept of psychogenic dystonia refers to an unusual but well-known concept of movement disorders caused by mental disorders. It's self manifested as a permanent muscular contractions that cause twisting, repetitive movements or abnormal posture of the body. It is characterized by high psychiatric comorbidity. 50-year-old patient who has diagnosed segmental dystonia will be presented. He was treated twice at psychiatry department because of comorbid psychiatric disorders. Diagnostic and therapeutic procedures that have confirmed comorbidity and association with clinical signs of neurological disorders were performed.","2256":"Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative, autosomal dominant disease that manifests with a triad of symptom clusters including movement disorder, cognitive impairment and psychiatric symptoms. We present a patient with HD who, prior to developing neurological signs and symptoms, had been exposed to war trauma and had developed posttraumatic stress disorder. Fifteen years later he manifested with dysarthria, difficulties with swallowing and involuntary movement. What brought him to psychiatrist was a heteroanamnestically noticed change in personality with irritable mood, impulsivity, aggressive outbursts in behavior and delusional ideation. Therapy was stared with haloperidol, but patient developed severe extrapiramidal side effects. Subsequent treatment with olanzapine, diazepam and omega 3 fatty acids lead to mood stabilization and better impulse control with even some improvement in motoric symptoms. To our knowledge, this is the first case report on combat related PTSD as psychiatric disorder manifested prior to HD. We discuss a possible influence of psychological stress disorder on severity of psychiatric symptoms in the HD. The importance of personalized approach in both psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutical treatment of patients with HD is emphasized. If the influence of environmental stress on the psychiatric phenotype of the disease should be confirmed by clinical trials and further studies, both screening methods and interventions aimed to reduce psychological stress in carriers of Huntington gene could be considered.","2257":"This article reports the case of a patient with partial agenesis of the corpus callosum manifested with corpus callosum syndrome together with signs of brain hemispheres dysfunction: mental impairment, epilepsy and pyramidal signs. The patient's malformation is combined with left-handedness while signs of callosal disconnection are not present. Mild cognitive impairment and late epilepsy onset require a multidisciplinary approach since the patient also displays elements of central nervous system malformations.","2258":"Neuropsychology includes both the psychiatric manifestations of neurological illness (primary brain-based disorders) and neurobiology of \"idiopathic\" psychiatric disorders. Neurological primary brain disorders provoke broad spectrum of brain pathophysiology that cause deficit sin human behaviour, and the magnitude of neurobehavioral-related problems is a world wide health concern. Speech disorders of aphasic type, unilateral neglect, anosognosia (deficit disorders), delirium and mood disorders (productive disorders) in urgent neurology, first of all in acute phase of stroke are more frequent disorders then it verified in routine exam, not only in the developed and large neurological departments. Aphasia is common consequence of left hemispheric lesion and most common neuropsychological consequence of stroke, with prevalence of one third of all stroke patients in acute phase although exist reports on greater frequency. Unilateral neglect is a disorder that mostly effects the patient after the lesion of the right hemisphere, mostly caused by a cerebrovascular insult (infarct or haemorrhage affecting a large area - up to two thirds of the right hemisphere), and in general the left-side neglect is the most widespread neuropsychological deficit after the lesion of the right cerebral hemisphere. Reports on the incidence of visual neglect vary and they range from 13 to 85%. Anosognosia is on the second place as neuropsychological syndrome of stroke in right hemisphere, characterized by the denial of the motor, visual or cognitive deficit. This syndrome, defined as denial of hemiparesis or hemianopsia, is a common disorder verified in 17-28% of all patents with acute brain stoke. There are different reports on frequency of delirium in acute stroke, from 24 to 48%, and it is more frequent in hemorrhagic then ischemic stoke. Post stroke depression (PSD) is one of the more frequent consequences on the stroke, and the prevalence of PSD has ranged from 5 to 63% of patients in several cross-sectional studies, peaking three to six months after a stroke.","2259":"Infectious and inflammatory processes could potentially play an important role in the etiology and pathogenesis of psychotic disorders. The aim was to investigate is there any differences in CRP levels in patients with bipolar disorder compared to patients with schizophrenia and if there is an association between increased CRP levels and the presence of MS in these two groups of patients. Patients with bipolar disorder (N=60; 32 males and 28 females) and schizophrenia (N=63, 33 males and 30 females). MS was defined according to NCEP ATP III criteria. The cut-off point for elevated CRP was set at 5 mg \/L. The prevalence of the MS was 31% in bipolar group compared to the 37% in schizophrenia group. No statistically significant differences in mean CRP values was observed between bipolar and schizophrenia group. CRP &gt;5 mg \/l was significantly associated with the presence of MS. Measurement of serum inflammatory parameters in psychiatric patients may be beneficial in order to obtain a better assessment of their metabolic risk profile. ","2260":"Catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) is an enzyme involved in the degradation of dopamine. The most commonly examined polymorphism within the COMT gene is Val108\/158Met polymorphism, which results in three to fourfold difference in COMT enzyme activity. It is particularely important in prefrontal cortex, since COMT activity is the most important regulator of the prefrontal dopamine function. Given the association between schizophrenia and decreased dopamine activity in the prefrontal cortex, it is not surprising that Val108\/158Met polymorphism is among the most extensively investigated polymorphisms in schizophrenia. According to different studies, Val allele may be a small risk factor for schizophrenia. There is also some evidence that Val108\/158Met polymorphism influences the age of onset of schizophrenia, cognitive function, severity of psychotic symptoms, as well as efficacy and adverse events of antipsychotics. Heterogenity of patient population has undoubtedly influenced the results of these studies. Interaction of Val108\/158Met polymorphism with other genes and environmental factors is an important avenue for future research.","2261":"Little research has been done to ascertain how patients and families of South Asian origin access and use early intervention mental health services today. The aim of this retrospective study is to gain a better understanding of how well South Asian patients engage with standard psycho-social interventions. In June 2003 an audit was conducted amongst 75 patients from different ethnic groups in Luton. Measures of engagement with mental health services included; number of missed outpatient appointments over one year and compliance with medication regimes. The results of this audit showed that South Asian patients are more likely to miss appointments and refuse to take medication in comparison to their Caucasian or Afro- Caribbean counter-parts. Further analysis revealed that the Bangladeshi subgroup had missed more appointments and had a greater proportion of medication refusal in comparison to the other Asian subgroups. These results support the pioneering work by Dr Robin Pinto in the 1970s he observed that Asian patients perceive and utilise mental health services in a different way compared to the Caucasian population. The observations from our study depict the difficulties in engaging ethnic minority patients into existing services. Hence we argue that future interventions should be adapted and tailored to overcome cultural and language barriers with patients and their families. ","2262":"Resistance refers to all types of behaviour that oppose the exploration processes in the therapeutic process and inhibit work. Very common types of resistances, such as forgetting the time of session, being late, non-payment of sessions and such are found in every type of psychotherapy, including psychodrama psychotherapy. The attempt to break resistance in order to evoke changes could be dangerous as it represents the necessary defence mechanism and it is also a vital element of the person's functioning in therapy. In psychodrama, which is a type of action method of group psychotherapy, resistance can manifest through continuous verbalization of problems, in not wanting to act out the problem, the protagonist's typical non-verbal message or the most obvious manifestation: the absence of the protagonist. This paper will be on the typical resistance which the therapist has noticed during the first session of psychodrama psychotherapy, with a small group of adult clients. As the group was young and with undeveloped cohesiveness, resistance represented a certain balancing power for maintaining mental homeostasis of the group.","2263":"The treatment of patients with BPDs is more hopeful than it was in the past. During the past period, psychiatrists have become overly dependent on pharmacological treatments, neglecting psychotherapies even when they are evidence-based. There is much stronger evidence for the effectiveness of psychotherapy in BPD than for any pharmacological intervention. One of the important psychotherapy for BPD is family therapy. Our work emphasized the protective role of family therapy in late adolescent female patients suffering from borderline personality disorder with eating disorder comorbidity.","2264":"Violence is an important social problem. Violence in the community has important social relevance for the political, criminal justice, and health care systems. Studies of homicide offenders have suggested a high prevalence of neurologic dysfunction due to organic brain damage such as traumatic brain injury, epilepsy and dementia have been observed to exhibit excessive violence. Moreover, violence in the mentally ill can be viewed as an important medical and mental health problem with significant implications for forensic psychiatry and the community. Although numerous previous studies showed that rate of violent behavior in the community is not much higher in patients with serious mental disorders (schizophrenia) than in healthy controls, that rate is substantially higher in patients with psychiatric comorbidity and substance abuse. A high proportion of patients in forensic psychiatric facilities are diagnosed with comorbidity, most often with schizophrenia, paranoid psychosis, organic brain syndrome, various personality disorders and comorbid substance abuse. These patients represent a high risk group for violence within forensic psychiatric facilities, and repetitive violent behavior in the community. Understanding the neurobiological basis of aggressive behavior clearly has important social and clinical implications. By introduction of neuroimaging studies (MRI, fMRI, PET, SPECT) as a useful tool in forensic psychiatry, the neurobiological aspect of violence is better understood. Previous studies have shown that individuals with frontotemporal brain dysfunction are frequently displaying antisocial behavior (disinhibition, impulsivity, lack of empathy) that justify the diagnosis of \"acquired sociopathy\/psychopathy\". A correlation between the potential for impulsive aggression mediated by limbic brain structures, and the control of the aggression by frontotemporal brain regions has been shown. The individuals with such brain dysfunction have an increased risk of violent behavior and scored high on the Webster's and Hare's violence risk assessment scale. This article reviews the relationship between psychiatric comorbidity, violence risk assessment and neuroimaging in forensic psychiatry and showing the useful directions for future research, screening and prevention of violent behavior among mentally ill criminal offenders.","2265":"This paper describes a patient who is suffering from PTSD with elements of hypochondria, panic attacks and episodes of depression in comorbidity with kidney stones. Kidney stones provoked egzacerbation of psychiatric symptoms. Kidney stones and frustration about them have taken part of provoking factor, the last drop, which led to regression of otherwise precarious, but compensated patient's mental functioning which resulted in development of psychiatric symptoms.","2266":"There is obvious decline in quality of life after MI and stroke. The main factors that reduce quality of life in these patients were the inability of returning to normal activities, pain and the development of depression \/ anxiety. We wanted to know what has the biggest influence on recovery and differences in quality of life in patients after stroke and heart attack. Cross-sectional study was conducted using HADS and WHOQOL-Bref questionnaire. Criteria for exclusion were diabetes, previous depression, cancer or other co morbidities that influenced the quality of life. It has been surveyed total of 396 patients, of whom 378 patients satisfied the criteria of inclusion in the study. Based on the personal data of patients, they were divided according to gender, age, educational level, and social support expressed by number of members with whom patient lives. In all the observed parameters of the SU group had better results than the stroke group. The recovery after a stroke affected age, length of education and depression. Age, gender and length of education influence on a heart attack recovery. Disease duration did not affect the quality of life in either group. Significantly more patients after a stroke had depression compared to MI (p&lt;0.001). Anxiety was not found significant in differences between groups (p=0.051). Metabolic syndrome was more frequent in the stroke group, but the difference between groups was not significant (stroke\/MI) (p=0.098). In the group of stroke patients who had MS patients more often had depression (p=0.003) for different of respondents from the group with MI. Quality of life was significantly worse in patients after stroke compared to those with MI. The recovery from stroke was most significantly impacted by depression and age and level of education, while the recovery from heart attack was at most affected by gender, age and level of education. ","2267":"Depression is one of the five most frequent disorders in primary care practice and often remains unrecognized. One of the reasons why depression often passes unnoticed is comorbidity - a number of different chronic diseases coexist with depression, especially in elderly patients. The aim of this research was to assess the difference between depressed and non-depressed patients regarding somatic and mental comorbidity. The differences in drug use were also examined. Five hundred successive adult patients visiting family physicians in Rijeka, Croatia, were polled using the Beck Depression Inventory and a general questionnaire which was created for the purpose of the study. The existing medical records were also used. Elevated depression level was determined in 48.1% of the examinees. These patients were suffering from larger number of chronic diseases (X=1.23) than non-depressed patients (X=0.70; t=5.07; p&lt;0.001; z=4.93; p&lt;0.001), especially cardiac, mental, renal and osteomuscular diseases. Depressed persons used significantly more drugs (X=1.28) than non-depressed patients (X=0.58; t=6.10; p&lt;0.001; z=5.78; p&lt;0.001), especially antirheumatics, analgesics, sedatives, antidepressants, antiallergics and diuretics. The research results point to a necessity of routine screening and early treatment of depression in patients with chronic diseases in primary care practice. ","2268":"Depression is prevalent in patients with type 2 diabetes and affects quality of life. The prevalence of depression in the sample of Croatian patients with diabetes is 32.2%. The main aim of the investigation was to evaluate the effect of antidepressant treatment on quality of life and metabolic control in depressed diabetic patients. In the sample we randomized 60 diabetic outpatients with optimally controlled diabetes and with depression. The efficacy of 50 mg sertraline per day treatment was tested by the MADRAS questionnaire in a 24-week period, where the patients controlled themselves. Changes in the quality of life as the consequences of treatment of depression were tested by the QLSQ questionnaire for the quality of life follow-up. The MADRAS scale results, measuring the changes in the degree of depression, showed substantial improvement of condition throughout the whole treatment. The first eight weeks of treatment presented statistically high significance in examinees in all the groups of chronic somatic diseases. The QLSQ scale results for measuring the quality of life showed marked improvement. Statistically significant changes occurred during the first eight weeks of treatment. Two patients withdrew their consent before starting medication and 13 dropped out later in the study. Treatment of depression with sertraline in chronic somatic patients did not induce changes in the HbA1c. that the prevalence of depression in patients with somatic diseases is several times higher than in general population. Treatment of depression with antidepressants from the group of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (sertraline) causes improvement of depressive symptoms and increases the quality of life in diabetic patients. Treatment of depression has no impact upon the values control parameters in these patients. ","2269":"Psycho-oncology is a broad approach to cancer therapy which treats the emotional, social, and spiritual distress which often accompanies cancer patients. The development of psycho-oncology began in the second part of the 20th century reflecting the increased interest in the study of cancer patients' psychological reactions to their illness at all stages of its course, and the analysis of the emotional, spiritual, social, and behavioral factors which influence the risk of developing cancer and long-term aftercare treatment. Today the psycho-oncology has become an accepted part of cancer treatment, with departments of psycho-oncology established in most major cancer centers in Canada, the United States and many Western European countries. A key clinical challenge for the oncologist is differentiating the expected and transient distress associated with cancer from the excessive, disabling distress requiring psychiatric interventions. One third of patients with cancer will experience distress which requires evaluation and treatment, and the most common psychiatric disorders are depression, anxiety disorders and adjustment disorders. Psychiatrists should be involved in the multidisciplinary treatment team who work with the cancer patients. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of different psychological and psychopharmacological interventions in psycho-oncology and palliative medicine. Mental health issues should be included in the training of health care professionals in all areas of medicine, psychology and social work to meet the demands of cancer patients.","2270":"Pain is one of the most ubiquitous problems of today's world, its impact being far-reaching. Current conceptualizations of pain medicine adopt a bio-psycho-social perspective. In this model, pain is best described as an interactive, psycho-physiological behavioral pattern that cannot be divided into independent psycho-social and physical components. Neurophysiologic substrates of the pain experience can be broken down into the pain transmission elements emanating from peripheral, spinal, and supra-spinal processes. There are many complex mechanisms involved in pain processing within the central nervous system, being influenced by genetics, interaction of neurotransmitters and their receptors, and pain- augmenting and pain-inhibiting neural circuits. The patient's emotional experiences, beliefs and expectations may determine the outcome of treatment, and are fully emphasized in the focus of treatment interventions. There are several common psychiatric disorders accompanying and complicating the experience of pain that warrant clinical attention and that can be the focus of psychiatric treatment. These include depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, somatoform disorders, substance-related disorders and personality disorders. Complex and disabling pain conditions often require comprehensive pain treatment programs, involving interdisciplinary and multimodal treatment approaches. There are many roles that the psychiatrist can perform in the assessment and treatment of the patients with pain, individually tailored to meet the specific needs of the patient. Rational poly-pharmacy is of a high importance in the treatment of patients with chronic pain, with antidepressants and anticonvulsants contributing as the important adjuvant analgesic agents.","2271":"Illnesses which develop in a complex way are best described in stages, and those stages will describe not only a particular point in the course of the disease but also the appropriate treatment for that stage. This approach has, over the years, proved to be very appropriate for planning the treatment of various cancers. It is suggested that in the same way, it can be very important in planning the treatment of a complex illness such as schizophrenia. We aim to describe the staging model of schizophrenia, show the neuroimaging and clinical evidence for it, and discuss its implications for treatment. We propose that the development of schizophrenia can be described in at least three stages; the prodrome, the first episode, and the chronic phase. In order to describe these stages, we will use data derived wherever possible from literature published in Europe, and we will compare this with data produced from other continents of the world, notably Australia. This is done by reference to and examination of the original published literature, in order that this evidence may be tested against criteria for evidence of a staging model which we propose. There is much data, from clinical studies which show that schizophrenia develops over time and that its presentation can be described in at least three stages in the development of a schizophrenic illness; the prodrome, the first episode, and the long term chronic phase. It is also true that there is a pre-morbid phase before the prodrome, where it is possible to identify delays in such signs of early neurodevelopment as early paediatric milestones which may suggest an increased risk of schizophrenia in the future. This is mirrored in descriptions of the MRI findings, with loss of gray matter beginning in the prodrome, as well as in changes in cognition which develop as the illness develops over time. It follows from this model that treatment is different in all these three stages, and that the expected outcome of treatment will be different in each of the various stages of the illness. In all the phases of the illness, evidence based psychological interventions, including psycho-education, cognitive therapy, family interventions, and other interventions to prevent relapse work together with medication in order to optimise treatment. Consequently, any attempt to optimise treatment in schizophrenia must take into account the different stages of the illness, and target outcomes must be appropriate for these stages. The treatments, both pharmacological and psychological must be appropriate to the stage of the disease. The application of treatment protocols which are inappropriate to the stage of the disease may lead to sub-optimal outcomes, and even to iatrogenic harm. ","2272":"Our aim was to investigate is there association between level of religious moral beliefs and severity of PTSD symptoms, depressiion symptoms, anxiety and severity of alcohol abuse we tested 152 war veterans on presence of PTSD, depression symptoms, anxiety, alcohol misuse and level of religious moral beliefs. We used Harvard trauma questionnaire (HTQ), Hopkins Check Scale SBCL 25, check list for alcohol misuse MAST. Subjects were assessed with regard to the level of belief in some basic ethical principles that arise from religious moral values. The score of religious moral belief index was used to correlate with severity of PTSD symptoms, depression symptoms, anxiety and severity of alcohol misuse. Mean age of tested subjects was 40.8 (SD=6.6) years. The score of the moral belief index was negatively correlated to PTSD symptom severity and depressiveness (Pearson's r=-0.325, p&lt;0.001; r=-0.247, p=0.005, respectively). Besides that the score of moral belief index negatively correlated with presented anxiety (Pearson's r=-0.199,p=0.026). Related to severity of tobacco and alcohol misuse we found negative association of these with the moral belief index (Pearson's r=-0.227, p=0.011; r=-0.371, p&lt;0.001, respectively). A higher index of religious moral beliefs in war veterans enables better control distress, providing better mental health stability. It enables post traumatic conflicts typical for combatants' survivors to be more easily overcome. It also causes healthier reactions to external stimuli. A higher index of religious moral beliefs of war veterans provides a healthier and more efficient mechanism of tobacco and alcohol misuse control. In this way, it helps overcoming postwar psychosocial problems and socialization of the personality, leading to the improvement in mental health. ","2273":"The stress -vulnerability model (Zubin et al. 1977) is an extremely useful model for identifying and treating relapses of mental illness. We accept that human persons carry genetic and other predisposition to mental illness. However, the question arises as to how stress impacts on a person in order to cause mental illness to develop. Furthermore there arises the issue as to what other effects such stress has on the human body beyond the human brain. Our aim was to research and integrate the current literature in order to establish how stress impacts on the brain at the cellular level, and to establish whether there are other consequences for the human body brought about by the impact of stress on the human brain. Literature Search, using pubmed. We have identified much literature on how stress affects biological mechanisms within the brain, and how it relates to biological vulnerabilities carried by different individuals. We have identified communalities in how the interplay between stress and vulnerability occurs in different disease processes. ","2274":"Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (DIGS) is a modern structured interview schedule that has been in use since 1994. Main purpose of the DIGS is to record information regarding to a subject's functioning and psychopathology and it was specifically designed for psychiatric genetic studies. The DIGS is also suitable for making diagnosis, evaluation of comorbidity and other researches. It contents items and sections and has a semi-structured design that gives interviewers the freedom needed to extract the best in formation possible. The validity of a Croatian version of the DIGS was investigated. The original English version was initially translated into Croatian. The Croatian version was then back-translated and compared with the original. In this paper we will describe each item that DIGS contents as well as the use of this diagnostic instrument.","2275":"The completion of Human Genome Project and the \"HapMap\" project was followed by translational activities from companies within the private sector. This led to the introduction of genome-wide scans based on hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphysms (SNP). These scans were based on common genetic variants in human populations. This new and powerful technology was then applied to the existing DNA-based datasets with information on psychiatric disorders. As a result, an unprecedented amount of novel scientific insights related to the underlying biology and genetics of psychiatric disorders was obtained. The dominant design of these studies, so called \"genome-wide association studies\" (GWAS), used statistical methods which minimized the risk of false positive reports and provided much greater power to detect genotype-phenotype associations. All findings were entirely data-driven rather than hypothesis-driven, which often made it difficult for researchers to understand or interpret the findings. Interestingly, this work in genetics is indicating how non-specific some genes are for psychiatric disorders, having associations in common for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism. This suggests that the earlier stages of psychiatric disorders may be multi-valent and that early detection, coupled with a clearer understanding of the environmental factors, may allow prevention. At the present time, the rich \"harvest\" from GWAS still has very limited power to predict the variation in psychiatric disease status at individual level, typically explaining less than 5% of the total risk variance. The most recent studies of common genetic variation implicated the role of major histocompatibility complex in schizophrenia and other disorders. They also provided molecular evidence for a substantial polygenic component to the risk of psychiatric diseases, involving thousands of common alleles of very small effect. The studies of structural genetic variation, such as copy number variants (CNV), coupled with the efforts targeting rare genetic variation (using the emerging whole-genome \"deep\" sequencing technologies) will become the area of the greatest interest in the field of genetic epidemiology. This will be complemented by the studies of epigenetic phoenomena, changes of expression at a large scale and understanding gene-gene interactions in complex networks using systems biology approaches. A deeper understanding of the underlying biology of psychiatric disorders is essential to improve diagnoses and therapies of these diseases. New technologies - genome-wide association studies, imaging and the optical manipulation of neural circuits - are promising to provide novel insights and lead to new treatments.","2276":"This review focuses first on conceptual chaos and different connotations in psychosomatic medicine, then on new perspectives on comorbidity and multimorbidity, especially from epigenetics perspective. Comorbidity is one of the greatest research and clinical challenges to contemporary psychiatry and psychosomatic medicine. Recently altered gene expression due to epigenetic regulation has been implicated in the development of multifarious mental disorders and somatic diseases. The potential relevance of epigenetics for better understanding and more successful treatment of comorbidity and multimorbidity is described.","2277":"Behavioural disturbances are prominent in frontotemporal dementia (FTD), a focal, non-Alzheimer type of dementia. Although most patients with FTD present with socially inappropriate behaviour, compulsive-like acts, poor insight and disinhibition, the presence of psychiatric features including delusions, hallucinations, and paranoia can lead to a misclassification of FTD as psychiatric disorder. In the absence of cognitive deficits non-experts fail to recognize these social changes as dementia symptoms. We report two individuals who met current clinical criteria for behavioural or frontal variant FTD (bv-FTD), with the aim of distinguishing between psychotic symptoms and the often bizarre personality and behaviour change found in FTD. Also we review the literature on the noncognitive neuropsyhiatric manifestation of this disorder. Clinical findings presented, and a literature review, indicate that psychotic symptoms are rare in FTD. Better awareness of behavioural symptoms in clinical practice is necessary in order to avoid misdiagnosis of FTD as psychiatric disorder.","2278":"PTSD is a complex psychobiological disorder that causes disfunctionality in many areas. In treating PTSD different models have been applied, however, no general consensus on the method of treatment has yet been achieved. At the Clinic for Psychological Medicine we have developed the model of combined treatment for PTSD patients that involves outpatient individual psychotherapy, psychopharmacotherapy and group psychotherapeutic techniques introduced within repeated day-hospital treatments. In this paper the efficiency of the above mentioned model has been explored. Three PTSD patients have been presented. We assessed changes in psychological functioning of our subjects on the basis of clinical observation and analysis of the session protocols. The model of combined and long-term treatment of PTSD in which the approach to traumatized patients has been mostly supportive, including supportive psychotherapeutic interventions and psychopharmacotherapy, has proved to be efficient in achieving integration of traumatic experiences and consolidation of the traumatised Self. Combination of individual and group approach facilitates the analysis of traumatic transference, whereas more mature defence patterns become stronger and integration of traumatic experiences improved. Consolidation of the Self leads to better socialization.","2279":"Asthma is a mayor public health problems and its prevalence has risen in recent decades world wide. Various explanations have been proposed to explain this trend including air pollution, aeroallergens, diet, infections and tobacco smoke. However, focus on biological risk factors has not fully explained this trend. A mounting body of research evidence suggests that psychosocial stress is likely to be a factor contributing to the development of asthma. The aim of the present study was to estimate the effect of psychosocial distress on asthma mortality rate at the aggregate level. Trends in age-adjusted, sex-specific suicide (as an integral indicator for psychosocial distress) and asthma mortality rate in Russia from 1975 to 2005 were analyzed employing an ARIMA analysis in order to asses bivariate relationship between the two time series. Time series analysis indicates the presence of statistically significant association between the two time series both for males and females. The findings of the present study add to the growing number of studies linking psychosocial distress to asthma expression and mortality. This paper presents new epidemiological evidence that supports psychosomatic concept of asthma. ","2280":"After 30 years of clinical work and research based on categorical criteria for personality disorders (Diagnostic and Statistical manual of Mental Disorders - DSM IV TR) and (International Classification of Diseases - ICD 10th revision), a solid conceptual understanding and treatment of these disorders have not been established. For the field to move forward, it is imperative that future classifications introduce major revisions of the concept, diagnosis, and classification of personality disorders. This paper proposes one such revision. Based on recent advances in molecular biology and epigenetics, we define personality disorders as maladaptive syndromes developed trough person-environment interaction. We conceptualize maladaptation as a failure of integrative functions of personality (i.e., those that carry out adaptive processes) caused by strong biogenetic dispositions or by pathological environmental effects, or both. Hence, accurate diagnosis of personality disorder depends upon neurobiological (innate) and adaptive (interactive) etiological factors. We propose a 2-step diagnostic algorithm for personality disorders: adaptive processes (i.e., character) are used to diagnose maladaptation, whereas biological aspects (i.e., temperament) are used to specify dominant clinical presentation and for differential diagnosis. We suggest that the term \"Personality Disorder\" be replaced by a more appropriate term \"Adaptation Disorder\" as the latter reflects more accurately the real nature of the disorder and distributes the causality of maladaptive syndromes more evenly, between the person and the environment. Diagnostic, research, and treatment advantages of the proposed solution are discussed in some detail.","2281":"In clinical neuropsychology a huge number of neuropsychological tests have been developed, and the corpus of these instruments is always increasing. Because of this, the question has been raised as to which are the most usefull instruments that provide the best neuropsychological profiles of the subjects. In the actual literature, there are polemics about the advantages and disadvantages of computerized neuropsychological batteries versus standard paper and pencil tests. In the present increased level of neuropsychological evaluation, computerized batteries still are not used in the majority of tests in clinical neuropsychology. Besides the impressive collection of neuropsychological instruments, the role of the educated and experienced clinician in neuropsychological evaluation is irreplaceable.","2282":"The mass media has a powerful impact on public attitudes about mental health and psychiatry. The question of identity of psychiatry as a medical profession as well as of the future of psychiatry has been the subject of much controversial discussion. Psychiatry today has the historical opportunity to shape the future of mental health care, medicine and society. It has gained in scientific and professional status by the tremendous increase of knowledge and treatment skills. Psychiatry should build up new transdisciplinary and integrative image of a specialized profession, promote it and make it public. Good public relations are very important for the future of psychiatry.","2283":"The aim of this study was to assess the course of health - related quality of life, cognitive and emotional change during the six months after elective CABG, and to investigate how cognitive impairments, depression and posttraumatic stress symptoms were related to quality of life. In a prospective study, we followed up for 6 months 138 of the original 147 patients who had undergone elective CABG surgery. Elective CABG is associated with significant improvements in HRQOL relative to the preoperative period, but impairments in HRQOL were found in a subgroup of post - CABG patients with evidence of PTSD, depression, or cognitive impairments at 6 - month follow - up. ","2284":"Idiosyncratic reactions are serious, unpredicted adverse effects of antiepileptic drugs which are in use in psychiatry as mood stabilizers. Severe idiosyncratic reactions can manifest as systemic symptoms or Dress syndrome clinically manifested with increased body temperature, peripheral lymphadenopathy and potential one or multiple organ failure. We present a 36 years old patient, who was hospitalized for the first time in our hospital after he attempted suicide by hanging. Patient was diagnosed as Bipolar affective disorder, current episode depressive with psychotic features and high suicidal risk. At the time of admission he was taking olanzapine and venlafaxine. Psychopharmacs were cross titrated to clozapine, valproic acid and lamotrigine. Two weeks later, patient's mood was stabilized but his somatic status worsened dramatically. He was forwarded to Clinic for Infective Diseases where he was diagnosed with severe sepsis. Dress syndrome, although initially suspected was not verified, but has to be taken into consideration in each patient prescribed with antiepileptic drugs.","2285":"The antipsychotic drugs can be of great benefit for the wide range of psychotic disorders, but all are associated with various adverse effects. Patients with psychotic disorder consider the sexual dysfunction to be among the most important side effects. Although, it is not uncommon for the patients with schizophrenia to report the sexual dysfunction, patients with untreated schizophrenia have fewer dysfunctions compared to those on antipsychotic medication. The decision whether the current treatment with a prolactin-increasing antipsychotic or sexual dysfunction inducing drug should be continued or switched to another antipsychotic drug, has to be made on the basis of the patient's risk-benefit estimation. It has to be kept on mind that adverse effects are usually dose dependent. In this case report, sertindole treated patient with chronic schizophrenia developed sexual side effect manifested as ejaculatory dysfunction that was significantly ameliorated by drug-dose reduction.","2286":"Risperidone, as all atypical antipsychotics, can cause hyperprolactinemia which can in turn lead to galactorrhea. Mood stabilizers, one of which is valproic acid and its derivate \"Depakine Chrono\", are rarely linked with symptomatic hyperprolactinemia and do not alter prolactin concentrations. This case is based around a patient suffering from a bipolar disorder that has been psychiatrically treated in an outpatient clinic during four years. Bipolar disorder treatment was started with carbamazepine, but later it was discontinued due to adverse events and extreme increase of liver transaminases. Treatment was continued with introduction of lithium, but the patient stated that she could not tolerate it. Subsequently, her endocrinologist advised for lithium discontinuation due to very severe osteoporosis. At the beginning of 2009, lithium was discontinued and Depakine Chrono was introduced. Due to patient's psychotic decompensation it was necessary to introduce risperidone into treatment and soon afterwards her psychotic symptoms settled. After several months of treatment her mood lowered, she began to feel sedated, psychomotorically retarded and that lead to dose lowering of Depakine Chrono and risperidone, at which point galactorrhea as a serious adverse event occurred. Occurrence of galactorrhea at lower risperidone doses in this case might be partially explained by recent studies that showed that lower doses of risperidone can also improve psychic state, but could also cause adverse events. Although galactorrhea, as a direct consequence of hyperprolactinemia caused by risperidone has mainly been researched with higher doses of this atypical antipsychotic, we have to keep in mind that lower doses could also cause serious adverse events.","2287":"It is well documented that sulpiride causes hormonal adverse events, like amenorrhoea and galactorrhea, due to its mechanism of action. Furthermore, risperidone can produce amenorrhoea and galactorrhea also, due to its mechanism of action, which differs from that of sulpiride. This case report is of a patient that was treated with large doses of sulpiride, but did not develop an adverse event like amenorrhoea. However, when risperidone was introduced into therapy it leads to the onset of amenorrhoea. Gynecologist saw it as the beginning of menopause. General practitioner questioned the existence of an intra-cerebral process that could produce amenorrhoea as well. Therefore, the patient was sent to perform an MRI of the brain, under work diagnosis of pituitary adenoma, which was later ruled out as a cause of the illness. Well experienced psychiatrist linked the loss of menstruation with the adverse event profile of sulpiride and therefore gradually discontinued sulpiride from therapy, while risperidone was left and subsequently menstrual cycle was restored. Good knowledge of adverse events profile of antipsychotic medication used, especially when used in a combination, allows us to correctly question appearance of adverse events, to adequately treat them and lowers the cost of unneeded medical procedures.","2288":"A 47 year old patient has been treated for psychotic depression for the last 5 years. The illness began manifesting through the symptoms of depressive thoughts, intrapsychic tension, projectivity, derealisation phenomena and pre-psychotic fears. She was treated with a combination of antidepressives, anxiolitics and hypnotics in ambulatory conditions. The therapy applied did not obtain the effects expected due to which an atypical antipsychotic was administered subsequently - risperidone, a 2 mg dose in the evening. After commencing the antipsychotic treatment, the symptoms started to weaken and a steady remission was obtained. Two years after a regular risperidone administration (in combination with fluoxetine, alprazolam and flurazepam) the patient reported some \"bleeding\" in October 2006. Hormonal blood tests were performed and high prolactin values were registered (2567.0 mIJ\/L),due to which a gradual risperidone retractement was indicated. Medicamentous hyperprolactinaemia is a well known side effect of risperidone. A gradual risperidone retractement lead to a lowered and normal prolactin level within a month.","2289":"Use of antipsychotic medication during the entire course of pregnancy in patients suffering from schizophrenia is frequently necessary as discontinuation of therapy can lead to relapse of the illness which can be far more severe for the mother, but also for the fetus. That is the case why third generation antipsychotics, so called atypical antipsychotics, are also being used during the pregnancy, but their effects are not fully researched. Use of ziprasidone as a third generation antipsychotic, and its effects during the pregnancy in patients suffering from various mental illnesses is very rarely described in scientific literature. There is even fewer information regarding eventual adverse events of ziprasidone in newborn babies of mothers that have been treated with ziprasidone during the entire course of pregnancy. This paper will be based around a case report of a female patient suffering from schizophrenia who has been treated with ziprasidone during the entire course of her pregnancy and whose newborn baby was diagnosed with a cleft palate (palatoschisis) at the time of birth.","2290":"Malignant neuroleptic syndrome (MNS) is a serious and potentially fatal side-effect of neuroleptic treatment. Beside antipsychotic drugs, other psychotropic drugs such as antidepressants and lithium carbonate can cause this life threatening side-effect. Underlying mechanism of this side-effect is still unknown and debated. So far some risk factors have been identified, with clinical observations and recent pharmacogenetic research suggesting (with inconsistent findings) correlation between genetic mechanisms and predisposition to MNS. Polymorphisms of CYP2D6 enzyme through which most psychotropic drugs are metabolized and TaqIA DRD2 which is target for antipsychotic drugs could be the link between pharmacogenetic factors and potential for development of MNS. In this paper we present two case reports with clinical presentation of three consecutive MNS. One patient developed MNS while he was taking combination of drugs: first time haloperidol, promazine and fluphenazine, second time fluphenazine and perazine and third time clozapine, promazine and valproic acid consecutively. The other patient developed MNS while taking following combination of drugs: first time haloperidol and lithium carbonate, second time risperidone and third time clozapine consecutively. Pharmacogenetic analysis for CYP2D6 and TaqI A DRD2 polymorphisms for both patients was done. Genotypisation of CYP2D6*1*3*4*5*6 in both patients showed no evidence of poor metabolizer phenotype. On the other hand, first patient was heterozygous for CYP2D6*4 (genotype *1\/*4). CYP2D6 polymorphisms could have clinical significance because may lead to toxicity and unwanted side-effects in standard usual antipsychotic dose ranges. Analysis Taql A DRD2 polymorphism for first patient showed that he is heterozygous for A1 allele (genotype A1A2) which is commonly associated with predisposition to MNS. According to our literature three consecutive MNS are rarely described, and incidence of MNS generally is too low to perform clinical research. Many patophysiological mechanisms may probably underlie this complex and potentially fatal syndrome, still unknown etiology. But, genetic mechanisms could be significant. Further pharmacogenetic research, findings and analysis in patients who develop single or repeated MNS are strongly recommended. In long term, pharmacogenetic analysis, implemented in daily clinical practice, could help in prevention of this extremely serious side-effect.","2291":"The use of antipsychotics in treatment of children and adolescents requires good knowledge of psychopathology, psychofarmacotherapy, developmental processes and family relations. It is necessary to have parental consent for the use of a medication in this age, with previous explanation of therapeutic goals, limitations and possible side effects of antipsychotics. The number of antipsychotics registered for use in children and adolescents is quite limited. The combination of clinical experience of those working with psychotic adolescents and a good collaboration with parents, creates a therapeutic space where good results in treatment can be achieved. Side effects, though rarely, can bring in question the course of treatment and disorder follow up. In this work we will present a 14-year old girl adolescent with psychotic symptoms, in which case the course of treatment and discontinuance of therapy was caused by a side effect - an oculogyric crisis.","2292":"Antipsychotics side-effects pose an enormous problem in psychiatric treatment. The choice of antipsychotics is a crucial issue in the treatment as both patients' cooperation and compliance often depend upon it. Severe side-effects might sometimes cause the treatment interruption, to which each patient is entitled. Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) features include social and interpersonal deficits, discomfort with close relationships, as well as cognitive and perceptual distortions and eccentricities of behaviour. Dominant symptoms often determine psycho pharmacotherapy and therefore antipsychotic treatment is possible. A 23 year-old man was treated for 4 months due to disturbances typical for SPD. Since the patient did not respond well to haloperidol, zuclopenthixol was advised. The latter medication produced severe, life-threatening side-effects which caused urgent hospitalisation. Althouth zuclopenthixol was instantly retracted from the therapy, the patient and his family rejected any further psychiatric treatment. In spite the fact that hetero-data obtained from his mother a few months later, revealed disturbances which greatly affected the patient's live, the patient showed resistance to further psychiatric treatment because of his negative experience with this medication.","2293":"Patients' non-compliance in treatments, such as irregular taking of medication, represents an enormous problem with psychiatric patients in general. This difficulty occurs especially in patients suffering from chronic mental illnesses such as schizophrenia. There are not any significant differences in the efficacy of reducing the positive symptoms in schizophrenia between the conventional and the atypical antipsychotics. However, the effects which are manifested in negative schizophrenia symptoms or in the patients' cognitive functioning, favour the atypical antipsychotics. When it comes to adding the subjective well-being of the patients and their improvement of the quality of life, then, the advantages of atypical antipsychotics are unquestionable. New trends in medicine are increasingly impinge on the pharmacoeconomy, which aims at reducing treatment cost. This trend is getting progressively stronger in the world and as such, it certainly will not bypass Croatia. Pharmacists and General Practice doctors (GP) are permitted, by the law, to replace the original medicament prescribed by a specialist doctor, with a cheaper one from the same generic group of medicaments, with a purpose of cutting down the treatment costs. Is there always a valid justification for such practice, and should it become a rule for all the patients out there? This is a case report of a patient who suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. He has been on a treatment with atypical antipsychotics and has kept in a good and stable remission for the past seven years. His therapy consisted of olanzapine in a dose of 15 mg in the evening, throughout the whole period of his 7-year remission. A month ago, his GP doctor self- initially prescribed a generic olanzapine. The impact of this decision on to the mental state of the patient as well as his trust in the treatment itself is described in this report.","2294":"New trends in medicine which are much more oriented towards pharmacoeconomy, are ever so common these days. There's an aim within the focus of the health system which is cutting down treatment expenses, and that relates to psychiatry practice too. Prescription drugs issued by specialist doctors are allowed to be switched with cheaper ones of the same group of drugs by GP doctors, with an aim of cost reduction. \"Instead of the medicament prescribed, a GP doctor is allowed to prescribe an alternative medicament of the same efficacy in the dosage of an adequate strength\" (taken from the specialist medical report form). A 74 years old man is treated for psychotic depression. Exogenic environmental factors caused the symptoms manifestation due to which hospitalization in a psychiatric ward occurred in two incidences. At the risperidone introduction soon after the second hospitalization event, a long term remission was obtained which lasted for several years. Despite a stable dose of psychopharmacs, new episode of the illness occurred. Researching the potential factors which lead towards the aggravation of the course of the illness disclosed that instead of the original risperidone, the pharmacist issued a generic in an equivalent dose.","2295":"Othello syndrome (OS) is an organic delusional disorder with prevailing jealousy symptoms presumably appearing as side effect of antiparkinsonian therapy. The clinical spectrum of psychiatric symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) is very wide, including symptoms of depression and anxiety, hallucinations, delusions, with prevalent paranoid symptoms, agitation, delirium and sleep disorders. At our knowledge, just a few cases of patients with PD and OS were reported till now. three neurologists working in a tertiary referral centre were asked to report cases of pathological jealousy as defined by the DSM IV criteria (Kaplan et al. 1994). The following data were collected retrospectively: sex, age at PD onset, age at OS onset, duration of PD, duration of PD treatment, duration of treatment with dopamine agonists (DAs), treatment of OS, past history of alcoholism, premorbid personality disorder, family history of psychiatric disorders and data about general cognitive condition. Five PD patients (three males) with OS were investigated. The mean age of the patients at the PD onset was 46.80+\/-8.87 (SD), the mean age at the OS onset was 56.40+\/-8.76 (SD). Before the onset of OS, all of them were taking dopamine agonists. The first patient was treated with pramipexole, apomorphine infusion and levodopa\/carbidopa, the second with apomorphine infusion plus levodopa\/carbidopa\/entacapone, the third with pramipexole, the fourth and fifth with ropinirole. Decrease of dopamine agonist led to clinical improvement in three patients (complete reduction of the symptoms in two, reduction of symptoms in one patients). In two patients, the symptoms remained the same. In three patients atypical neuroleptics had to be added: clozapine in two and quetiapine in one patient. We believe that OS is a more common psychiatric side effect in PD patients on treatment with dopamine agonists than usually believed, particulary in those with early disease onset. It is a very disturbing symptom for patients and their partners, often underestimated by them, and should therefore be actively searched for. ","2296":"The use of benzodiazepine anxiolytics and hypnotics continues to excite controversy. Views differ from expert to expert and from country to country as to the extent of the problem, or even whether long-term benzodiazepine use actually constitutes a problem. Although as a class benzodiazepines act rapidly and are well tolerated, their use presents clinical issues such as dependence, rebound anxiety, memory impairment, and discontinuation syndrome. The aim of this article is to review literature regarding different side effects associated with treatment with benzodiazepines - effects on cognition, treatment with benzodiazepines during pregnancy, dependence on benzodiazepines and risk of falling. Literature research included structured searches of Medline and other publications on the subject of treatment with benzodiazepines, particularly effects on cognition, risk of falls, benzodiazepine dependence and treatment with benzodiazepines during pregnancy. Results of investigations have revealed different side effects associated with treatment with benzodiazepines. Previous investigations showed that treatment with benzodiazepines may induce anterograde amnesia. Also, previous studies confirmed occurrence of physical dependence in high percentage of patients in long term treatment with benzodiazepines at therapeutic dosages. Some investigation suggested higher risk of oral cleft, the floppy infant syndrome, or marked neonatal withdrawal symptoms when using benzodiazepines during pregnany. Investigations have shown increased risk of falling in elderly persons taking benzodiazepines. ","2297":"Clozapine is associated with various haematological adverse effects, including leukopenia, neutropenia, agarnulocytosis, leukocytosis, anaemia, eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia and thrombocythaemia. Recognition and treatment of clozapine-related seizures also will become increasingly important as clozapine use grows in the 1990s. The decision to stop clozapine as a result of haematological adverse effects or seizures is a frustrating one for the clinician, and frequently disastrous for the patient. Cessation of treatment results in relapse. In case that patient is unresponsive to other antipsychotic, restarting clozapine should be consider, despite the risk involved. As the risk of a second agranulocytosis is much higher in those patients, various methods of militating against repeat blood dyscrasias have been treated, including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and lithium. The decision to restart clozapine should be taken on case-by-case basis and should take into account the likely risks and benefits of restarting. Prior response to clozapine and magnitude of patient deterioration on stopping treatment are important factors to take into this consideration. Clozapine-related seizures did not preclude successful treatment with clozapine. A strategy that has been proposed to reduce the occurrence of seizures is the addition of an anticonvulsant agent. However, clozapine does induce a variety of adverse effects, most of which are of limited duration and either preventable or manageable if a number of simple clinical procedures are followed. With careful haematologyc control, the risk of agranulocytosis can be minimized and in case of clozapine related seizures recommendations include dose reduction, electroencephalogram (EEG), plasma-level monitoring and prophylactic antiepileptic treatment. Re-exposure to clozapine may rarely be attempted where there are facilities for very close and frequent monitoring.","2298":"Antidepressants and antipsychotics can cause side effects in various organs and organic systems, and some (and) in the central nervous system, which can also be clinically manifested by suicidal behavior as well. Tricyclic antidepressants particularly of imipramine and clomipramine can have pro-suicidal effect, which is believed to be the consequence of their own hypothetic asynchronous cognitive-psychomotor pharmacodynamic action. Antidepressants from the group of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can at the beginning of administration as monotherapy also have pro-suicidal effects in patients with hints of suicidality or suicidal behavior, by increasing the intensity of already present suicidal predictors, such as dysphoria, anxiety, impulsiveness, agitation etc. Antipsychotics can act stimulatingly upon predictors of suicidal behavior, that is, pro-suicidal in an indirect way through side effects they cause indirect pro-suicidal neurological and consecutive psychological impact, as it is called. It is particularly valid for classic antipsychotics causing primarily neurological, i.e. extrapyramidal side effects, along which consecutive psychological side effects can occur as well. However, new antipsychotics in comparison to classic ones, have less pronounced neurological, extrapyramidal symptoms and signs but more somatic-metabolic side effects, and thereby their action can be mostly manifested as indirect pro-suicidal neurological and somatic-metabolic as well as consecutive psychological activity.","2299":"There is evidence that people with mental disorders are more likely to suffer from metabolic syndrome. In the last decades there has been an increase in interest for researching metabolic syndrome in psychiatric patients and plenty of evidence about their association. However, investigations on the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in patients with bipolar disorder are still surprisingly rare. The aim of this paper is to analyze comorbidity of bipolar disorder and metabolic syndrome, and the association of treatment with antipsychotics and mood stabilizers with metabolic syndrome, as well as to point out the necessity of appropriate preventive measures and treatment of metabolic syndrome in patient with bipolar disorder. Literature research included structured searches of Medline and other publications on the subject of comorbidity of bipolar disorder and metabolic syndrome, and the association of treatment with antipsychotics and mood stabilizers with metabolic syndrome, as well as preventive measures and treatment of metabolic syndrome in patient with bipolar disorder. Metabolic syndrome is present in 8-56% of patients suffering from bipolar disorder. Metabolic syndrome in patients with bipolar disorder can significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality, and it is certainly necessary to think of it, to take adequate preventive and therapeutic measures in treating its individual components. Further investigation on association between bipolar disorder and metabolic disorder, and the association of treatment with antipsychotics and mood stabilizers with metabolic syndrome are necessary. ","2300":"Metabolic syndrome and other cardiovascular risk factors are highly prevalent in people with schizophrenia. Metabolic syndrome can contribute to significant morbidity and premature mortality and should be accounted for in the treatment of mental disorders. Along with results of numerous investigations regarding metabolic syndrome, different issues have occurred. The aim of this article is to review literature regarding diagnostic and treatment of metabolic syndrome and point at some issues regarding diagnostic and treatment of metabolic syndrome in patients with psychotic disorders and in general population. Literature research included structured searches of Medline and other publications on the subject of metabolic syndrome, particularly diagnostic and treatment of metabolic syndrome in patients with psychotic disorders and in general population. Despite numerous investigations of metabolic syndrome, many issues remain unclear, becoming objectives for future research. The experts disagree in their opinions on particular issues, such as clustering risk factors, importance of particular diagnostic procedures for the early detection and monitoring of metabolic syndrome and the role of antipsychotics in occurrence of metabolic syndrome. There is, however, unique attitude about importance of early detection and treatment of metabolic syndrome as well as necessity of further investigations. ","2301":"Endometriosis is a complex disease that can result in substantial morbidity, including chronic pain, dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia. There are contradictory reports regarding the connection between acute and chronic stress and magnesium levels in body fluids. A prospective study included 87 patients undergoing laparoscopy. The study group included 40 women with endometriosis and the control group consisted of 47 women with other causes of infertility. The levels of fright were determined using HAMA scale. The measurements of Mg levels were performed using biochemical analyzer \"Monarch Plus\". One day before the operation, HAMA score was 9.54+\/-7.34 in the women with endometriosis, and 6.69+\/-5.51 in the women without endometriosis. The morning before the operation, HAMA score was 8.64 +\/- 8.10 in the women with endometriosis, and 4.29+\/-2.29 in the women without endometriosis. The second postoperative day, HAMA score was 8.96+\/-7.60 in the women with endometriosis and 6.92+\/-5.16 in the women without endometriosis. Higher HAMA score in the women with endometriosis, in comparison with the control group, in all three time periods has been found, but the differences were not statistically significant (p&gt;0.05). A negative correlation between the concentration of Mg in peritoneal fluid and HAMA score was found in the control group (p&lt;0.01). In infertile women without endometriosis a correlation between Mg concentration in peritoneal fluid and HAMA score was found. No such correlation was found in the women with endometriosis, possibly due to a systemic disorder in endometriosis that might affect Mg transport through the cell membrane. ","2302":"In recent decades, general practitioners (GPs) have become critical components of mental health services. However, in Croatia the role of GPs in mental health services is still mostly perceived as \"gate keeping\", whereas seeking help for serious mental illnesses is mostly restricted to psychiatrists. The aim of this study is to investigate the practices and attitudes of family doctors in providing care for psychiatric patients. The study included 111 GPs, working in 38 different locations in four major towns in Croatia. Data were collected using a questionnaire, specifically designed for the purpose of this study. By their own estimation, GPs prescribed antidepressants without a psychiatrist's recommendation in about 37% of patients who use them. Also, GPs prescribed sedatives without a psychiatrist's recommendation in about 60% of patients who use them. Although certain categories of psychiatric patients (elderly, patients with PTSD) were almost always referred to a psychiatrist, it was GPs' attitudes toward psychiatric casualties and their proneness to prescribe antidepressants and sedatives without a psychiatrist's recommendation that predicted whether a patient will be treated by himself of referred to a psychiatrist. \"Interest\/Competency\" and \"Knowledge\" of the GPs positively correlated with the number of courses attended as a part of continuous medical education (CME). Overall, the role of GPs in mental health services in Croatia is changing into a more active one, as a significant portion of patients with depression and anxiety are being treated by GPs. Personal interest and self confidence in proper knowledge and skills, in part acquired also from current CME programs, are determinants of higher autonomy of GPs in treating psychiatric patients. Psychiatrists, as active promoters of community mental health should more actively encourage their alliance with GPs, especially through offering higher quality CME courses. ","2303":"Schizophrenia spectrum psychosis is a chronic mental disorder, based on a range of genes whose expression can be altered by different environmental factors. In this archival and demographic study of genetic isolate we show an incidence of schizophrenia spectrum psychosis in a minority population and transmission of schizophrenia spectrum psychosis through several generations of two families in an isolated rural area of Dalmatia from the second half of 19th and the first half of 20th century. The incidence of schizophrenia spectrum psychosis was between 0.58 and 2.58 per 1000 inhabitants. The genogram of Family 1 shows that out of 182 descendants in six generations, there were 27 people with schizophrenia spectrum psychosis. Schizophrenia spectrum psychosis occurred in two men who were born from a relationship of a mother with her relative. The genogram of Family 2 shows that 19 out of 86 descendants in five generations suffered from schizophreniform psychosis. The high occurrence of schizophrenia spectrum psychosis in an isolated village in central Dalmatia is in accordance with the results of earlier studies in that region. The fact that psychosis occurs in varying frequency, without obvious regularity, can be explained by the irregular expression of risk genes as well as by exogenous factors which may affect the activity of the key chromosome areas. Occurrence of psychosis in people born from incestuous relationships indicates the importance of genetic factors in the development of the disorder. ","2304":"Dropout from an outpatient clinic is the loss of a patient to scheduled follow-up. Due to movement of mental health care to the community, adherence to ambulatory care is crucial to maintain stability among individuals with mental disorders. We hypothesized that patients drop out from ambulatory psychiatric care when regardless of the therapist's evaluation, they feel that they have recovered, or because they are dissatisfied with treatment. The aim was to examine the phenomenon of premature termination of treatment in a public community-based ambulatory psychiatric clinic serving a catchment area with a population of 200,000. The study sample was drawn from patients who had at least one ambulatory therapy session during the previous five years, immediately or shortly following initial treatment and who were subsequently lost to follow-up. Participants completed a questionnaire that evaluated their satisfaction with treatment and described their reasons for early termination of treatment. The sample included eighty-two patients. Eighty percent of the responders (N=65) terminated therapy on their own, and twenty percent (N=17) decided to end treatment together with their therapists. Increased involvement of patients in treatment planning, duration and end of therapy, may improve attendance in ambulatory mental health care settings. Though dropouts generally reported satisfaction with the ambulatory service, some explained early termination of treatment as being due to dissatisfaction with the therapist, the type of treatment or because of therapist turnover. Others terminated treatment because they felt their problems were solved or their conditions had improved, though therapists had determined otherwise. ","2305":"In this pilot study (Study A), the authors administered the Hungarian standard version of Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the translated version of the Ottawa Self Injury Inventory (OSI) to students of 3 educational facilities in a county town. Fourteen to eighteen year old pupils were tested in order to measure the key symptoms of depression and the frequency and characteristics of self-injurious behaviour among this sample of the high school population. Twentysix youngsters were found to have had any form of self-injurious actions in their life-time. The paper presents descriptive data on the basis of statistics of symptom occurence. Although the depressive symptoms have an expected correlation with the self-injurious ideas,depression seems not to have the same relationships with actual self-harm action. In study B, the authors present descriptive statistics on the data of 48 female outpatients from the total pool of 72 adolescents aged 14 through to-18 years (average age 16.1 years) showing symptoms of self-injurious behavior according to the Ottawa Self Injury Inventory (OSI). All patients were recruited from a one-year clinical,representative sample of the \"Pannonia\" multicentre adolescent psychiatry survey. Ten point two percent of consecutively referred and 25.6% of treated adolescent patients had symptoms of self-injurious behavior over a one-year period in 4 Transdanubian Child Psychiatric Centers, which is more frequent than the expected rate. Referring to the clinical diagnoses of adolescents confirmed by M.I.N.I. Plus Diagnostic Interview, the authors estimate, that the majority of these young people suffered from episode(s) of present or past major depression, from whatever form of anxiety disorder and\/or from suicidal behaviour. The study presents details of risk behavior including motivations, frequency of acts, ideas, afflicted body regions, emotional correlates, secondary obtained benefits , escalation of problem behavior and consequences in detail.","2306":"This study aim was to describe the epidemiology of intentional self-poisoning among students. A cross-sectional study was conducted on self-poisoned students admitted to Loghman-Hakim Hospital in Tehran, Iran. Variables studied included age, sex, substance abuse, personal history, familial history and the immediate precipitant for the suicide attempt. A total of 248 students (200 F and 48 M) studied. The mean age was 16.3+\/-1.42 years. Self poisoning with a pharmaceutical agent was the most common attempt modality (87.5%). The most common precipitant for the suicide attempt was family conflict (54.4%), followed by romantic disappointment (29.4%). The most common psychiatric disorders were adjustment disorder (84.3%). and depression (18.1%). The emphasis in student suicide prevention programs must be on early identification of students at risk, and appropriate treatment of episodes of psychopathology. ","2307":"This review is describing different models of case management, showing their similarities and differences with regards to the way they operate. Good relationship between patient and case manager, application of the biopsychosocial model, availability of psychosocial treatment methods and rehabilitation programs, and individual treatment plan are all important factors in case management's success. Large number of studies supports the application of case management in practice as effective treatment method in treating people with severe mental disorder, particularly those, who are less co-operative. Therefore, the implementation of case management into psychiatric practice should be supported.","2308":"A body of biochemical evidence suggests that abnormal phospholipid metabolism may play a role in the etiology of schizophrenia, and possibly, other psychiatric and neurological diseases. Niacin, a B-complex vitamin, induces prostaglandin synthesis, vasodilatation, and skin flushing when applied as a solution on the skin or taken orally. In schizophrenia, diminished or absent skin response to niacin represents a robust finding. Attenuated niacin skin-flush response has been analysed as a potential biochemical marker of impaired prostaglandin signaling in schizophrenia. Diminished skin redness after topical application of niacin might be caused by a reduced level of the precursor arachidonic acid in the peripheral membranes, increased activity of the enzyme phospholipase A2, abnormal expression of niacin or prostaglandin receptors, or poor vasomotor activity of cutaneous capillary walls. Heritability estimates established in several studies support niacin skin flush response as a vulnerability trait for the development of psychosis. However, the exact mechanism of a reduced skin flush, the possible influence of the long-term use of antipsychotics, and the usefulness of the test for diagnostic purpose are not clear yet. Niacin skin flush test is a simple, non-invasive and easily replicable method in the research of schizophrenia. The studies investigating niacin flushing in schizophrenia are numerous but incoherent regarding methods of niacin application and evaluation of the results. New studies, controlling adequately for age, sex, drug abuse, diet, as well as genetic factors that may influence the intensity and reaction time, are necessary to clarify the usefulness of niacin testing in psychiatry. ","2309":"Somatic illness is frequently associated with depression and anxiety and major depression significantly increases risk of severe medical conditions, e.g. cardiovascular illness. One of the most frequent comorbidities is that of depression and pain. Alterations in noradrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmissions in the central nervous system have been implicated in the joint pathophysiology of depression and chronic pain. Antidepressants, alone or in combination with psychotherapy, are an effective treatment option in such cases. The newer dual action antidepressants (milnacipran, venlafaxine, duloxetine) acting specifically on both noradrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmitter systems are presumably more reliable in pain management. So far, the most extensively studied drug has been duloxetine. Twelve randomized placebo-controlled trials with the total number of 4,108 patients suffering from pain associated with major depressive disorder suggested consistent analgesic efficacy of duloxetine, especially in fibromyalgia and peripheral neuropathic pain.","2310":"","2311":"This paper describes how a team who would work in the community with patients from the rehabilitation unit of Ljubljana psychiatric hospital was developed and what the results of treatment of a group of these patients were in terms of admission and relapse rate. The admission and relapse rate of these patients was markedly reduced by working assertively with them in the community.","2312":"","2313":"Developing useful outcome measures for the treatment of serious mental illness remains an important challenge for the newly re-configured Mental Health Services in the United Kingdom, towards the latter part of the ten year period covered by the National Service Framework. The present authors have taken the opportunity to develop a method for measuring outcomes in psychotic illness while developing a service for Early Intervention in Psychosis. The results are mentioned shown, but will be discussed in detail elsewhere. This article will focus on the development of the method for measurements which demonstrate functional improvement and improvement in quality of life. We shall show that, in order to measure outcomes, it is necessary to systematically record information from the first presentation of the case, so as later to be able to demonstrate what change has been accomplished. We shall also demonstrate that this activity is part of a necessary ongoing audit activity for services, but that, since there is no certain knowledge of what outcomes could have been expected prior to the implementation of new service developments, it is necessary to include a control group recruited from previous services, in order to establish meaningful benchmarks or norms to which the outcomes of a new service such a control group constitutes audit rather than research, but should be still amenable to statistical analysis. In order to be meaningful, and since serious mental illness may well be chronic, it is necessary that outcome measures should be carried out regularly, after specified periods of time. We also argue for the use of appropriate rating scales, which measure both the number and the intensity of symptoms and for computer base notes in order to facilitate regular audit.","2314":"","2315":"The symptoms and the individual experience of psychosis vary from patient to patient. Treatment, medication and cognitive psychotherapy are targeted mostly on positive and lately also on negative symptoms of psychosis. Deficits in metacognition found in patients with psychosis have a profound impact on the recovery process, their quality of life and experience of mental pain. Long term group psychotherapy helps patients to mourn their loss, improve their metacognition, and reduce the stigma and mental pain in patients with psychosis.","2316":"Care for families and children of people with severe mental illness is a professionally and politically neglected issue. The majority of countries provide only services for several needs of the patients' families, i.e. treatment, custody and counselling. Management of stress and resolving of common problems are rarely addressed. Children of people with mental illness reflect and call professional attention to this issues. The deficiency of services is to be addressed by multidisciplinary team efforts. In the Slovenian organization of health services coordination could be provided by family physicians.","2317":"In this paper I wish to draw attention to Balint's concept of 'the Child as the presenting symptom' and ask whether this concept is relevant to us as psychiatrists. What arises is whether this concept might illuminate situations where there is serious mental illness in the family, and whether the presentation of a child to a doctor might be indicative of mental illness in the family. If such an interpretation is possible, then there are important clinical implications, since at present, all UK government guidance, based on the analysis of many high-profile cases where children have been severely abused, is that the needs of the child are paramount, and thence it may be that, whilst quite dramatic intervention may well occur in order to protect the child, perhaps the mental health needs of the parents might be somewhat overlooked. Examples of the interplay between child and parents in the context of mental illness are given, and the present way in which children within families where there is mental illness are cared for is described, also considering the consequences for the parents.","2318":"In this review of Psychosis and gender we will present the relevant. Treatment principles and consider the foreign and local published data.","2319":"This paper is based on the Danish National Schizophrenia Project manual for psychodynamic individual psychotherapy with persons in states of schizophrenia. The methods for engaging with and treating a patient with schizophrenia in a supportive, psychodynamic way are described.","2320":"In comparison to female schizophrenia patients male patients have more impaired premorbid functioning, earlier onset of disorder, more severe symptomatology, less favourable outcome, different structural brain abnormalities and cognitive deficits. It has been hypothesized that estrogen, with effects on both neurodevelopment and neurotransmission, could play a protective role in women with schizophrenia and account for some of the gender differences observed in the disorder. On the other hand, it is known that altered promoter DNA methylation could play a critical role in mediating differential regulation of genes and in facilitating short-term adaptation in response to the environment. This data could indicate that environmental factors have gender specific influence on DNA methylation changes in schizophrenia. Recent data support the epigenetic theory of major psychosis and suggest that DNA-methylation changes are important to the etiology of psychosis in a gender specific pattern. Clinically observed gender differences in schizophrenia are probably influenced by genetic and environmental factors. The interplay between those two sets of factors is mediated by estrogen and epigenetic mechanisms.","2321":"Neuro-protection in this context is an important concept in the treatment of patients in the early, prodromal phase of psychosis, otherwise known as the 'At Ultra High Risk Mental State'. Neuro-protection as described here refers to the use of agents to control the process of apoptosis, which occurs more rapidly in the earliest phases of schizophrenia. There is a need to identify medications with fewer side effects than anti-psychotics in order to treat at risk mental states, or prodromal psychosis. Studies have shown that schizophrenia occurs in males at an earlier age than females. Later, at about the time of the menopause, there is a second peak in the incidence of psychosis (schizophrenia) in women. Hence it has been suggested that Oestrogen may be neuroprotective. Studies have shown that the addition of oestradiol to anti-psychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia in females increased the efficacy of the treatment, which suggests that oestrogen does indeed have a neuroprotective action. However oestrogen has never been used in 'at ultra high risk mental states', perhaps because of concern regarding side effects.","2322":"The paper presents the course of the seventh relapse of a 25 years old female patient, further-on referred to as 'I. O.' The impact on the therapeutic group of which 'IO' was a part is described.","2323":"Sexuality and sexual disorders of patients with psychoses are frequently neglected and under-investigated. The main purpose of the present study is to discuss the subjective experience of sexuality in patients with psychosis within the general psychodynamic and phenomenological understandings of psychotic states. The authors, both psychotherapists, dealing with patients with psychoses, reflected experiences from their clinical work with the help of the conceptual frameworks of psychodynamic and phenomenological psychiatry. Willingness and need of patients to talk about sexuality, non-specificity of frequencies and variety of sexual disorders in psychotic patients, difficulties in establishment of a stable (sexual) identity and the question of homosexuality, absence of sexual activities with others and feelings of guilt and inadequacy, masturbation with its functions, impulsive sexual acts or lack of sexual self-control, erotic delusions and erotic transference were the main findings, dominating the sexual sphere of these patients. All these manifestations of sexuality in patients with psychosis can be seen - as exposed in discussion - as consequences of a basic self-disorder (phenomenological perspective) or of difficulties in regulating closeness and distance (psychodynamic perspective). Reasons of avoidance of treatment of sexuality by the therapists of psychotic patients are discussed as well. Implications for dealing with sexuality issues in psychotherapy of patients with psychoses were drawn from the above findings in the last part of the article.","2324":"In accordance with the predominant view on the neurobiology of schizophrenia, most of the research on the differences in the illness between men and women has been studied on the basis of sex difference as a biological category rather than on the basis of gender as a psychosocial category. There are gender- identity difficulties observed in schizophrenia. Problems associated with gender can be a major source of instability and vulnerability during the development of the first and later psychotic episodes. There is a need for future research to view sex difference through gender perspectives. Findings from a gender study may have utility for the development of differential treatment interventions for men and women and may improve the outcome of the illness in general. The study of the complex role of gender in illness processes is an important research direction that would enhance our understanding of the heterogeneity in the manifestation and subjective experience of schizophrenia.","2325":"Psychosis and depression are syndromes that affect the most basic human processes of perception and judgment. Traditional dichotomous classification of psychotic and affective disorders resolved in strict separation between schizophrenia on one hand and bipolar disorder and recurrent depressive disorder on the other hand. However, it is not uncommon that depression and psychosis as syndromes are expressed together in the course of the same mental disorder. According to recent knowledge on the molecular level there are probably many multiple susceptibility genes involved in the pathogenesis of both psychotic and affective disorders, each of small effect, which act in conjunction with environmental factors. Research data indicates a significant overlap in genetic susceptibility across the traditional classification categories of psychotic disorders and affective disorders. It seems that a new classification and research approach will provide better understanding of severe mental disorders and explain the usefulness of some medications in different groups of these disorders.","2326":"The different causes of misdiagnosis in psychiatry are reviewed, and the ethical implications of such misdiagnoses are discussed.","2327":"","2328":"In this theoretical paper with a clinical focus, three different meanings of depression in schizophrenia spectrum patients - depression as a reaction to schizophrenia, as an integral part of it, and as an independent disorder - are exposed and discussed from a phenomenological point of view. A well-reflected schizophrenia patient is briefly introduced in order to illustrate the clinical relevance of the aforementioned distinctions. The clinical relevance of thorough phenomenological and hermeneutical analysis of patients' experiences ranges from diagnostic to psychotherapeutic implications.","2329":"Modern societies are growing ever more sensitive to the various sources and many kinds of psychic traumas, resulting even in psychotic reactions or states of functioning. Especially the war captivity situation represents the prolonged basis for chronic severe psychic stress and traumatisation, that may become deleterious even for the core self of the person. Severely psychotraumatized war veterans, or ex-POWs in the aftermath of the war captivity situation, survivors of extreme forms of violence and humiliation, are very reluctant to recall traumas. This avoidant behaviour is many times one of the most prominent symptoms that should be recognised and confronted in order to start the retraumatising process of healing the previously unthinkable traumas. The authors believe that shameful feelings are at the very basis of the psychotraumatised persons' withdrawal, depression, suicidal attempts, and even psychotic answers. The main feature of the first phase of any therapeutic work with these patients is the mourning process that should be gradually unfolded. The clinical examples will illustrate therapeutic work with these patients. The authors will expose some basic psychodynamic approaches and concepts regarding shame. This difficult feeling will be put in relationship with the psychotic answers. In that frame of reference the concept of 'near psychosis' will be described.","2330":"Psychosis brings burden to the families of patients with psychosis. The Zung rating scale for depression has been used to evaluate depressive symptoms in the relatives of patients with psychosis that have been attending the 'Group with a significant other' for the last five years. When we sent the Zung rating scale for depression to the families of the schizophrenic patients' (which are or were part of the 'Group with a significant other' in the last five years), the results showed 2\/3 of the patients had already become depressed due to the illness' effects. This is a much more common phenomena here than in the entire population. Cooperation within the Group has positive effects, such as reducing isolation and stigmatization, while it also works encouragingly on the emotional climate this is very important for reducing depression.","2331":"","2332":"The psychiatric ward is a complex organization. It contains two main groups: the patients and the staff. The different needs of each group influence the encounters between patients, the consumers, and staff, the suppliers. We shall discuss those needs and analyze the ways they interfere with or complement the therapeutic group work. For example: staff members need specific therapeutic group work for their professional development, and the patients need the group in order to maintain some form of interpersonal contact and to keep themselves active. The staff holds therapeutic groups in order to monitor the activity on the ward, while the patients seek a space where they can express their concerns about their treatment. Some vignettes will be presented which demonstrate these different needs, of staff and patients, and the way they were explored in the staff's group supervision meetings.","2333":"A diagnosis of psychosis has tended to discount the considerable degree of emotional disorder associated with it, in a manner that may also inform psychological treatment options. Depression and anxiety are often associated with schizophrenia. Up to 40% of people have clinical levels of depression and anxiety symptoms could occur in 60% of patients with chronic psychotic disorder. Among emotional problems depression and depressive symptoms are well recognised and treated with success, whereas anxiety is a less known phenomenon and has not been studied as much as depression. Comorbid anxiety disorders or symptoms (social phobia, panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder) occur in patients with psychosis in the same way as in patients who have only anxiety disorder. This comorbidity adversely affects outcome, and it may also reflect on processes underlying the development of psychotic symptoms. The present review highlights some major characteristics of anxiety and psychosis and also some aspects of coping and treatment strategies for anxiety in patients with psychosis.","2334":"This is a summary and transcription of a talk given to ISPS Slovenia in Bled in 2006. It assesses the research evidence for a biological basis for psychological treatments.","2335":"A team from the Rehabilitation unit of Ljubljana psychiatric clinic attended a course on community care in London in October and November 2005. Because we decided that the methods presented to us could be of great use in Slovenia where the Health system is lacking such services we decided to implement them after our return. Immediately after we returned we started to carry out our plan. We designated our target group which were patients who poorly participated in treatment or had multiple and severe difficulties functioning and retaining their progress after discharge. Our goals were to improve patient participation in treatment before and after discharge, less and shorter hospitalizations and better integration of patients into society. Initial results are very positive, which leaves me much hope for further implementation of assertive outreach and community care in Slovenia.","2336":"When looking back in the history of psychiatry, the concept of reactivity had very variable impact on ethiological considerations. If classification of mental disorders is taken as a proxy, it seems that this impact is presently at the lowest that it has been in the last hundred years. The author gives a short historical overview of concept of reactive psychosis, followed by a description of the current state of the art. He pleads for a rethinking of the current position as stated in ICD-10. Reintroduction of a certain degree of the reactivity concept into the classification seems to be required.","2337":"A review of the different forms of anxiety is presented and the phenomenological and anthropological aspects of different types of anxiety are described. Clinical and neurobiological aspects of anxiety are then discussed, and the relationship of psychosis to anxiety is then described.","2338":"This is a summary of a lecture given in Portoroz, Slovenia, in 2005. It is clearly totally derivative, and I acknowledge all authors on whom I drew to give the lecture. A literature review has been carried out to describe present knowledge of how psychosis develops, and to describe the concepts of early intervention in psychosis, the critical period, the duration of untreated psychosis, and the prodrome of psychotic illness. Hence, the principles of how an early intervention service intended to deal with first psychotic episodes of illness is described. The setting up of such a service in Luton, Bedfordshire is then described, and its first results are assessed.","2339":"The historical development of the psychodynamic approach to psychotherapy is described.

Metabolic syndrome and mental disorders in pregnant women are rarely investigated, especially in pathological pregnancy. To determine a relationship between predisposed factors in pregnancy and the occurrence of metabolic syndrome as well as to determine the occurrence of psychological symptoms and disorders in pregnant women. The tested sample consisted of 162 pregnant women (80 with normal and 82 with pathological pregnancy). For the examination, 3 questionnaires were used: clinical, laboratory, ultrasound and radiological scanning. Metabolic syndrome was diagnosed according to WHO criteria, and psychological symptoms by using the SCL 90-R questionnaire. Metabolic syndrome was confirmed in 19 (23.2%) women with pathological pregnancy. These women had a greater prevalence of psychological symptoms (p&lt;0.001). Women with pathological pregnancy who are diagnosed with metabolic syndrome showed significantly more psychological symptoms. ","2341":"Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease affecting approximately 6% of the general population. Depression and schizophrenia are often comorbid with diabetes. There are two main ways to explain this phenomenon. Firstly, patients with diabetes mellitus have higher incidence of psychiatric disorders and secondly, antidepressants and antipsychotics may cause metabolic abnormalities. Antidepressants with noradrenergic activity have the highest potential to cause metabolic abnormalities. In schizophrenia, the risk is highest with clozapine and olanzapine pose the highest risk, moderate for risperidone and quetiapine, while ziprasidone and sertindole have not been associated with diabetes. American Diabetes Association and American Psychiatric Association suggested that optimal management of patients with schizophrenia should include baseline assessment on their weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, blood glucose level and lipidogram and family history on obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension and cardiovascular illness. During the first three months, weight gain should be monitored on monthly basis, while biochemical analysis should be performed after the first three months, and then once a year. In patients with significant weight gain, increase of blood glucose level or dyslipidemia, the first intervention should be switch to another antipsychotic. If necessary, a patient should be referred to an endocrinologist and advised on changing their life style.","2342":"qEEG investigations present differences in the comparison of schizophrenic patients and healthy examinees, as well as of depressive patients and healthy controls. The comparison of \"positive\" and \"negative\" schizophrenia also presents differences in the qEEG parameters. Changes in qEEG are various in these studies, but not always consistent. In this research we wanted to compare \"positive\" schizophrenia, \"negative\" schizophrenia and depression. The sample comprised 55 examinees (all women): 20 patients with \"positive\" schizophrenia, 15 patients with \"negative\" schizophrenia and 20 patients with depression. The standard EEG registration was done in all of them. From the recorded material, the 20-second period without artifacts was analyzed by the FFT method. The results were presented as absolute special power values (muV(2)) for individual segments of the spectrum: delta (0.5-4.0), theta (4.0-8.0), alpha (8.0-13.0) and beta (13.0-30.0). The observed regions included Fp1, Fp2, F3, F4, F7, F8, T3, T4, P3, P4, O1 and O2. The \"positive\" type schizophrenia differs from the \"negative\" in the increase in both delta and theta activities, and in the decline of beta activity over frontal regions. The \"positive\" type of schizophrenia differs from depression in the increase in delta activity over frontal regions, while the \"negative\" form of schizophrenia differs from it in the decrease in beta activity over frontal regions. qEEG parameters differ in the comparison of \"positive\" and \"negative\" types of schizophrenia. These differences are more numerous and more significant than those obtained in the comparison of each of these types of schizophrenia with depression. ","2343":"The authors presented a patient with schizophrenia and with early parallel development of neurologic symptoms. At first, symptoms were manifested by extrapyramidal syndrome due to appliance of typical neuroleptics. Therefore, therapeutic approach was diverted to implementation of atipycal antiypsychotics. Consequently patient developed orofacial diskyinesias which progrediated in unilateral choreo-atetoid movements. This followed two hospitalizations for diagnostic workup and correction of therapy. Only repeated brain MR showed moderate cortical atrophy. However, even with different therapeutic changes and approaches, we were not able to reach any significant shift neither in psychiatric nor neurologic disturbances. The resistence on pharmacologic threapy led to suspicion of parallel development of neurologic disorder in form of Huntington chorea. Still remains the question whether primary neurologic disorder provoked psychotic process or there were two separate disorders where pharmacologic intervention accelerated expansion of neurologic disorder.","2344":"Diagnostic recognition and distinguishing of psychotropic side effects which are phenomenological Identical\/similar to symptoms and\/or signs of psychiatric disorders undergoing psychotropic treatment, is an integral element within the general diagnostic procedure. Unrecognising and undistinguishing of psychotropic-induced side effects from psychopathological phenomena and\/or physical signs which are, according to relevant classification criteria, standard parts of psychiatric disorders, most frequently can cause increase the dose of the psychotropic medication, assigning of the unwarranted diagnoses, and\/or addition of unnecessary medications. Some of the most frequent side effects that can be caused by the diagnostic difficulties and\/or misjudgements of the phenomenological recognition and differentiating side effects from psychiatric symptoms and signs are: drug-induced akathisia, intensive anticholinergic pharmacodynamic effects including delirium, neuroleptic induced Parkinsonism, paradoxically antidepressants-induced worsening or re-emerging depression, acute dystonia and tardive dyskinesia and others. In conclusion, differential diagnosis of these side effects requires careful evaluation based on clinical experience and knowledge.","2345":"Variation in the human genome may explain genetic contributions to complex traits and common diseases. Until recently, single nucleotide polymorphisms were thought to be the most prevalent form of interindividual genetic variation. However, structural genomic rearrangements such as deletions, duplications, and inversions lead to variation in gene copy number and contribute even more to genomic diversity. Other sources of genomic variation include noncoding genes, pseudogenes, and mobile genetic elements (transposons). Genome dynamics, including changes in gene number and position as well as epigenetic modifications of coding and noncoding sequences, can affect regulation of gene expression and may contribute to the variability of complex phenotypes. ","2346":"Ethics is an indispensable component of health care policy. Pharmacotherapy of comorbidity requires the use of a greater number of different drugs that have complex drug-drug interactions and drug-patient interactions which can cause various side-effects in the patient. The basic moral questions that justify the applied psychopharmacotherapy are the patient's welfare and preference, optimal relationship between risk and gain for the patient, and some include cost benefit as well.","2347":"Social anxiety is very common in children and leads to considerable impairment. Some of the biological and psychosocial risks are well known. The analysis of these factors may help to understand the symptomatology for planning preventive and therapeutic interventions.","2348":"This article discusses diagnostic features of social phobia, social skills and (anxious) avoidant personality disorder, and gives an overview on principles of cognitive behaviour therapy strategies used in social anxiety patients. Motivation to change and the therapeutic relationship are important issues to be worked on at the beginning and throughout therapy. Functional analysis focuses on interactional and systemic features. Three specific programmes dealing with anxiety management, social skills training and relaxation techniques are presented (Gruppentraining sozialer Kompetenzen, Hinsch und Pfingsten (2007); Soziale Phobien, ein kognitiv-verhaltenstherapeutisches Behandlungsmanual, Stangier et al. (2003) und Soziales Kompetenztraining, Gruppentherapie bei sozialen Angsten und Defiziten, Alsleben und Hand (2006)).","2349":"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is considered to be one of the most common anxiety disorders. Despite its high prevalence, the disorder is still considerably underdiagnosed and undertreated. SAD shows a typically early onset in childhood or early adolescence and generally becomes chronic. The disease places a massive burden on patients lives, affecting not only their social interactions but also their educational and professional activities, thereby constituting a severe disability. Although substantial progress in the study of the etiology of SAD has been made, no commonly accepted model has emerged yet. Data from genetic and neuroimaging studies point towards a contribution of several neurotransmitter systems (i.e. norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin) to the pathophysiology of this disorder. Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have repeatedly emphasized the central role of the amygdalae and insula in the neural circuitry of the disorder. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are commonly accepted as first line therapy, however other substance classes like serotonin norepineprine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), benzodiazepines and several other agents have also proved effective. There is still a substantial lack of data on therapeutic options in cases of non-responsive SAD as well as on add-on therapy. A combined treatment-approach including psychotherapy (e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy) may prove useful.","2350":"Based on present diagnostic criteria daily routine of patients with social phobia is described in detail with all its social, educational and occupational impacts. Suffering of affected people is classified as a disease and in need of treatment.","2351":"This paper gives an overview on the epidemiology of social phobia. About 4.5% of the adult general populations suffer from social phobia, i.e. it is the most frequent of all anxiety disorders. Social phobia is clearly more frequent among women than among men. About the half of all individuals with social phobia suffer from any comorbid mental disorders. Reviews show a large variability between single studies, probably due to methodological differences. Several population surveys indicate that a marked proportion of those with social phobia do not receive adequate treatment.","2352":"","2353":"","2354":"Our mouth is the mirror of our health and it might be said that numerous diseases which affect our organism may be manifested in the mouth. Early symptoms occurring within the oral cavity may emerge with diseases related to our blood system, gastrointestinal system, renal system, cardiovascular system, and mental system. They are manifested as a hyperkeratosis, which may have an erithematous background. What we talk about here is lichen ruber planus. Lichen ruber planus is a common chronic immunological inflammatory disease of mucosa and skin, whose manifestations vary from karatolytic to eritematous and ulcerating lesions. The most frequent psychogenic diseases which may lead to the emerging of lichen planus are depression, anxiety and stress. Depression is a condition of decreased psychophysical activity predominated by sadness, apathy and slowed-down pessimistic thinking. Anxiety is a complex feeling comprising anxiety, fear, tension and insecurity, and is accompanied by the activation of autonomic nervous system. Stress is a reaction to trauma, and it enhances survival.","2355":"There is a dearth of epidemiological research on psychosis. Little is known about how psychosis rates vary within contrasting urban areas. Variation in rates would have implications for the aetiology of psychosis. The aim was to determine the variation in psychosis prevalence in different areas of a city. We conducted a retrospective audit of the caseloads of the four Community Mental Health Teams (CMHTs) in Luton. Caseloads were categorised by diagnoses recorded in the medical notes, and by patient age. We performed a descriptive analysis of the levels of psychosis in each CMHT, considered against parameters including deprivation and ethnicity as recorded in the 2001 UK census. Areas with high indices of deprivation, and a large ethnic minority and migrant population, demonstrated higher rates of psychosis. Our findings are consistent with, the MRC Aetiology &amp; Ethnicity of Schizophrenia &amp; Other Psychoses study. Increased rates of psychosis observed in areas with large migrant and ethnic minority populations, and in areas of high deprivation, have implications for the planning of local services, and in further understanding the role of environmental factors in the aetiology of psychosis. There is a need for further prospective epidemiological studies at this geographical scale. ","2356":"There is no data on depression prevalence in Croatia. The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence and psychosocial risk factors of depression in the adult population of the Croatian capital Zagreb, particularly in patients suffering from Depressive episode (F32) and Recurrent depressive disorder (F33). A cross-sectional study was preformed on a representative sample for city of Zagreb drawn from 10 family physicians' offices with 17290 patients. From standardized medical files, the family physicians sorted out data of patients with depression, both Depressive episodes (F32) and Recurrent depressive disorder (F33), classified according to ICD 10. Psychosocial parameters were assessed according to the core questions for the management of psychosocial risk factors recommended by the European Guidelines on Cardiovascular Disease Prevention in Clinical Practice. The prevalence of depression was 2.2%. Recognized socioeconomical parameters were: female sex (74.7%), middle age 45-65 years (40.7%), married (55.3%), high school education (59.2%), retired (54.5%), and average economical status (73.6%). As regards social isolation: depressive patients were not living alone (71.5%), they had help in case of illness (80.9%), and had no problems with their partner (36.8%). Work stress parameters were estimated between 5 and 6. Life satisfaction was estimated mean +\/- SD=4.57+\/-1.72. Logistic regression analysis showed a significant association between higher education and physicians' perception as \"more depressed and more difficult\" patients with Recurrent depressive disorder (F33). Family physicians were unfamiliar with the genealogical disease burden for 45% of depressive patients, whether they had closed confident for 21.93% and problems with partner for 30.80%. Depression had a prevalence of 2.2%. It was poorly recognized, as were some psychosocial factors especially genealogical disease burden. This suggests the need for implementation of special intervention methods of developing the family physicians'skills in adopting the psychosocial approach to depressive patients with a focus on recognized psychosocial risk factors. ","2357":"Activities of daily living, play a key role in the measurement of functional health as defined by the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) and in prevention and treatment of mental or somatic illnesses. From a clinical context it is important to discriminate between basic \"activities of daily living, ADL\", \"intentional activities of daily living, IADL\", and \"recreational activities of daily living, RADL\". While ADL and IADL have gained much attention in dementia, the elderly, or severe somatic illnesses, there is a lack of research on RADL, which are important in depression, anxiety, or other neurotic disorders. 154 unselected inpatients of a department of behavioral and psychosomatic medicine filled in the \"Check List of Recreational Activities\" to assess the rates and profiles of RADL. Patients reported on average 19.3 (s.d. 7.0) activities (range 4 - 40), i.e. males 21.3 (s.d. 6.5, 9 - 34) and females 18.9 (s.d. 7.1, 4 - 40). Most frequent RADL were passive and unspecific activities like \"watching tv\" (93.4%). Least frequent were activities which need special skills or preparation like \"horse back riding\" (0.7%). Low rates were also found for activities which are in the centre of inpatient occupational therapy like \"ceramics\" (4.7%) or \"silk-painting\" (2.6%). There are differences between sexes but not in respect to age (18 to 60), sick leave and unemployment, or diagnostic status. When patients were asked what they would like to do in the future, the same activity profile emerged as when looking at what they had done in the last month The data give a reference profile for recreational activities, help to define what can be considered a normal frequency and spectrum of RADL, and, by this, can guide therapeutic interventions. ","2358":"Vehicle accidents are a common cause of disease and death among people over 30 years of age. Essentially, reaction to stress due to the vehicle accident does not differ from the reaction to other stress factors. There are still no uniform viewpoints about the kind of sequels and their percentage representation after vehicle accidents. The research was provided as a prospective study, included 150 subjects who had vehicle accident minimum 2 years prior to the examination. A questionnaire adjusted to the needs of the research and a battery of psychological tests was used. Affective disorders occurred in 35.33% of subjects, 65% of persons suffer from travel anxiety, 9% of the total number of examinees doesn't drive any more, 65% have somatisational dysfunctions of the vegetative nervous system, while the posttraumatic stress disorder is present in 36% of subjects. In 87.4% of persons psychiatric consequences last over two years. Long term consequences in 60% of subjects occur as a combination of multiple psychiatric disorders, so the posttraumatic stress disorder and affective disorders never occur one at a time. ","2359":"Our research objective was to estimate the characteristics of major depressive disorder and social adaptation of women displaced during the war in Croatia in the early 1990s. We aimed to establish the relationship between major depressive disorder and displacement and study its impact on the outcome of depression in order to improve treatment and avoid possible complications. A group of 20 women, 35 to 55 years of age, displaced some time during the 199l.-1995. war in Croatia were compared to 27 women of the same age but with no experience of exile. All the patients suffered from major depressive disorder based upon DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, the Zung Self Rating Depression Scale and the Social Adaptation Self-evaluation Scale were used. The objective intensity of depression of the displaced significantly decreased over time but not their personal experience of depression. All depressed patients manifested poor social adaptation. Many aspects of social functioning remained poor even after the improvement of depressive disorder. Displacement characteristics were: the length of time spent in exile, the place, and the circumstances of displacement regarding the members of the family accompanying the displaced women. These characteristics significantly influenced the expression of their major depressive disorder as well as social functioning. Displaced persons\/refugees are at high risk of developing depressive disorder. Recognition of all risk factors and early diagnosis of depressive disorder followed by appropriate treatment could decrease the risk of chronic and complicated depression as well as the risk of poor social adaptation.","2360":"The 1992-1995 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) has had a tremendous impact on civilians; thousands of inhabitants were left with numerous traumatic experiences. Many children suffered or witnessed horrifying acts of violence and aggression. Although young trauma victims are often resilient, many experience mental health difficulties, including PTSD. The aim of the study was to estimate whether psychosocial support given by the School Project of Humanitarian Association of \" Prijateljice\" reduced posttraumatic consequences in students in primary and secondary schools in Bosnia and Herzegovina after 1992-1995 war. A stratified sample of 336 students in primary and secondary schools located in two entities of North-East Bosnia and Herzegovina, involved in psychosocial support, was compared with 72 voluntarily selected same-age students from the same schools who were not involved in this project. Data were collected on two occasions, beginning of December 2005 and end of May 2006, by using a self-evaluation survey method for measuring symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) according to DSM IV. The Index of Children Post-traumatic reactions were used. The severity of PTSD symptoms among students involved in the School Project decreased from (mean+\/-standard deviation=35.3+\/-10.2 to 26.7+\/-8.7) (t=13.1, P&lt;0.001, Paired sample test), whereas in the group with no psychosocial assistance this reduction was from (29.7+\/-10.9 to 28.1+\/-11.8) (t=0.9, P=0.396, Paired sample test). This study suggests that work with students by giving them psychosocial support within the School Project resulted in significant reduction of PTSD symptoms' severity. ","2361":"This paper explores the essential features of recovery and the need for an existential approach in psychiatry. The biopsychosocial model often fails to sufficiently validate the existential suffering of patients. We review the major principles of recovery and the philosophical and psychiatric principles of existentialism. The ontological or intrinsic existential issues of death, isolation, freedom and meaninglessness are described and their manifestations are explored in clinical syndromes. When ultimate existential concerns are recognised, patients have an opportunity to understand their life on a deeper level that is not defined as a medical disorder but as a part of human existence. Understanding that existential concerns underlie a great deal of human behaviour helps to free patients from the stigma of psychiatric labels. An existential approach is a humanistic way toward recovery.","2362":"There has been significant confusion about the relative advantage of new generation antipsychotics over first generation antipsychotics as well as of clinical trials performed to evaluate their efficacy vs. those designed to evaluate their effectiveness. Pragmatic or effectiveness clinical trials like CATIE and CUtLASS sponsored by governments have challenged the current worldview of the greater advantages of new generation over first generation antipsychotics and suggested more clinical applicability of older antipsychotics. Public policy regarding the role and place of modern antipsychotics in schizophrenia treatment is usually guided by the imperfect state of clinical trials and by economic constraints. The right question is not whether new generation antipsychotics are better than first generation antipsychotics in terms of effectiveness, tolerability and safety. How to reach personalized , evidence based and value oriented decision making in the complex treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, that is the question now. Personalized medicine in psychiatry is not possible without the availability of enough number of different modern antipsychotics.","2363":"","2364":"For the past several years a numerous studies in the field of forensic psychiatry confirmed a close relationship between violent offenders and comorbid substance abuse. The comorbid substance abuse in violent offenders was usually unrecognized and misdiagnosed. Furthermore, comorbidity in forensic psychiatry describes the co-occurrence of two or more conditions or psychiatric disorder known in the literature as dual diagnosis and defined by World Health Organization (WHO). In fact, many violent offenders have multiple psychiatric diagnoses. Recent studies have confirmed causal relationship between major psychiatric disorders and concomitant substance abuse (comorbidity) in 50-80% of forensic cases. In general, there is a high level of psychiatric comorbidity in forensic patients with prevalence of personality disorders (50-90%), mood disorders (20-60%) and psychotic disorders (15-20%) coupled with substance abuse disorders. Moreover, the high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities could be found in mentally retarded individuals, as well as, in epileptic patients. Drugs and alcohol abuse can produce serious psychotoxic effects that may lead to extreme violent behavior and consequently to serious criminal offence such as physical assault, rape, armed robbery, attempted murder and homicide, all due to an altered brain function and generating psychotic-like symptoms. Studies have confirmed a significant statistical relevance in causal relationship between substance abuse and violent offences. In terms of forensic psychiatry, the comorbidity strongly contributes in the process of establishing psychiatric diagnosis of diminished mental capacity or insanity at the time of the offence in the course of clinical assessment and evaluation of violent offenders. Today, the primary focus of forensic psychiatry treatment services (in-patient or community) is management of the violent offenders with psychiatric comorbidity which requires a multilevel, evidence based approach to the patient. Forensic treatment service effectiveness appears to be associated with individual case management and approach including psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy and occupational therapy in order to achieve optimal rehabilitation, prevention of recidivism and stability in social functioning of the patient in the community.","2365":"Involuntary emotional expression disorder (IEED) is syndrome characterized with relatively stereotypical episodes of uncontrollable crying and\/or laughing. Additionally, this syndrome can include irritability, anger and frustration. This syndrome is common among a number of neurologic diseases like patients with a stroke or traumatic brain injury (TBI), patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), as well as dementias such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), and motor disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). IEED is very common but misdiagnosed and consequently undertreated. Prevalence of IEED in AD is between 15-39%. Recent controlled clinical studies suggest that dextromethorphan (DM) and quinidine (Q) is an effective treatment for IEED. United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for filing and review its New Drug Application (NDA) for Zenvia (dextromethorphan hydrobromide and quinidine sulfate capsules) for the treatment of IEED. In Republic of Croatia current treatment involves antidepressants (tricyclic and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), antipsychotic agents, anxiolytics, antidementives and mood stabilizers. New promising treatment can reduce the frequency of episodes and improve the quality of life of patients and their families and caregivers.","2366":"Posttraumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) is a disorder which emerges after the patient has experienced one or more psychotraumatic events, which equally include neurobiological deregulation and psychological dysfunction. Comorbidity is present in more than 80% of the diagnosed cases of PTSD, which makes treatment of the primary disorder very difficult. It has been identified that PTSD can be found in comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders as well as with physical illnesses. This study presents aged 42, who has been psychiatrically treated for the past 12 years, with a diagnose of chronic PTSD and who subsequently developed depression. The patient has been treated for psoriasis for the past seven years, and two years ago, had to undergo surgery due to bladder carcinoma, followed by a radiotherapy course. Multiple comorbidity significantly makes the treatment of the primary illness very difficult and it limits the choice of pharmacotherapy in ambulatory conditions.","2367":"Depression is the most frequent disorder of today. It is unique for the fact that it can become a comorbid illness with almost any other psychiatric disorder. Premorbid depression is also a risk factor for the development of PTSD, while at the same time traumatic experience is a risk factor for the development of depression. These facts show us that a close connection between these two diagnostic entities exists. Aim of this research was to analyze the levels of depressiveness in patients that were hospitalized and patients that were treated in the Day hospital. Also, to establish the connection of age, time spent in combat (war), length of treatment and number of hospitalizations with the results from the Beck's depression inventory. Participants were divided into two groups, 36 patients that were treated for PTSD in a hospital setting and 64 patients that were treated in the Day hospital. Participants completed Beck's self-evaluation inventory for depression, as it assesses the degree of depression. Two groups did not differ regarding to age, time spent in combat (war), the length of treatment and level of depressiveness assessed by Beck's depression inventory. Score on Beck's depression inventory was significantly positively correlated with the age of participants and the number of hospitalizations. Older participants and participants that were hospitalized more often score higher on Beck's depression inventory. Results show that there is no difference between the two groups of participants of differing levels of depressiveness, but depression most often presents as severe depression in both groups of participants. Older participants and participants that were hospitalized more often are more depressed. This research points to the fact that it is necessary to treat PTSD and depression at the same time, because parallel treatment of these comorbid disorders leads to a decrease of the rate of suicide, due to the fact that depression is often the leading cause of suicide. ","2368":"Comorbity is very high in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients. PTSD is very often complicated with depressive disorder, substance abuse, other anxiety disorders, personality disorders, psychotic features, etc. There have been few pharmacotherapy studies in this complicated field. In the past few years the literature on pharmacotherapy treatment for PTSD and comorbidity has arisen. From empirical evidence (level A) exist three sertraline studies in PTSD comorbid with: 1) anxiety, 2) depression, and 3) anxiety and depression, and one risperidone study in PTSD comorbid with psychotic symptoms. From empirical evidence (level B) exist two disulfiram, naltrexone, and their combination studies in patients with PTSD comorbid with alcohol dependence and one paroxetine or bupropion versus cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) versus community mental health referral study in PTSD women outpatients with major depressive disorder. The results from our label trials in the Croatian war veterans with chronic PTSD comorbid with psychotic features treated with novel antipsychotics (olanzapine, risperidone, or quetiapine) are promising. In the future more rigorously designed, comparative studies are needed to determine the usefulness, efficacy, tolerability, and safety of particular psychopharmaceutical drugs in the treatment of this therapeutically and functionally challenging disorder, especially the trials from level A.","2369":"Depressive disorders are more common in the population affected with dermatologic disorders. Comorbidity of depression and dermatologic disorders is around 30%. The correlation between depressive and dermatologic disorders still remains unclear. In psychodermatology three disorders are described: a) psychophysiological disorders (both disorders induced and maintained by stressors), b) secondary psychiatric disorders (mental disorder as a result of skin leasions and treatment) and c) primary psychiatric disorders (skin alterations as a result of mental disorders and treatment). In depression and dermatology disorders in which certain precipitating factors are required thereby causing alteration of the patient's immunological identity causing a combination of hereditary features and ones acquired through adaptation occur to cause the disorder to develop. The cytokines are vital in the regulation of the immunology response and are also mediators of non-infective inflammatory processes leading to recurrent hormonal secretion affecting the function of the vegetative and central nervous system leading to so called \"sickness behaviour\", marked by loss of appetite, anhedonia, anxiety, decrease of concentration and interest along with other changes which generate a picture of depressive disorder. Treatment of depressive and dermatologic disorders is complex and requires an integral therapeutic approach encompassing all aspects of both disorders and their comorbidity. Therefore therapeutic success lies in a team approach to the patient under the auspice of consultative-liason psychiatry by setting the frame for efficient collaboration and bridging the gap between the mental and the physical in everyday clinical practice.","2370":"Patients who require long-term treatment for depression have an increased risk of experiencing drug interactions since they will take medications for intercurrent and\/or co-morbid illness. Antidepressants can be the object of drug interactions by other substances, or they can precipitate interactions by inhibiting enzyme pathways. There is an increasing agreement about the importance of polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 enzymes and the effects of drug-drug interactions in relation to the incidence of adverse effects. Genetic test suitable for the routine laboratory are now available for some important metabolizing enzymes (e.g. CY2D6, CY2C19) identifying those individuals who are slow or fast metabolizers of certain drugs. Specific antidepressants differ in the interactions with CYP450 isoenzymes and in their susceptibility to drug-drug interactions. The main focus of this article is pharmacokinetic drug interactions of antidepressants. With that specific knowledge, clinicians can improve outcomes of depressed patients, by considering the possibility of drug interactions both before prescribing a specific antidepressant and while monitoring for response, adverse effects and patient compliance.","2371":"The rate of comorbid depression and medical illness varies from 10 to 40%. Patients with depressive disorder compared to general population more often have cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders, diabetes, irritable bowel syndrome, and some types of tumor. Side effects of mental health medications may appear in a form that is very similar to clinical presentation of somatic illness. Side effects that appear during treatment of depressive disorder, e. g. cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, movement disorders, etc., may provoke certain diagnostic issues regarding origin of such symptoms (somatic illness vs. side effect). The aim of this article is to review literature regarding comorbidity of depressive disorder and somatic illness and to point at possible diagnostic problems in differentiating comorbid somatic illness and side effects of antidepressants. Literature research included structured searches of Medline and other publications on the subject of comorbidity of depressive disorder and somatic disorders and possible diagnostic problems in differentiating comorbid somatic illnesses from side effects of antidepressants. Comorbidity between depressive disorder and various somatic disorders appears often. Investigations suggest that depressive disorder is underdiagnosed in such cases. Side effects of antidepressants are sometimes very hard to differentiate from symptoms of somatic illness, which may lead to diagnostic issues. Bearing in mind frequent comorbidity between of depressive and somatic disorders, early recognition of such comorbidity is important, as well as the selection of antidepressant. It is important to recognize depressive disorder in patients with somatic illnesses, as well as somatic illness in patients primarily treated because of depressive disorder. ","2372":"Suicidality is one of the great challenges in contemporary psychiatry. Suicidal patients are often misdiagnosed in clinical practice. It is very important to evaluate possible comorbidity in diagnostic assessment of suicidal patients. The high prevalence of comorbid bipolar (BD) and borderline personality disorders (BPD) presents both a diagnostic and a therapeutic challenge. Although the primary treatment for patients with BPD is psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy is a core component for the treatment of comorbid conditions such as bipolar disorder. Because of heterogeneity of the BPD, pharmacologic treatment has evolved to some particular dimensions of BPD rather than the disorder in its entirety. The dimensions include affective instability, impulsive aggression and identity disturbance. Effective medication management reduces the overall suffering of the patient and enables to make greater use of psychotherapeutic interventions which is very important for BPD patients with BD comorbidity.","2373":"The heart and mind are intimately linked. Patients with severe mental disorders have increased mortality rates compared with the general population and the leading cause of premature death is cardiovascular disease (CVD). Despite their high prevalence and substantial medical impact, comorbidity between cardiac conditions and psychiatric illnesses frequently go undiagnosed and untreated. It is very interesting to investigate the impact of mental health on cardiac disease and what is the complex underlying mechanism that links these two conditions.","2374":"During the past century, many scientific discoveries and industrialization greatly contributed to the progress in medicine and significantly improved a quality of life of psychiatric patients. Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder. Due to synthesis of numerous high quality antipsychotic medications, a great progress in the treatment of it has been made during the last 50 years. In five thousand years of the recorded history, it is known that in the early times, people used different methods and procedures in the treatment of various psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia. In recent decades after great discoveries, medicine based on facts has also faced a number of disappointments. The medicine gradually begins to understand that some of the alternatives used earlier in centuries are complementary methods that were unnecessarily suppressed and excluded from the treatment. On the other hand, a number of countries where this is legally possible is growing and there is also an increasing number of patients seeking alternative and complementary methods in the treatment of schizophrenia. The aim of this paper is to encourage and reflect upon the meaning of alternative and complementary methods in the treatment of schizophrenia as well as to try and prevent forgetting their meaning whenever it is justified and based on facts.","2375":"Smoking prevalence for schizophrenic patients is higher than this for general population. More than 60% of schizophrenic patients are current smokers, which contributes to excessive mortality in these patients. The reasons for high frequency of both smoking prevalence and heavy smoking in schizophrenic patients is thought to be at least partially related to enhancement of brain dopaminergic activity, which, in turn, results in behavioral reinforcement due to stimulant effects. Smoking stimulates dopaminergic activity in the brain by inducing its release and inhibiting its degradation. There is also evidence that cigarette smoking can reduce deficits relative to dopamine hypofunction in prefrontal cortex. Recent neuroimaging studies have further contributed the evidence of complex influences of cigarette smoking on brain dopaminergic function. It has been suggested that smoking may be an attempt by schizophrenic patients to alleviate cognitive deficits and to reduce extrapyramidal side-effects induced by antipsychotic medication. Cigarette smoke also increases the activity of CYP 1A2 enzymes, thus decreasing the concentration of many drugs, including clozapine and olanzapine. There is also evidence that smoking is associated with increased clearance of tiotixene, fluphenazine and haloperidol. Given the high frequency of smoking in schizophrenic patients, clinicians need to check smoking status in each patient. Schizophrenic patients who smoke may require higher dosages of antipsychotics than nonsmokers. Conversely, upon smoking cessation, smokers may require a reduction in the dosage of antipsychotics.","2376":"Scientific research aiming at discovering new generations of effective medications is a common practice in medicine, and psychiatric research is no exception. Antipsychotics are used to treat chronic mental illnesses such as schizophrenia. The new generation of antipsychotics (atypicals) gradually reveal their advantages in comparison to the older generation of antipsychotics (conventional, typicals) and are increasingly applied to the everyday practice. Although there are no differences in the therapeutic effectiveness between the two groups mentioned, atypical antipsychotics have become the drugs of choice. A certain number of women in their reproductive age suffer from schizophrenia and other mental illnesses which demand antipsychotic treatment. Atypical antipsychotics have been available on the market since the mid 90's so the experience in the application of these medicaments in treating pregnant women is relatively modest. This study will present our own experience in the treatment of a pregnant woman suffering from schizophrenia, who was treated with ziprasidone for the duration of her pregnancy. The psychotic symptoms remained in remission throughout the whole pregnancy period, during labour and after the birth. The pregnancy course remained normal all through to the birth, which was carried out naturally and normally. A healthy baby was born within the term expected.","2377":"Schizophrenia often co-occurs with chronic medical illnesses. Beside comorbid somatic illness, somatic symptoms appear as a result of side effects of antipsychotics during treatment of psychotic disorders, which may lead to certain diagnostic problems in deciding regarding the origin of such symptoms (somatic illness vs. side effects). The aim of this article is to review literature regarding comorbidity of psychotic disorders and somatic disorders and to point at possible diagnostic problems in differentiating comorbid somatic illness from side effects of antipsychotics. Literature research included structured searches of Medline and other publications on the subject of comorbidity of psychotic disorders and somatic disorders and possible diagnostic problems in differentiating comorbid somatic illnesses from side effects of antipsychotics. Co-occurrence of schizophrenia and somatic illnesses is frequent. Genetic factors, sedentary life style, poor diet, risk behaviors and smoking are some important factors that contribute to such comorbidity. Side effects of antipsychotics may cause diagnostic problems in deciding regarding the origin of such symptoms (somatic illness vs. side effects) during treatment of psychotic disorders. Bearing in mind frequent comorbidity between of psychotic and somatic disorders, early recognition of such comorbidity is important, as well as the selection of antipsychotics. It is important to recognize psychotic symptoms in patients with somatic illnesses, as well as somatic illness in patients primarily treated because of psychotic disorder. ","2378":"Personality interacts with psychosocial variables, psychopathology and coping strategies of patients with schizophrenia. Psychobiological model of personality is important for schizophrenia as temperament dimensions, except dimension Persistence, have been associated with different neurotransmitter systems. Comorbidity of psychiatric and somatic disorders and syndromes is generally associated with dimensions high Harm avoidance and low Self-directedness. Variations in other dimensions may also be important. High Harm Avoidance may represent state vulnerability marker for various psychiatric disorders and is associated with appearance of comorbidity in schizophrenia. High Self-directedness may be protective factor for development of various psychiatric as well somatic comorbidity states.","2379":"It is a well known fact that mentally ill patients, especially those with schizophrenia, have a higher incidence of somatic diseases than the general population and finally a significantly shorter life expectancy. In this paper a comparison is made between schizophrenia and somatic comorbidity before the era of antipsychotics and after, with consideration to the prevalent morbidity during each of these periods. In the period before antipsychotics acute infectious diseases and TBC were the prevalent comorbid diseases. High comorbidity rates were due not only to epidemics but also poor treatment success, deficient health habits and poor personal hygiene. In the period after the discovery of antipsychotics significant changes in morbidity occurred with the prevalence of chronic degenerative diseases, primarily diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia. Studies show that new generation antipsychotics partly generate the occurrence of metabolic disorders, which makes it necessary to consider the choice of antipsychotic depending on the assessed risk in every individual case.","2380":"The existence of two or more diagnoses (psychiatric, or a combination with somatic) in one person leads to a dilemma when choosing psychopharmacs for the treatment of the patient. There are no acceptable and comprehensive guidelines or algorithms for the treatment of innumerable possible combinations of psychiatric and somatic disorders. A strategy for treatment of such conditions is needed.","2381":"The hypothesis of each individual being special and different leading to heterogenity of diseases sets the ground for the concept of personalized medicine. Personalized psychiatry follows the principles of personalized medicine. A constituent part of an individually adapted approach towards the psychiatric patient presents itself thorough personalized psychiatry. The development of pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics as well as the nanotechnology based on them ensures implementation of personalized medicine principles in psychiatry to a greater extent than other medical disciplines. In the field of pharmacogenomics, the greatest advance was achieved by the study of genetic variability in drug metabolism. All the predispositions are now present for the implementation of pharmacogenetic tests in routine practice. Pharmacogenetic testing for medications which are metabolised thorough two polymorph cytochromes P 450: CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 is of special significance due to their involvement in most adverse and ultrafast metabolism of psychopharmacs. The potential application of personalized medicine in psychiatry, supported by pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics, are: personalized medication choice, personalized dosage, anticipation of possible side-effects individually and personalized follow-up treatment with rehabilitation. The authors conclude how the development of pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics as well as the nanotechnology based on them, presents a step forward in creating a personalized therapeutic approach in psychiatry. However, the burden of applying the most appropriate therapeutic agent and medication tapering remains based on clinician decision. Pharmacogenetics can only help by making therapeutic decisions with one less unknown element.","2382":"Comorbidity is one of the greatest research and clinical challenges to contemporary psychiatry. Mental disorders are often comorbidly expressed, both among themselves and with various sorts of somatic diseases and illnesses. Shifting the paradigm from vertical\/mono-morbid interventions to comorbidity and multimorbidity approaches enhances effectiveness and efficiency of human resources utilization. Comorbidity studies have been expected to be an impetus to research on the validity of current diagnostic systems as well as on establishing more effective and efficient treatment including personalized pharmacotherapy.","2383":"","2384":"","2385":"","2386":"It has been found that in patients suffering from unipolar depression, associated depersonalization symptomatology is more intense compared to healthy controls, and also that there is a positive correlation between depression and depersonalization. According to data that may be found in the literature, there is a relatively high prevalence of depersonalization symptomatology in unipolar depressions. Our study was aimed at finding whether the presence of depersonalization was related to a specific phenomenological expression of depressive symptomatology in unipolar depression. The study included 84 subjects suffering from unipolar depression without psychotic features. Based on the Cambridge Depersonalization Scale (CDS) score, the subjects were divided into two groups - a group with associated depersonalization (CDS&gt;or=70) (40 subjects) and a group with subsyndromal depersonalization (CDS&lt;70) (44 subjects), the later one being treated as a control group. The groups were compared in regard to the intensity of depressive symptomatology, depressive symptoms frequency and the depressive symptoms duration. The General Socio-Demographic Questionnaire, the Cambridge Depersonalization Scale and The Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 were used. The depressive patients with depersonalization had predominantly severe episodes, almost all patients had feelings of sadness, insomnia, and decrease of energetic potentials. The biggest difference between the groups, in terms of greater number of manifest symptoms in the patients with depersonalization, was for psychomotor disturbances (agitation or retardation), insomnia, decrease of energetic potentials and concentration. At the same time, 75% of the subjects with associated depersonalization had anhedonia, sadness\/dysphoria, insomnia and decrease of energetic potentials continuously present. Unlike this group, the control group subjects experienced sadness, appetite problems, concentration and motor behavior changes almost half as frequently. Particularly significant were the differences regarding suicidal thoughts. It was shown that in the group with depersonalization there was a higher percentage of patients with suicidal thoughts, mostly continuously present, which represent a significant suicidal risk factor. Unipolar depression, associated with depersonalization is more severe in its intensity .It has a bigger number of manifest symptoms which have a tendency to continuous duration. A special focus is on the negative impact on the occurrence and lasting presence of suicidal thoughts. ","2387":"In this paper we present a survey of the literature dealing with IQ stability in children with childhood autism (CA) over the last ten years. Nowadays there is no clear evidence on this topic. We used the online \"PubMed\" database. By inputting the following key words: (autism and IQ and child) and (stability or outcome or follow-up) we obtained a total of 78 references. Out of those 78 references, some papers were left out in line with the exclusion criteria, so this survey includes 23 papers altogether. The average initial IQ point is in the range from borderline intelligence to mild mental retardation. Out of a total of 23 studies, the majority, 19 of them, generally state that there are no changes in IQ, 8 studies mention increased IQ, while 3 studies demonstrate a decrease in IQ. Some studies register different results in the same study. At an individual level, single studies show a similar trend to the general results. The majority of studies state that the IQ points will remain the same. Today the generally accepted belief is that therapy should be started intensely and early. Some children with good progress may attend regular school. ","2388":"The aim of this research was to examine differences among two groups of girls, models and ballerinas (with risk factors - experimental group) and young students (control group), in body image preception, body mass index, neurotic perfectionism, body - image distortion and simptoms of eating disorders. The research was conducted with 91 participants divided in two groups, control group - 55 students at University of Sarajevo and experimental group - 13 professional ballerinas, 23 professional models. During this research work we used several measuring instruments: Body mass index; Body Mass Index - Silhouette Matching Test; Neurotic Perfectionism Questioner; Eating Disorders Inventory. In this study statistically significant differences occur between these two groups of girls which are related to body - image perception and objective position on the body mass index chart. All 91 participants saw themselves as obese. Statistically significant differences occur in body - image distortion and simptoms of eating disorders in the experimental group, they have high scores on body - image distortion, on eating disorders inventory and neurotic perfectionism simptoms. Based on th results in this study, we may conclude that there are groups of people who have risk factors for developing some kind of eating disorder, so it would be desirable to create a preventive intervention for young ballerinas and models, but also for those people who coach them, trainers, instructors and managers. For other population groups with risky behavior such as young children, a prevention plan and modifications of cultural influences on people's opinion of body image are extremely important. ","2389":"Adolescence is a period of significant physical, emotional and intellectual changes, as well as changes in social roles, relations and expectations. Our objective was to inquire into eating attitudes among female adolescents. The sample consisted of female adolescents, age of 16-17, attending first grade Economic and Medical Secondary School pupils in Banja Luka, 2007. Survey questionnaire (16 questions) is a scale for self-rating of eating disorders designed by the author. Response rate was 389 out of 419 (92.8%). Eight point seven per cent of the female adolescents had a Body Mass Index (BMI) less than 18.5. More than half want to be thinner, while 1\/3 of adolescents accepted themselves whether thin or obese. Forty-seven percent (47%) of adolescents exercise sometimes, 15.4% exercise often while 1\/5 goes on a diet sometimes or regularly. About 43% adolescents are sometimes or often terrified about being overweight, while 60% sometimes or often lose weight. About 2\/3 adolescents are not satisfied with their figure. One-half of the adolescents are terrified of increasing their weight. There is a statistically significant relation between female adolescents with, and female adolescents without control in eating, in both schools (p&lt;0.05). This research indicates the necessity of education of adolescents and developing prevention programs to help them to adopt healthier nutrition and lifestyle in early life. There is a high level of discontent and dissatisfaction with their figure among adolescents. One-third (1\/3) of adolescents accept themselves whether thin or obese, while about 43% adolescents are sometimes or often terrified about being overweight. One-half of adolescents are terrified by increase in weight. ","2390":"It is well recognized that both acute and chronic alcohol use are among the major behaviorally modifiable factors that are associated with suicidal behavior. There is suggestive evidence that binge drinking pattern, i.e. excessive consumption of strong spirits results in quicker and deeper level of intoxication, increasing the propensity for alcohol-related suicide. Although alcohol seems to be an important contributor to the burden of violent mortality in Belarus, little systematic research has been undertaken on its impact on suicide mortality in this country. The aim of the present study was to address this particular deficit by using aggregate-level data on the suicide and alcohol poisoning rates from 1979 to 2007. Trends in suicides and alcohol poisoning mortality rate (as a proxy for binge drinking) from 1979 to 2007 were analyzed employing an ARIMA analysis in order to assess bivariate relationship between the two time series. According to Bureau of Forensic Medicine autopsy reports the suicide rate increased by 41.2%, and fatal alcohol poisoning rate increased 2.1 times in Belarus. Alcohol in blood was found in 62% suicide victims for the whole period, with the minimum figure 49.3% in 1988 and maximum 68.5% in 1981. Alcohol-related suicides were more affected by the restriction of alcohol availability during the anti-alcohol campaign: between 1984 and 1986 the number of BAC-positive suicide cases drop by 54.2%, while number of BAC-negative suicides decreased by 7.1%. The results of time-series analysis indicated a statistically significant relationship between fatal alcohol poisoning rate and total suicides number, as well as number of BAC-positive suicides. The results of the present study, as well as findings from other settings indicate that a restrictive alcohol policy can be considered as an effective measure of suicide prevention in countries where rates of both alcohol consumption and suicide are high. ","2391":"We studied relative cortical blood flow (relCBF) patterns associated to correct performance (CP) and perseverative error (PE) during Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) execution, in controls and patients with schizophrenia. relCBF (regional cortical blood flow (rCBF) \/ whole cortex blood flow) of 10 well defined cortical regions was measured in 18 patients with schizophrenia and 13 healthy controls by a Technetium - 99 - HMPAO - SPECT, at rest and while they performed WCST. Patients made significantly more PE than controls during WCST performance. In patients, we found a significant correlation between PE and relCBF in right occipital cortex. In controls, we found a significant correlation between CP and relCBF of several cortical regions during WCST execution: left orbitofrontal cortex and left global frontal cortex positively and parietal bilateral cortex negatively. PE was inversely correlated with relCBF in left temporal cortex. Successful WCST performance is associated to a high left frontal activity in controls but not in patients. The severity of PE during WCST performance is associated to a low left frontal-temporal activity in controls and to a high right parietal-occipital activity in schizophrenia. This may represent a cortical activity redistribution pattern related to perseveration in schizophrenia. ","2392":"","2393":"","2394":"A case is reported of a 36-year-old male, found dead in his locked room, lying on a bed, dressed in his mother's clothes, with a plastic bag over his head, hands tied and with a barrel wooden cork in his rectum. Two pornographic magazines were found on a chair near the bed, so that the deceased could see them well. Asphyxia was controlled with a complex apparatus which consisted of two elastic luggage rack straps, the first surrounding his waist, perineum, and buttocks, and the second the back of his body, and neck. According to the psychological autopsy based on a structured interview (SCID-I, SCID-II) with his father, the deceased was single, unemployed and with a part college education. He had grown up in a poor family with a reserved father and dominant mother, and was indicative of fulfilling DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence, paraphilia involving hypoxyphilia with transvestic fetishism and anal masturbation and a borderline personality disorder. There was no evidence of previous psychiatric treatment. The Circumstances subscale of Beck's Suicidal Intent Scale (SIS-CS) pointed at the lack of final acts (thoughts or plans) in anticipation of death, and absence of a suicide note or overt communication of suicidal intent before death. Integration of the crime scene data with those of the forensic medicine and psychological autopsy enabled identification of the event as an accidental death, caused by neck strangulation, suffocation by a plastic bag, and vagal stimulation due to a foreign body in the rectum.","2395":"Through the case presentation of a diagnostically and therapeutically interesting gender dysphoric individual, the authors wish to address diagnostic problems associated with this controversial category, illustrate dilemmas and emphasize the importance of diagnostic procedures in differentiating between primary transsexualism and other transgender states. Many questions have been triggered by this case, mainly about whether this patient should be classified as a paraphilia (transvestite, transvestite with transsexual trend), primary transsexualism or autogynephilia and about the most adequate treatment (e.g., sex-reassignment surgery, hormone therapy as a way of partial feminisation or exclusively psychotherapy). The issue of reconstructive surgery, i.e. its justification in the case of this particular condition is specifically discussed. Before any decision is made, both medical but also ethical consequences of the treatment choice need to be considered (e.g., the client is the father of two underage children).","2396":"Animal-assisted therapy is a familiar method of treatment in the rehabilitation of many illnesses and conditions, but is still not applied sufficiently in our milieu. This paper gives an overview of the available literature and some of the research which demonstrates that the interaction between the patient, animal and therapist provides a context which improves communication, elevates self-confidence, reduces the symptoms of diseases, and improves the quality of life. The dog, cat, horse, birds and toy animals are most often used in therapy. Short-term contacts with animals are used, as well as long term keeping of animals, which are looked after by patients following a particular methodology. The therapy is used in the treatment of psychiatric patients afflicted with depression, schizophrenia, phobias and addiction problems. Loneliness is easier to endure in the company of animals. It is also applied in cardiovascular diseases, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, child cerebral paralysis, rheumatoid arthritis, AIDS, and other diseases. Research shows a more rapid reduction of symptoms of many diseases when animals are included in the therapeutic process.","2397":"As one of the most potent and substantial form of mass communication, film exercises a very significant influence upon the perceptions of the audience, especially in relation to mental illness issues, and that perception is very much blurred with populists' misinterpretation and lack of awareness regarding problems faced by persons suffering from mental disorders. Movies such as \"Psycho\", \"One Flew Over Cuckoo's Nest\", \"Exorcist\", despite being valuable in an artistic sense, corroborated and encouraged confusion and undermined the clarity and certainty concerning the fine line separating mental health from mental illness. Modern film makers and movie theoreticians try to overcome these limitations which are often generated by exploitation of stereotypes and myths referring to mentally ill people. This paper defines and discusses the most frequent thematic stereotypes seen in movies which are perpetuating stigmatization of mentally ill people. They are: free-spirited rebel, maniac on a killing spree, seducer, enlightened member of society, narcissistic parasite, beastly person (stereotype of animal sort). Psychiatry and cinematography are linked inseparably not only because they creatively complement each other, but also as an opportunity of mutual influences blending into didactical categories and professional driving forces, benefiting both the filmmakers' and the psychiatrists' professions.","2398":"A rapid expansion of new treatment options in recent decades and the increasing volume of scientific evidence published on a daily basis have been followed by the necessity of introduction of clinical guidelines and therapeutic algorithms. The development of these guidelines and algorithms has also been driven by increased cost-awareness and the increasing pressure to improve cost-efficiency. The Serbian Physicians Society published \"Therapeutic Guidelines for the Treatment of Schizophrenia\" in 2003 and \"Therapeutic Guidelines for the Treatment of Bipolar Affective Disorder\" in 2004. The School of Medicine, University of Belgrade published \"Therapeutic Guidelines for the Treatment of Depression\" in 2004. All of these national guidelines, at the moment of development, were based upon up-to-date scientific evidence. According to the recently conducted survey at the Institute of Psychiatry, Clinical Centre of Serbia, about 65% of psychiatrists stated that they adhere to the national or relevant international therapeutic guidelines. When asked to cite which international or foreign guidelines in particular they used, approximately 50% failed to do so, while the other half cited mostly the APA Guidelines or NICE Guidelines. Among the national guidelines, physicians are, according to the survey, familiar with the Therapeutic Guidelines for the treatment of Schizophrenia (46.3%), Therapeutic Guidelines of Depression (41.5%) and Therapeutic Guidelines for the Treatment of Bipolar Affective Disorder (34.1%). The majority of Serbian psychiatrists rely on the efficacy and safety of the drugs as the major determining factors in the choice of therapy, bearing in mind the patients' best interests. However, it is unclear why such a discrepancy between practice and guidelines still persists, since guidelines also recommend therapy based on their safety and efficacy data. It is possible that a substantial percentage of psychiatrists obtain indicators on drugs' efficacy and safety from their personal professional experience. It is doubtful whether this knowledge is valid, or just represents unproven prescribers' habits. Furthermore, the influence on other factors, such as treatment costs or drug availability should be further investigated.","2399":"Gender identity disorder is a rare entity in psychiatry which affects deep instincts and personal identity. A review of the recent literature has shown that research of socio-demographic characteristics of transsexual patients is sporadic. There are very few investigations which consider the socio-demographic characteristics in individuals with disharmonized sex and gender identity. This kind of research has not been done in Serbia until now. The objective of this research was to evaluate and analyze socio-demographic data of transsexual persons with a homosexual orientation. The paper presents the mentioned characteristics on sample of 30 gender dysphoric persons. The patients were examined by The Belgrade team for gender identity. The transsexuals were in a stage of preparation for the sex-reassignment surgery (SRS), and transsexualism was diagnosed and guided within this program (used criteria were keeping with ICD X, DSM IV and Diagnostic schedule recommended by Standards of Care for Dysphoric Persons of the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association). We have examined the following socio-demographic characteristics: sex, age, place of residence, educational level, employment and religion. Results and analysis of obtained data have shown that the socio-demographic profile of transsexual patients included in the research is: predominantly males (male\/female sex ratio 3:2); refer for psychiatric help in younger age (frequently before 26); most of them with high school education; live in urban communities; mostly Orthodox religion; equally employed and unemployed. Gathering and analysis of sociodemographic data is important for elucidating the transsexual patient's profile. It facilitates better understanding, timely recognition and choice of appropriate treatment for these patients. ","2400":"Stigma refers to the undesirable characteristics linked to mental illness and the adverse cognitive and behavioral consequences. Stigma causes a spiral of alienation and discrimination, leading to social isolation that diminishes chances for recovery. There is a great need for antistigma programs in order to decrease stigma related to persons with mental health problems. The antistigma program was initiated in schools of Serbia with the aim to address and decrease discrimination of adolescents with mental disorders. Sixty-three students from high schools voluntarily participated in the program. The effect of the program on the attitudes of students was evaluated by the Opinion about Mental Illness Questionnaire given to adolescents prior to its implementation and six months afterwards. Social discrimination and the tendency towards social restriction were reduced, while, at the same time, social awareness of mental health-related problems was increased among young people six months after program implementation. The results obtained clearly indicate positive changes in adolescents' attitudes and demonstrate a need for further educational activities regarding stigma and mental disorders. Stigma and discrimination reduction programs for adolescents are aimed at achieving a change of their attitudes toward the mental health problems of their peers and themselves through organized education. Our program demonstrates the necessity for youth participation in mental health services and system, and antistigma actions are seen as important aspects. ","2401":"Taking the Initiative to evaluate students' affinity toward psychiatry seems to be a global issue and is an essential part of programs to improve the status of the profession. The aim of this study is to explore medical students' attitudes toward psychiatry in comparison to other residencies (internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, gynecology and general medicine) in the pre-clinical year and to observe which factors influence the creation of these attitudes. The survey included 114 students of the second year, School of Medicine in Belgrade (academic year 2007\/08). The data was collected trough a 23-item questionnaire. Fifteen percent of students stated that psychiatry was their career of choice, while 25% expressed a strong aversion. Psychiatry was ranked less attractive than internal medicine, surgery and pediatrics, but more attractive than general medicine or gynecology. Those who like psychiatry attributed more importance to an interesting and challenging job than to prestige and financial reward. Also, they found this field to be intellectually challenging and to rapidly expand the frontier of medicine. Students with negative attitude were convinced that psychiatry was lacking in scientific foundation and was clinically inefficient, they disliked intensive emotional involvement, exposure to stress and frequent unpleasant situations and had prejudices toward the patients or simply a lack of the interest. The present study is the first of its kind in Serbia which used a precise and internationally comparable methodological instrument and It shows that pre-clinical medical students at the University of Belgrade, have a stronger affinity towards psychiatry when compared to their peers from most countries worldwide. Also, the study points out the fact that prejudices toward patients with mental dysfunctions and lack of confidence in the efficacy of psychiatric treatment should be specially targeted by the curriculum in the later part of undergraduate education. How this will affect the attitude of clinical students and graduates is to be examined. ","2402":"Some new studies have shown a significant connection between post-traumatic stress disorder and impairment of the quality of life (QoL), whereas, to our knowledge, research on the connection between other disorders of the stress related group and quality of life do not exist. The objective of our study was to assess the connection between stress related disorders and the quality of life. We studied the quality of life in 160 subjects who have experienced certain stressogenic life events. Within the first group (80 subjects) a certain stress related disorder was diagnosed after a stressogenic life event. In the second group (80 subjects) none of the stress related disorders was developed after a stressogenic life event. The diagnosis was made based on the ICD-10 criteria; the stress was assessed by the Impact of Events Scale (IES) and QoL by the Manchester Short Assessment Quality of Life Scale (MANSA). Persons in whom some stress related disorders were diagnosed had a lower quality of life compared to persons who experienced stress but did not develop a disorder (p&lt;0.01). Given the long-term stressogenic situation in our country, which is still ongoing, we think that comprehensive measures of prevention, early diagnostics and efficient treatment of stress related disorders are necessary in order to improve the quality of life for the persons with these disorders and their families, but also for society as a whole. ","2403":"Tianeptine, a new generation antidepressant, possesses a unique mechanism of antidepressive action and has a specific pharmacokinetic profile. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy, tolerability and safety of tianeptine in a \"fragile\" population of depressive patients: (1) a group of elderly patients and (2) a group with comorbid alcohol addiction. This was an open multicentric eight-week study of tianeptine efficacy, tolerability and safety including patients with mild to moderate depression (DSM-IV), age &gt; or =55 years (group 1; n=45) or with comorbid alcohol addiction (group 2; n=32). Assessments was made with the following rating scales; MADRS, HAM-A and CGI for efficacy and DESS for tolerability. After eight-week tianeptine therapy, remission (MADRS &lt; or =12) was established in 51.1% and 84.4% patients, respectively. On day 7, the therapy led to a significant decrease of MADRS. On endpoint, there were significant differences on HAM-A, CGI-I and CGI-S scores (p&lt;0.01). No adverse effects with frequency &gt; or = 10%, were registered. A lower tolerability of tianeptine was registered in a group of elderly (nausea 4.5%, leg fatigue 4.4%, irritability 2.2%, bursts of crying and sadness 2.2%), while only 3.1% depressive patients with comorbid alcohol addiction had dizziness. This is the first clinical study to evaluate tolerability, efficacy and safety of tianeptine in a special population of depressive patients in the region. The study showed that tianeptine had good efficacy in treatment of mild to moderate forms of depression in special populations of depressive patients (elderly population and patients with comorbid alcohol addiction). The drug was well tolerated. ","2404":"Mood stabilizer augmentation of standard antidepressant drugs has been shown to be effective in treatment-resistant depression. Despite the reported high overall efficacy, lithium has been relatively underused in recent years. Lamotrigine, a novel anticonvulsant recently recognized as a mood stabilizer, seems to have putative antidepressive properties. The aim of the study was to investigate lamotrigine efficacy and tolerability as antidepressant augmentation for unipolar treatment-resistant depression compared to lithium. 88 patients suffering from treatment-resistant Major depressive disorder, having acute recurrent depressive episodes according to DSM-IV criteria, were enrolled in the study. This was an open-label trial with a flexible dosing regimen. All patients, received antidepressants in full therapeutic doses. They were divided into two augmentation groups: 46 patients received 50-200 mg\/day lamotrigine, and 42 patients received 600-1200 mg\/day lithium. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and The Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI) were used to monitor therapeutic efficacy. Patients were evaluated weekly for an 8 week treatment period. The HAM-D total score was significantly reduced in both treatment groups at the study endpoint, without any difference between the groups. However, significant clinical improvement was reached within the second treatment week in the lamotrigine group compared to the lithium group (p=0.01 vs. lithium). Lamotrigine showed significant efficacy on the HAM-D item 1(depressed mood; p=0.01), item 7 (work and interest; p=0.01) and CGI-Improvement scale (p=0.02). The drop-out rate due to treatment failure was lower in the lamotrigine group (n=1) compared to the lithium (n=4) group. Also, the incidence of side effects did not differ between the groups. Our results suggest that lamotrigine could be useful as augmentation of antidepressants for treatment-resistant unipolar depression. Also, lamotrigine may accelerate the onset of antidepressant action, and therefore might be useful in treatment of major depression in general. ","2405":"In treatment-resistant schizophrenia a combination of ECT with antipsychotics has been reported to have superior outcomes compared to other strategies, however the results were inconsistent. We investigated the long-term effects of the combination of unilateral, non-dominant hemisphere ECT with three antipsychotics. The clinical study was a naturalistic, prospective, open-labeled, active-controlled study in adult outpatients of both genders suffering from treatment-resistant schizophrenia with a follow up of 2 years. The patients received sulpiride (n=17, 100-400mg\/day, PO), risperidone (n=26, 2-8 mg\/day, PO) or olanzapine (n=27, 5-10mg\/day, PO). Unilateral ECT was applied in 1 unit (0.5A, 0.8 mS) in six single applications, once a week and further according to the clinical need, in fortnight steps. Clinical efficacy was established using the PANSS and CGI psychometric scales. According to the results, the most effective treatment mode was olanzapine plus ECT, then risperidone plus ECT, while sulpiride plus ECT had lower clinical efficacy. Olanzapine plus ECT was significantly superior in all scale scores vs sulpiride plus ECT, as well as risperidone plus ECT except for PANSS-P (t=1.85, p&gt;0.05). During the study, 38 of 70 patients were withdrawn due to treatment failure (n=21), side effects (n=6) and non-compliance (n=11). The combination of novel antipsychotics and ECT can be used safely and effectively in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. ","2406":"The objective of the study was to investigate neurological deficit in schizophrenia and to compare soft neurological signs in positive and negative subtypes of schizophrenia. 66 patients with schizophrenia were evaluated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale to classify the subtype of schizophrenia: positive subtype (36 patients) and negative subtype (30 patients), all of which were entering into remission. To examine the neurological soft signs we compared scores on the Neurological Evaluation Scale (NES) for positive and negative subtype. The negative subtype of schizophrenia showed significantly higher neurological soft signs in comparison to the positive subtype, with reduced functioning in the sensory integration and motor coordination subscale as well as the other subscale. The main finding in this study indicates that patients with schizophrenia have neurological impairment, and that the negative subtype has significantly higher neurological impairment than the positive subtype. The results further support the significance of the soft neurological signs as a possible marker of different subtypes of schizophrenia. ","2407":"Previous studies concerned with neuropsychological aspect of delusions, were mainly focused on specific forms of this disorder, such as Cotard or Capgras type of delusions. Comparatively small numbers of investigations were concerned with cognitive deficiencies accompanying the delusions. The substance of this study includes the detection of neuropsychological dysfunctions in patients with delusional disorder, and tracing of these cognitive distortions to appropriate brain regions. The investigation is designed as a comparative study. Inpatients with delusion are compared with normal subjects from the aspect of the following cognitive functions: attention, memory, visuospatial and visuoconstruction organization, executive ability, verbal divergent thinking. Attention, memory (verbal modality) and psychomotor skill tasks are most susceptible to delusional effects. The neuropsychological profile of patients with delusional disorder includes impediment of complex attention modalities. From this primary disorder, there also stems a disorder of verbal memory in the sense of reduced recognition. These cognitive distortions suggest a dysfunction of the anterior regions of the cerebrum, mainly of the prefrontal and sinistral temporal regions. ","2408":"The authors present the development of the concept of mental disease and treatment in Serbian medicine. Serbian medieval medicine did not acknowledge fortune telling, sorcery, the use of amulets and magical rituals and formulas. These progressive concepts were confirmed by the Church and the Serbian state in what is known as Dusan's Code. The Historical data on the establishment of the first psychiatric hospital in the Balkans \"Home for the Unsound of Mind\" at Guberevac, Belgrade, in 1861 and its founders is reviewed. After World War I, in 1923, the Faculty of Medicine was established in Belgrade to which the coryphaei of Serbian medicine educated in Europe, mostly in France and Germany, flocked and that same year the Psychiatry Clinic of the Faculty of Medicine in Belgrade was set up. Its first seat was on the premises of the Mental Hospital in Belgrade, and it became a training base and laid the foundations of the future Neuropsychiatry Clinic in Belgrade, which in time evolved into the nursery of psychiatric professionals for all of Serbia. The most important data on the further development of psychiatry up to date are presented.","2409":"Even though memory dysfunction is not considered to be a diagnostic criterion for schizophrenia, results of a neuropsychological research indicate significant damage in mnestic functioning, especially in verbal memory (Saykin et al. 1991). This type of a disorder is recorded in patients with a first episode of schizophrenia, as well as in chronic patients (Saykin et al. 1994). These researches show that this deficit is not influenced by neuroleptics. Paulsen and associates suggest that the deficit of verbal learning in schizophrenia is related to difficulties in encoding retrieving information without significant storage (rapid forgetting) problems (Paulsen at al. 1995). We will present a case of a 36 - year old male who is suffering from a paranoid schizophrenia.","2410":"A 15 year old patient suffering from psychiatric disturbances looked for psychiatric help but refused hospital admission. Following an ambulatory treatment, the patient was diagnosed with Anorexia nervosa. The patient, a girl, was 175 centimeters tall, weighting only 39 kilos. Within the clinical picture, there were few dominant disorders present; anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, fear of feminization, with recurrent psychotic episodes. By the implementation of an intensive psychotherapeutic treatment, without the use of psychopharmacs, the weight was kept stable. In accordance with the girl's mother, a psychopharmacotherapy was commenced, a combination of olanzapine and paroxetine (the choice of psychopharmacs was lead by the side effects known). At the end of a 24-month period of a psychological treatment which was combined with psychopharmacotherapy, the patient exhibited no symptomatology and a stable clinical remission of the illness was achieved.","2411":"A scientific progress, due to the advancements within the pharmacological industry nowdays, is offering an ever increasing number of atypical antipsychotics for schizophrenia treatment. The atypics are gradually taking over the leadership of the more conventional antipsychotics in treating schizophrenia. The advantages of using atypics are fewer instances of side-effects and a good tolerance of the drug, which promotes an adequate and a satisfactory collaboration of the patients during the treatment. The daily practice often shows a polypragmasia within the treatment itself and a less frequent presence of a monotherapy as a way of treatment of schizophrenia. A question arises asking us, whether these are just a number of some old practices or, in the other hand, some fears and doubts between the clinitians and patients? The answer remanis for us to ponder upon. The patient diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia had been treated with a combination of conventional antipsychotics for many years. Eight years back, olanzapine was introduced in a 20 mg daily dose, combined with an anxiolytic, to which he reacted well. He was kept on the same olanzapine dose exclusively, for the past five years. During the treatment, he used to be monitored regularly (laboratory analyses, body weight) and no side-effects were percieved. He was in a stable remission during the treatment and a good recovery is evident via social functioning and a working ability.","2412":"The first effective drugs for Parkinson's disease (PD) were anticholinergics, introduced at the end of 19.th century by Charcot. Since the introduction of levodopa in the sixties of the previous century, many new drugs have emerged for the treatment of Parkinson's disease: dopamine agonists (ergot as well as non-ergot, bromocriptine, pergolide, mirapexine, ropinirole), MAO B inhibitors (selegiline, rasagiline), amantadine, COMT inhibitors (entacapone, tolcapone). In all stages of the disease, levodopa remains the most effective drug for improving motor symptoms in PD. However, long term treatment with levodopa is accompanied by the development of motor fluctuations, dyskinesia, cognitive and neuropsychiatric adverse effects and increasingly diverse spectrum of drugs is needed to alleviate motor and nonmotor symptoms. Some of these drugs have caused considerable concern and controversies and were regarded at certain points as the 'bad guys' of Parkinson's disease pharmacological armamentarium. In the article, a short review of 'bad guys' including anticholinergics, selegiline, tolcapone and dopamine agonists, is given.","2413":"The aim of this review is to describe side effects of five antidementives which are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA); four acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and one glutamate - or N-metyl-D-aspartat receptor antagonist - memantine. The antidementives are well tolerated and undesired effects are rare; except hepatotoxicity of tacrine and gastrointestinal side effects of donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamin and tacrine that result from acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and weight loss are the most common side effects of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Significant cholinergic side effects can occur in patients receiving higher doses; often they are related to the rate of initial titration of medication. Memantine is the first noncholinesterase inhibitor indicated for Alzheimer's disease. The side effects which may occur during the treatment with memantine are constipation, dizziness, headache and confusion. These effects if appears are mild end transient.","2414":"Benzodiazepines are among the most frequently prescribed drugs. Of all their side effects, hip fractures and possibility of developing dependence are usually studied. The aim of this study was to determine how often do psychiatric outpatients suffer from adverse effects of benzodiazepines, and which adverse effects do they notice. 109 patients on two consecutive days were asked to fill in the questionnaire. Among them were 29 women and 80 men. Ten women (1\/3) and 20 men (1\/4) refused to participate in the study. 68% of women and 93% of men used benzodiazepines at least once in a lifetime; 40% of women used benzodiazepines in the last seven days, and 93% of men (32% of women and 44% of men used benzodiazepines every day for the last seven days). Unfortunately, 8% of men used more then one benzodiazepine daily. All of the women who used benzodiazepines had at least one adverse effect; and 91% of men had adverse effects. One third of women and one quarter of men stopped taking benzodiazepines due to adverse effects. The mean number of adverse effects was 4.8 both in men and women. Those who stopped taking benzodiazepines didn't have more adverse effects in comparison to those who continued to use them. More than half of the participants suffered from sleepiness, slowness and fatigue. One third of the participants said they noticed the change in sexual drive. More then 30% of women noticed dizziness and only 6% of men. None of the participants said to have jaundice after using benzodiazepines. The same adverse effects were present in those who stopped taking the drugs and in those who continued to use them. The prevalence of benzodiazepine use is very high in psychiatric patients. Many of them notice adverse effects, but mainly continue to use the drug. ","2415":"Little research was done on the influence of antipsychotics' side effects on stigma of mental illness. An overview of studies shows that people with mental illness state that because of medication side effects they feel discriminated in the field of employment, observe worsening of family relations and tend to skip or discontinue their regular medication. It is difficult to discriminate between stigmatizing effects of antipsychotics and other stigma related factors such as illness symptoms. A focus group of ten patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder with severe and remitting mental illness treated with antipsychotic medication was conducted to obtain their personal views on how side effects of antipsychotic drugs affect their everyday lives and contribute to the stigmatization because of mental illness. The patients felt most stigmatized in areas of employment and occupation. They repeatedly skipped or discontinued regular medication due to side effects. Their families supported them throughout treatment and recovery despite problems associated with psychotropic medication. Medication induced stigma affects patients' lives in substantial ways and therefore merits further research, part of which is the patients' personal experience. ","2416":"The objective of this paper is to review therapeutic ways of management of antipsychotics side effects. In order to obtain this, modern guidelines were investigated, as well as recent articles on this subject. Guidelines recommend that side effects should be monitored regularly, and the side effect profile of the prescribed antipsychotic should be considered. In case of unacceptable side effects, changing to a different antipsychotic is recommended.","2417":"The side effects of antidepressants are important because they influence treatment process, patients' satisfaction with treatment and adherence to medications. Because of side effects correction of daily dosage of antidepressants is required in some cases, and sometimes therapy with particular antidepressant must be stopped. For this reason, management of side effects of antidepressants is part of routine clinical practice. The objective of this paper is to review recommendations from treatment guidelines and recent articles about management of antidepressants' side effects during treatment of major depressive disorder.","2418":"The side effects are a major issue in the contemporary psychopharmacotherapy. Treatment choices are largely determined by the side-effect profiles of mental health medications. The effects of psychopharmacotherapy result from highly complex interactions between mental health medications and the patient who takes them as well as from the context in which treatment occurs. A high level of care and caution is necessary during the whole course of psychopharmacotherapy to recognize any side effect and respond promptly and specifically. Creative psychopharmacotherapy demands a broad base of pharmacologic and neuroscience knowledge (evidence based practice), personal experience (practice based evidence) and favourable treatment context (well-being therapy, life coaching).","2419":"","2420":"Psychosocial interventions have been shown to enhance pharmacotherapy outcomes in bipolar affective disorder (BAD). This article describes an application of psychosocial intervention as the additional therapy for BAD. In this case report we present the course of illness, psychological features and specific chronic stress of a patient with BAD. Following the recent guidelines, we applied the pharmacotherapy together with an adjuvant psychosocial treatment (psycho-education, supportive and psychodynamic therapy). Psycho-education was used to inform patient and family members about the disorder, course of illness and treatment. Supportive therapy helped the patient to deal with her illness and deepened her understanding of her present problems. Psychodynamic psychotherapy was used to examine the meanings of unconscious conflicts and the ways the stressor activates the patient's deeply repressed traumatic experiences. This case study indicates that psychosocial treatment applied as adjuvant therapy of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of BAD may result in symptom remission, improvement of life quality and illness relapse prevention.","2421":"The aim of this article is to report weight loss in patients with schizophrenia after switching from olanzapine standard oral tablet (SOT) to olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets (ODT). In the first case report, the patient was switched to olanzapine ODT in daily dosage of 20 mg, while in the second case report, the patient was switched to olanzapine ODT in daily dosage of 15 mg, and weight loss was similar (14 kg vs. 15 kg). Switching patients from olanzapine SOT to olanzapine ODT treatment resulted in significant weight loss that was maintained during 12 months in both case reports. Further controlled clinical investigations are necessary to evaluate change in weight during treatment with olanzapine ODT, and to improve our understanding of this change.","2422":"Usher syndrome, the most common case of deaf - blindness, may be associated with various psychiatric disorders. Inability of communication through spoken language in association with progressive visual impairment affects diagnostics and management in case of co-morbidity with mental disorder. A patient with Usher syndrome and psychiatric symptoms is described and the difficulties in psychiatric assessment in her case are discussed. A 28 years old woman with hearing impairment diagnosed at the age of 3 months and progressive pigmentary retinopathy diagnosed at the age of 19 years, has been treated for ADHD in childhood, eating disorder in adolescence and psychosis-like disorder in adult life. Direct observation of patient behavior and the effects of pharmacotherapy were the main diagnostic procedures, since the use of sign language and handwriting was very limited. The limitations of management are discussed.","2423":"Naltrexone is a competitive opioid antagonist and is often used to maintain abstinence in detoxified opioid dependent patients. However, it can precipitate an accelerated withdrawal when ingested by an individual with concurrent opioid use. We report the case of a 28 year old male with opioid dependence syndrome presenting with chaotic symptoms following ingestion of naltrexone. Symptomatology, management is described and literature in this area is reviewed. Accidental or surreptitious ingestion of naltrexone in a patient with concurrent opioid use can precipitate symptoms typical of opioid withdrawal in addition to other varying symptomatology. Most cases would require sedation and management of concurrent vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinicians, especially those providing substance abuse and emergency care, need to be aware of the possibility of an accelerated and possibly life threatening withdrawal associated with naltrexone ingestion in an incompletely detoxified patient with opioid dependence. ","2424":"A comprehensive insight into drug utilization as an economic and primarily a public health issue can only be acquired in the context of overall health state of the respective population. The objectives of the study were: 1) to determine the real outpatient utilization of psychopharmaceuticals in Zagreb, 2) to determine the psychopharmaceutical prescribing quality during the study period; and 3) to propose appropriate interventions in Zagreb on the basis of the results obtained. Data on drug utilization were obtained from all Zagreb pharmacies. The number of defined daily doses (DDD) and number of DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day (DDD\/1000\/day) were calculated from the number of particular drug packages. The Drug Utilization 90% (DU90%) method was used as a criterion of prescribing quality. Outpatient utilization of psychopharmaceuticals showed a declining pattern from 115.40 DDD\/1000\/day in 2001 to 93.15 DDD\/1000\/day in 2006. Anxiolytics accounted for the majority of this drug group utilization in the City of Zagreb, although the anxiolytic\/antidepressant ratio decreased from 7.19 in 2001 to 3.86 in 2006. The utilization of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors showed a 2.5-fold increase and accounted for 90% of overall antidepressant utilization. A 2.5-fold decrease was recorded in the utilization of antipsychotics, while the atypical\/typical antipsychotic ratio changed from 1:2 in 2001 to 1.1:1 in 2006. Despite some improvement observed in the prescribing quality, the predominance of benzodiazepines in the utilization of psychopharmaceuticals points to the need of additional rationalization in the field. ","2425":"This longitudinal research is to follow the changes in quality of life and in anxiety level of patients treated with bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Patients selected in period from 1990 to 2000 were treated with bone marrow transplantation and were invited to participate in the study. In ten years period 299 patients were treated with BMT. 109 patients were included in this study (58 male and 51 female) after their informed consent was obtained. 42 of 109 patients were successfully monitored during a five year period and they successfully returned completed questionnaires. The level of Karnofsky scores show statistically significant difference related to time that passed since BMT. Average value of Karnofsky scores in a group of patients 3 months after BMT was 82.22, and in group five years after BMT was 91.76. There is statistically significant difference between these values (p=0.003). Results of anxiety as a trait and as a state also show statistically significant decrease between measuring after leaving the hospital and five years after BMT. There is statistically significant correlation between anxiety and quality of life, that is, with decrease of anxiety quality of life level increases. ","2426":"The paper presents the findings of our study researching the differences in strategies for coping with stress, social support, hassles and uplifts of sport, medical and psychology students at the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia. A random sample of 237 Slovene undergraduate university students was studied. The three groups were chosen among students of medicine, sport and psychology. It was found that there were no significant differences in strategies for coping with stress between the three groups of students. Significant differences between the groups were found in the number of uplifts and hassles, but not in the mean of both variables. Sport students had less social support compared with the other two groups of students, but the difference between actual and ideal social support is not significant. The results were interpreted according to our hypothesis and compared with findings of research in students' stress. Some suggestions for further research are given on the basis of the present research. ","2427":"The aim of the study was to examine the frequency and class of life events, as well as social support, in patients with panic disorder (with\/without agoraphobia) (PD\/PDA) in a 1-year period preceding the onset of panic attacks. The study sample included 40 patients (PD\/PDA) (of an average age of 39.25, SD 6.96), and 40 matched healthy controls (M 37.50, SD 8.05). The following instruments were applied: DSM-IV criteria for PD\/PDA, Stressful Life Events Scale, Social Support Index (SSI), Family Coping Coherence Index (FCCI), Relative and Friend Support (RFS) and Family Hardiness Index (FHI). The study was retrospective. Patients with PD\/PDA compared to the healthy controls, had significantly increased frequency of negative life events (M 3.8, min 0, max 11) (p&lt;0.05). With respect to the class of life events, PD\/PDA patients reported significantly more frequently: mild somatic illness, serious somatic illness, conflict with a member of the extended family, separation from a significant person (p&lt;0.05) and frequent marital conflicts (p&lt;0.01). The patients compared to the healthy controls, had significantly lower level of social support by SSI, FHI, and FCCI (p&lt;0.001). By RFS, there were no significant differences between the two groups. Increased frequency of negative life events (particularly somatic illness, interpersonal conflicts and separation), combined with absence of the most part of the supportive quality of the environment (particularly family support), precede the development of PD\/PDA in vulnerable persons. ","2428":"We have investigated the changes of Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) dimensions of personality in outpatients during 6 months of antidepressant treatment. 30 outpatients were treated for mild or moderate depressive episode, current mild or moderate episode of reccurent depressive disorder or mixed anxiety and depressive disorder (ICD-10). The intensity of depression was assessed by the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) at the beginning of treatment and then after the 1st, 3rd and 6th month of treatment. The TCI dimensions were assessed by the Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised (TCI-R) at the same time periods as the MADRS. The mean scores of the TCI-R dimensions and MADRS were processed by Wilcoxon pair test. We have observed a significant decrease in harm avoidance (HA) score after 6 months of treatment (p&lt;0.05), between the 1st and 6th month (p&lt;0.05), between the 3rd and 6th month, (p=0.033), significant increase in persistance (P) between the 1st and 6th month (p&lt;0.05) and a significant decrease in self-transcendence (ST) score after 3 months (p&lt;0.05) and after 6 months (p&lt;0.05). In the MADRS total score we have observed a significant decrease after the 1st (p&lt;0.001), 3rd (p&lt;0.001) and also 6th month (p&lt;0.001). Our findings showed changes of personality dimensions HA, P and ST in outpatients during antidepressant treatment. ","2429":"The article was designed to contribute to the empirical clarification of representational structures among adult psychiatric patients. According to psychoanalytic concepts, cognitive developmental psychology and attachment theory, various forms of adult psychopathology involve fundamental impairments in representational structures or cognitive-affective schemas. We conducted a study to research the structural characteristics of representations of self and significant others in patients with different, mostly severe mental disorders according to DSM-IV and Kernberg's structural criteria for personality organizations. The modified Blatt's method for assessment of conceptual levels of object representations, Kernberg's criteria for identity diffusion and some others measures were used in the analysis of spontaneous descriptions of self and significant others in 186 adult psychiatric in- and outpatients and 109 controls of both sexes. The results show significant differences in the developmental level of representational structures between different groups of psychiatric patients and healthy controls. Patients (particularly schizophrenic) reached lower scores on the Conceptual Level Scale compared to healthy controls. Patients' descriptions of self and significant others were more preoperational, concrete, one-dimensional, less differentiated and less integrated. They also described significant others and themselves in a more diffuse, contradictory and shallow way in comparison to healthy controls. Results support previous empirical findings and are for the most part in accordance with developmental cognitive and psychoanalytic theories. As mental representation is a central theoretical construct in cognitive science, in developmental and social psychology and also in psychoanalytic theory and research, the studies of representational structures may demonstrate an important contribution in understanding aspects of personality and psychopathology. ","2430":"Psoriasis is a chronic, hereditary disease generally characterized by eruption of erythematous, silvery-scaled plaques, predominantly on the elbows, knees, scalp and trunk, affecting between 1-2% of the population worldwide. Psoriasis is a multifactorial disease of unknown etiology. It has been shown that in some patients alcohol abuse has been associated with psoriasis. Chronic alcohol abuse results in the impairment of health-related, social and occupational functioning. Therefore the association of psoriasis and alcoholism represents one of the major psychodermatological issues where a multidisciplinary approach (including dermatologist, psychiatrist, psychologist and others) is crucial for optimal outcome.","2431":"Since intensive care medicine enables us to maintain blood circulation and respiration artificially for some time, the usual criteria for death, such as cardiac arrest and cessation of respiration, are not applicable in all cases. Thus, the irreversible breakdown of the brain functions have come to be accepted as the most prominent factor for the occurrence of death. This criterion is linked primarily to the disintegration of the organism as a whole. Yet the controversy surrounding the moment when a man can be declared dead has not yet been resolved. The decisive weak point in this controversial discussion seems to be that the notion of the \"organism as a whole\" is inadequately defined. The aim of this work is to fill this void. We developed four general criteria of life: integration, coordination, dynamics, and immanency. Moreover, four additional characteristics are necessary for a living being (organism as a whole): completion, indivisibility, autofinality, and identity. If one of these four characteristics is missing we can only speak of derivative life but not of a living being. In a brain dead body one finds a number of signs of life. These signs of life, however, are not signs of an organism as a whole but signs of a physiological combination of organs whose parts - directed from the outside - are dependent on each other. The brain dead body lacks the four criteria of a living being. Thus it is no longer a living person but purely derivated biological life.","2432":"Violence is what the victims experience as violence. Only they are able to measure what oppression, injury, pain or sexual violence can cause. Violence starts where human beings are constrained, humiliated, abjected and injured in their self-determination by other human beings. The experienced violence causes a trauma in most cases and in many cases also a PTSD. As a lot of epidemiological studies have affirmed, the highest lifetime-prevalence of PTSD appears after one respectively after a repeated act of sexual violence.It is important to define the circumstances of the action, by defining three fields of violence: domestic sexual violence, sexual violence in civil everyday life respectively violence, that occurs not inside families and sexual violence in wartime.Victims of all fields of violence can be found in Western Europe, the last mentioned form of violence predominant among refugees, but also among survivors of the last world war.","2433":"Acute stress disorder (ASD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are frequent, but not obligatory psychological sequelae following trauma. A major subgroup of patients face a chronic course of illness associated with an increased psychiatric comorbidity and significant impairments in psychosocial adaptation. The typical psychopathological symptoms of ASD and PTSD are best described within a multifactorial model integrating both neurobiological and psychosocial influences. The complex etiopathogenesis of acute and posttraumatic stress disorder favours multimodal approaches in the treatment. Differential psychotherapeutic and pharmacological strategies are available. In a critical survey on empirical studies, psychological debriefing cannot be considered as a positive approach to be recommended as general preventive measure during the immediate posttraumatic phase. Positive effects of cognitive-behavioral interventions can be established for ASD. Psychodynamic psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy and EMDR show promising results in the treatment of PTSD. Major clinical restrictions of patient sampling within special research facilities, however, do not allow an unconditional generalization of these data to psychiatric routine care. In an empirical analysis the SSRIs are the most and best studied medications for ASD and PTSD. In comparison to tricyclic antidepressants SSRIs demonstrate a broader spectrum of therapeutic effects and are better tolerated. The substance classes of SSNRI, DAS, SARI and NaSSA are to be considered as drugs of second choice. They promise a therapeutic efficacy equivalent to the SSRIs, being investigated so far only in open studies. MAO-inhibitors may dispose of a positive therapeutic potential, their profile of side effects must be respected, however. Mood stabilizers and atypical neuroleptics may be used first and foremost in add-on strategies. Benzodiazepines should be used only with increased caution for a short time in states of acute crisis. In early interventions, substances blocking the norepinephric hyperactivity seem to be promising alternatives. Stress doses of hydrocortisone may be considered as an experimental pharmacological strategy so far.","2434":"Trauma, traumatization, Acute stress reaction, Posttraumatic stress disorder and other disorders following exposure to traumatic stress are described. Classification according to ICD and DSM are presented and critically valued. The complex Posttraumatic Stress disorder is introduced in its symptoms and with a proposal for a classification. Problems in assessing traumatized individuals are referred and recommendations for interviews and testing procedure are presented. Structured interviews and tests in german language are described. Due to control stress load by the process of assessing the economic choice of instruments is recommended.","2435":"Studies of early childhood traumatic experiences have clearly established a causal relationship between the experience of childhood psychic trauma and long-term effects on cognitive emotional und social development. Children exposed to chronic trauma can have difficulty regulating their emotions as well as difficulty knowing and describing their feelings. Symptom formation and psychopathology up to long-term effects on personality development result in high numbers of emotional disorders like depression, anxiety and phobic disorders and co-morbid conditions like alcohol and drug abuse and antisocial behaviour. More intermediate-term consequences of childhood trauma are likely to reside in higher rates of risk for the development of conduct disorders, higher rates of teenage pregnancy, school droop out, and involvement with the juvenile court jurisdiction because of law violations. Early psychosocial interventions and trauma specific therapy along the developmental needs of children and adolescents and the opportunity for appropriate interventions to the specific needs of traumatised children are necessary at any point in time. To meet a child needs in daily life after traumatic experience different times of support and therapy are needed and involves parents, teachers, social workers and therapists as well. Clear cooperation and collaboration between care givers and mental health professionals are needed. Mental health professionals should be advisors for educators and all people concerned with the well being of children.","2436":"The essence of human uniqueness and what is special about humans is spirituality. What is unique to every human being is his: language, sociability, politic, science, art, technical and working attitudes, playing games, fun and laughter, as well as religiosity and ethical attitudes. All of these dimensions are based upon spirituality or even the human spirit. This paper aims to relate all these dimensions of human spirituality to the sick person and establish to what extent that person is imbued with them and whether he can rely on them. Furthermore, this paper attempts to shed some light on the limits of medicine, especially as seen by Ivan Illich. In the end we are left with a series of questions, and possibly with an indisputable fact that the person who is suffering physically or mentally is \"saved\" by his most amazing unique trait--his religiosity.","2437":"Fifty years ago, craving was defined as an \"urgent and overpowering desire, or irresistible impulse\", but subsequently, craving definitions have been modified by many authors and no unique definition of this phenomena, or a consensus in regards to its manifestation and significance exists. This review discusses the contemporary views of alcohol craving. Issues such as definition and different types, dynamics of craving, its mediators and moderators and clinical correlations are explored. We focused on the literature search (MEDLINE, PSYCHLIT, and EMBASE) and new findings in the addiction field, especially paying attention on the study of craving. There is growing evidence to suggest that craving is associated with different aspects of addiction (i.e. withdrawal, relapse) and clinical characteristics such as depression and anxiety. These different phenomena contribute individual differences in intensity, frequency and types of craving. At present, there are several different models to better describe the complexity of craving. Craving is not an exact, precisely measurable value but it is rather an uncertain, descriptive phenomenon. Further research (biological, sociological and psychological) should be orientated primarily toward exploration of the relationship between environmental factors and personality variables and craving and its maintenance, with special attention to gender differences. ","2438":"Concern has been expressed that it may be difficult to provide certain interventions to some ethnic groups in an Early Intervention Service for Psychosis, and that as a consequence, three-year outcomes for the different Ethnic Groups may be different in different groups. To test whether there are differences between the three year outcomes of different ethnic groups represented in the patient population of an Early Intervention service for Psychosis. The three-year outcomes for the first group of 62 Patients to receive three years treatment in the Early Intervention Service in Luton, Bedfordshire were examined. This group well represented the ethnic mix of the population of Luton. It does not appear that there are major differences between the three-year outcomes of any one of the three groups studied. However the South Asian Patients appear to present earlier, with shorter DUPs, seemed more likely to marry, live with their families, and seem more likely to return to higher education after a first psychotic episode of psychosis compared to the Caucasians. Afro-Carribeans and South Asians were more likely to be unemployed, but many South Asians were employed, as were Caucasians. The fewest persons employed were in the Afro-Caribbean group. While slightly more South Asians and Afro-Carribeans were admitted compulsorily under the mental health act over the three years, 60% of each of the two non-white groups were never admitted compulsorily. This is different from the reported national trends of the Mental Health act being used excessively with the Afro-Caribbean population. No previous study has looked at the outcomes of Early Intervention Services for First Psychotic Episodes according to the Ethnic Origin of the Clients. The better outcomes seen with South Asians are probably due to cultural factors among the South Asians born in this country, rather than to issues related to the Psychotic Illness itself. These findings are important in planning services in areas where there is much ethnic diversity. The above conclusions must be understood as relating to patients who are well engaged with services. It would be unwise to extrapolate these outcomes to patients in the general population who have not engaged with services. ","2439":"The aim of this study was to establish the morbidity structure among testators whose wills were challenged as well as to reveal if there is a specific relationship between certain diagnostic categories in the testators' health status and forensic psychiatry expert opinion on testamentary incapacity. The authors analyzed 156 consecutive forensic psychiatry reports on retrospective, determination of testamentary capacity made in the Forensic Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Belgrade in the period 1965 - 2005. The wills covered by this study were mostly made by male, 65 years old or older testators, with primary education, who executed a holograph will and survived it for less than a year. Testamentary incapacity for medical reasons was established in 47% of the testators, while a strong, statistically significant relationship between a diagnostic category and testamentary incapacity was established among the testators suffering from an organic mental disorder (Chi-square=133.256, p=0.000) or a substance induced mental disorder (Chi-square=6.971, p=0.008). Testamentary capacity is a specific focus of medical assessment given that the evidence for overturning a will is generally dependent upon medical assessment. In that respect, much litigation and expenses could be avoided if medical experts were given a chance to correctly assess the testamentary capacity of a person at the time of making a will. The fact remains that our findings may not be a representative cross-section of the general population, and this important issue certainly deserves to be addressed by future research based on a larger sample. ","2440":"Majority of Bosnia-Herzegovina (BH) residents were exposed to cumulative traumatic events during and after the (1992-1995) war, which demanded emergency organizing of psychosocial support as well as psychiatric-psychological treatment of psychotraumatized individuals. To describe organizing of psychosocial help during and after the BH war, institutional treatment of psychotraumatized in the frame of mental health service reform program with an overview on the model of psychosocial support and psychiatry-psychological treatment of psychotraumatized persons of Tuzla Canton region. The retrospective analysis of functioning in the Department for traumatic stress disorders on the Psychiatry Clinic in Tuzla for the 1999-2003 period has been described in regard of number, gender, age and trauma related mental disorders of referred patients. In the observed period, 8.329 of patients in the outpatient care program were included, 617 of inpatients were treated in the Clinic, while 301 of patients in the Partial hospitalization program were included. Mean +\/- standard deviation of patients' age was 45+\/-8.06 years. More psychotraumatized women (60.8%) were encompassed in the partial hospitalization program than in inpatients (23.9%) or outpatients (18.3%) care programs. In regard of trauma related mental disorders, majority outpatients had Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in co morbidity with other mental disorders (72.5%), PTSD was presented amongst the majority of inpatients (64.5%) and in partial hospitalization program there were (47.5%) patients with PTSD. In the treatment of psychotraumatized persons, in the organizing of health care system schema in postwar Bosnia and Herzegovina, meaningful obstacles are presented still today on the both, social and political level, despite mental health service reform performed in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The stigmatization of mental health issues is an important problem in treatment of traumatized individuals especially among war veterans. The lack a single Center for psychotrauma in postwar BH shows absence of political will in BH to resolve the problem of war veterans with trauma related psychological disorders. ","2441":"To determine the correlation between social support and PTSD symptoms in women traumatized by the war and postwar social insecurity in Herzegovina. The experimental group consisted of 187 randomly selected women living in Mostar, who were exposed to a wide spectrum of traumatic events during the war. The control group included 180 women living in the area surrounding Mostar who were not directly exposed to war destruction. Demographic data were obtained and a battery of psychological tests was used to measure the level of war traumatization and PTSD symptoms, along with the perception of social support. Women in the experimental group had significantly lower levels of perceived social support from friends (t=2.91; p&lt;0.05) and coworkers (t=2.30; p&lt;0.05). However, its protective significance for all levels of posttraumatic symptoms was strong, even stronger than social support from the family. Of all the sources of emotional social support, low level of perceived support from friends is the only significant predictor of PTSD. The sources of social support which the traumatized women drew from family, friends and coworkers change their significance depending on their availability. These sources are a strong predictive factor of PTSD development.

Patients of a psychiatric nursing home were assessed for TD by means of the AIMS on two occasions ten years apart. Out of 10 patients who met criteria for TD at baseline the global judgement of severity of the AIMS improved in 5, worsened in 4 and remained unchanged in one patient. The mean sum score of the AIMS slightly increased from 5.5 to 6.3. No patient developed movements that incapacitated him in his daily activities. In concordance with the available literature these findings support the view that under continuous treatment with antipsychotics there is an equal chance for improvement as for deterioration. Progressive worsening to severe forms of TD was not observed. ","2443":"To determine the influence of global cerebral ischemia on the activation of extracellular-regulated kinases (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) in optic nerves of rats exposed to different reperfusion periods. Transient global cerebral ischemia (20-min duration) was induced by the four-vessel occlusion method. After different reperfusion periods (5 and 10 min; 1; 6 and 12 h after ischemia), optic nerves were extracted and ERK and JNK activation signals were determined by Western immunoblot analyses. The activation signals of ERK and JNK were detected within first 10 min of reperfusion, but striking activation for both enzymes was found 1 h after ischemia. After a transient decrease, the activation of ERK returned to peak level after 12 h of reperfusion in the second wave of kinase activation. In that period, a slight increase of JNK activation was registered. Our results demonstrated for the first time that ERK and JNK were activated in rat optic nerves during early and later periods of reperfusion, suggesting their potential active role in the response of cerebral white matter tissue to ischemic injury.

This is a case report of such a person, F.V., 25 years old female, with no documents and other affirmed auto and heteroanamnestic data. Her psychical state and ability of communication do not allow realization of certain autoanamnesis and in the same time she has no family or relatives to give heteroanamnestic data. It is also unknown exact date and place of birth. Only certain data were that she lived in many orphanages, refugees' camps and communes in several European countries. She immigrated illegally in Croatia where she has made some criminal acts and earned forensic status. We tried to evaluated the complex status of our patient from several points of view and tried to answer to the questions where to start and what to do with such a person to do the best for her and including her human rights.

Marked differences between regions were noticed in patterns of service provision and utilization. In contrast with the scarcity of mental health services in the Zasavska and Notranjsko-kraska region, the Central-Slovenian region offered the most diverse and abundant choice of services of all statistical regions. We lack day and structured activity services offering work or work-related activities. Out-patient and community services are mainly medium intensity non-mobile services that offer continuing care.","2447":"We focus on the relationships between schizophrenia and religiosity, on the basis of the review of literature and the data of an ongoing study about religiousness and personality, and religious coping conducted among outpatients with schizophrenia. Religion may be part of the psychopathology, but some of its dimensions may be protective from the negative effects of the illness. Religion may be relevant for the treatment of people with schizophrenia in that it may help to reduce pathology, to enhance coping and to foster recovery. Religiosity is multidimensional concept and so it must be evaluated in the people with schizophrenia (Aukst-Margetic et al. 2005).","2448":"It can be said that (re)integration of mental patients is the basic goal of psychiatry as a medical discipline. Throughout the history of psychiatry different approaches to treatment and rehabilitation of mental patients and their social (re)integration have been identified and monitored. There have always existed different impediments to the (re)integration of mental patients, as a manifestation of the times when treatment and rehabilitation took place. In the beginning of psychiatric development, the principal goal, in line with the social development and social awareness of human rights, was to isolate the patient away from his\/her social environment and place him\/her into a psychiatric hospital, preferably for life. Lately, as fighting for human rights grew into a matter of fashion and prestige rather than an ethical and legal issue, the media have often spoken about the human rights of mental patients and, explicitly or implicitly, advocated their social (re)integration. This cry for human rights of mental patients has virtually rooted out the advocates for permanent social isolation, even in this region. However, the Croatian media often give out the so called mixed messages when it comes to treating mental patients. This article analyzes such contradictory communication and attempts to offer certain solutions.","2449":"The integrative approach to psychiatry has gained more importance in recent years. Is it justified or not, does it improve theory or practice, those are only some of the questions to which we are looking for answers, but in this paper we shall underline the necessity of enrolling forensic psychiatry into integrative, modern psychiatry. The reason and the motive for that integration is the fact that nowadays the content and the activities of contemporary forensic psychiatrists are totally reduced to executing the tasks given by courts. It is therefore entirely right to say that current forensic psychiatry finds itself in the passive role of executing orders of the court. Our aim is to point out how important it is that forensic psychiatry becomes an interdisciplinary profession in interaction with psychiatry but also with other medical branches just as with judiciary, educational institutions, moral-ethical institutions and religious institutions in producing preventive programmes and by participating in individual decision making process likewise. Our primary goal is to present the status and the position of contemporary forensic psychiatry and to specify the necessary improvements and its place in integrative psychiatry. It should be better, more meaningful and more ethical, both for the individual and the society in total. We want forensic psychiatry to include a protective and therapeutic role for each individual forensic examinee, i.e. a person who has already been in forensic examination and for whom one evaluates mental competence because of a mental disorder. We also want it to get a far larger and more active general role in society in terms of preventing criminal acts among the mentally ill and in society in total.","2450":"The main aim of this study was to point on role and importance of consulting psychiatry in paediatric population of patients particularly in branch of paediatric surgery. This study is a view to a few years research on biopsychosocial aspect of treatment of long bones fractures in children and adolescents realized in Departments for paediatric surgery of three hospitals, in Zagreb and Rijeka, Croatia, as well as in Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, in period 2003.-2007. There have been investigated 135 patients, both gender, 10-18 years of age differently treated for long bones limbs' fractures. Basic methods of work were self-reported questionnaires to evaluate the degree of self-esteem, depression, anxiety, quality of life and perception of social support in mentioned patients. Our results pointed at the influence of type of treatment of long bones fractures on psychological variables, mostly on self-esteem and self-perception of quality of life. As a conclusion, we suggest the possibility of psychological preparation of the patients in order to diminish the psychological reaction to the surgical treatment, as well as individual consulting (liaison) psychiatric intervention during the treatment of fractures of long bones according to the individual needs.","2451":"An example which confirmes the adequacy of the integrative perspective in medicine is depression in dermatology because of the sufficient number of arguments linking depression and some chronic skin conditions in depth more than simply comorbidity. In recent literature, the authors found, how depression in dermatology occurs significantly more frequently than in the general population. In dermatological patients the prevalence of depression is around 30% which is more in comparison to patients in general practice where prevalence of depression is 22%. The authors found a considerable similarity in the various characteristics between depression and psoriasis, based upon recent research findings in immunity disorder and elevated concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines as well as acute phase proteins in both disorders, indicating that both disorders can be considered as immunologicaly mediated, inflammatory states with repetitive chronic progress and similar comorbidity. The afore mentioned theoretical settings evoke the integrative aspect and the integrative interdisciplinary approach placing in the center of attention not only the diseased person with his fears, needs, preocupations and expectations during treatment, but the person who is at risk of becoming burdened with these disorders.","2452":"Psychodermatological or psychocutaneous disorders are conditions resulting from the interaction between the mind and the skin. There are three major groups of psychodermatological disorders; psychophysiologic disorders, psychiatric disorders with dermatologic symptoms, and dermatologic disorders with psychiatric symptoms. Along with the standard dermatological treatment, majority of these disorders can be treated with cognitive-bihevioral psychotherapy, psychoterapeutic stress-and-anxiety-management technicques and psychotropic drugs. Therefore, understanding of biopsychosocial approaches and liaison approach involving general practice, psychiatrist, dermatologist and psychologist treatment in this field is essential.","2453":"The influence of anxiety and depression on cardiovascular disease is well-known in terms of chronic cardiovascular and ischemic states. It happens mostly through diminished cardiac vagal modulation and greater procoagulant activity in depressed patients. But the impact of emotional factors in acute cardiac events is not estimated enough. From the clinician's point of view, there are an increasing awareness concerning external circumstances and external triggering in sudden cardiac death, that is caused by malignant ventricular arrhythmias or myocardial infarction. A number of external, i.e. exogenous factors in everyday life can be implicated in triggering such events. Including heavy physical activity, emotional stressors, meteorologic variables, air pollutants, chronobiologic phenomena, food ingestions, coffee, alcohol etc., emotional stress seems to be among the most often triggers of sudden event. There is a wide range of everyday situations and activities that involves activation of sympathetic nervous system, and emotional stressors are described as trigger caused by sympathetic arousal. Acute emotional arousal can trigger life-threatening arrhythmias and the mechanisms of that risk have been recognized. Acute episode of emotional distress (and notably anger-like stress) may trigger ventricular ectopic beats and tachycardia, as well as acute myocardial infarction. These sudden phenomena can be the result of the endogenous response to external risk of acute emotional stress. Sudden death without antecedent angina, suggesting cardiac arrhythmia, as well as deaths preceded by chest pain, suggesting coronary occlusion were observed in many studies that have led to estimates that between 20 and 40 percent of sudden cardiac deaths are precipitated by acute emotional stressors.","2454":"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and metabolic syndromes are growing public health problems in post-war countries. Understanding the co-morbidity among PTSD, depression and metabolic syndrome has an important clinical and theoretical issue. To examine the relationship between combat-related PTSD, co-morbid depression and metabolic syndrome as well as between severity of depression and metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome and co-morbid depression were investigated in 100 male war veterans with combat PTSD and in 79 males who needed medical attention in dispensary of family medicine. Metabolic syndrome according NCEP: ATP III was found in 25 % of war veterans with PTSD. Metabolic syndrome was identified more frequently in PTSD patients with co-morbid depression (47.8 %) compared to those without depression (9.1%). PTSD with moderate and severe co-morbid depression was associated with higher rates of metabolic syndrome (78.6% and 90.9% respectively) in comparison with mild depression (26.2%). PTSD is frequently comorbid with depression, and when the two disorders co-occur, the risk for metabolic syndrome is increased. Treatment of war veterans with PTSD should address co-morbid depression and metabolic syndrome as well as the clinical features of PTSD. ","2455":"One of the central issues in the psychotherapy of suicidal patients is the countertransference. Key concepts in countertransference include projective identification, role-responsiveness and countertransference enactment. It is important to recognize that countertransference can be effective in understanding the emotional intensity of the suicidal person's internal world. There is a significant relationship between treatment outcome and the different countertransference feelings among the therapists. In this paper we have illustrated important factors for understanding psychiatrist's countertransference reactions when working with suicidal patients.","2456":"The concept of individualized drug therapy on the basis of pharmacogenetics has become a central focus in the treatment of depression. There is an increasing agreement about the importance of polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 enzymes and the effects of drug-drug interactions in relation to the incidence of adverse effects. There has been also increasing focus on the role of the drug transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) with regard to drug penetration into the brain. P-gp at the blood-brain barrier can exert a profound effect on the ability of some antidepressants to enter the brain. In addition, genetic polymorphism of the serotonin transporter has been investigated in relationship to the therapeutic response to several antidepressants, especially SSRIs. However, prediction of response on the basis of variants of candidate genes is incipient and remains elusive.","2457":"The original term schizoaffective disorder was invented 75 years ago by Kasanin as a response to diagnostic difficulty with patients who did not fit well in Kraepelin's dichotomy of dementia praecox and affective disorder. However, this was not the perfect solution since criteria for diagnosing schizoaffective disorder were not firmly set at that time. The broad category of schizoaffective disorders included not only patients with co-occurring schizophrenic and affective symptoms but also other \"atypical\" psychoses. Over time diagnostic criteria became more defined but the original question still remains the same: is there any such thing as schizoaffective disorder? This paper presents some historical and modern data which may help clarify this issue, but it is still premature to give a definitive answer on all pending questions related to this interesting topic.","2458":"Suicidal behavior is a major health risk in schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to evaluate serum cholesterol concentrations and some socio-demographic parameters in suicidal and non-suicidal men suffering from schizophrenia. Results of this study show that there were no differences in socio-demographic parameters between suicidal and non-suicidal schizophrenic patients but there was a difference in the level of cholesterol (lower in suicidal patients). Duration of untreated psychosis was higher in suicidal patients, which could means that suicidality is a process determined by many different factors including time of treatment. Suicidal patients in our study have been more seriously ill than non-suicidal (had higher scores on PANNS and HDRS-17) and we explained these findings by the fact of damage associated to higher time of non-treatment. Our results show that cholesterol has an important role in distinguishing suicidal from non-suicidal patients, which, if confirmed on a higher number of patients and in more studies, may be of considerable clinical significance. Clinical management of suicidal states is based on integrative approach and includes ensuring immediate safety, the use of psychosocial techniques to address depression and psychosocial stressors, and targeted pharmacotherapy for psychotic and depressive symptoms.","2459":"There has been a growing interest in the effect that comorbid schizophrenia and metabolic syndrome may have on each other. To examine metabolic syndrome from integrative medicine point of view including prevalence of metabolic syndrome in patients with schiziphrenia compared to their first-degree relatives, healthy volunteers without schizophrenia in close family, and patients with PTSD, as well as the percentage patients with schizophrenia without any component of metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome according to NCEP\/ATP III criteria and number of its components were analysed in 205 patients with schizophrenia, 140 healthy volunteers and 105 patients with combat PTSD. Metabolic syndrome was identified in 45.9% of the patients with schizophrenia, 38.1% of the war veterans with PTSD, 36.7% of the first-degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia and 16.2% of the healthy volunteers without schizophrenia in close family. Only 21.5% of the patients with schizophrenia were without any metabolic syndrome component. The comorbidity of schizophrenia and metabolic syndrome is very important for theory and practice of integrative medicine. Almost 80% of the patients with schizophrenia have increased risk or developed cardiovascular disorders,. ","2460":"Reduced n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) content in red blood cell (RBC) membranes and abnormal membrane phospholipid metabolism were repeatedly implicated in the etiology of schizophrenia. Prenatal and perinatal depletion of PUFAs interferes with normal brain development and function. The lack of docosahexaenoic acid - DHA in the brain is reflected in lower membrane DHA\/AA (AA - arachidonic acid) ratio, increased activity of AA-metabolizing enzymes, and disturbance of downstream metabolic pathways involved in signaling, growth modulation, brain glucose uptake, immune functions, neurotransmission, synaptogenesis and neurogenesis. Preliminary high-throughput metabolomic studies revealed abnormal biochemical profile in patients with schizophrenia or brief psychotic disorder when compared to healthy controls. The results of both metabolomic and proteomic studies pointed to energy metabolism and lipid biosynthesis being impaired in schizophrenia. The usefulness of antipsychotic medication and supplementation with PUFAs in reverting to the normal metabolic state has been suggested in early treatment of the first psychotic episode. Abnormalities of phospholipid metabolism can be also detected as attenuated niacin skin flush response in the variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. Disturbances of lipid homeostasis could represent biochemical markers in the preclinical phase of neuropsychiatric illnesses and could serve as triggers in genetically vulnerable individuals. The assessment of patients' lipid status may also help in monitoring the course of the disease and treatment response. In this regard, simple, cheap and fast niacin skin flush test might be valuable. It might help in diagnosis of adolescents and young adults with psychotic behaviour, or in defining the necessity for long-term antipsychotic therapy. Along with antipsychotic medication schizophrenic patients need specific medical nutrition therapies. ","2461":"One of the most challenging problems in clinical psychiatry are inter-individual differences in clinical response to antipsychotic treatment. Several studies were investigating the impact of the polymorphic cytochrome P450 2D6 gene (CYP 2D6) on the psychopathological and extrapyramidal symptoms, but the results were conflicting. There is a lack of clinical studies of the impact of CYP2D6 polymorphism on therapeutic efficacy, especially in the long-term treatment of schizophrenia. The aim of the presentation was to evaluate the impact of CYP2D6 genotype on psychopathological and extrapyramidal symptoms in a group of Slovenian outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in stable remission, who were receiving long-term maintenance therapy.","2462":"Epidemiological studies suggest a strong heritability in schizophrenia. Positive family history is the greatest risk factor for developing schizophrenia. However, regarding the genetic factors in schizophrenia, there is a lot of the inconsistency (i.e. non-replication) in the literature of the associations of different genes with schizophrenia. The presence of a single gene is neither sufficient, nor necessary to cause schizophrenia. The understanding of the genetic basis of schizophrenia is complex. Besides different gene polymorphisms, numerous environmental factors, interacting with genes, contribute to susceptibility to schizophrenia. Such factors include the use of street drugs, childhood head injury, maternal infection during pregnancy, paternal age at conception, stressful life events and urban upbringing. While knowing genetic risks, integrative psychiatry may have a role in reducing other modifiable risk factors, including reduction of stress level, stress management strategies, family consultation\/education, education against street drugs use, treatment of prodromal symptoms and development of social skills.","2463":"The main purposes of the article are to present the history of integration in psychotherapy, the reasons of the development integrative approaches, and the approaches to integration in psychotherapy. Three approaches to integration in psychotherapy exist: theoretical integration, theoretical eclecticism, and common factors in different psychotherapeutic trends. In integrative psychotherapy, the basic epistemology, theory, and clinical practice are based on the phenomenology, field theory, holism, dialogue, and co-creation of dialogue in the therapeutic relationship. The main criticism is that integrative psychotherapy suffers from confusion and many unresolved controversies. It is difficult to theoretically and methodologically define the clinically applied model that is based on such a different epistemological and theoretical presumptions. Integrative psychotherapy is a synthesis of humanistic psychotherapy, object relations theory, and psychoanalytical self psychology. It focuses on the dynamics and potentials of human relationships, with a goal of changing the relations and understanding internal and external resistances. The process of integrative psychotherapy is primarily focused on the developmental-relational model and co-creation of psychotherapeutic relationship as a single interactive event, which is not unilateral, but rather a joint endeavor by both the therapist and the patient\/client. The need for a relationship is an important human need and represents a process of attunement that occurs as a response to the need for a relationship, a unique interpersonal contact between two people. If this need is not met, it manifests with the different feelings and various defenses. To meet this need, we need to have another person with whom we can establish a sensitive, attuned relationship. Thus, the therapist becomes this person who tries to supplement what the person did not receive. Neuroscience can be a source of integration through different therapies. We may say that both neuroscience and neurobiology offer yet another bridge for integration of different schools of thought and supports the importance of the developmental relational model during the developmental phases and relational process in psychotherapy in which the quality of therapeutic relationship is the primary healing process. Furthermore, the development of integrative psychotherapy in Croatia and the organization of the Croatian program, which is identical to the program of the European Association for Integrative Psychotherapy is shortly described.","2464":"Psychiatry is a medical discipline addressing the study, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mental disorders. Psychiatric disorders, which may be seen in people of all ages, involve the emotions, the will, and intellectual processes, verbal and non-verbal behaviour. According to current knowledge we cannot speak about only one cause but of the interaction of several etiological factors, mutually pervading and causing the mental illness. Because of this the treatment of mental disorders involves the complex implementation of biological, psycho-therapeutic, and socio-therapeutic methods of treatment. The contemporary principle of integrative psychiatry immanently requires simultaneous treatment of three human components: body, mind, and spirit. The holistic approach emphasizes the importance of the wholeness of the human person, and the inter-dependence of his components.","2465":"Modern psychiatry in the last century proposed several aggregative biopsychosocial models as an opposition to prevailing fragmentary, reductionistic and dogmatic approaches. Although the biopsychosocial approach has become the mainstream concept of the present-day psychiatry, it is not fruitful enough because it is excessively broad and provides no real complex field integration and guidance to clinicians and researchers. The postmodern psychiatry alternatives have been appeared as pluralism and integrationism. Holistic and integrative approach in medicine and psychiatry is built on the premise that human beings in health and disease are complex systems of dinamically interacting biological, psychological, social, energetic, informational and spiritual processes. Emerging as a transdisciplinary holistic, complementary and integrative psychiatry implies widely accepted general systems theory on psychopathology, novel integrating interpretative models, new integrative understanding of etiopathogenesis or meanings of symptoms, and novel integrative assessment and treatment approaches addressing those etiopathogenesis and meanings.","2466":"","2467":"Male genital self-mutilation is an infrequently reported event in the general medical literature. The majority of cases deal with a single episode of self-mutilation. These cases are usually focused on surgical repair. We present an extremely rare situation of two cases of male genital self-mutilation occurring in the same family. Both patients were treated for schizophrenia. Both patients had religious psychotic experiences and guilt feelings associated with sexual conflicts. Both patients had an experience of setting fire. Although they were close relatives, the younger did not imitate the older one when he mutilated his genitals. The possible causes of such behavior have been analyzed in the light of the recent literature.","2468":"Tardive dystonia is a syndrome of sustained muscle contractions, frequently causing twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures, associated with prolonged exposure to antipsychotics. We report a case of a 35-year-old patient with schizophrenia who developed a generalized form of tardive dystonia after switching of clozapine to risperidone treatment that persisted after switch to olanzapine and during the period while treatment with an antipsychotic was discontinued. It was successfully managed with reintroduction of clozapine. The case may represent the first report of generalized tardive dystonia while taking risperidone. The possible pathophysiological bases of the disorder are discussed. The goal of our report is to emphasize that an adequate trial of clozapine is a worthwhile option in the cases of tardive dystonia, even where discontinuation of antipsychotics was unsuccesful.","2469":"To assess the effectiveness of aripiprazole in the treatment of patients with psychotic symptoms in the emergency psychiatric setting. We considered all patients admitted to a psychiatric intensive care unit of a general hospital in a two year-period, treated with at least one dose of aripiprazole. We measured 1) the rate of cases starting aripiprazole who did not change antipsychotic in the course of hospitalization; 2) the rate of cases who were concurrently treated with another antipsychotic; 3) the CGI Improvement score. In 63 cases, aripiprazole was started on admission. Forty-nine (77.7%) of these cases were treated with aripiprazole also on discharge. Among the 63 cases who started aripiprazole on admission, 22 (34.9%) were concurrently treated with another antipsychotic. Among the 53 cases discharged with aripiprazole, 15 (28.3%) were concurrently treated with another antipsychotic. Of the 49 cases treated with aripiprazole both on admission and on discharge, 24 cases were much improved, 11 cases moderately improved, 10 cases mildly improved, and 4 cases were not improved at the CGI Improvement Score. Aripiprazole should be considered as first line treatment in some patients affected by psychotic disorders visited in the emergency psychiatric setting. ","2470":"Choice of antidepressant is a daily problem in clinical work. Clinical predictors of therapeutic response to antidepressants are not yet available. We explored the possibility of using a signal analysis of skin conductance response (SCR) in specifying the imbalances of the neurotransmitter systems in the brain. The method consists in application of the system identification theory in analyzing the regulation of SCR. Eleven short stories from the contemporary literature have been used to elicit emotional arousal in subjects. Participants were divided into two groups, a group of depressed patients (n=57), and a healthy control group (n=52). The resulting mathematical model of SCR revealed two feedback loops. Significant differences have been found between depressed patients and healthy subjects in the sense of stronger signals in both identified feedback loops in depression. We considered these results in the context of the data regarding: (i) the functional neuroanatomy of SCR, and (ii) the neurochemical characteristics of depression. The methodological approach that is still to be examined could be useful in prediction of response to a specific antidepressant. ","2471":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the phenomenology of a newly structured Austrian tertiary - care hospital consultation - liaison (C - L) psychiatry service. We compared two 1 - year surveys over two years of observation (2003 - 2005). Survey A (August 1, 2003, until July 31, 2004) comprised 1474 consecutive new consultations, and the more recent Survey B (August 1, 2004, until July 31, 2005) extended over 1833 consecutive new referrals to our C - L service. Psychiatric referrals were analyzed with regard to consultation rate, demographic characteristics, referring departments, principal reasons for referral, diagnostic characteristics, and intervention patterns. The consultation rate increased by 0.61% from 2.69% in Survey A to 3.30% in Survey B. Internal medicine consistently accounted for almost 31% of all referrals in both surveys. In Survey A, the most common psychiatric diagnoses were adjustment disorders (21.4%), depressive disorders (18.5%), and delirium (18.1%). The most prevalent diagnoses in Survey B were adjustment disorders (24.5%), delirium (18.8%), and depressive disorders (14.3%). Pharmacotherapy was the most frequent action in both surveys and accounted for between 45% and 49% of all actions. This study underscores the need for specially planned C - L services in Austria that provide both psychiatric and psychosocial care for patients who are medically ill. ","2472":"Psychometric properties of the DSM-IV Axis V scales in measuring adaptational functioning of psychotraumatised veterans have been chosen as the focus of this study. The reliability and validity of the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF), the Social and Occupational Assessment Scale (SOFAS), and the Global Assessment of Relational Functioning (GARF) were examined in a clinical sample of 129 veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The interrater reliability of the GAF (ICC=0.82) and the SOFAS (ICC=0.83) was excellent, while the interrater reliability of the GARF (ICC=0.75) was good. Correlations with other clinician-rated scales of psychopathology and overall functioning showed that the GAF is primarily related to a reduction in functioning due to psychiatric symptoms, while an assessment of functioning beyond psychopathology, considering the effects of the individual's general medical condition as well, was provided by the SOFAS and the GARF, which is of importance for a comprehensive evaluation of the patients' health status. The factor analysis of the Axis V scales revealed a theoretically meaningful, single common factor (variance accounted for by the extracted factor = 76.91%), while observed differences, between the subjects with complete and partial PTSD, in scores on the axis V scales support further use of the axis V scales as useful outcome variables. The issue of a valid and reliable measurement of functional impairment is of paramount importance not only in the domain of clinical psychiatry but in forensic practice as well. In this respect, our findings give strong support to extending the scope of the DSM axis V scales with the two experimental scales which provide both conceptual framework and useful tools for reliable and valid evaluation of adaptatinal functioning in persons suffering from PTSD. ","2473":"The traumatic events experienced in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the 1992-1995 conflict may have a lasting effect on the mental health of the citizens, characterized by high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. A diagnosis of PTSD, depression, and anxiety among family physician residents could affect their ability to diagnose and treat patients for depression, anxiety and PTSD. To assess PTSD, depression and anxiety symptoms and prevalence amongst family medicine residents (FMR) who were general practitioners (GP) in different war engagements and compare them with FMR who were medical students, 9 years after the 1992-1995 war in Bosnia-Herzegovina (BH). We applied the Bosnia-Herzegovina versions of both the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ) for PTSD symptoms, and Hopkins Symptom Checklist - 25 (HSCL-25) for anxiety and depression symptoms to 78 residents (age 30-45 years, 84.6% females), who lived in BH during the conflict years. PTSD prevalence of 10.3% and depression and anxiety prevalence of 21.8%, was found. The anxiety symptoms score was significantly higher amongst FMR who were GPs (1.69+\/-0.66) than medical students (1.40+\/-0.41, t-test=2.219, P=0.029) during the war. ","2474":"Kainic acid (KA) is used as an experimental agent which produces convulsions and neurotoxic lesions. Lamotrigine (LTG) is an antiepileptic drug, a glutamate release inhibitor, with action at the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel. The aim of the present study was to investigate the Na+-K+-ATPase activity in the hippocampus and cortex of rats with KA-induced convulsions. Further, this study was also designed to investigate the influence of the LTG pre-treatment on the mentioned hippocampal and cortex changes. The study was carried out on Hannover-Wistar rats. Na+, K+-ATPase activity from hippocampal and temporal cortex tissue was determined two hours after a single subcutaneous KA (8 mg\/kg) injection as well as on the third or the fifth experimental day. LTG (30 mg\/kg i.p.) was used one hour before KA application and during the next two or four consecutive days. All animals of KA and KA+LTG groups were observed during the first 2 hours after KA application and their behavior was noted. Only animals with characteristically KA-induced behavioral changes observed were used in the study. KA typical behavioral changes were confirmed with electroencephalography. After KA application, Na+, K+-ATPase activity was significantly inhibited. Na+-K+-ATPase activity inhibition in the hippocampus of the LTG pretreated rats on the fifth experimental day was statistically less pronounced than in KA treated rats. The LTG pretreatment showed also a protective effect on the Na+-K+-ATPase activity in the rats' brain cortex. KA systemic application induced Na+, K+- ATPase activity inhibition in the rat hippocampus and cortex and LTG pre-treatment showed a partially protective effect on the enzyme activity. ","2475":"In this editorial we will first use the findings of epidemiological research to show that the closer we get to brain dysfunction, the higher is the suicide risk (Where?). Secondly, a distinction will be made between the proximate and ultimate causation of suicide behaviour as a biological phenomenon (Why?). Using the evolutionary psychiatry approach, the ultimate causation of suicide could answer the question why does suicidal behaviour exist at all? Third, we will review the most attractive recent molecular genetic findings in the field of suicidology genetics (How?). These three perspectives will in turn lead us to summarise where, why and how suicide risk is generated?","2476":"","2477":"Slovenia, with its population of 2 million, has one of the highest suicide rates in Europe (around 30 per 100,000). It has been determined by twin studies that up to 45% of the variance in suicidal ideation and behaviour may be attributable to genetic variables. In the present paper we report on a case of a male suicide victim. Before the psychological autopsy was performed we genotyped this person for 15 genetic polymorphisms of the serotonergic pathway, since molecular-genetic studies of neurotransmitters from brain and blood samples of suicide victims have shown that the serotonergic system might be implicated in suicide. This case report evaluated by psychological autopsy and serotoninergic gene polymorphisms determination indicates the influence of genetic and environmental factors contributing to the suicidal behaviour of the individual person. Probably the interplay between genes and stressful events jut before suicide, together with mental disorder lead to suicide in the case described.","2478":"Information technology has the potential to improve and support the treatment of depression. Use of clinical guidelines can improve outcome of treatment, but implementation of guidelines is a demanding process and the resulting user compliance is often poor. Electronic health records, clinical decision support systems and other information technology tools seem at first glance to be a preferable way to implement clinical guidelines since they require user's active and problem oriented participation. This article reviews attempts made so far at use of information tools for implementation of clinical guidelines for depression treatment and discusses their effects. It turns out that there are few existing solutions, ambiguous effects and that usage is often limited. In future the factors determining development of successful electronic tools for clinical guidelines implementation will need to be further specified. Further research projects are underway in Slovenia to investigate these issues.","2479":"The Psychiatric emergency clinic (PEC) was established at University Psychiatric Hospital Ljubljana in 2004. 2760 patients were examined in the PEC until the end of May 2004. We have gathered data from medical documentation about the patient's age, suicidal behaviour, pharmacotherapy and psychoactive substances misuse. We compared patients with substance misuse and patients without substance misuse regarding suicidal behaviour and prescribed psychopharmacotherapy. There was a significant difference in suicidal behaviour between the group of those, who abused PAS (n=497) and those who did not (35.4% vs. 28.0%, N = 1753, Pearson Chi-Square Test, p&lt;0.001). More patients who abused PAS attempted suicide (9.5% vs. 3.5%, N = 2760, Fisher's Exact Test, p &lt; 0.001). However, we have not observed a difference between the groups regarding suicidal threats and thoughts (17.2% vs. 18.0%, N = 2592, Fisher's exact test, p = NS). The subgroup of patients with PAS abuse have been prescribed pharmacotherapy more often than others (19.4% vs. 11.4%, N = 2592, Fisher's Exact Test, p &lt; 0.001).

Executive dysfunction, including disturbances in planning, sequencing, organizing and abstracting has been reported in late-onset depression. They were found to be associated with relapse and recurrence of geriatric major depression and with residual depressive symptoms. A group of patients with late-onset depression, compared with age matched healthy volunteers, were assessed for deficits in executive functioning. We used the computer version of Stroop Color-Word test enabling more detailed reaction time analysis. Severity of depression was evaluated with Hamilton depression rating scale and Geriatric depression scale. The preliminary results of a study show that patients with late-onset depression have increased absolute reaction times in Stroop colour-word test. Significant differences in the magnitude of individual interference effects pointing towards a characteristic change in attentional processes in depressed patients. The preliminary results of a study comparing a group of elderly depressed patients with a control group of older healthy volunteers confirm changes in executive functions.

In observational study we investigated the influence of the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms on the frequency of patients' questions about mental disorder and their tendency to misinterpret the signs and symptoms of depression as side effects of medication. In 60 public health centers across Slovenia a total of 422 patients with depression treated with paroxetine were included. After one week of treatment one quarter of patients reported adverse effects and 15% of these patients misinterpreted signs of depression and anxiety for adverse effects. These patients tend to be more anxious and more depressed at the beginning of treatment. Half of them could not accept the explanation of their misinterpretation. A total of 55% patients had additional questions about illness at the second visit and these patients were also more anxious and more depressed at the beginning of treatment.","2482":"In the literature evidence of two claims that have been made about the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants. Ithas been reported that there is: (i) a decreased suicide rate in the population; and (ii) an increased suicide rate in some individuals early in treatment with SSRIs. The aim of this observational study of suicidal behaviour in patients prescribed SSRIs and other antidepressants was to investigate at arrival in Psychiatric Emergency Clinic (PEC) at the University Psychiatric Hospital Ljubljana the differences in expressed suicidal behaviour regarding prescribed antidepressant medications. From the medical documentation of Psychiatric Emergency Clinic (PEC) at University Psychiatric Hospital Ljubljana all admissions in the year 2004 were extracted (N=1437). The first subgroup had prescribed SSRIs and the second subgroup had prescribed other antidepressants before arrival in PEC. During this period 338 patients were examined in PEC who had already been prescribed antidepressants. Among patients with prescribed antidepressants 273 of them had been prescribed SSRIs and 65 had been prescribed other antidepressants. Suicidal behaviour (suicidal ideations, threats and attempts) was observed in 30% of patients with prescribed SSRIs and in 38% of the patients who had been prescribed other antidepressants. However, the difference was not statistically significant (p&gt;0.05).

Data were compared between two groups of patients according to diagnosis; the first group encompassed anxiety disorders, stress related disorders and somatoform disorders (F 40-F 48) and the second group gathered all other psychiatric diagnoses (others). One third (36%) of patients examined in PEOC suffered for anxiety disorders, stress related disorders and somatoform disorders. The most common diagnoses within this group were stress related disorders (F 43: 41.7%). Gender ratio was in favour of women in both groups. Significantly more women suffered for anxiety, stress-related and somatoform disorders (63.4% vs. 56.9%, p&lt;0.005). Patients with anxiety, stress-related and somatoform disorders were significantly younger compared with others (40.4 years vs. 45.2 years, p&lt;0.001), and they were significantly less urgent cases compared with others (46.7% vs. 65.3.3%, p&lt;0.001). Anxiety disorders, stress related disorders and somatoform disorders are common in PEOC. The higher percentage of women among these patients is in accordance with data from the literature; lower age might be a consequence of earlier onset of the above mentioned disorders. ","2484":"The number of patients with dementia in Slovenia will increase 33% in the next ten years. Unfortunately, networks offering different activities for demented patients are still insufficiently developed, although in the last ten years a significant improvement has been observed in all areas of care (diagnosis, treatment, day care centres, nursing homes, and non-governmental organizations). The article provides a short overview of developing care for persons with dementia in Slovenia.","2485":"It has been estimated that domestic violence is wide spread in Slovenia, but the lack of empirical data of domestic violence prevalence and its consequences, aggravate the precise knowledge on the extension of the phenomenon. The aim of the study was to assess the extensiveness and characteristics of domestic violence in the group of Slovenian adolescents. 1297 young adolescents (age 13-15 years) from 65 Slovenian primary schools participated in the study. A questionnaire for domestic violence experience and help seeking screening, McMaster Family Functioning Scale, Buss\/Perry Aggression Questionnaire and Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC) have been applied. 18.7% of participants experienced violence in their own family (38.3% males and 61.7% females). Different patterns of verbal violence, irritability and indirect violence predominated. In the most cases of domestic violence the adolescent's parents were involved as perpetrators and their close relatives (brothers, sisters). Victims displayed a significant profile that could be linked with their violence experience: dysfunctional family environmental, aggressiveness, anxiety, depression, anger and posttraumatic stress symptoms. Presented study confirmed that the phenomenon of domestic violence and abused adolescents is quite widespread in Slovenia and that in the future more attention on research and policy making level should be given to this phenomenon. Particularly the perceived gap between attitudes towards support and the actually given help could be the orientation for developing a better prevention strategies and screening procedures for domestic violence. A proper intervention and protection of the adolescent victims could effectively prevent the outburst of depression, suicide, behavioural problems and, spreading the aggressive behaviour patterns to the future generations. ","2486":"There are many evidences of co-morbidity influence on alcohol dependency treatment outcome. We were interested in the question 'Do alcohol dependent patients with different co-occurring mental and medical conditions significantly differ in subjective attributes of well-being and in abstinence rate two years after the end of intensive alcohol dependency treatment'. 222 ex - patients participated in the research 24 months after the end of intensive alcohol dependency treatment, 74% of them males (mean age = 46.17, SD = 8.79) and 26% females (mean age = 46.35, SD = 8.10). No significant differences were found in any dependent variable regarding any independent variable in \"presence of any somatic diagnose\" (yes\/no) and \"personality disorders\". \"Depressive vs. non depressive\" differed significantly only in the evaluation of important interpersonal relations, while \"anxious vs. non - anxious\" and \"benzodiazepine dependent vs. nondependent\" significantly differed in all self - evaluations, except in evaluation of important interpersonal relations. No significant differences were found between (non)abstinents regarding any of six categories of mental disorder and medical conditions (yes\/no) and no significant differences were found in any self - evaluation regarding the participation in different kinds of after-care. A greater number of patients continued to abstain from alcohol if they continued in aftercare 24 months after the end of intensive treatment. Patients with different somatic and mental co-occurring disorders did not differ in abstinence rate. However, membership in after-care 24 months after the end of intensive therapy significantly contributed to the abstinence rate. Abstinence was found to be connected with more positive self-evaluation. Patients with somatic co-occurring diagnoses tended to have more positive self-perceptions than patients with co-occurring mental disorders. ","2487":"The purpose of the present study was to determine which aspects of motivational, cognitive and emotional functioning were impaired in a group of alcoholics after 8 weeks of abstinence. We also examined the clinical applicability of the BIS\/BAS Scales (Carver &amp; White 1994) used in order to identify a potential association between behavioural inhibition \/ activation tendencies and emotional and cognitive deficits in alcohol abstainers. 33 right- handed middle- aged (mean age 45.0 years) male alcohol inpatients in treatment and 36 healthy volunteers without a previous drinking history, matched for age, education and handedness participated in the study. Both groups were assessed with the composite of tests in the following domains: motivation, attention, emotional processing, visuospatial functioning and working memory. Alcohol abstainers revealed heightened BAS sensitivity, more pronounced depressive symptoms and attentional deficits compared to controls, while working memory and visuospatial abilities did not significantly differ between the groups. Elevated BAS sensitivity correlated with the length of abstinence, whereas BIS sensitivity associated with the presence of suicidal history and with selective attention difficulties. Our research confirmed several previous studies that some cognitive and visuospatial deficits could improve during alcohol abstinence, while motivational tendencies, attentional and emotional functioning take longer to recover. Application of the BIS\/BAS Scales proved a useful instrument for assessment of the alcohol abstainers' rehabilitation process. In this regard, when planning treatment programmes for alcoholics, approach and withdrawal motivational tendencies, neuropsychological dysfunctions and psychiatric comorbidity should be considered. ","2488":"A long duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) is associated with a poorer prognosis and with worse functional outcome. The aim of the study was to show that early treatment with antipsychotics in the prodromal phase improves the outcome; to compare outcome in patients with DUP longer than 1 year (group 1) with patients who had received treatment with antipsychotic medication in the prodromal phase of the disease (group 0). 87 patients with schizophrenia were included in the retrospective study, 37 patients in group 0 and 50 patients in group 1. Sociodemographic parameters were evaluated, including employment, marital status and educational level. Groups were compared during the acute psychosis of first episode (t1) and at the conclusion of the study (t2). Vocational status was worse in group 1 with a higher degree of unemployment and disability than in group 0 (chi(2)=17.47, df=4, p=0.002) at t2. More than half of the patients in group 1 were on disability benefit as compared to 19% of patients in group 0. At t1 differences were not statistically significant (chi(2)=4.15, df=3, p=0.245). There were more single patients in group 1 during both evaluations. At t1 almost half of the patients in group 0 were married; in group 1 only 18% were married (chi(2)=11.47, df=3, p=0.003). Also at t2 more patients in group 0 were married than in group 1 (chi(2)=8.01, df=3, p=0.046). Significant differences between the groups in achieved educational level were noted only at t1 (chi(2)=9.65, df=3, p=0.022). Better outcome can be achieved with early antipsychotic treatment in the prodromal phase. ","2489":"The development of dementia in Alzheimer's disease is known to be influenced by various factors. The research was carried out on 16 patients with a probable diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), who were first evaluated with MMSE. The patients were then divided according to gender, age, and the progress of the illness into two equal groups. The first group of patients was assigned an additional cognitive therapy for improving cognitive abilities alongside regular treatment while the second group was assigned only regular treatment. After 6 months the patients were re-evaluated using MMSE. The results show a statistically significant difference in cognitive abilities between the two groups with regard to the pre-therapy results. The results of the research are consistent with the results of other researches which imply a slower decrease in cognitive abilities in AD patients who are mentally active.","2490":"Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme catalysing rapid hydrolysis of acetylcholine is the major enzyme in the metabolism of this neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and in the skeletal and smooth muscles. Donepezil is a reversible, primarily non-competitive, selective inhibitor of AChE used in patients with Alzheimer's disease for the improvement of cognitive deficits. We hypothesized that prolonged treatment with donepezil could increase AChE mRNA levels and AChE activity in the central nervous system. The levels of AChE mRNA and AChE activity in the brain sections of 6 animals treated for 28 days with donepezil (2 mg\/kg s.c.) were visualized by an autoradiographic method of in situ hybridization and by Koelle histochemical staining, respectively, and compared with 6 control animals treated with physiologic saline. The images of autoradiograms and of AChE-stained brain sections were densitometrically analysed with a computerized imaging analysis system. We observed that 28-day treatment with donepezil in comparison to control treatment increased hippocampal AChE mRNA levels and AChE activity. Our data suggest that AChE up-regulation induced by prolonged treatment with AChE inhibitors may be the rationale for up-titration of AChE inhibitors during the treatment of AD. Further preclinical and clinical data are needed to evaluate the relative impact of the up-regulation of AChE activity on the outcome of prolonged treatment of AD patients with donepezil. ","2491":"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a slowly, progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is the most common cause of dementia in elderly people. On the other hand, cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and increased levels of cholesterol are related to a high risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. It seems that both groups of dementias are not sharply separated and involvement of cholesterol in the pathogenesis of both types of dementia is suggested. Increasing number of reports indicate that there is a connection between serum cholesterol level and risk of AD and preclinical studies indicate involvement of cholesterol in amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) production. On the other hand, the clinical role of statins in prevention or treatment of AD is not yet established. The influence of statins on AD could be indirect through decreasing serum cholesterol levels and the incidence of CVD or direct by influencing cellular mechanisms in the brain involved in Abeta production and apoptosis.","2492":"The aim of our study was to evaluate the expressed anxiety and depression of female cancer patients regarding the site of the cancer. We test the hypothesis that female patients with breast cancer have higher expressed depression and anxiety in comparison to other female cancer patients. 202 consecutive female cancer patients who were treated at the out-patient department were clinically examined. The first group, which consisted of 149 female breast cancer patients, was compared with a group of 53 female patients with other cancers. More breast cancer patients suffered from clinically observed anxiety (85%) then patients with other cancers (73%) (p&lt;0.05). The difference between patients with breast cancer (70%) and other patients (69%) was not observed for depression (p&gt;0.05). Despite many limitations in the study, this data indicates that female patients with different cancers may also express different levels of anxiety. ","2493":"The aim of the study was to estimate the characteristics of the informing process about sexuality and to find out factors encouraging or inhibiting early adolescents in their decision to have first sexual intercourse. An anonymous questionnaire was administered to 1217 pupils, aged from 14 to 15 years. The Chi-Square Test and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) showed a statistically significant gender difference. In order to evaluate the linear effect of the independent variables on the dependent variable we used Multiple Regression and Correlation according to Ajzen's model of planned behaviour. The results of study show, that the majority of the respondents got their first sexual information from their parents and at school, rather late. The main informants were media and peers. Mothers were the most wanted sexual informants. In forming a behavioural intention to have first sexual intercourse, respondents showed significantly weak control in a situation of attraction to the partner and strong control if contraception was not provided for. Boys statistically significantly more than girls expressed the possibility to have sexual intercourse and they get less information about sexuality, especially at home. The data on the information about sexuality in Slovenian adolescent were obtained. We were unable to confirm Ajzen's theory of planned behaviour in our case. The findings will be used for developing guidelines for sexual education in the Slovenian youth. ","2494":"The present study describes the translation process of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) into the Slovenian language and the testing of its reliability and validity on the psychological morbidity in female cancer patients. The English version of the HADS was translated into the Slovene language using the 'forward-backward' procedure. The questionnaire was used in a study of 202 female cancer patients together with a clinical structured interview (CSI) to measure psychological state. A biserial correlation coefficient was calculated. The value of biserial correlation coefficient was 0.81 for the depression scale and 0.91 for the anxiety scale. The validation process of the Slovenian HADS score version shows metric properties similar to those in international studies, suggesting that it measures the same constructs, in the same way, as the original HADS score form. This validation study of the Slovenian version of the HADS proved that it is an acceptable and valid measure of psychological distress among female cancer patients. ","2495":"Mental health promotion and mental disorder prevention can reduce the risk for mental and behavioural disorders and decreased social welfare and health costs. The aim of the present study was to map and analyse prevention and promotion activities and programmes in the mental health area in Slovenia. The selection of services for a study was performed using the database of the Agency of the Republic of Slovenia for Public Legal Records and Related Services, internet and other accessible sources The Slovenian translation of ESMS was used for mapping the services in the mental health area. The initial sample from above mentioned sources contained 84 services working in the mental health area in 12 Slovenian statistical regions. At present 516 services were contacted and 172 did not comply with inclusion criteria. The 162 services from all 12 Slovenian statistical geographical regions have been mapped and their activities and characteristics analysed. The analysis of the approaches to mental disorder prevention revealed that the most frequent approaches were selective primary prevention in 27.9% and tertiary prevention in 28.2% of cases.

This paper therefore discusses the specific theoretical and practical findings regarding management of service provider organizations from the viewpoint of their social mission and significance, as well as their legal organization, internal structure and values.","2497":"This research studied the characteristics of self representations and ego identity in adult psychiatric patients with different mental disorders according to DSM-IV (APA, 1994) and Kernberg's structural criteria for personality organizations (1986). We constructed Identity Diffusion Questionnaire (IDQ), a self-report measure based on Kernberg's criteria for identity diffusion (1986), and Actual Self - Ideal Self - Significant Other Scales (AISS), a measure for discrepancies between perceived actual self, ideal self and significant other. Both measurements reached sufficiently internal consistency and construct validity. The sample of 186 adult psychiatric in- and outpatients and 109 controls of both sexes served as subjects in the study. All groups of patients reached higher scores on IDQ and AISS compared to healthy controls. Patients revealed more identity problems than normals and they also had bigger discrepancy between actual and ideal self than healthy participants. These results support psychodynamic and cognitive theories and empirical studies that disturbances in self representations and ego identity are related to many different mental disorders. Results also confirmed the claim that identity disturbances are related to big discrepancies in representation of real and ideal self. The hypothesis that severity of identity diffusion is in a positive correlation with severity of pathology was not confirmed. There may be some uncontrolled factors which influenced the results. Despite some theoretical and methodological limitations the present study confirms the relation between disturbances of ego identity and different psychopathology.

Various factors have been considered as risk factors (predisposing factors) for delusional disorders. Positive family history of psychiatric disorders particularly delusional disorders, is the most important risk factor. In this report, we present a 40-year old man with somatic delusions following intoxication with Phenobarbital and left brachial plexus injury (C6, C7, C8) in stupor state. Two weeks after discharge from the hospital, he developed a significant somatic delusion about his left upper extremity. To our knowledge, somatic delusions secondary to peripheral neuropathy has not been reported up to now therefore this case illustrates a very rare organic delusional disorder.","2505":"The interrelation between chronic stress and multiple sclerosis (MS) has always been known, but the biological foundation for this phenomenon has not yet been proven. Our case-study of 5 patients, both diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and PTSD, attempts to demonstrate various dimensions of interrelation between these two diseases. We have also tried to point out the problems and possible complications doctors might encounter during the treatment of an MS patient who is suffering from chronic stress. Our findings show the need for a multidisciplinary approach in the treatment of patients with chronic PTSD and co morbid multiple sclerosis, which will optimize treatment and result in more cost-effective care. Appropriate identification and optimal pharmacological interventions for both disorders might modify further chronicity of these disorders and thus achieve better outcome.","2506":"To correlate habits (abuse of tobacco, alcohol, psychoactive substances and drugs) of war veterans and the frequency of symptoms in persons with PTSD and those without it. We have carried out a prospective research (case-control study) over the period between September of 2005 and June 2006. The sample consisted of two groups of examinees: 60 males, war veterans with PTSD and 60 males, war veterans without PTSD. The group of war veterans without PTSD was formed using matching criteria (same age, level of education). Both groups included married males. Research was performed using a questionnaire designed for this study. A higher number of war veterans without PTSD were employed compared to war veterans with PTSD (chi2=45.753; df=4; p&lt;0.050). A higher number of war veterans with PTSD used psychoactive substances during the war period compared to war veterans without PTSD (18.3% vs. 3.3%). We have observed that 85% of examinees with PTSD have used anxiolitic drugs in the period of research, compared to only 5% of those without PTSD (chi2=77.576; df=1; P&lt;0.050). All examinees with PTSD had some form of sleep disorders comparing to 70% of those without PTSD (chi2=50.595; df=3; P&lt;0.050). Analysis of alcohol abuse showed a statisticaly significant difference between the examined groups (chi2=9.654; df=2; P=0.008). A higher number of war veterans without PTSD had employment in comparison to the group of war veterans with PTSD. A higher number of war veterans with PTSD had some form of sleeping disorder, used psychoactive substances and anxiolitic drugs during the war period, and had alcohol abuse in comparison to the group of war veterans without PTSD.

To estimate the aggregate level effect of alcohol consumption on homicide rate in the former Soviet Slavic republic of Belarus. Trends in homicide and alcoholic psychoses morbidity rate from 1970 to 2005 in Belarus were analyzed employing ARIMA analysis in order to assess the bivariate relationship between the two time series. The results of time series analysis suggest a close relationship between homicide and alcoholic psychoses rate at zero lag. This study replicates the previous findings that suggested a close link between alcohol and homicide at the aggregate level. The outcome of the present findings suggests that alcohol is responsible for the fluctuation in homicide rate over time in the former Soviet republic of Belarus. This study also supports the hypothesis that homicide and alcohol are closely connected in the prevailing culture with its intoxication-oriented drinking pattern.

In order to emphasize the importance of the therapist-patient relationship in the treatment of chronic schizophrenic patients (Ivezic 2001) and creating the group atmosphere a Croatian model of case management is created where the patient's needs and risks are assessed by a multidisciplinary team which also conducts the recommended psychosocial interventions plan. The majority of interventions are conducted in groups. The case manager develops a confident relationship with a patient, nourishes the positive transference and aids the delivery of the treatment. The main goals of the interventions are empowerment of the patient, improvement of his abilities and decreasing of disabilities. The case manager also carries out a full assessment of the needs of the patient's family so that the family or carers are also included in the treatment or support if necessary (Gruber 2006). A case report of a patient and the work of her case manager as well as the case manager's diary (Gruber 2007) and the Croatian model of case management is presented in this article.","2509":"From 1991-1995, the war in Croatia cost tens of thousands of lives (approximately 11834 persons killed between 1991-1994), and human rights abuses led to significant numbers of disappeared persons (3052). A total of 2395 families were searching for one disappeared person and 168 families of disappeared were searching for more than one person. 2035 men were reported disappeared and 528 women. However, while the majority or 60% (1226) of the men were between the ages of 18-49, 83% (438) of the women were between the ages of 50-96. Though the majority of missing persons of both genders were civilians, the disappeared women were more likely to be civilians (99%) than the disappeared men (52%), though only 23% of the men were regular army military personnel. The majority (55%) of men were previously engaged in paid employment, while 81% of women were farm or housewives, or pensioners. Most men (53%) were reported by informants to have disappeared outside of their home, while the majority (75%) of women disappeared from their home. Among those searching for the disappeared, 27% of those searching for men believed the person was alive or might still be alive, in contrast, only 18% of those searching for women believed them still alive. An important gender difference occurred in the pattern of disappearance in Croatia; most disappeared men were of combatant age, employed, and similar to the general population in key demographic characteristics, while most disappeared women were rural, less educated, and elderly.","2510":"To compare patient's attitudes, demographic, clinical characteristics, psychopathology, insight and type of antipsychotic therapy in compliant and non-compliant outpatients with schizophrenia; to explore correlations between patient's attitudes and related variables. A sample of 44 outpatients of both genders (&gt; 60 years), with a diagnosis of ICD-10 Schizophrenia (F20) was included into the study. All the patients were on maintenance treatment with different classes of antipsychotics (oral, depot or both), for at least 6 months from the latest hospitalisation. The exclusion criteria were determined. The BPRS and the PANSS were used to assess psychopathology and insight (G12 item). The self-report questionnaire MARS was used to assess patient's attitudes. Compliant patients (N=37) showed the following significant differences compared to non-compliant patients (N=7): higher the MARS (p&lt;0.001), lower the PANSS (Positive sub score) (p&lt;0.01) G12 scores (p&lt;0.01) (the Student t test) and percentage of patients with previous non-compliance (p&lt;0.05) (chi2 test). Considerable correlation between the MARS and the BPRS (p&lt;0.001), the PANSS (Positive, General psychopathology) (p&lt;0.001; p&lt;0.01), G12 scores (p&lt;0.05) (negative) and current compliance (p&lt;0.001) was also found (The Spearman's correlation).

","2511":"Weight gain is a risk factor for hypertension, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, respiratory illnesses, various forms of cancer, and the metabolic syndrome. Obesity is common among psychiatric patients in general and among schizophrenia patients in particular. Antipsychotic treatment may contribute to obesity by increasing appetite. Weight gain may also be related to apathy regarding body enhancement, reduction of interest, and need for oral gratifications associated with psychiatric disorders. We examined weight gain among inpatients who received anti-psychotic drug therapy for one year or longer and compared weight gain in patients treated with first and second generation antipsychotic therapy. The study group included 70 patients treated with second-generation antipsychotic agents for one year or longer (risperidone N=40; olanzapine N=30). The control group included 30 patients who were treated with first generation antipsychotics. We compared weight prior to initiation of antipsychotic treatment and one year later, and demographic and medical data as recorded in the patients' medical files. Following one year of treatment 55% of the patients increased their weight, 2% remained at the same weight and 43% had lost weight. Our study showed that there are differences in the direction of weight changes among the patients: while most of the patients gain weight during treatment, some lose weight. Consequently there is no alternative to personal follow up for each individual patient and personal treatment plans for medication, diet and physical exercise. ","2512":"Previous studies showed that sensitization could be important in cardiovascular disease subjects. The main aim of our study was to investigate further the relationship between sensitization of emotion on one side, and main risk factors for ischemic heart disease (IHD) and some psychological variables on the other. A total of 374 patients with (187) or without (187) ischemic heart disease took part in our study. Owing to the lower percentage of women with IHD only men were included in the study. Patients were divided into three groups: repressors (those who report low subjective disturbance but react relatively strongly objectively; psychometrically, they have a high defensiveness score - L-EPQ and low trait anxiety score - EPQ-N), sensitizers (they have the opposite results: high N and low L score) and all the remaining subjects (the remaining two combinations of the N and L scores). Altogether, 12 exploratory variables (presence of IHD and main IHD risk factors; personality traits and coping styles) were explored in relation to sensitization of emotion. As predicted, sensitization of emotion was significantly more frequent in the group of patients with IHD (chi2=23.2; df=2; p&lt;0.0001). We also showed some additional correlates of sensitization trait that could explain the association between this trait and IHD more in detail. In the group of IHD patients, the highest scores of psychoticism (F=12.14; df=2; p&lt;0.001) and emotional coping styles (F=19.36; df=2; p&lt;0.001) were shown in sensitizers, and the highest scores of detached emotional coping styles in the middle group of patients (F=7.58; df=2; p=0.001). Also, sensitizers were the youngest group (F=8.28; df=2; p&lt;0.001) and had the highest frequency of smoking history (chi2=6.73; df=2; p=0.035). Some of these associations were in the same direction also significant in the group free of IHD, namely for psychoticism (F=9.15; df=2; p&lt;0.001), emotional coping (F=11.07; df=2; p&lt;0.001) and age (F=5.83; df=2; p=0.004). Among some other characteristics, sensitization of emotion also relates to more emotional and less detached ways of coping with stress, and more smoking on the other, which in turn increases the overall behavioral risk of developing this chronic disease. ","2513":"Lay theories on abnormal behavior and mental disorders have been growing as a field recently. Lester and Bean have contributed to these endeavors by developing the Lester and Bean Attribution of Causes to Suicides Scale (1992), an instrument that gauges beliefs concerning the causes of suicidal behavior (intrapsychic, interpersonal, and societal causes). To provide test-retest reliability figures (two-month interval) and to further validate the scale. The instrument was administered to 155 Austrian psychology undergraduates. Test-retest reliabilities, scale intercorrelations, and correlations with locus of control, among others, were ascertained. Test-retest reliabilities amounted to r = 0.67 for intrapsychic, 0.53 for interpersonal, and 0.56 for societal causes, and to 0.59 for the total scale (all ps &lt; 0.001). All three subscales were, as previously observed, significantly positively intercorrelated. Belief in intrapsychic causes was weakly positively related to the internality dimension of the locus of control construct, beliefs in interpersonal and in societal causes were significantly positively associated with societal externality, and there was a significant positive correlation of the fatalistic externality dimension with all three subscales of the Lester-Bean Scale. In view of the moderate internal scale consistencies, the test-retest reliabilities can be seen as satisfying. The significant intercorrelations among attributed causes of suicide further support the hypothesis that the critical dimension of lay theories of suicide is the belief that suicide has definite causes, regardless of the type of cause. Directions for future research are discussed. ","2514":"Previous research has documented that disbelief in the genetics of suicide prevails. This study examined for the first time the malleability of such beliefs and their internal structure, using the Beliefs in the Inheritance of Risk Factors for Suicide Scale (BIRFSS). A sample of 38 Austrian first-year psychology students (27 women, 11 men), previously not exposed to the topic, studied a recent overview article on the genetics of suicide as a self-paced exercise. Exposure to the contents of the article was evaluated with a subjective self-report measure and with an objective quiz. Validity checks were suggestive for a successful implementation of the intervention. Compared with baseline data 4 months prior to the intervention, evaluation of the intervention showed that participants held significantly stronger beliefs (Cohen's d = 1.41) in the genetics of suicide which also were more coherent. Disbelief in the genetics of suicide is modifiable. Study limitations, directions for future research, and practical implications are discussed. ","2515":"Recent studies of Internet influence on behavioural disorders of its users, have created quite a polarised ambience. On the one hand, there are those who believe that the Internet is a new better medium for enabling various patterns of communication and social relations. On the other hand, others maintain that Internet use can lead to social isolation and other forms of psychological disorders, for an example depression. The aim of this work is a review of research attempts to confirm a connection between increased Internet use and psychological disorders, in the first place, depression. The number of studies on this subject is not very great thus far. This is mainly because depression and similar disorders are serious distorsions in basic psychological processes; this suggests how difficult it may be to work with such examinees, and how complex it may appear to distinguish etiological factors. These facts do not lessen the importance of the aim itself, i.e. defining potential consequences of excessive Internet use when it comes to psychological wellbeing, since the Internet is expected to become a basic form of social interaction in the near future, and consequently one of the major factors of socialisation and constitution of one's psychological identity. Due to that fact, the aim of this work is to indicate methodological and conceptual flaws of the studies which have attempted to make a connection between mood disorders and the Internet, so as to establish the base for future studies of the psychological consequences of Internet development.","2516":"","2517":"","2518":"The brain circuitry that mediates OCD appears to be different from that involved in anxiety, fear, stress and mood related disorders. It has become increasingly clear that the compulsive behaviors of OCD patients share more similarities with addictive than affective disorders. Recent advances in Deep Brain Stimulation techniques encourage a cautious optimism that ultimately new and effective treatment approaches will be found for this debilitating condition.","2519":"An audit of the diagnosis of 300 consecutive new cases presenting in a private practice over the period of the last four years (from January 2003 to December 2006) is presented. The main observation is the high percentage of patients who fall within the bipolar spectrum who are diagnosed and reported. In particular, there is a large proportion of patients who suffer from Bipolar II illness. The consequences of this in the diagnosis and management of patients is discussed.","2520":"Functional and structural neuroimaging help us to compare the brains of schizophrenic patients and controls, moreover they let us observe the changes with treatment. Longitudinal studies comparing patients with typical and atypical antipsychotics have been useful in understanding the effects of these antipsychotic medications on brain function. In general, atypical antipsychotics are suggested to have greater normalizing effects on brain function than typical, although the results are controversial. In particular, clozapine appears to act more selectively than typical antipsychotics on the prefrontal region, an area of special relevance in higher cognitive functions and schizophrenia. The study of anatomic and functional brain variables associated with clozapine response in schizophrenia may help to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from clozapine treatment. We investigated the effect of clozapine on regional cerebral blood flow and (1)H MRS findings and studied their relationship with treatment response. Clozapine increased frontal\/basal ganglia perfusion ratio in treatment-responders. In addition, NAA\/Cre ratio has increased and Cho\/Cre has decreased in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex after 8 weeks of clozapine treatment. The results of the study will be discussed in the light of current literature. These findings can contribute to better understanding of mechanism of action of clozapine.","2521":"Schizophrenia is a chronic progressive illness characterized with frequent relapses and requiring long-term treatment. In spite of the fact that this disorder belongs among ten leading causes of disability worldwide, the consequences and difficulties associated with schizophrenia are frequently underestimated. The course of the illness is further characterized by a high percentage of suicides and attempted suicides, decline in cognitive functions and frequent relapses. The results of numerous studies indicate that early treatment with antipsychotics leads to better long-term outcomes compared with control groups. In the process of deciding about treatment we must bear in mind the importance of individual approach to schizophrenic patients because there are significant differences in the type of disorder, symptoms, co-morbidity, course of disorder (first episode or chronic course), as well as the differences in treatment response and treatment adherence. When choosing an antipsychotic agent we should try to find the drug capable of addressing all aspects of the illness that is safe and well tolerated in long-term treatment; we should start the treatment as early as possible, reduce the psychotic symptoms and avoid negative effects on functioning, whilst avoiding adverse effects and establishing a trusting and productive therapeutic alliance with the patient. Existing evidence strongly suggests the use of adequate doses of antipsychotics as early as in prodromal psychosis. Evidence shows that schizophrenic patients remain longer in treatment with atypical antipsychotics particularly when they are applied as depot injections, because the efficacy of treatment is higher, drug concentration stable and long-lasting, there are fewer adverse effects, and the co-operation with the service provider is better. In this way, the atypical antipsychotics provide us with the opportunity to establish long-term control of the psychotic symptoms, and reduce relapse rate and the number of hospitalizations while improving the quality of life of schizophrenic patients and establishing optimal therapeutic alliance.","2522":"Clinical guidelines briefly identify, summarize and evaluate the best evidence and most current data about prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, therapy, risk\/benefit and cost-effectiveness. However, the final conclusion about them will be possible only after their use in everyday practice with full freedom of psychiatrists to make changes according their personal judgment about risk and benefit of treatment.","2523":"62 patients suffering from mood disorders or schizophrenia diagnosed retrospectively according to DSM-4 as 295.xx or 296.xx were followed up by the author personally for 20 years. The DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia (295.xx) was changed to a diagnosis of a mood disorder in 13 patients (26%). If schizoaffective disorder is classified as a mood disorder to form a group of periodic disorders, 41% of patients diagnosed as \"pure\" schizophrenia (295.xx without 295.70) at the start of the observation period were re-diagnosed as periodic disorder over 20 years. This \"retrogression\" of schizophrenia is seen as a result of the treatment with psychotropic drugs. The Kraepelian dichotomy is based on the relationship between the symptomatic pattern (syndrome) and the course of the illness. This relationship is disrupted by long-term treatment with psychotropic drugs.","2524":"Antipsychotics are currently registered for the use in psychosis, mania and agitation. They have although been in common practice used for a wide range of psychiatric disorders even in the era of first generation antipsychotics. Such a use is termed \"off-label\". There are several drawbacks in off-label antipsychotics' prescribing among them legislative in case of complications, poorly defined criteria for their use (dosages, possible complications, time span), missing guidelines and treatment algorithms as well as missing consensus among clinicians about indications and treatment protocol. We have reviewed existing literature on the topic using Medline search for controlled and naturalistic data about off-label use of antipsychotics. The results have been combined with our descriptive clinical experiences as well as the process of making national recommendations on off-label use of antipsychotics. The results have shown that the practice of off-label use is widely accepted in clinical work not just for antipsychotics but for other psychotropic drugs in psychiatry as well. The level of evidence is however different and will be discussed. Indications for the use of antipsychotics are evolving with new generations, which is consistent with their mechanisms of action and anticipated from drug profiles of different newer antipsychotics. New official indications do show the dynamic properties of the term \"off-label\" which tends to be more a cross-sectional descriptive term rather then scientific fact. According to the evidence and practice antipsychotics are becoming antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs, mood stabilizers, cognitive enhancers, anti-aggressive, anti-impulsive, anti-suicidal and hypnotic medications. We will propose a different way to classify the use of antipsychotics in indications different from those officially recognized.","2525":"Evidence based psychiatry and treatment guidelines have a significant role in raising the quality of mental health care and treatment, as well as in providing order where chaos reigns. The purpose of treatment guidelines and algorithms is to provide psychiatrists, health authorities, patients and their families with best evidence for making treatment decisions. However, adherence to some guidelines may do more harm than good if they are not flexible enough to take into account individual patient preferences and circumstances. The paradox at the heart of algorithms-based practice is that gold standard treatments are predicated on statistical generalizations about patients, mental disorders and treatments. In contrast, the effectiveness of a treatment is based on the art and practice of learning organization, the uniqueness of the patient, the doctor-patient relationship and the willingness of the patient to change her\/his mental model, life philosophy and the relationships in his family. Treatment guidelines are the lifelines of medical psychiatry and clinical psychopharmacology, without which psychiatry will never reach professional maturity and become fully accepted in medical circles.","2526":"A modern &amp; professional psychotherapy has existed since 1900. Yet it took a long time before it found a place in the psychiatric therapy concepts. Next in addition to psychopharmaceutical drugs, psycho- &amp; sociotherapeutic measures are integral elements of a general therapy standard. Some psychotherapeutic intervention technics, such as supportive psychotherapy, have been able to establish themselves in an inpatient psychiatric setting. It is important that the entire multiprofessional team members of an inpatient psychiatric unit take a psychotherapeutic stance, and work together to achieve the therapy goal. According to international experts, psychiatric-psychosomatic Consultation Liaison Service should be available in every general hospital. This Liaison principle also applies to psychotherapy in a psychiatric ward. Further, an exact definition of the therapy goals is necessary. A checklist, as an orientation tool, has always proved itself of assistance in psychiatric psychotherapy.","2527":"The functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) are the most frequent clinical conditions seen in practice. Up to 60% of these patients is also suffering from psychosocial problems. Therefore it is important to define the patient's complaints in terms of a biopsychosocial disorder, to acknowledge the relevance of the psychosocial aspects and to provide an integrated psychosomatic treatment or a psychotherapy if indicated. Most of the research on psychotherapy in FGID to date has focused on the irritable bowel syndrome and different methods of treatments were studied (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy, dynamic psychotherapy, hypnotherapy, and relaxation). Randomised controlled studies have shown that psychotherapy is superior to conventional medical therapy. Hypnotherapy is successful not only for irritable bowel syndrome but also for functional dyspepsia. Predictors of a positive response to psychological treatment generally are: (1) awareness that stress exacerbates their bowel symptoms, (2) at least mild anxiety or depression, (3) the predominant bowel symptom is abdominal pain or diarrhea and not constipation, (4) the abdominal pain waxes and wanes in response to eating, defecation, or stress rather than being constant pain, and 5) the symptoms are of relatively short duration. Benefits persist over years, and in the long run, clinic visits and health care costs can be reduced.","2528":"The impact of findings gained in psychoanalytic-psychotherapeutic research and outcome studies on the psychiatric routine-treatment is reported. The importance of the psychoanalytic theory of mentalization for the treatment of patients with personality disorders is shown in three naturalistic efficacy studies. Interpretation of the dominating effect and of the transference-relationship-dyad could be confirmed as essential for the treatment progress. The empirical studies point at the necessity of interpreting affect-regulatory parameters, such as the hostile-externalizing-dysphoric parameter, from the very beginning of the treatment on. Acknowledgement and recognition of externalizing and projective mechanisms should be trained in the psychiatric routine treatment in order to establish a stable working alliance with psychiatric patients.","2529":"Quality assurance is an important issue in psychotherapy research and practice, which is methodologically still in development. Apart from unstructured supervision, reliable assessment instruments are needed. A theoretical concept is outlined that allows to define the main techniques which constitute behavior therapy. An assessment instrument is introduced, which allows to measure whether a therapist applies these standards in therapy and to evaluate their quality. The development of the \"Behavior Therapy-Competence-Checklist (BTCC)\" is described. 182 tape-recorded therapy sessions of 14 behavioral therapists who were working full time in routine care were evaluated. The most often used behavior therapy techniques were preparation of homework assignments (71.4%) and modification of cognitions (41.6%). Most rare were macro-behavioral-analysis (19.5%) and problem solving (19.5%). The mean-total score of the BTCC was 3.4 on a scale that ranges from 1 (bad) to 7 (very good). The lowest scores were found for \"problem solving\" (2.7). The highest scores were found for \"establishment of a therapeutic relationship\" (5.2). Therapeutic competency can be operationalized and measured with the BTCC. The quality of behavior therapists under conditions of routine is moderate. They show the tendency to prefer certain therapeutic options and do not use the full spectrum of therapeutic options. Such findings point to areas in need of training. ","2530":"The paper presents legal and practical dilemmas concerning compulsory admission by means of a case report.","2531":"Next to feelings of hopelessness, certain cognitive features such as problem solving deficiency, attentional bias and reduced future positive thinking are involved in the development and maintenance of suicidal behavior. The aim of this study was to examine feelings of hopelessness and problem solving ability in depressed suicide attempters and depressed individuals without a suicide attempt and to see whether these features change over time. Three groups of participants, depressed suicide attempters (N=23), psychiatric control group (N=27) and healthy volunteers (N=27) completed measures of hopelessness and executive planning and problem solving abilities. The two clinical groups completed all measures shortly after admission and then again 7 weeks later whereas the non-clinical control group completed measures at baseline only. Both clinical groups displayed a higher level of hopelessness and poorer problem solving ability when compared to non-clinical volunteers. However, no differences were found between the two clinical groups. In neither of the clinical groups was improvement in problem solving ability between baseline and retesting observed despite the lowering of feelings of hopelessness. The diagnoses in the psychiatric controls group were only obtained by the psychiatrist and not checked by further documentation or questionnaires. Furthermore we did not control for personality traits which might influence cognitive functioning. Since feelings of hopelessness decreased over time and problem solving ability nevertheless remained stable it is important that treatment not only focuses on mood improvement of depressed suicidal and depressed non-suicidal individuals but also on teaching problem solving techniques. ","2532":"This prospective observational study examined the outcomes associated with the treatment of bipolar mania in clinical practice settings in a diverse range of countries: Bosnia, Slovenia, Slovakia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Particular emphasis was placed on investigating outcomes associated with treatment regimens including and excluding the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine. In- and outpatients initiating or changing oral medication for the treatment of bipolar mania were grouped into two treatment cohorts: (1) olanzapine (N=569), and (2) non-olanzapine (N=325). Clinical outcome measures included change in Clinical Global Impressions-Bipolar Version Severity of Illness scale (CGI-BP), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and Hamilton Depression Rating scale- 5 item (HAMD-5) scores, and response and remission rates. Outcomes were analysed by conventional linear or logistic regression, adjusted for potential confounders, using last observation carried forward (LOCF) at endpoint, and a marginal structural model (MSM) approach to account for treatment switching. Results from the 12-week acute phase are presented. Clinical improvements were observed in both cohorts. While no marked differences were apparent between the groups in adjusted mean baseline to LOCF endpoint change, longitudinal analysis of these variables using MSM averaged over all visits indicated greater improvements in the olanzapine versus non-olanzapine cohort in CGI-BP Overall (-0.26, p&lt;0.001), CGI-BP Mania (-0.19, p&lt;0.001), CGI-BP Depression (-0.10, p=0.003), CGI Psychosis (-0.14, p=0.001), YMRS (-1.70, p&lt;0.001), and HAMD-5 (-0.40, p&lt;0.001) scores. Inclusion of olanzapine after initiating or switching treatment for bipolar mania appeared to be beneficial during treatment in terms of symptom improvement. ","2533":"The importance of cholesterol for physical and psychological well-being has been recognized for several decades. Changes in serum cholesterol levels may have a direct impact on mental performance, behavior, treatment response, survival and expected lifetime duration. To examine the association between various mental disorders (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental disorders) and cholesterol levels, and to discuss the possible treatment implications. A MEDLINE search, citing articles from 1966 onward, supplemented by a review of bibliographies, was conducted to identify relevant studies. Criteria used to identify studies included (1) English language, (2) published studies with original data in peer-reviewed journals. Clinical investigations of cholesterolemia in patients with major mental disorders have produced very conflicting results. Hypercholesterolemia has been reported in patients with schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorders, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, PTSD. Low cholesterol level has been reported in patients with major depression, dissociative disorder, antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder. It seems that both high and low serum total cholesterol may be associated with a higher risk of the premature death. Our current knowledge on the relation between cholesterolemia and mental disorders is poor and controversial. No definite or reliable insight into a pathophysiological link between cholesterol levels and mental disorders, treatment response and mortality rate is available. The lipoprotein profile, rather than total cholesterol levels, seems to be important. ","2534":"","2535":"During five thousand years of recorded history, we know that from the ancient times people have used different methods and procedures in treatment of different psychiatric disorders and very often these were medicinal preparations of plants. Numerous scientific discoveries and industrial age gave a big contribution to medicine development and significantly improved quality of life for psychiatric patients during the last century. However, evidence-based medicine after big bliss faced a lot of disappointments, and an attitude that some natural drugs were unnecessarily thrown out of use step by step came along. On the other hand, there are a huge number of patients that use natural medicinal plants in self-treatment of different psychiatric disorders. The aim of this article is not giving advantage to natural medicines over chemicals, nor to support self-treatment. The aim is to encourage thinking about the meaning of natural medicines in the treatment of mental disorders and an attempt of preventing to push them out totally into silence wherever it is justified and based on facts.","2536":"Regulatory agencies of different European countries and the United States have been critically examining the possible link between suicidality and antidepressant use in children and adults, which has resulted in an FDA directive to the manufacturers of all antidepressant medications to add a 'black box' warning. 'Black box' warning describes the increased risk of suicidality in persons who take antidepressants. Because the news media's coverage of the antidepressant-suicide controversy has increased dramatically in the last few years, serious concerns need to be performed. In this review, the possible risk-benefit ratio has been estimated according to the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) antidepressants due to relevant psychobiological, clinical and epidemiologic data.","2537":"Non-invasive neuroradiological methods like magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), blood oxgenation level dependent (BOLD) imaging recently entered into the areas of research in psychiatry, psychoactive drug development, as well as in clinical practice. fMRI can identify the regions of the brain associated with various functions, can monitor recovery, progression, and response to treatment and MRS can be used to study brain chemistry and metabolism. BOLD-imaging provides an indirect indication of neuronal activity. Future developments of different neuroimaging techniques are promising not only in surgical planning, functional assessment in brain tumor management, monitoring functional changes, but also in discovery of pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders and recognition of new pharmacological targets. Those techniques could be implemented in the process of drug discovery and identification of biomarkers which are clinically relevant for development of candidate drugs. Furthermore, those techniques establish the bridge between preclinical and clinical studies and allow the drug research in human in vivo.","2538":"There is no unique scientific agreement about genetic variations that could beyond any doubt predict phenotype of the response to pharmacotherapy. The knowledge about the predictors for therapy and serious adverse effects could be very useful in clinical practice. It is obvious that the combination of variation in metabolizing enzymes, transporter proteins and drug targets fully explains heterogeneity in response to psychiatric treatment. We assume that genetic polymorphisms of serotoninergic transporter and MDR1 could be important in prediction of therapeutic response in patients with major depression treated with paroxetine. Our results show that SERTPR-LL genotype might predispose significantly better paroxetine treatment response compared to SS genotype in MDD patients and that variants G2677T and C3435T are not associated with therapeutic response to paroxetine in patients with major depressive disorder.","2539":"Genetic factors are extensively studied in respect to drug response in psychiatric disorders. Recent evidence suggests that action of reproductive steroid hormones in brain may also have a role. Sex-specific differences in terms of illness onset, duration, severity of symptoms and treatment response are well documented. It is believed they result from different brain morphology and function between sexes, factors being highly influenced by sex hormones. The synergistic effects of the genetic background and potential prenatal stressors may influence the processes of sexual brain maturation, the most vulnerable period for developing susceptibility for psychiatric disorders. A resulting neuroendocrine dysfunction implies inadequate response of brain structures to pubertal flow of circulating sex hormones. Steroid sex hormones, at least estrogen, are major parts of the communication system in the brain. For that reason, estrogen receptors could be attractive targets in development of new treatment strategies. Potential benefits from compounds mimicking estrogen should be also considered in clinical practice. ","2540":"Although the connection between spiritual and physical has been acknowledged since the oldest of human civilizations and emphasized in almost all of religions, It has taken a lot of time for that connection to gradually recover its lost meaning. As it is evident that many diseases and illnesses can not be explained purely by physical causes nor treated with purely physical methods there is a growing interest in spirituality and its usability in the treatment of various diseases and states, as well as in everyday life. Despite the fact that a sense of positive, nourishing and healing power of faith is deeply rooted in every religion, objective and empirical research of that connection has been avoided for centuries, and those studies which were conducted are only rudimentary, on the outskirts of empirical science. Scientific literature regarding spirituality and mental health points to a conclusion that spirituality and faith are positively correlated with positive therapeutic outcome and the possible explanation for that can be found in the fact that spirituality and religiosity can satisfy some of the basic needs of psychiatric patients. Efficacy of psychiatric treatment improved with the introduction of psychotropic medicaments and psychotherapeutic techniques, but the outcome is still not satisfying because relapse, recidivation and discontinuation of therapy occur very often. On the other hand, spirituality and religiosity play a very significant role in the healing process because they provide people with strength and will to fight their problems and disease itself. Psychopharmaceuticals are evidently irreplaceable in the therapy of mental disorders, but they are only one of the segments of the overall therapy. In order to adequately answer to the spiritual and religious needs of their patients, psychiatrists, psychologists and related health care professionals are faced with the need for expanding scientific concepts which served as the basis for development of many psychiatric methods and techniques.","2541":"When second generation antipsychotics were introduced in the mid 1990-s they offered the possibility of early psychopharmacological interventions in the treatment of schizophrenia. The idea applying antipsychotics in the prodromal phase of schizophrenia today is an realistic option. However ethical dilemmas about offering antipsychotics to the adolescents with at risk mental states, of whom only a few are real prodromes of schizophrenia remain for clinicians. In the literature about the ethics of the early interventions in psychiatry there are still many ethical questions which call for caution because of the low predictive value of at risk mental states, of which only 40% turn out to be a real prodrome of schizophrenia. These ethical questions can be addressed in three categories: - how to best identify who should receive early pharmacological intervention? - what this intervention should consist of? - how to evaluate treatment efficacy in the absence of illness base rates in the adolescents with a real prodrome of schizophrenia? Besides, arguing against the concept of early psychopharmacological interventions in the adolescent population are the fact of the unknown effect of antipsychotics on the developing brain as well as negative effects of stigma on those adolescents who receive them. The authors in the article analyse these ethical questions and take the side of those clinicians who think that caution and careful ethical judgment are needed before the prescribing of antipsychotics to adolescents with at risk mental states.","2542":"The \"mind-body\" dualism has shaped the development of psychiatry. At the very beginning psychiatry was related to the mind and the rest of the medicine to the body. The main reasons for such division were lack of biological evidence for psychiatric disorders and wrong beliefs about demonic origins of \"lunacy\". But although the development of science offered more than enough biological evidence to understand brain as an organ of origin for psychiatric disorders, the dualism of mind and body remained alive even in the modern classification systems. One of the consequences was another dualism that differ biological (e.g. pharmacotherapy) from psychological therapy (e.g. psychotherapy) as completely different approaches. The purpose of this article is to offer enough evidence to reframe the existing dualisms into a different paradigm. In every illness both mind and body can be affected to a different extent. Which part of an illness is body and which part is mind is often difficult to differentiate even when we compare a person with broken leg with a person with acute stress reaction. For that reason it might be an over-simplification to differentiate sharply between biological and psychological therapies. The evidence show that psychotherapy influences biology of the brain and that pharmacotherapy influences psychological, social and developmental dimensions of the diseased person as well as overall well-being and functionality. In the era where medicine discovered psychology and psychiatry discovered biology, the debates and divisions that steam out of past dualisms should end. Every practising physician regardless of the medical discipline uses in everyday practice both biological and psychological approaches to help the patient successfully.","2543":"The influence of psychoactive drugs on neuroplasticity, especially on neurogenesis is reviewed. From psychopharmacological point of view most interesting results are those showing neurogenesis that neurogenesis is increased by SSRI. However, the role of serotonin system in neurogenesis as well as significance of neurogenesis in the beneficial effect of psychotropic drugs requires a lot of additional and new inventive research.","2544":"Despite modern advances in clinical psychopharmacology, mental disorders are still the leading cause of disability all over the world. Drug treatment of mental disorders is unfortunately too often associated with partial remissions, frequent relapse or recurrence as well as with persistent residual symptoms, distress and low levels of well-being, life-satisfaction and quality of life. The practical failure of psychopharmacotherapy to improve life-satisfaction and well-being is related to treatment focus on psychopathology and decrease of illness and not on the development of wellness, purpose of life and creativity. NLP, life coaching and well-being therapy may significantly increase effectiveness of psychopharmacotherapy shaping an efficient and meaningful treatment context for achieving a full recovery.","2545":"Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) is a clinically recognizable multiple congenital anomaly and mental retardation syndrome caused by an interstitial deletion of chromosome 17 pll.2. Although the physical and molecular genetic features of SMS are increasingly well understood, work is more limited on SMS's behavioral phenotype, which includes self-injury, tantrums, aggression, attention deficit, and sleep disturbance. This case-report describes the lowering of the aggression level of a 13 year old individual with SMS.","2546":"Involuntary emotional expression disorder (IEED) is underrecognized by clinicians, misdiagnosed as depression or bipolar disorder and undertreated, because clinicians are unfamiliar with the disorder. An important clinical consideration for IEED is that of distinguishing mood from affect. IEED describes a syndrome of relatively stereotypical episodes of uncontrollable crying and\/or laughing, resulting from lesions of multiple types, in multiple brain regions, without an apparent stimulus to trigger such responses. This syndrome is common among a number of neurological diseases like patients with a stroke or traumatic brain injury (TBI), patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), as well as dementias such as Alzheimer;s disease (AD), and motor disorders such as Parkinson;s disease (PD). The neuropathological cause and neurochemistry of the disorder remains unclear. There is general agreement that IEED is the result of an injury to the neurological pathways that control the expression of emotions. Adequate treatment can reduce the frequency and improve the quality of life of patients and caregivers.","2547":"The aim of this paper is to determine the influence of religious moral beliefs on the stability of adolescents' mental health. The sample consists of 240 mentally and physically healthy male and female adolescents attending a high school, who are divided into groups equalized by gender (male and female), age (younger 15, older 18 years); school achievement (very good, average student); behaviour (excellent, average); family structure (complete family with satisfactory family relations), and level of exposure to psycho-social stress (they were not exposed to specific traumatizing events). Subjects were assessed with regard to the level of belief in some basic ethical principles that arise from religious moral values. The score of religious moral belief index was used to compare two groups of subjects. For sample selection the measuring instruments were used to assess the religious, moral and social profile of subject. For the assessment of personality structure a standardized test battery (Freiburg's Personality Questionnaire\/ Das Freiburger Personlichkeitsinventar - FPI, Profile Index of Emotions - PIE, Life Style Questionnaire - OM) was used to assess personality profile, emotional profile and subject's defence orientation. The score of the moral belief index was negatively correlated to neuroticism and depressiveness (Pearson's r=-0.242, P&lt;0.001; r=-0.311, P&lt;0.001, respectively). Spontaneous and reactive aggressiveness and irritability were negatively correlated with the score of moral belief index (Pearson's r=-0.197, P=0.002; r=-0.147, P=0.023; r=-0.350, P&lt;0.001, respectively). Emotional instability is negatively associated with the moral belief index of the investigated adolescents (Pearson's r=-0.324, P&lt;0.001). The moral belief index was highly negatively correlated with repression (r=-0.206, P=0.001), regression (r=-0.325, P&lt;0.001), compensation (r=-0.186, P=0.004), transfer (r=-0.290, P&lt;0.001) and defensive orientation (r=-0.129, P=0.046). Verified intellectualisation and reactive formation are in positive correlation with the moral belief index among our investigated adolescents (Pearson's r=0.168, P=0.009; r=0.356; P&lt;0.001, respectively). A higher index of religious moral beliefs in adolescents enables better control of impulses, providing better mental health stability. It enables neurotic conflicts typical for adolescence to be more easily overcome. It also causes healthier reactions to external stimuli. A higher index of religious moral beliefs of young people provides a healthier and more efficient mechanism of anger control and aggression control. It enables transformation of that psychical energy into neutral energy which supports the growth and development of personality, which is expressed through socially acceptable behaviour. In this way, it helps growth, development and socialization of the personality, leading to the improvement in mental health. ","2548":"The role of the father in the onset and development of schizophrenic disorder\/disturbance is very often secondary as compared to that of the mother. This study deals with the father's sphere in the family with a patient\/son suffering from schizophrenia, the traits of his personality and his relationship with his son\/patient, and with his wife\/the mother of the patient. The methods applied were clinical interview, structured interview and semantic differential. The following statistical procedures were used: correlation, componential, discriminative, factor and quasicanonical analyses. The results include some characteristic excerpts from clinical interviews with patients\/sons and their fathers, projective perception of current family relationships, quasicanonical analysis of the father's, mother's and son's experiences of the patient's\/son's early childhood, and the projective view of the father. Among the conclusions reached, the phenomenon of \"dead father\" is emphasized as one of the main factors in the onset and development of schizophrenic disorder\/disturbance.","2549":"Based on multifaceted evidence (family, twin, adoption, molecular genetic, geographic, immigrant, and surname studies of suicide), the genetics of suicide is increasingly recognized. However, a comprehensive, stand-alone review of adoption studies in this area is unavailable, nor are there data on what people actually believe about adoption study findings. To reassess the available adoption studies of suicide and to provide novel data on beliefs relating to these. Key findings of the 3 existing adoption studies of suicide were reviewed and subjected to a meta-analysis. Beliefs pertaining to these were analyzed in 10 samples (total N = 1379) of different types (medical and psychology students, general population) from 6 countries. The combined evidence from adoption studies clearly supported genetic factors in suicide. Critical tests showed that suicide runs in the biological families of suicided (as well as schizophrenic or affectively ill) adoptees, but not in those of demographically matched healthy control adoptees alive (relative risk RR = 8.38, p = 0.0002). Individuals' beliefs about the plausibility of these findings were inconsistent and self-contradictory. Particularly, it was widely disbelieved that adoptees' risk of suicide resembles the one of their biological, not their adoptive, relatives (which is the case). Despite demonstrating a significant genetic effect, the evidence base from adoption studies of suicide is narrow. To broaden the evidence remains an important research agenda. Gaps in and deficiencies of this specific literature as well as general limitations of adoption study designs are discussed. ","2550":"Sixty-two patients who had been treated for three years in an ad-hoc, assertive treatment team for patients who had suffered a first psychotic episode were compared to sixty-two patients who had been followed up after a first psychotic episode in a community mental health team. All patients had suffered a first or early psychotic episode. The main differences between the two teams was that the ad-hoc team was assertive in its approach, offered more structured psycho-education, relapse prevention and psycho-social interventions, and had a policy of using atypical anti-psychotics at the lowest effective dose. There were many differences in outcome measures at the end of three years between the two groups. The EI patients are more likely to be taking medication at the end of three years. They are more compliant with medication. They are more likely to be prescribed Atypical Medication. The EI patients are more likely to have returned to Work or Education. The EI patients are more likely to remain living with their families. They are less likely to suffer depression to the extent of requiring anti-depressants. They appear to commit less suicide attempts. The patients in the EI service also appear to be less likely to suffer relapse and re-hospitalisation, and are less likely to have involuntary admission to hospital. They have systematic relapse prevention plans based on Early Warning Signs. They and their families receive more psycho-education. These indications suggest that the EI patients are at the end of three years better able to manage their illness\/vulnerability on their own than the CMHT patients. More patients in the EI group stopped using illicit drugs than in the CMHT group. All the above changes were statistically significant except for the total improvement in employment status and education status, which however approached significance. These results suggest that an ad-hoc Early Intervention Team is more effective than standard Community Mental Health Team in treating psychotic illness.","2551":"","2552":"","2553":"","2554":"There has been a growing interest in the effect that comorbid mental and somatic disorders may have on each other. Metabolic syndrome is an important risk factor for the development of diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease and premature mortality. To examine the association between various mental disorders (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental disorders) and metabolic syndrome and discuss the possible pathophysiologic mechanisms that may link specific mental disorders and metabolic syndrome. A MEDLINE search, citing articles from 1966 onward, supplemented by a review of bibliographies, was conducted to identify relevant studies. Criteria used to identify studies included (1) English language, (2) published studies with original data in peer-reviewed journals. Clinical investigation of the metabolic syndrome in patients with mental disorders, except schizophrenia, has been surprisingly scarce. Metabolic syndrome was reported in 19-63% of schizophrenic patients, in 42.4% of patients with schizo-affective disorder, in 24.6-50% of bipolar patients, in 12-36% of the patients with recurrent depression and in 31.9-35% of patients with combat posttraumatic stress disorder. Metabolic syndrome can contribute to significant morbidity and premature mortality and should be accounted for in the treatment of mental disorders. No definite or reliable insight into the pathophysiological link between metabolic syndrome and mental disorders is available. ","2555":"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been associated with co-morbidity of many major mental and somatic disorders as well as with premature mortality. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between combat-related PTSD, metabolic syndrome and its components as well as between PTSD severity and metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome and its components were investigated in 100 male war veterans with combat PTSD and in 79 males who needed medical attention in a family medicine dispensary. Metabolic syndrome according to the modified NCEP: ATP III criteria was found in 35% of our PTSD patients. Metabolic syndrome and intensity of PTSD were significantly related. Metabolic syndrome was identified in 66.7% of the war veterans with high intensity of PTSD in comparison to 23.3% of the veterans with low intensity PTSD. Prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its components is elevated in war veterans with PTSD. PTSD is a multi-systemic disorder and treatment of war veterans with PTSD should address co-morbid somatic disorders including metabolic syndrome in addition to the clinical features of PTSD. ","2556":"Our aim was to discover nurses' attitudes towards depression and to test for the impact of education on these attitudes. Negative attitudes towards depression are one of the reasons for underestimation of depressive disorders in the community and the clinical setting. We developed a questionnaire on attitudes towards depression by using the principal component analysis. We observed overall changes in attitudes and differences in each dimension and compared them between nurses who attended education workshops and those who did not. We learnt that nurses have positive attitudes towards people suffering from depressive disorder and towards curing and healing from depression itself, but a somewhat neutral opinion on possible complications caused by depression. Overall, nurses' attendance at education workshops contributed to improvement in their attitudes. This in turn probably led to a decrease in the stigmatisation of depression.","2557":"To determine the efficacy of venlafaxine in treatment of post-stroke depression. The sample consisted of 30 adult subjects with symptoms of post-stroke depression. All subjects received treatment with venlafaxine in therapeutic dose range in the period of three months. All subjects were assessed prior to treatment and in 1 month-follow-up and 3 months follow-up using the standardized instruments for assessment of depressive symptoms (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale HAM-D-21), and for efficacy and tolerability with the Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI). All subjects signed an informed consent form prior to entering in the study. The results indicate a statistically significant reduction of depressive symptoms following three months of treatment with venlafaxine. The difference between three assessments with The Clinical Global Impressions scale was statistically significant. Unwanted effects were registered in two of the subjects (increased blood pressure) and they were of mild intensity. Venlafaxine proved to be very efficient, well tolerated and safe in the treatment of depression occurring after cerebrovascular incidents to the subjects in this study. ","2558":"To assess the frequency of silent brain infarcts and cerebral cortical atrophy in psychiatric patients with cognitive dysfunction. One hundred and ninety four patients with cognitive dysfunction determined by the use of the Benton Visual Retention Test and Wechsler Memory Scale were analyzed according to age, gender, education, duration of psychiatric treatment, presence of mental disorders, neurological findings, and CT scan of neurocranium. The results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Average age of the group of patients studied was 48+\/-9.7 years, and average duration of psychiatric treatment was 6+\/-7.3 years. Regarding mental disorders, patients suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in comorbidity with depression (21.1%), depressive disorder (14.4%), Complex PTSD (13.9%), PTSD (11.3%), and post-concussion syndrome (7.7%). Cerebral cortical atrophy was determined in 47.4%, silent brain infarct in 3.6%, whereas the combination of cerebral cortical atrophy and silent brain infarct was found in 26.3% of patients. In 22.6% of patients with cognitive dysfunction on the Benton Visual Retention Test and Wechsler Memory Scale CT scan findings were completely normal. Cerebral cortical atrophy was more frequent in patients with PTSD in comorbidity with depression (43%), PTSD (39.0%), Complex PTSD (26%), depression (25%), whereas the silent brain infarct was more frequent in patients with post-concussion syndrome (53.3%) and depression (42.8%). Cerebral cortical atrophy and silent brain infarct are frequent findings in computerized tomography of the brain in psychiatric patients with cognitive dysfunction. Cerebral atrophy is frequent in patients with PTSD, whereas in patients with depression, besides cerebral atrophy, silent brain infarct is also frequently present. ","2559":"Aim of this research was to establish possible differences in sexual self-perception among acute and chronic schizophrenic patients, taking into consideration their hereditary predisposition. Two groups of schizophrenic patients were analyzed, consisting of 100 acute and 100 chronic schizophrenic patients, treated at the Psychiatric clinic Rijeka, in the period 1998-1999, taking into consideration their hereditary predisposition and influence of that predisposition on seven aspects of sexual self-perception: sexual self-scheme, sexual consciousness, readiness for sexual action sexual adventurism, level of negative emotions towards one's sexuality, perception of one's sexual self-competence, sexual satisfaction. Results show that hereditary predisposition in chronic schizophrenic patients has a negative effect on some of the aspects of sexual self-perception: sexual self-scheme and sexual satisfaction. Therefore, patients with hereditary predisposition achieve lower results than those without hereditary predisposition. We can conclude that hereditary predisposition negatively influences certain aspects of sexual self-perception in chronic schizophrenic patients, and that it does not influence aspects of sexual self-perception in acute schizophrenic patients.

Trends in age-adjusted, sex-specific suicide (as an integral indicator for psychosocial distress) and stomach ulcer mortality rate in Russia from 1965 to 2005 were analyzed employing an ARIMA analysis in order to assess the bivariate relationship between the two time series. Time series analysis indicate the presence of a statistically significant association between the two time series for males (r=0.45; SE=0.16). The association between the two time series for females was also positive, however it was not statistically significant (r=0.25; SE=0.14). The results of the present study suggest a positive association between male suicide and stomach ulcer mortality rate at the aggregate level. This paper presents new epidemiological evidence that supports the psychosomatic concept of stomach ulcer disease. ","2561":"We explore psychometric characteristics of a modified version of the Cloninger's personality questionnaire, the Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised (TCI-R) in a 200-subject sample. This sample was stratified in accordance with the Czech population. We performed principal component analyses and explored the factorial structure of the questionnaire, to establish internal consistency of each dimension. The factorial structure of the TCI-R was well defined for temperament, but not for character. A robust factor was obtained for Persistence. All dimensions obtained higher alpha Cronbach coefficients with the TCI-R than with the TCI. There were high reliability coefficients in test-retest for TCI-R and lower for TCI\/TCI-R were found. Significant correlations were obtained between age and NS, RD and SD. The TCI-R seems to have similar psychometric characteristics to TCI, with significant improvements in temperament factor structure and internal consistency of most dimensions.","2562":"This overview focuses on a provision of current mental health services in New Zealand and might help professionals from other countries to become familiar with its community based model of care. New Zealand mental health services have undergone significant changes over the last 40 years. These include the closure of old psychiatric hospitals and the development of community based treatment facilities. The New Zealand government has been closely involved with the organisation of mental health services providing strategic directions and financial support. So far much has been accomplished, however some gaps still remain.","2563":"Forty patients who had been treated for three years in an ad-hoc, assertive treatment team for patients who had suffered a first psychotic episode were compared to forty patients who had been followed up after a first psychotic episode in a community mental health team. All patients had suffered a first or early psychotic episode. The main differences between the two teams was that the ad-hoc team was assertive in its approach, offered more structured psycho-education, relapse prevention and psycho-social interventions, and had a policy of using atypical anti-psychotics at the lowest effective dose. There were many differences in outcome measures at the end of three years between the two groups. The EI patients are more likely to be taking medication at the end of three years. They are more compliant with medication. They are more likely to be prescribed atypical medication. The EI patients are more likely to have returned to work or education. The EI patients are more likely to remain living with their families. They are less likely to suffer depression to the extent of requiring anti-depressants. They appear to commit less suicide attempts. The patients in the EI service also appear to be less likely to suffer relapse and re-hospitalisation, and are less likely to have involuntary admission to hospital. They have systematic relapse prevention plans based on early warning signs. They and their families receive more psycho-education. These indications suggest that the EI patients are at the end of three years better able to manage their illness\/vulnerability on their own than the CMHT patients. More patients in the EI group stopped using illicit drugs than in the CMHT group. All the above changes were statistically significant except for the number of patients who stopped using illicit drugs. In this case it is believed that the sample size was too small to demonstrate significance. These results suggest that an ad-hoc early intervention team is more effective than standard community mental health team in treating psychotic illness.","2564":"Early intervention in psychotic illness is a key area of development in community mental health.

Despite of this fact, there are still some treatment-resistant patients, who do not respond neither on antidepressants nor on antipsychotics (Wender 1988). Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (Peschina et al. 2001), electroconvulsive therapy (Konig et al. 1991) and vagus nerve stimulation are some effective treatment options for those patients. For seasonal depressions light therapy has been proven to be effective. Actually Methylphenidate is in use for hyperkinetic and narcoleptic patients (Steinhausen 1995), but seems also to be effective for major depressive disorders as an add-on therapy (Sachdev et al. 2000). Steinhausen (1995) report a response rate among hyperkinetic patients of 75% and a lower one among depressive patients. This case report describes an 15 yr old patient with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, who was initially treated psychopharmacologically (electroconvulsive therapy, vagus nerve stimulation and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation were refused) without a significant improvement.

The most prevalent groups of psychiatric disorders among general hospital inpatients are organic mental illness, depressive disorders, and alcohol dependence or abuse. The prevalence rates of organic brain syndromes, adjustment disorders with depressed mood, and alcohol dependence in general hospital inpatients are above those of the general population. In nearly half of the studied general hospital inpatients receiving a psychiatric diagnosis Consultation-Liaison (C-L) psychiatry interventions were found to be necessary. However, psychiatric consultation rates found in most recently presented studies in Germany and Austria range from 2.66% to 3.30%, and remain low when compared to the reported prevalence figures of psychiatric disorders and the demonstrated necessity for specific therapeutic interventions among general hospital inpatients. There is also evidence stemming from newly presented C-L follow-up studies that the remarkable advances in intensive care treatment, organ transplantation medicine and cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass within the past decade have an important impact on the general hospital inpatients; psychosocial outcome. One follow-up study of long-term acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) survivors using the Structural Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV (SCID) has shown that 43.5% of these patients met the criteria for a full posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 8.9% of these patients for a subthreshold or partial PTSD (sub-PTSD) at hospital discharge, and 23.9% of them still suffered from full PTSD, 17.8% of them from sub-PTSD. ARDS-Patients with PTSD symptomatology exhibited major impairments in a variety of dimensions of health-related quality of life. Another outcome study examining concurrently psychiatric morbidity and quality of life in intermediate-term survivors of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) survivors has documented that 5.4% of these patients had a full PTSD, and 17.3% of them a sub-PTSD at 4 year-follow-up. OLT- related PTSD symptomatology was associated with maximal decrements in health-related quality of life. The duration of intensive care treatment, the number of medical complications, and the occurrence of acute rejection were positively correlated with the risk of PTSD symptoms subsequent to OLT. Finally, one prospective 1-year outcome study has focused on psychiatric morbidity including postoperative delirium in patients who had undergone cardiac surgery employing cardiopulmonary bypass. Postoperative delirium developed in 32.4% of these patients, however, only in 5.9% of them severe delirium was noted. Short-term consequences of cardiac surgery included adjustment disorders with depressed features (32.4%), acute full in-hospital PTSD (17.6%), and in-hospital major depression (17.6%). The diagnostic status of in-hospital PTSD was linked to postoperative delirium. At 12 months, the severity of depression and anxiety disorders including PTSD improved and returned to the preoperative level. However, patients who were found to have major depression or PTSD before discharge, C-L psychiatric consultations were conducted. In conclusion, PTSD symptoms following medical illness and treatment are not rare. If they are untreated, PTSD symptoms such as intrusive recollections, avoidance and hyper-arousal may impair the patients; quality of life more than the primary disease. This seems to be also true for a subthreshold PTSD. To adequately diagnose and treat patients at risk of developing PTSD, close collaboration between physicians of all subspecialties and C-L psychiatrists will be necessary.","2573":"The purpose of this study is to examine the long term psychological effects of war stress regarded as traumatic experience.

Personal space was assessed using stop-distance technique. All subjects were approached by female and male experimenter from four directions. Personal space zone was significantly larger in the schizophrenic patients than in the comparison group. Subjects in both groups maintained larger interpersonal distances when approached by a male experimenter and when approached frontally. No significant difference in personal space preference was found between subjects manifesting paranoid and residual type of schizophrenia. The results suggest that schizophrenic patients, presumably due to their mental health, demonstrate a stronger need for personal space. These results are consistent with the protective function of personal space.

Furthermore, social network analysis offered some potentially relevant explanation for comorbidity of diabetes mellitus and depressive symptoms. ","2595":"The objective of the study was to investigate the global cognitive deficit in schizophrenia and to compare cognitive dysfunction in the positive and negative subtypes of schizophrenia, and furthermore to examine the existence of predictors of the positive and negative subtypes of schizophrenia. 56 patients with schizophrenia were evaluated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale to classify them into the subtypes of schizophrenia, that is positive subtype (31 patients) and negative subtype (25 patients). All the patients were entering into remission. To examine the cognitive deficits in schizophrenia (global and selective) we compared scores on the Wechsler Individual Intelligence Test (VITI) for the positive and negative subtypes. The negative subtype of schizophrenia showed significantly higher cognitive dysfunction in comparison to the positive subtype, with reduced functioning in evolutionary higher cognitive functions like the selection of information, processing, planning, comprehension, realization (executive functions) as well as visual motor abilities. Verbal IQ predicts the positive subtype of schizophrenia. ","2596":"","2597":"Compulsive buying (oniomania) is a disorder that has begun to receive attention from researchers in recent years. It has been estimated that disorder affects from 2 to 8% of the general adult population in the US (official data for Croatia are not available). About 90% of those affected are female. Onset occurs in the late teens or early twenties, and the disorder is generally chronic. Psychiatric comorbidity is frequent, particularly mood, anxiety, substance use, eating and personality disorders. Treatment has not been well delineated, but individual and group psychodynamic psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioural therapy and 12-step programmes may be helpful. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) re-uptake inhibitors may help some patients regulate their buying impulses. We have presented the case of a 32-year old woman with a history of excessive pathological buying treated successfully with combined therapy (fluvoxamine and cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy).","2598":"We describe the case of a 39-year-old patient with schizophrenia who developed worsening of glucose metabolism during treatment with two different atypical antipsychotics, clozapine and quetiapine. Diabetes mellitus was recognized during clozapine treatment. During quetiapine treatment, while patient was taking diabetic diet, fasting and 1-hour glucose levels and body mass index, decreased, but 2-hour glucose levels increased. This suggests that, in some patients, monitoring of only fasting glucose level and body mass index may be insufficient for detecting the glucose metabolism abnormalities. In those patients oral glucose tolerance test may be recommended. Recommendations about when and how often clinicians should administer the test do not exist in current guidelines. Further studies are needed for the elucidation of this question.","2599":"Cronkhite-Canada syndrome is a very rare illness and psychical disturbances developed as a consequence of this illness are very rarely described. That is the case because majority of the symptoms of this syndrome are associated with the polyposis of the gastrointestinal tract. The aim of this case report is to link the development of acute brain syndrome with this rare syndrome. The patient was two times treated under the diagnosis of Cronkhite-Canada syndrome in the clinics of internal medicine in Rijeka and Zagreb, and then in the Psychiatric Clinic in Rijeka under the diagnosis of acute brain syndrome (F05.0). Therapy with a typical antipsychotic (haloperidol) and corresponding internistic treatment gave results very fast and calmed acute delirium. Typical antipsychotics are efficient in the treatment of the acute brain syndrome caused by Cronkhite-Canada syndrome. Acute brain syndrome is caused solely by the lack of electrolytes and other important nutrients because of a malabsorption syndrome, conditioned by a diffuse polyposis of intestines. ","2600":"Mental health is not considered only as absence of mental disorders, but rather as the achievement of higher standards of available psychical potentials. True devotion and obedience to The God give the one a huge and incredible strength, constant source of spiritual emotional and moral energy, which is of help in resisting destructive and slavery attacks of the environment and its materialistic-consuming tendencies, as well as social and mental disruption. According to the opinion of numerous worldwide recognized mental health experts, humankind of today is confronted with a number of problems, which are the consequence of spiritual and moral-ethical degradation of human being. Therefore, religiosity became the field of interest of mental health researchers. The results of new studies undoubtedly indicate beneficial effects of religion on life and mental health in humans. Religiosity reduces tendencies for risky behaviour, impulsive reactions and aggression; it corrects tendencies towards psychopathic and paranoid behaviour, reduces converse, depressive and schizoid tendency, and provides successful overcome of emotional conflicts. In comparison to low-religious adolescents, the factors such as inner conflicts, frustration, fear, anxiety, psychological trauma, low self-esteem, unbalance of psychical homeostasis, emotional instability, and negative psychical energy are less present in highly religious adolescents and neutralized in a healthier and more efficient way. Beneficial impact of religion on mental health derives from precise cognitive-behavioural patterns, which provide a clear life orientation, solid basis and safe frames for personality development, assuring human to be continually on the way to achieve its own generic essence and reach its own maturity and self-actualization.","2601":"Psychodermatologic disorders are conditions involving an interaction between the mind and the skin. These disorders fall into three major categories: psychosomatic disorders, primary psychiatric disorders and secondary psychiatric disorders (Koo 1995). The treatment of psychodermatologic disorders is almost impossible without a holistic team approach involving psychiatrist, dermatologist and psychologist. Majority of psychodermatologic disorders can be treated with cognitive-bihevioral psychotherapy, psychoterapeutic stress-and-anxiety-management techniques and psychotropic drugs. Psychopharmacologic treatment with anxiolytics, antidepressants, antipsychotics and mood stabilizers can be prescribed by dermatologist, after consulting the psychiatrist.","2602":"Aripiprazole exhibits high affinity for dopamine D2 and D3, serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors, moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5-HT2C and 5-HT7, alpha1-adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors. The mean elimination half-lives are about 75 hours and 94 hours for aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole, respectively. Steady-state concentrations are attained within 14 days of dosing for both active moieties. At least 1 to 2 weeks, and sometimes up to 4 weeks, may pass before aripiprazole reaches its full effect. The efficacy of aripiprazole was investigated in the treatment of schizophrenia, in the treatment of acute manic episode associated with Bipolar I Disorder, and in the treatment of psychosis associated with Alzheimer's dementia. Aripiprazole has demonstrated superiority to placebo in clinical studies of the treatment of both schizophrenia and acute bipolar mania. Aripiprazole has been evaluated for safety in 5592 patients who participated in multiple dose, premarketing trials in schizophrenia, bipolar mania, and dementia of the Alzheimer's type. The recommended starting and target dose for aripiprazole is 10 or 15 mg\/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. Aripiprazole has been systematically evaluated and shown to be effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg\/day. Dosage increases should not be made before 2 weeks of continuous therapy, the time needed to achieve steady state. At least 1 to 2 weeks, and sometimes up to 4 weeks, may pass before aripiprazole reaches its full effect. In this presentation was given an overview of novel antipsychotic aripiprazole.","2603":"In order to estimate the degree of glucose tolerance impairment, oral glucose tolerance test was conducted in the group of 15 schizophrenic patients taking olanzapine, the group of 15 schizophrenic patients taking risperidone and in the group of 14 healthy volunteers. In the olanzapine group the tolerance was impaired in 33% of the patients, contrary to the risperidone group in which impairment amounted to 20% of the patients. The authors discuss possible mechanisms responsible for impaired glucose tolerance in patients taking newer antipsychotic drugs.","2604":"This paper provides a review of the organization of mental health care for children and adolescents in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The number of institutions that provide this form of health protection is insufficient. Such institutions exist only in the two largest cities in the country. Government measures and the Plan for responding to most urgent needs are also presented. The accent is put on the need to attain territorial coverage with services, both for health and social protection of children and adolescents.","2605":"","2606":"In our paper we analyzed the results of the questionnaire for compliance and insight into the disease among chronic schizophrenic patients and their carers in Croatia. We interviewed thirty female patients and fifteen carers. We have found out that patients in general have poor knowledge about the illness, symptoms and side effects of medicine which is similar to the results obtained by other studies. Patients often stop taking medicine, which results in exacerbation of the disease (in average 10 hospitalizations during 12 years of disease) mainly because of checking whether they have been cured and because of the side effects of medication. Two thirds were diagnosed during the period of one year from the onset of the disease, and one third between one and five years. The most valuable information they get about illness and about drugs is from psychiatrists and from direction in medicine box. Information from other medical staff was estimated the same as of non-professional people, e.g. friends and family. Over 70 percent of patients did not have contact with educational material like leaflets, only 3% use Internet. Both groups were completely unsatisfied with the role of the media. Stigma problem was denied by the group of patients but reported by carers in a way that 40% still hide from someone the illness of the family member. According to the results of the questionnaire we detected some good points in care of the patients, and found new ideas how to improve psychiatric services in Croatia.","2607":"Objective of the study was to investigate differences in some important cognitive functions in the schizophrenic patients that were either involuntary or voluntary hospitalized in psychiatric hospital. 30 involuntary hospitalized patients with schizophrenia were evaluated with neurocognitive battery and compared with a group of 30 voluntary hospitalized patients with schizophrenia. Demographic and medical data were also analyzed Involuntary hospitalized patients showed significantly poorer performance in some cognitive tests and no difference in the other cognitive tests in comparison with voluntary hospitalized patients. Involuntary hospitalized patients also had earlier onset of illness, higher number of psychiatric hospitalizations and involuntary psychiatric hospitalizations, and less regular psychiatric treatment. More often the reason for involuntary hospitalization was aggressive behavior. Deficit of cognitive functioning could influence treatment decisions in schizophrenic patients, leading to poorer compliance and coping with illness and resulting in less favorable treatment options, like involuntary hospitalization. ","2608":"Among one of the biggest difficulties in diagnosis and treatment of Attention Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD\/HD) is firstly the involvement of different persons, especially parents and teachers, who, together with experts, make the unavoidable subjects in the process of detecting and treating children with AD\/HD. Adding to that the standards of living environment, the process becomes even more complex. The aim of this research is to detect if there is a difference in the assessment of AD\/HD, given by the parents and teachers in two urban areas, which have culturally and geographically different characteristics (Middle European and Mediterranean). The assessments of children's behavior were conducted in two randomly selected schools; one in Zadar (Mediterranean town on the Adriatic coast) and the other in Zagreb (Middle European city). The children were evaluated by the experts using DSM IV as a gold standard, and by the parents and teachers using Conners rating scales. Analysis of results showed that there were differences in assessment of AD\/HD among experts and parents\/teachers, and among parents from two towns. Different results given by parents in Zadar and Zagreb, we reasoned, were obtained because of different sensitivity to the problems of hyperactive\/impulsive\/attention deficiency children's behavior.","2609":"Psychiatric reforms in Upper Austria have considerably improved the quality of life of psychiatric patients. Modernizing the status of acute psychiatric departments based on a bio- psycho-, social concept implemented multidimensional approach in diagnostics and therapeutic methods applied by multiprofessional teams. Prophylactic procedures and rehabilitation programs have minimized chronification of psychiatric diseases. By \"late rehabilitation programs\" increased autonomy, more individualized planning of life processes could be achieved even with \"chronic\" patients. We do not see any need to confine \"chronic\" psychiatric patients in psychiatric hospitals. These patients are cared for, socially integrated by special rehabilitation measures and professional rehabilitation in community-based services and units of Pro Mente Upper Austria--a non-profit organization. Problems decreased the duration of stay in psychiatric hospitals, and increased admission rates when the number of beds in psychiatric departments was considerably decreased in the course of psychiatric reforms in Austria. In our province--Upper Austria--these problems are of lesser importance because private non-profit organizations like Pro Mente Upper Austria have provided a variety of community-based services (mental health centres, day clinics, housing facilities and special services for drug addicts and geriatric patients) in ever increasing numbers. Still there is the need for further development of community-based services provided by specially trained professionals. These services are financed mainly by the state, the provincial government, the labour market services and to a small degree by funds of the European Union. In these days of reduced social budgets of the state and social departments of provincial governments it is not easy to keep our standards and meet the increased needs of our clients.","2610":"Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis are rare, but severe cutaneous reactions. Beside cutaneous manifestations, the syndrome is characterised by constitutional sypmtoms with even lethal consequences. Toxic epidermal necrolysis is usually a drug-hypersensitivity syndrome. More than a hundred drugs were suspected to cause toxic epidermal necrolysis. Although benzodiazepines had been suspected in some cases, flurazepam has not been implicated thus far. The authors report a severe, life threatening case of toxic epidermal necrolysis in a young woman suffering from schizophrenia. The most probable cause was flurazepam, a hypnotic agent of the benzodiazepine class.","2611":"","2612":"The physician-patient relationship is recognized as having an essential role in the process of medical care, providing the context in which caring and healing can occur. Good patient-doctor relationship goes far deeper than the behaviour of physicians, particularly those behaviours recognized in popular culture as acting in a professional manner, being respectful of the patients' circumstances and bedside manner. The therapeutic relationship is a relationship between two persons--on one side is the patient who is psychologically modified in his illness, in regression, with resistance mechanisms, defences, fears and need for gratification, care and also for secondary profit. On the other side is the physician with his authority, knowledge, personality, habits, defences, unconscious of his own pharmacological effect on the patient, as the most potent drug. In the patient-centred medical model, based on contemporary scientific knowledge of disease, the physician has to understand the patient's \"world of illness\", and to accept the patient as a person with his whole conscious and unconscious reasons for suffering and not only as a\"collection of symptoms\".","2613":"This paper has been conceptualised as an overview of the clinically verified psychological consequences of war-stress exposure in children and adolescents in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The presented data are related to the city of Sarajevo, as this sample is in a particular way very specific in comparison with other areas. In effect, all types of stressors affecting the population can be found here, and it has particular significance in the light of the status of the city of Sarajevo as a war target. The delivered data are presented as a comparison of the clinical phenomena during the war and those several years afterwards. It is evident from the data that the war has left psychological consequences in the developing population, primarily in quantitative terms, i.e., in the increase of prevalence of psychological disorders by approximately 15% compared to the pre-war circumstances.","2614":"This article concerns the organisation of child psychiatry services in the region of south-eastern Europe. It is evident that the situation in different countries varies widely, from well-organized systems to a complete absence of professionals in the field of child psychiatry. Furthermore, the article will discuss the necessity to carry out reform in order to organize mental health care for children and adolescents. The emphasis is on the tendency to harmonize standards as much as possible in all countries of the region. The lack of proper legislation on mental health care is also pointed out. The article concludes with information on the first concrete actions, carried out by professors from the Children's Clinic at the Eppendorf University in Hamburg and the Deutsche Akademische Austausch Dinst (DAAD), which provides education by gathering representatives of child psychiatry services from the entire region. The goal is to define and agree on concrete ways of service networking for the entire region. An emphasis is placed on the education of professionals.","2615":"At least 95% of mental health problems are dealt with entirely in primary care. The other 5% are referred to secondary care, but these will be dealt with jointly by primary care services and secondary care services. Mental Health problems provide a major burden to primary care services, the doctors who operate in those services- the General Practitioners-, and their staff Standards need to be set in order to clarify what an adequate primary care response should be to the provision of mental health care. We propose a set of standards which are evidence based and which are correlated with the recent WHO declaration on Mental Health in Europe.","2616":"Standardized assessment of education is not used routinely although these factors may play an important role in the course of psychological disorders in children. Thus the aim of the present study was to investigate families of Borderline children with regard to differences with regard to education in their families. Families of 115 Borderline children (aged 6-12y), diagnosed by means of the Mannheim's Parents Interview (Esser et al. 1989) were included for evaluation and compared with a matched control group. Parents were asked to complete a form assessing education (\"Erziehungspraktiken\", Schneewind et al. 1985). Group comparison was made by the Mann-Whitney-U-test. The results show that there are less emotional attention, less material reinforcers and more physical punishment in families whose children belong to the Borderline children\" group. It could be shown, that there seems to be a significant influence of Borderline symptomatology on education which should make therapists focus their efforts not only on the \"index\" children as such but also on their families.","2617":"An epidemiological, retrospective, and analytical study was conducted to evaluate frequencies of emergency conditions, gender, age and demographical differentials, thus highlighting all clinical and demographical parameters relating to suicide attempts. Two Hundred and Sixty Eight (268) patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit of the Department of Psychiatry at the Sarajevo University Medical Centre over the course of a one-year period (01.01.2004 - 31.12.2004) were examined and included in the study. Essentially, the symptoms were assessed via psychiatric examinations and through the medical history of the patients. The data collected by the study were analyzed statistically by using the SPSS and Chi Square test. 94% of all patients were hospitalized as being in an emergency situation, 6% were wrongly diagnosed and transferred into a relevant medical institution. 41% of patients were hospitalized at the point of crisis (with police and emergency medical staff), while the most frequent condition was exacerbation of schizophrenia (22.4%). Of the 94% of patients, 17.9% were suicide attempters, while the group at greatest risk was the youngest (18-24), although this group represents 4.5% of total. The other risk factors were male gender, age 30-49 years, single or divorced, and lower socioeconomic status. The most frequent means of attempted suicide was intoxication with medication. Nearly all the patients had made previous suicide attempts. The study was conducted to provide an important epidemiological information on the characteristics of emergency admissions to psychiatric units and to underline the problem of triage and monitoring for this type of patients. How to prevent crises remains an open question; however this and other studies provide the necessary data to assist in managing and resolving this issue in the future. ","2618":"This open-label, multicentre study investigated the clinical efficacy of liquid peroral risperidone in psychotic disorders, the patients' attitudes toward the study medication vs. previous antipsychotic medication and also psychiatrists' opinion of it. Eighty one patients with psychotic disorder entered the study during 2004. At the baseline (T0), the treatment started with peroral risperidone liquid and lasted for 6 months (T2), with one visit a month after the baseline (T1). Clinical improvement was evaluated using PANSS and CGI, while extrapyramidal side effects were measured by the AIMS scale. The patients' attitudes were evaluated by 3-choice 3-item questionnaire designed for the purposes of present study. Moreover, psychiatrists were asked about their opinion regarding clinical improvement and compliance comparing liquid peroral versus risperidone-tablets. PANSS and CGI scores yielded clinical improvement (p&lt;0.001, DF=151 and p&lt;0.001, DF=151, respectively). Eighty three per cent of patients preferred peroral liquid risperidone for continuation of treatment. The psychiatrists agreed with the patients in deciding to continue treatment with peroral liquid risperidone (83%) because of better tolerability in 88% patients, better cooperation in 82% and more precise dosage in 80% patients. In terms of mental state, it was observed that during the study symptomatology had worsened in 3% of the study patients, in 6% there were no changes, while all others improved (26% moderately, 65% highly). conclusions: Peroral risperidone liquid was effective and well tolerated in patients with psychotic disorders. The patients' as well as their doctors' attitudes expressed satisfaction with the use of the risperidone peroral formulation. This is the only SAG available in peroral liquid formulation. ","2619":"The fusion of sexuality and violence is a major issue of concern and has become a central issue of social policy. That fusion can be observed in private circumstances as well as in society at large. Children and young people as well as women and men can fall victim to that phenomenon. Eventually, due to gender stereotyping, the awareness of the victimization of the male gender is somewhat weak. In the social-political discourse the male is seen as dominant and powerful and the female gender as the weak one. Sexual violence and\/or domination therefore is interpreted as mirroring the genderized balance of power in society. Otherwise the phenomenon is very complex and cannot be explained by simplistic or one-dimensional interpretations. In respect of definitions it is necessary to separate \"sexual violence\", as an aspect of sexual behavior, and \"sexualized power\". The latter means the use of sexuality for the display of power and violence. That kind of fusion is visible in all kinds of interactions--on the private level as well as in the sense of \"structural power\" (like in war, torture, etc.). To theory and practice of psychiatry and psychotherapy the situation brings a whole series of objectives. On the one hand these disciplines have the task to study the phenomenon in different contexts and to contribute to the understanding of the psychic and psychosocial processes which lead to the fusion of the drives. On the other hand it is their obligation to treat the victims of sexual trauma. In recent times much insight has been gained in that context. Nevertheless there has to be much future work done, to understand the phenomenon more deeply and to develop adapted and efficient concepts for prevention and treatment.","2620":"Aggressive behaviour in psychiatric patients is one of the most challenging issues in clinical work. Self harming behaviour mostly derives from depressive and psychotic disorders as well as from intoxications. Aggressive behaviour against others is mostly linked to psychotic symptoms. Beside all therapeutic possibilities in Austria the so called \"Unterbringungsgesetz\", a special law defines the circumstances under which patients may be transferred to closed psychiatric wards. Despite the fact that a judge makes the main decisions there are plenty of possibilities for the treating psychiatrist to deal with this law actively. It is very important that these possibilities are regularly used because otherwise the proportion of patients who are judged because of criminal activities continues to grow further.","2621":"In forensic practice there is an urgent need for criteria which separate personalities with a high risk for violent behaviour from those less likely to cause complications upon discharge or relaxed enforcement. Based upon a sample of over 64 expert opinions on conditional discharge from imprisonment, especially violent offenders and the diagnostic groups of personality disorders and substance abuse were investigated. Dangerousness and risk assessment was based on the criteria of the Psychopathy-Check-List (PCL-SV). Psychopathy has a high coincidence with addiction, hyperkinetical disorders and antisocial behaviour. In our sample of 64 offenders a standardized psychophysiological stress test (with a visuo-acoustic startle stimulus) was administered. Physiological indices consisted of skin conductance, pulse frequency, skin temperature and muscle tension (frontalis). Significant correlations between physiological data and cognitive and personality variables based upon extensive psychodiagnostic assessment are reported. Individual differences in stress reactivity with regard to psychopathy (Hare) and implications for therapy are further discussed.","2622":"This article is about destructive aggressive behaviour which was and would be one of the most sensitive aspects of psychiatric care. We present an attempt to arrange different types of aggression along a continuum, from idea-motivated forms to forms with psychomotor character only, without participation of the will. The psychopharmacological agents with proven anti-aggressive efficacy are discussed and model clinical cases are presented.","2623":"From numerous tests it is clearly to be concluded that between severe mental health problems and the act of violence exists a moderate, but reliable association. With this conclusion, neither old fears of \"an unpredictable insane person\" should be reactivated nor stigmatisation are to be carried out. Particularly since the whole of humans with psychological disturbances does not exhibit an increased act of violence risk in relation to the average population. It is however necessary to identify subgroups with increased tendency for self- and other aggressive behaviour, to describe aggression-aroused and reducing factors and to appreciate the positive influence of the psychiatric therapy and the social rehabilitation. After today's level of knowledge it is to be proceeded from the following risk indicators: Diagnosis of a paranoid disturbance, male sex, correlation with personality disorder and substance abuse, lack of treatment, increasing social disintegration with a longer treatment process and uncertain competence for the support. Extensive psychiatric treatments reduce the risk clearly. The deinstitutionalisation does not have negative influence with secured ambulatory support. The legal accommodation framework, which is discussed on the basis of the Austrian law situation, is an important modifying factor. Relating to the mental health problem there is just a little relation to the aggressive behaviour in comparison to the average population.","2624":"","2625":"","2626":"Suicides and induced abortions are primarily both premature deaths. Standardized death rates often show the certain level of medical standards in the different countries. The aim of this paper was to determine suicide rates in Croatia and its neighbouring countries (Hungary, Slovenia and Italy) associated with induced abortions and standardized death rates Method: It was a register linkage study. Information on suicides of women in Croatia, Hungary, Slovenia and Italy were linked with induced abortions and standardized death rates in these countries. Nationwide data in Croatia, Hungary, Slovenia and Italy in the period 1996-2002 i.e. the latest available data for each county was used. There were suicide rates in women: Croatia (2000)-10.3, Hungary (1999)-15.4, Slovenia (1999)-13.4 and Italy (1998)-3.6. There were induced abortions (% of live born children): Croatia (2002)-17.8, Hungary (2002)-69.7, Slovenia (2002)-49.6 and Italy (2002)-24.0. There were standardized death rates (1\/10.000 population): Croatia (1998)-113.8, Hungary (1996)-109.3, Slovenia (1996)-109.3 and Italy (1996)-70.7. The Croatian suicide rate and induced abortions have been lower than in Hungary and Slovenia. Croatia has been at the last place according to induced abortions but Croatia has been at the first place due to standardized death rates. ","2627":"The aim of the study was to examine the agreement and differences between Diagnostic Questionnaire for Depressive Patients according to 10th revision of International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Participants were 115 breast cancer female patients recruited in specialised cancer hospital radiotherapy unit. Depression was measured with CES-D, 20-item self-report scale designed to measure depressive symptoms in community. Score of &gt;\/= 16 indicated clinically relevant depression. Depression was also measured with Diagnostic Questionnaire for Depressive Patients based on the criteria of 10th revision of International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems. By using Diagnostic Questionnaire for Depressive Patients we established that of 115 patients 47 (40.9%) fulfils the criteria for depressive episode and that in the division by type of depressive episode 5 (10.6%) has mild, 22 (46.8%) has moderate and 20 (42.5%) has severe depressive episode. By CES-D 42 (36.5%) patients were considered clinically depressive. Kappa coefficient shows good agreement between two measures (kappa=0.799; p=0.000). CES-D and Diagnostic Questionnaire for Depressive Patients show good agreement in assessment of depression but in clinical setting assessment should be made with diagnostical instruments as Diagnostic Questionnaire for Depressive Patients.

Using official suicide statistics, this study examined suicide rates in Croatia over a 36-year span (1966 to 2002) as a function of gender, age, marital status, time, war and social changes. Suicide rates were displayed graphically and compared with some neighbouring countries (Slovenia, SCG, Hungary and Italy). During the period of socialistic Yugoslavia, suicide rate in Croatia was constantly increasing with small variations. During the war time suicides with firearms were significantly increased. Since 1993 (the period of independence and democratization) there has been a trend of evident decrease in total suicide rate. This study demonstrated that Croatia has still had high suicide rates with declining trend since 1993, probably related to democratization, more national, religious and cultural rights, better availability of SSRIs and systemic campaign for education of general practitioners for early recognition and treatment of depressive disorders.

Sometimes, divorces are like family damnation repeating in the family tree of one family. Decisive factors for that, according to professionals, are adoption of a model of parenthood behaviour or unconscious transmission of the representation of the family self that children manifest in their mature age. This work presents a case of a seven years old girl Maria in the system of transgenerational transmission divorce of the marriage of her parents. Maria suffered from symptoms of school phobia and in this symptoms lies the \"hidden\" wish of her mother for divorce as transgenerational representation of family self of her primary family, which conditioned generational compulsion of repetition through the female line.

These patients are cared for, socially integrated by special rehabilitation measures and professional rehabilitation in community - based services and units of Pro Mente Upper Austria - a non-profit organization. Problems are decreased duration of stay in psychiatric hospitals, increased admission rates when the number of beds in psychiatric departments was considerably decreased in the course of psychiatric reforms in Austria. In our province - Upper Austria - these problems are of lesser importance because private non-profit organizations like Pro Mente Upper Austria have provided a variety of community-based services (mental health centres, day clinics, housing facilities and special services for drug addicts and geriatric patients ) in ever increasing numbers. Still there is need of further development of community-based services provided by specially trained professionals. These services are financed mainly by the state, the provincial government, the labour market services and to a small degree by funds of the European Union. In these days of reduced social budgets of the state and social departments of provincial governments it is not easy to keep our standards and meet the increased needs of our clients.","2640":"Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is a frequent consequence of surviving the stress of the war. The majority of research studies confirm that the severity, duration and the proximity to the traumatic events have significant influence on the outcome of surviving psychological trauma. There is also evidence that the prisoners of war who have survived severe, repetitive traumatization will develop PTSD more frequently, and that the characteristics and the severity of symptoms is more serious compared with the veterans of war who did not survive imprisonment. This paper analyzes the presence of the symptoms of PTSD according to frequency in a group of former prisoners of war and a group of war veterans who did not experience imprisonment. The research sample is comprised of subjects who were selected by the method of randomized stratified sample and divided an experimental and control group. Experimental subgroup E1 consist of 50 former prisoners of war who have sought psychiatric help after being released from the prisons, and subgroup E2 consist of 50 former prisoners of war who never sought psychiatric assistance. Control group is divided in subgroup K1 that consist of 30 veterans of war who did not survive imprisonment, and who have occasionally sought psychiatric assistance after the war, and subgroup K2 that consist of 30 veterans of war who did not survive imprisonment and who never sought psychiatric assistance. All subjects were male, none of them had any prior psychiatric history. The instruments used in the study were the following: general and sociobiographic questionnaire designed by the authors, traumatic events questionnaire which is a modified version of the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, PTSD questionnaire designed according to DSM IV diagnostic criteria. Results in relation to degree of traumatic experience demonstrate that there is a significant statistical difference (P&lt;0.005) between the experimental and control group. PTSP is statistically significantly more represented among the former prisoners of war than among the war veterans who were not detained in camps (P&lt;0.05). Average scores for all symptom clusters (fear and helplessness, re-experiencing symptoms, avoidance symptoms, and hyper-arousal symptoms) were higher in the experimental group than in a control group.","2641":"Objectives. Standardized assessment of family features is not used routinely although these factors may play an important role in the course of psychological disorders in children. Thus the aim of the present study was to investigate families of autistic children with regard to differences within the features in their families using standardized instruments. Methods. The families of 115 autistic children (55 boys, 60 girls) diagnosed (aged 6-12y) by means of the Mannheim Parents Interview (Esser et al., 1989) were included for evaluation and compared with a matched, healthy control group. Parents were asked to complete a questionnaire assessing the family features (\"Familienklima-Testsystem\", Schneewind et al., 1985). Results. The results show that there are significantly more conflicts in families whose children are autistic than in control families. Compared to the matched healthy control group, there is a significant lack of organization and coherence in the dissocial group. Conclusions. Our results strongly suggest, that there seems to be a significant influence of psychosis on the family's coherence and organization which should make therapists focus their efforts not only on the \"index\" children as such but also on their families.","2642":"The multicentric prospective study was conducted to examine patients' attitudes toward risperidone in comparison to any previous antipsychotic treatment. Ninety three subjects with a schizophrenia or schizoaffective psychotic disorder (ICD-10), previously treated with any antipsychotics, were included in the study and treated with risperidone during 8 weeks. At the baseline, symptoms were assessed by PANSS and history of previous medication was recorded. At the end of the study, patients' attitudes were examined by eight-items questionnaire and PANSS was scored. Ninety five percent of patients previously treated with FGA (80%), SGA(5%) or combination (10%) completed the study, with improvement expressed in 62% change of the total PANSS score. Eight items questionnaire yielded risperidone to be superior to other regarding all questions. For continuation of the treatment, 83% of patients had chosen risperidone. Patients' attitudes and satisfaction with treatment should be monitored carefully because it appears to be related strongly to their readiness to take medication as prescribed, and thereby to outcome.

The aim of this study was to establish the effectiveness and safety of risperidone (Risset(R) - PLIVA) in patients with acute or chronic schizophrenic or other related psychosis. Study was designed as postmarketing, 4-week, open-label, flexible-dose observational study. Subjects and Methods. 30 patients, both genders, aged 18-70 years, with diagnosed various types of schizophrenic psychosis were enrolled in the study as outpatient and inpatient setting. The patients had to have a total score &gt;\/=40 on Positive and Negative scale - two parts of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and to be able to discontinue current antipsychotic and antiparkinsonian medications. The primary efficacy parameter was the percent of score difference between baseline and week 4 of therapy on two above-mentioned PANSS subscales. The difference was considered as significant improvement if decrease from the baseline was 20% or more. The safety of risperidone was evaluated on the basis of reported adverse events. Results. All 30 enrolled patients completed the study. After the 4 weeks of treatment, 23\/30 patients (76.67%) had clinically significant improvement of 20% or more decreased total PANSS score (Positive and Negative subscale). In 4\/30 patients (13.33%) clinical improvement was also reported with &lt;20% decreased total PANSS score. No serious adverse event was observed. Conclusions. Overall, collected data indicate that in this specific population (70% patients were resistant to previous anti-psychotic therapy), Risset(R) has shown very good effectiveness and safety.","2646":"The paper will show specific characteristics of the psychodynamic group psychotherapy in the small group of patients. Primary indications for the psychotherapy were expressed neurotic disorders. All patients have survived war traumatization, and some survived trauma of being refugee and separation from the other family members. Therapeutic atmosphere suitable for exploration of the neurotic conflicts has been created. At the same time traumatic contents that were asking for cognitive and emotional elaboration were emerging from time to time. We have supported that with the continuous effort to bring the patient closer to the identified clear connection between neurotic symptoms, early infantile traumatization and stronger sensibility to the experience of the war traumatization related to it. By better awareness and understanding the patient has been increasing the ability to deal with the neurotic conflict as well as with the psychological injuries created during the war traumatization.","2647":"The objective is the evaluation of treatment outcome difference between men and women through measuring quality of life persons who experienced war torture in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The research is analytical-descriptive and retrospective. It was conducted at two samples which were homogeneous according to gender. All persons included in the research regarding torture consequences have received comprehensive psychosocial rehabilitation at the Association for Rehabilitation of Torture Victims-Centre for Torture Victims in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. MANSA (Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life) questionnaire have been applied as instrument of research. The results indicates that women who experienced war torture, after completition of psychosocial rehabilitation, have bit better quality of life in post war conditions comparing to men. Generally, the quality of life results, both men and women war torture survivors are representing the evaluation of treatment outcome, justifying fully purpose of this treatment type. ","2648":"The aim of this study was to determine specific differences in trauma related symptoms between the civilians who survived the trauma of war and veterans of war who have had the experience of combat stress. The study involved two groups of subjects, with 50 male subjects in the age range between 20 and 50 in each group who had no psychiatric history prior to traumatization. All subjects were assessed for psychopathological symptoms using the multidimensional instrument for symptom assessment SCL 90-R (L.R. Derogatis 1986.). This instrument contains 90 articles divided in 9 subscales. PTSP symptoms were assessed with Mississippi Questionnaire designed by Keane et al 1988, and containing 35 articles. Sociodemographic characteristics were registered by the use of a special questionnaire designed by the authors. Our results indicate a statistically significant difference in the presence of symptoms between the two groups. Both PTSP and other related symptoms were present in statistically significant higher degree in the group of war veterans than in the group of civilian survivor of war traumas. There is also a statistically significant difference in socio-economic status in the period after the war between the two groups. This difference is at a disadvantage of the group of war veterans who are fairing significantly worse. This is probably due to the consequences of traumatization as well to secondary traumatization, absence of expected reward for their effort and impairment in social functioning in the group of war veterans. ","2649":"The aim of this study was to determine specific differences in trauma related symptoms in a group of subjects who were survivors of torture and displacement compared with a group of subjects who survived displacement as a consequence of state sponsored violence in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The subjects were divided in two groups of 50 adult survivors; one group comprising of 50 survivors of displacement and torture, the other group of 50 survivors of displacement who did not experience torture. The age range of the subjects was between 20 and 60. The groups were homogenous according to all other criteria. The exclusion criteria were prior psychiatric history and the experience of a loss of secondary family (spouse or child). All subjects were assessed using the standardized multidimensional instrument for symptom assessment, SCL 90-R (L.R.Derogatis, 1986). Mississippi Questionnaire, (Keane et al. 1988), was used for assessment of symptoms of PTSD. Sociodemographic questionnaire designed by the authors was used for registering of the sociodemographic characteristics of the subjects. The results of our study show a statistically significant difference in trauma related symptoms between a group of subjects who were refugees with the experience of torture and a group of subjects who were refugees only. The symptoms of PTSD are increased in survivors of torture to a degree that is statistically significant compared with the presence of PTSD symptoms in a group of refugees. Anxiety, depression, somatization, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, phobic symptoms, hostility, interpersonal sensitivity, paranoid and psychotic symptoms are present to a statistically higher degree in a group of refugees survivors of torture than in the group of refugees. There is also a statistically significant difference between the groups in socio-economic status in the period after the war. Refugees survivors of torture have significantly worse socio-economic situation, probably due to impairment in social functioning in these subjects.

Detailed analysis of all anamnestic and hetero-anamnestic data as well as the observations during the treatment separated few significant patterns of self-destructive behaviour of various intensity and different possible consequences. The results showed out that within the first group of patients with self-destructive behaviour was noticed a significant increased number of younger age patients who were diagnosed with personality disorder especially borderline and antisocial type. Additionally facing difficulties with alcohol abuse and drug addiction. In a second group there were older patients with serious attempt of suicide dominantly diagnosed with endogenous psychosis, especially schizophrenia.","2653":"Previous research has found that recently detoxicated alcoholics show impairments in executive cognitive functions, supporting the frontal lobe hypothesis. The study is testing the hypothesis that participants with alcohol dependence syndrome will show impairments in cognitive flexibility, planning and problem solving, ability to learn and information processing speed. The performance of twenty-eight participants with alcohol dependence syndrome was compared to controls using three neuropsychological tests (Stroop colour and word test, Tower of London, Wisconsin card sorting test) sensitive to executive cognitive functions. The alcoholics were found to be impaired in almost every executive cognitive function measured. Compared to controls, they showed impairments in cognitive flexibility, information processing speed, planning and problem solving. No significant differences were found regarding ability to learn. Present findings confirm the frontal lobe hypothesis and are consistent with the results of previous studies that revealed significantly impaired executive cognitive functions in recently detoxicated alcoholics. ","2654":"Cognitive impairment is the hallmark of progressive neurodegenerative process observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Acetylcholine (Ach) deficiency is considered to be one of major factors underlying cognitive dysfunction in AD. Several lines of evidence suggest that sigma receptor ligands can elevate Ach extracellular levels in prefrontal cortex rat brain. Since all selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) show affinity for sigma receptors, it has been assumed that fluoxetine could improve cognition in AD. The aim of study was to investigate the effects of fluoxetine on learning and memory processes in experimental model of AD in rats. Experiments were carried out on adult male Wistar rats divided into three major groups: intact control, sham-operated and nucleus basalis-lesioned rats. Bilateral electrolytic lesions of nucleus basalis Meynert (NBM) (experimental model of AD) were made by 1 mA direct current passed through unipolar electrode for 30 sec. The behavioural test (active avoidance) was performed after recovery period of 10 days from the lesion. The effects of several doses of fluoxetine (3, 5 and 10 mg\/kg) on these processes were investigated after 7 days of administration. The results showed that lesion of NBM in rats markedly impaired learning and memory processes compared with controls (intact and sham). Fluoxetine in 5 mg\/kg daily doses significantly improved (p&lt;0.05) these processes in lesioned animals. These findings suggest that fluoxetine could be useful as symptomatic therapy in the treatment of AD.","2655":"The objective of this review is to provide general facts and data regarding Slovenian suicides. Recent data shows Slovenia having a suicide rate of around 30, which places it among the highest rates in the world. The review examined Slovenian suicides both apart from and in comparison to world data and trends. Historical suicide statistics are dealt with, including an evaluation of data collected during the Yugoslavian years in contrast with data collected following the independence of Slovenia in 1991. The discussion includes an assessment of suicide rates throughout Europe and possible explanations for various trends in these rates, including potential economic, genetic, and alcohol-related causes. Furthermore the variations in suicide rates throughout Slovenian municipalities are discussed. Both unique aspects of Slovenian suicide (such as a high proportion of hangings) and commonalities with world data are reviewed. Suicide in Slovenia is a considerable public mental health problem and in order to prevent it, we must first thoroughly understand its characteristics in time and space.","2656":"","2657":"The psychosomatic department is the first institution of this kind in Upper-Austria.

This importance has not been mirrored, however, in the daily life of hospital patients. A well-proven model of co-operation between psychiatric\/ psychosomatic departments and other medical departments are the so-called consiliar\/ liaison services. These have been developed in psychiatry and represent an especially close type of co-operation going beyond the classical and generally known counselling model. The following article gives a general overview of this form of co-operation with special consideration given to the situation in Austria. Questions concerning fields of duty, needs and the efficiency of C\/L services are elaborated in the selection of areas of special emphasis. As examples, results of a few empirical studies will be illustrated which in many respects give encouragement to increasingly implement this form of applied psychsomatics in our hospitals.","2659":"At present, pain is conceptualized as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience, including biological and psychosocial components. Thus, the classical distinction of somatogenic and psychogenic pain is heuristically no longer useful. For the understanding of the development and chronification of pain, the identification of predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating factors are of value. Biological, psychological and sociocultural aspects should be considerd for the diagnostic procedure and the treatment of pain patients. As this, a multidisciplinary pain management can be conceptualized as a stepwise approach of increasing treatment complexity, including different health professions (physician, psychologist\/psychotherapist, nurses, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, social worker) and various settings (consultation-liaison(C\/L)-services, outpatient pain clinics, day hospitals, inpatient wards). The efficacy of an multidisciplinary pain treatment has been clearly demonstrated by numerous studies during the last years.","2660":"The diagnostic process of psychosomatic patients finally arriving at an indication for psychotherapy is an important point of reference in the present discussion concerning the introduction of special clinics for psychosomatic patients in Austria: equippment of such clinics and standards for the personnel has to relate to the needs of these patients.

The emotional, economic, and societal costs of suicidal behavior are enormous, making identification of ways to predict and reduce this risk a high priority public health issue. The gratest risk for suicidal behavior is while in the hospital or within the 6 months subsequent to discharge from the hospital. In schizophrenia, individuals with suicidal behavior are hospitalized significantly more frequently than non-suicidal individuals. Therefore clinicians must increase their assessment of suicidal behavior. Methodical assessment of suicidal ideation and aggressive treatment with psychological, social, and pharmacologic approaches are vital aspects of patient management. Determination of reliable predictors of suicide risk would not only help reduce the mortality associated with suicide attempts but could also permit more rational allocations of resources for treatment and should reduce the emotional and economic burden of this behavior on families and society.

Extensive literature indicates the association between PTSD and other psychiatric disorders. The most frequent disorders associated with PTSD are: depression, anxiety disorder and the abuse of psychoactive substances and alcohol. Some studies show that the depression is the most frequent disorder which follows PTSD. We studied the comorbidity of PTSD and depression in ex-war prisoners and in war veterans five years after the end of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The study sample was divided into two groups. The first group is composed of 100 ex-prisoners of war, and the second one consists of 60 war veterans who were not confined in camps. The questionnaires under the criteria DSM IV were used to diagnose PTSD and depression. All the respondents were males and all of them were in good health before the war.

(1968). Data were compared by correlation analysis and Mann-Whitney U-Test. Ambivalent attachment is highly associated with \"difficult\" and \"slow to warm up\" temperament. There is almost no association between secure attachment and easy children. Avoidance does not seem to be associated with temperament factors. Insecure attached children seem to show temperament disorders and vice versa. This circular process can be stopped by attachment improving programs: improving the attachment may make children \"easy\". Secure attachment may not stand for easy children.
