of bone-implant interface or osseointegration can be assessed by using resonance frequency analysis (RFA), which measures implant stability. A modified implant surface can significantly enhance osseointegration and reduce healing period. Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) consists of fibrin mesh with entrapped platelets and leukocytes that release a huge number of growth factors which contribute to wound healing and tissue regeneration. The present study aims to evaluate the effect of PRF on osseointegration in terms of implant stability. This was a split-mouth randomized clinical trial. Sixty surgical sites were divided randomly into two groups. In Group 1 (thirty sites), PRF was placed in osteotomy sites before implant placement whereas no PRF was placed in Group 2 (thirty sites). Stability was measured using RFA in terms of implant stability quotient (ISQ) at baseline, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months. Intergroup comparison was done using Mann-Whitney U-test. Intragroup comparison was done using Friedman's test followed by pairwise comparison using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. On intergroup comparison, Group 1 showed higher values for ISQ which were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) at 1 week and 1 month. No significant difference (P &gt; 0.05) was found at baseline and 3 months. Intragroup comparison and further pairwise comparison revealed a highly significant difference for values between all pairs of time intervals (P &lt; 0.01) with higher values at 3 months. PRF has a significant effect on osseointegration of dental implants during the early healing period prior to loading. ","1":"","2":"Tooth surface polishing is an integral part of periodontal therapy. Enamel and cementum show a smooth surface clinically after debridement with the naked eye, but numerous surface irregularities can be detected microscopically. Air polishing is safe and effective when used by trained professionals. The aim of the study is to evaluate and compare the surface roughness of cementum by using an air polishing device and conventional root planing with hand instruments. A total of 45 extracted teeth stored in saline were divided into three groups randomly - Group A (conventional root planing), Group B (hand instrumentation and air polishing), and Group C (air polishing alone) - with 15 samples each. Samples were evaluated for surface roughness by using profilometer. Six parameters were checked for surface roughness. The data were collected, charted, and analyzed using one-way ANOVA with post hoc LSD method for pairwise comparisons. Least amount of surface roughness was achieved with Group C when compared with Group A and Group B. These differences were statistical significant (P &lt; 0.0001). Air polishing can effectively smoothen the root surface by removing surface irregularities which are produced hand\/ultrasonic instruments. Profilometer can be effectively used to measure the surface roughness. ","3":"Maxillary permanent canines are the second most frequent cases of impacted teeth; their resolution demands a multidisciplinary evaluation to delineate a viable treatment plan based on the individual esthetic and functional outcomes required. An impacted maxillary permanent canine which was ankylosed in a horizontal position was extracted followed by a regeneration technique, filling the bone defect with biomaterial. An implant was immediately installed in the alveolus of the extracted deciduous canine, and a connective tissue graft was buccally positioned. After the osseointegration period, a modified Palacci and Nowzari surgical technique was performed to gain papilla, and the implant was loaded with an interim restoration with a proper profile to manipulate the soft-tissue contour. Finally, the definitive restauration was cemented achieving the desired outcomes. The achieved clinical outcomes remain stable during a 2-year follow-up. A successful management of this challenge esthetic case lies in the details at surgical and prosthetic phases based in biological response of the peri-implant tissues.","4":"The pathogenesis of periodontal disease is governed by a multitude of factors ranging from the macroscopic to the microscopic scale. Among the factors that constitute the etiological agents of the disease, a major element is the role played by the body's metabolome-i.e., the complete collection of microscopic molecules and metabolic products of cells and tissues in the body. Being of a regulatory nature, the interplay of these molecules exerts a considerable effect on the development as well as the progression of disease, which differs in each individual based on their phenotype. Exploring this connection and application into the field of diagnostic as well as prediction of risk for periodontitis will ultimately result in a personalized standard of care for patients in the future.","5":"The mucogingival junction (MGJ) is one of the important anatomical entities which mark the apical termination of attached gingiva, except that at palatal side. Its position is genetically determined like other organs and tissues in our body. There are certain anatomic aberrations such as abnormal teeth eruption or high frenal attachments and pathologies, such as periodontitis, leading to its absence. There are no studies on the prevalence of teeth having no clinically detectable MGJ. There is a resurgence of importance of attached gingiva, reflected by the definite presence of MGJ, through the field of dental implantology. We aim to evaluate the prevalence of teeth without clinically detectable MGJ on the buccal aspect of dentate alveolar processes. This cross-sectional observational clinical study was conducted in the department of periodontology which was approved by the institutional ethical committee. Periodontally healthy as well as diseased patients of age 18-50 years were included in the study. The detection of MGJ was carried out by visual method, tension test, rolling probe method, and Lugol's iodine solution, and confirmation from any two methods was considered for the absence of MGJ. The etiology of MGJ absence (gingival recession, pocket till MGJ, trauma, abnormal frenal attachment, malposition of tooth, abnormal habits, severe abrasion, etc.,) was also evaluated. Simple statistics in the form of averages and percentages were used for calculations. A total of 130 subjects (3637 teeth) were examined out of which 32 (24.6%) subjects showed no clinically detectable MGJ. In all subjects, on an average, every subject has 28 teeth and out of the total 3637 teeth analyzed, only 91 (2.5%) teeth were without detectable MGJ. Almost 25% of the population may show a tooth or few teeth without a clinically detectable MGJ. The prevalence of teeth without clinically detectable MGJ per mouth is very low at 0.7 (approximately 1 tooth\/subject). ","6":"","7":null,"8":"The development and progression of periodontal diseases is a result of the dynamic interaction of microorganisms within their habitat, and changes in this habitat generate a dysbiotic state. Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia are bridging microorganisms between the pioneer communities and other microorganisms responsible for periodontitis such as Porphyromonas gingivalis. Tetracycline hydrochloride (TTC-HCl) is commonly used as a coadjutant in periodontal treatment in the form of an antiseptic. However, there are no clear dilution or concentration protocols. This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of TTC-HCl diluted in sterile water, saline solution, and 2% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:80,000 at concentration of 125, 250, and 500 mg, at three time points- 30, 60, and 120 s - on P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, and P. gingivalis using the Kelsey-Maurer technique. The antimicrobial activity of TTC-HCl was evaluated at the proposed concentrations and times, dissolved in the different vehicles at pH 1.9 and 7.0, on F. nucleatum, P. intermedia, and P. gingivalis. The Kelsey-Maurer test was used to verify the presence or absence of colony-forming units. Each test was performed in triplicates with its respective viability controls. Inhibition of F. nucleatum, P. intermedia, and P. gingivalis was achieved with TTC-HCl at all concentrations, dissolved in distilled water, saline solution, and 2% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:80,000 for all times. The results show that TTC-HCl is a good antimicrobial alternative against F. nucleatum, P. intermedia, and P. gingivalis regardless of the vehicle in which it was dissolved, concentration, pH, or time used in this investigation. ","9":"Autogenous bone block graft is the gold standard technique for alveolar bone augmentation. However, it is technique sensitive and associated with several complications. Exposure of block graft can affect the outcome of surgery and is challenging to manage. A patient diagnosed with Seibert Class III residual alveolar ridge was managed with autogenous bone block graft. Two dental implants were placed after obtaining sufficient ridge augmentation. The patient presented with exposure of bone block graft after implant placement. A full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap was elevated. Exposed bone was shaved and contoured using piezosurgery. A connective tissue graft with epithelial striation from palate was employed to cover the exposed graft and augment the keratinized tissue. Treatment resulted in complete coverage of block graft and gain in keratinized mucosal dimensions. Prosthetic rehabilitation using screw-retained 3 Unit Bridge was delivered. The results are sustained after 2 years, and the patient is being followed up.","10":"This study was carried out to investigate the effectiveness of subgingival irrigation with propolis extract compared to chlorhexidine as an adjunct to mechanical debridement to bring out the restoration of periodontal health in patients with chronic periodontitis. Twenty subjects were selected and randomly assigned into two groups of ten subjects each, which received subgingival irrigation with 0.2% chlorhexidine (control group) and propolis extract (test group) after initial scaling and root planing on the 7th day and 15th day as an adjunctive treatment. Plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), and probing pocket depth (PPD) were assessed at baseline, on the 15th day, and on the 30th day. Microbial analysis for the colony-forming unit (CFU) was done at baseline and on the 30th day. Statistically significant reduction was observed in PI, GI, PPD, and CFU counts from baseline to 30 days in both the groups. On intergroup comparison, the group received irrigation with chlorhexidine showed slightly better results; however, this difference was statistically nonsignificant compared to the group that received irrigation with propolis. It was concluded that propolis extract is as effective as chlorhexidine as a subgingival irrigant in reducing the subgingival plaque formation and microbiota from periodontal pockets. ","11":null,"12":"This 5-year prospective survival analysis study aimed to examine the prognostic validity of a periodontal prognostic score specific for diseased molars: Miller-McEntire Periodontal Prognostic Index (MMPPI). One thousand and twenty-three molars were evaluated from 129 patients. The MMPPI scoring factors included age, smoking, diabetes, probing depth, mobility, molar type, and furcation involvement. MMPPI was computed as the sum of scores for all seven prognostic factors. Appropriate periodontal treatment and supportive periodontal therapy were provided. All patients were evaluated at baseline and annually posttreatment up to 5 years. Hazard risk ratios (HR) were computed for each prognostic factor, MMPPI scores assigned. The MMPPI score were then analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. A total of 31\/1023 (0.3%) molars were extracted over the 5-year follow-up duration. Significant and positive hazard risk ratio (HR = 1.9) was noted for the total MMPPI score, validating its prognostic value for molar survival at 5 years prospectively. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed a significantly lower probability of molar survival with increasing MMPPI scores, where total score &gt;8 showed worse survival probability over time. The hazard risk ratio was significant for individual prognostic factors: mobility (HR = 1.63), smoking (HR = 1.61), diabetes mellitus (DM) (HR = 1.4), molar type (1.97), and furcation involvement (2.22). The findings of the current study demonstrate significant prognostic validity of MMPPI scores for molar loss for 5 years, and a score &gt;8 showed markedly worse molar survival probability in a well-maintained, university-based, prospective cohort. Mobility, smoking, DM, molar type, and furcation were component factors that were significant individual predictors. ","13":"Fibrosarcoma (FS) is a malignant neoplasm of mesenchymal cells with no specific line of differentiation. Histologically, it mimics the wide spectrum of benign and malignant spindle cell neoplasms creating diagnostic conundrum. Immunohistochemistry plays a crucial role in the diagnosis which relies on various antibodies reacting with different antigens expressed by heterogeneous cells. Thus, there is a need to study the origin of the spindle cells to better comprehend their immunophenotypes that forms cornerstone for final confirmatory diagnosis. This case report describes the case of a 42-year-old male with soft-tissue mass in the mandible. Initial biopsy revealed it a reactive fibrous lesion; however, deeper biopsy confirmed spindle cell malignancy which exhibited immunonegativity to all other markers except vimentin. In addition, this case highlights the origin of various spindle cells with markers expressed during their development. The differential diagnosis of FS from other benign and malignant spindle cell lesions on the basis of clinical, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry is also elaborated.","14":"The long-term safety of xenografts and their potential association with disease are valid concerns. Bovine bone substitutes which are by far the most commonly used xenografts in dentistry are not biodegradable. The aim of the present report was to raise awareness on the long-term risks of the bovine-derived xenografts. Patients who experienced clinical complications after xenografting are reported. Patients' demographic, significant medical, and dental findings are reported. Complications included migration\/encapsulation\/displacement of the graft material, chronic inflammation, and soft-tissue disturbances\/fenestrations. Albeit some xenograft complications are not significant enough to compromise the initial outcomes achieved, the xenografted particles seemed to be left intact favoring conditions for migration.

The intact\/migrated bovine bone particles present a risk to patients and may contribute to long-term clinical complications in implant dentistry.","15":null,"16":"The ultimate goal of furcation defect therapy is furcation closure via periodontal regeneration. However, the process of periodontal regeneration is affected by the regenerative environment of signaling molecules and growth factors due to which consistent findings of complete furcation closure could not be attained. In this study, we have evaluated the use of concentrated growth factor (CGF) which provides sustained release growth factors in conjunction with bovine-derived xenograft anorganic bovine bone (ABB) in guided tissue regeneration (GTR) of Degree II mandibular molar furcation defect. Twenty patients with Degree II mandibular molar furcation defects were selected for the study. Each group consisted of 10 patients and a total of 10 sites were treated in each group. The control sites were treated with GTR and ABB, while the experimental sites received CGF mixed with ABB along with GTR. Clinical parameters recorded were Plaque Index, Gingival Index, vertical probing depth, and horizontal probing depth measured at baseline and 6 months. Radiographic parameters such as the vertical height of defect, horizontal depth of defect, and percentage of vertical and horizontal bone fill were recorded at baseline and 6 months. All the parameters recorded showed a significant reduction from baseline to 6 months in both the groups. Significantly higher vertical and horizontal bone fill was observed in the experimental group as compared to the control group. The use of CGF showed a positive additive efficacy in enhancing the events of periodontal regeneration in the treatment of Degree II mandibular molar furcation defect. ","17":"Excessive gingival display can be an esthetic concern for the patient. Conventional lip repositioning provides a conservative surgical option with less patient morbidity. The unified technique is a modification of conventional lip repositioning technique using the orthodontic brackets as anchorage to provide better soft-tissue closure with the lesser chances of relapse. This technique has been modified to be less invasive with better results. In this case report, patients undergoing orthodontic treatment with short upper lip were recommended for the surgical lip repositioning to reduce excess gingival display. Cases were treated with conventional lip repositioning technique and with unified lip repositioning technique, and after evaluation, comparison was done postoperatively. The unified lip repositioning technique showed better results with a significant decrease of gingival appearance and more patient compliance. Thus, in patients with short upper lip, unified lip repositioning technique can be a viable conservative treatment option.","18":"Complete tooth wear dentition is multifactorial and has challenges with diagnosis and etiology. Their rehabilitation often requires orthognathic surgery, orthodontics, periodontal surgery, and prosthodontic guidelines for occlusion with harmonious facial and dental esthetics. A patient needs a multidisciplinary approach with systematic analysis to formulate evidence-based approach to improve function and esthetics. Contemporary periodontal therapy also encompasses esthetic treatment where needs are frequently associated with changes in tooth size, shape, proportion, and balance that can adversely affect smile appearance. The article provides an evidence-based guideline for reconstruction of a worn dentition. The completed work includes crown lengthening, provisionalization, socket shield technique, oral implants, and gain in lost vertical dimension with occlusion correction and minimally invasive prosthetic restorations.","19":"This clinical case describes the longitudinal outcome of a radisected upper molar root. The palatal root acted as an abutment and was finalized with a double-premolar-shaped metal-resin crown with two rests on the adjacent teeth. Fifteen years later, the root and its crown were still in place, with no pathologic pocket probing depth and lack of inflammation; the tooth was still in function with no signs of periodontal breakdown. This therapeutic option seemed to have been biologically respectful and maintains the possibility to provide future implant therapy.","20":"It is often documented that chronic irritation could be an etiology of oral cancer; yet out of negligence little heed is paid to any sort of discomfort until it grows to a sizable mass where it is difficult to go unnoticed. Intraorally, the source of irritation could vary from a jagged tooth edge to a chronic cheek bite. Furthermore, the removable prosthesis and orthodontic appliances can lead to alteration of the oral mucosal tissue. This case report represents one such sequelae of an ill-fitting dental prosthesis. Surprisingly and unfortunately, the broken denture was still in use by the patient until the damage caused by it could no further be ignored, it is then that the patient sought medical help. A histopathological diagnosis of reparative giant cell granuloma was made, and the patient was treated by successful excision of the same.","21":"Illness perception is the cognitive representation of an illness, which determines how a person responds to it. The Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R) assesses seven components of illness representation in various chronic diseases, but queries prevail about its factor structure. The study assesses the components of illness representation in patients with chronic periodontitis. A total of 625 voluntary, consecutive dental patients with a clinical diagnosis of periodontitis were recruited into the study. The Hindi version of IPQ-R was used, consisting of three parts-identity scale, structured scale, and perceived causes of the patient's ailment. Of the 625 participants, 44.0% reported cyclical disease pattern, 30.4% said their disease was a mystery. Only 1.6% predicted it to remain throughout their life. A total of 44.0% of participants reported the disease to impact their day-to-day life severely. A significant difference was observed between males and females across seven components of IPQ-R. While 21.6% of participants attributed stress to be a major cause for their diseased state, 20.8% reported workload to be a major cause, but 42.4% attributed poor medical care in the past to be a major cause for their state. A sensible approach to treating a disease is to measure the patient's illness perception and target specific interventions accordingly. It would be cost-effective and break misconceptions about diseases in patients, ultimately providing them with better overall health and satisfaction.

This study aimed to compare the microbiological effects of VCO with palm oil (PO) pulling when used as an adjunctive oral hygiene care. Thirty-six volunteers with gingival inflammation were randomly assigned to start with (1) VCO (test) and (2) PO (control) interventions in a crossover design. Oil pulling was performed for 28 days adjunctively to oral hygiene routine. After a 21-day wash-out period, the participants switched the oil type and restarted the protocol. Plaque samples were collected for microbial culture at baseline, after the first oil pulling period, after washout, and after the second oil pulling period. The total, aerobic, and anaerobic bacteria and Mutans streptococci (MS) counts were recorded. The mean differences between VCO and PO were compared by paired t-test. The number of total, aerobic, or anaerobic bacteria after 28 days of oil pulling was not significantly different from baseline in both PO and VCO groups. However, PO pulling demonstrated a significant reduction from baseline of MS count (P = 0.010), while VCO pulling showed no significant reduction. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean changes of any microbiological parameters between the two treatments. VCO pulling did not show statistically significant superior benefit against plaque bacteria over PO pulling. Using PO pulling as an adjunctive oral hygiene care may reduce the number of MS, but this requires further investigations. ","24":"Around the world, an increasing number of people are turning towards nature by using the natural herbal products not only because they are inexpensive but also for better cultural acceptability, better compatibility with the human body and minimal side effects. This study assessed the effectiveness of liquorice (root extract) mouth rinse against dental plaque and gingivitis and compared it with 0.2% chlorhexidine (CHX) gluconate mouth rinse. A double-blind, concurrent parallel randomized controlled clinical trial (CTRI\/2016\/09\/007311) of four months duration was conducted. Forty-four volunteers who met the inclusion criteria were randomized into two groups through the computer-generated random sequence. Based on in vitro minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericidal concentration evaluations on periodontal pathogens, a concentration of 20% (w\/v) of aqueous liquorice root extract mouth rinse was prepared. Both the groups were asked to rinse with their respective mouthwash twice daily for 15 days. Gingivitis was evaluated using gingival index (GI), and dental plaque was evaluated using the Turesky modification of the Quigely Hein Plaque Index (PI). The evaluation was carried out at day zero, 8th and 23rd (15 days after intervention). Intra- and intergroup comparisons of indices for both the arms were done using the paired sample t-test and unpaired t-test, respectively. There was a statistically significant (P = 0.000) reduction in mean PI and GI scores for both the groups after a follow up of 15 days. The intergroup comparison of plaque and gingival index scores for both the mouth rinse groups came out to be statistically significant (P = 0.000). Both liquorice and CHX gluconate mouth rinse restricted plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation. Considering the established side effects of long-term use of chemical formulations, the herbal mouth rinse preparation can promise to be an effective self-care therapy.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the ROM levels in plasma, saliva, and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) in generalized chronic periodontitis (GCP) patients before and after nonsurgical periodontal treatment. Two groups were included in this study. Group I consisted of 30 healthy controls (C) and Group II consisted of 30 subjects with GCP. Plaque index (PI), papillary bleeding index, Probing Depth (PD), and clinical attachment level were recorded. GCF, saliva, and plasma samples were collected from both groups. ROM levels were assessed. A baseline comparison was made between the two groups. Nonsurgical periodontal treatment was carried out for Group II subjects. Two months posttreatment, the clinical parameters and ROM levels in GCF, saliva, and plasma were reassessed in Group II, and the data were compared with their baseline values. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS 20 software and results were derived. Two months posttreatment, Group II exhibited significant reduction in ROM levels in plasma, saliva, and GCF with significant decrease in PI, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment loss. Thus, significant oxidative stress may occur in chronic periodontitis and nonsurgical periodontal therapy may be regarded as an effective treatment modality to treat the diseased periodontium, thereby preventing possible systemic diseases in future.

Blood collection of a healthy individual was collected with an amount of 300 mL and divided into 30 tubes containing 10 mL each one. The samples were divided into three groups, according to the g-force protocols: (1) F200 g: (2) F400 g; (3) F800 g. Membranes of each g-force group were divided into subgroups, according to waiting time after centrifugation: (T0) immediate use and (T30) use after 30 min. Considering these intervals of time, the concentrate was removed from tubes and inserted in a PRF metallic box to confection of the membrane. The PRF membranes were submitted to mechanical tension on a universal testing machine and obtained to a resistance force of each membrane. The centrifugation time showed no statistically significant difference for membrane resistance for any force applied (P &gt; 0.05; Student's t-test). For T0 group results demonstrated no influence for membrane resistance (P = 0.357; Student's t-test), therefore T30 showed statistically significant difference (P = 0.040; Student's t-test) for membrane resistance for centrifugation forces applied, with highest value when applied greatest force. The findings suggest that the waiting time for centrifugation could be determined according to demand of application, and for immediate use of the membrane, the centrifugation did not influence the resistance, on the other hand, after 30 min, the application of higher force resulted in a membrane with considerable resistance.","30":null,"31":"Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is being extensively studied in the field of periodontics as a noninvasive technique to achieve better results after nonsurgical and surgical therapy. However, there is a lack of definitive guidelines for the use of LLLT to promote gingival and periodontal wound healing. The primary objective of this systematic review was to critically analyze the studies evaluating the effect of low-level diode laser on human gingival fibroblasts in vitro and to develop wavelength-specific guidelines for photobiomodulation of human gingival fibroblasts. A thorough electronic and manual search was conducted for relevant articles published until December 2019. Nine studies were included in the review after the initial screening of 1334 articles. Our data analysis revealed that LLLT with diode laser stimulates human gingival fibroblasts as there was the increase in cell viability, proliferation, migration, and protein synthesis in irradiated cells. The diode lasers in the 600-700 nm spectrum were effective in the 10 mW to 30 mW power range. Lasers in the 700-800 nm range were effective in the 25-50 mW power range and diode lasers in the 800-900 nm range were effective at a power setting of 10 mW. It was possible to ascertain a suitable power setting for a particular wavelength spectrum, but no other parameters could be defined due to a lack of reporting of details. Hence, the authors have developed guidelines for comprehensive reporting of in-vitro studies to facilitate future research and overcome existing lacunae in knowledge.","32":"","33":"","34":"","35":"Gummy smile is a quite frequently found esthetic alteration characterized by excessive display of gingiva during smiling.

The clinical observation at 1 month postoperatively revealed restoration of natural smile with 1-2 mm of facial gingival display. The outcome seems to suggest that this proposed decision-making process can provide valid treatment options for gummy smile cases.","36":"The architecture around an oral implant pushes the clinicians for an equalization of biological and physiological requirements. An esthetic implant-supported restoration needs plethora of knowledge and expertise. Surgeon skills can be of use for correct tridimensional position of implant in the extraction socket, shaped abutment contours, and anatomical final crown. An immediate implant placement for a fresh socket requires existing oral parameters judgment and evidence-based treatment plan. They are hard- and soft-tissue relationship, gingival biotype, and the tooth position. In this article, we describe a case of immediate implant placement, provisional crown, bovine bone contraction, soft-tissue collapse, and its management.","37":"Esthetic demands for correction of irregularities of dentition are becoming a prime concern even in patients above the age of 40 years. Severe periodontitis, being insidious, if present simultaneously, complicates the situation. Periodontally compromised adult patients requiring the treatment for malaligned teeth are encountered very frequently in daily practice, and the correction of these requires a combined perio-ortho interdisciplinary approach. The present case report deals with a 5-year follow-up of a case whose prime concern was rotated anterior teeth in the maxillary arch. However, along with this, severe periodontitis was also present. Open flap debridement along with osseous grafting was done wherever required, followed by fixed adjunctive orthodontic treatment. After the completion of orthodontic treatment, a fixed retainer in the form of splinting was given and the entire treatment met the esthetic along with functional demands of the patient. Early 6 months followed by yearly follow-ups reflected clinical and radiographic improvements in the dentition.","38":"Granular cell tumor (GCT) of the oral cavity is rare and so is the involvement of the eye, orbit, and ocular adnexa. A 65-year-old male developed a posttraumatic ulceroproliferative mass over his left cheek for the past 1 year. The mass involved the periorbital region with accompanying blood-stained purulent discharge from multiple sinus tracts over this lesion for the past 6 months. Radiographs of the orbit suggested chronic osteomyelitis. The lesion was not responsive to treatment with antibiotics. Enlarged submandibular lymph node demonstrated reactive lymphadenitis on cytological examination. However, computed tomography scan of the paranasal sinus (PNS) revealed possibly a malignant mass extending into the maxillary sinus and left extraconal space. Surprisingly, histopathological examination and immunohistochemistry from a growth involving the left upper retromolar region that extended up to the midline and periorbital region suggested a diagnosis of GCT. This unusual and new presentation of GCT is not well known to the dentists and also to the ophthalmologists. It is imperative to examine anatomically neighboring structures, especially the eye, nasal cavity, PNSs, and oval cavity among other structures in an underlying pathology in either of these sites.","39":null,"40":null,"41":"Probiotics catch more attention as adjunctive periodontal therapy. This study was conducted to assess the benefit of locally delivered Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) probiotic as an adjunctive to scaling and root planing (SRP) in the treatment of chronic periodontitis clinically and microbiologically. Bacterial cultures and clinical evaluation were recorded in 20 sites of chronic periodontitis in 12 patients and followed up at 3 and 6 months from the start of intervention using clinical attachment level, probing pocket depth, plaque index (PI), bleeding on probing, and microbiologically for Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) load. Patients meeting the inclusion criteria were scheduled within 1 week for two sessions of SRP. After SRP, oral hygiene measures were reassured, and sites were divided randomly into two groups 10 sites each. Group I received SRP only, while Group II received SRP and subgingival delivery of 1 ml of probiotic L. reuteri suspension at baseline and 1, 2, and 4 weeks using a blunt syringe. A periodontal pack was applied after the placement of the drug. We found noticeable variation between the two groups in all evaluation aspects at 3 and 6-month follow-up periods except PI at 6 months in which there was no significant difference between both groups. The results proved the antimicrobial benefit of L. reuteri probiotic as a promising adjunctive therapy in improving periodontal parameters.

A randomized, controlled, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial was conducted among 72 schoolchildren aged 14-15 years. Children were divided into two study groups: Group A with 0.4% Triphala mouthwash (n = 36) and Group B with 0.12% CHX mouthwash (n = 36). The plaque Index (Loe H [1967]), gingival index (Loe H and Silness J [1963]), and microbial analysis were recorded at baseline, 30 days, and 90 days interval. Statistical analysis was done using unpaired t-test for group-wise comparison and one-way analysis of variance test, followed by Tukey's post hoc test for intragroup comparison. P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The results showed that 0.4% Triphala and 0.12% CHX have similar inhibitory effect on plaque accumulation, gingivitis, and growth of S. mutans, S. sanguinis, and Lactobacilli.

","43":"It is irrefutable that the extraction of teeth inextricably results in definitive changes in the surrounding hard and soft tissues. Recently, Socket-Shield Technique (SST) has been used to keep the buccal two-third of the root intact in the socket. This buccal shield further preserves the periodontium-bundle bone complex and hence preserves the buccal hard and soft tissue. The purpose of the study was to do a statistical comparative analysis of two different types of flapless and graftless techniques using the esthetic (Pink Esthetic Index) and radiological parameters. A total of thirty nonrestorable tooth\/root stumps (vital or nonvital) were selected and randomly allocated to two different groups: control group with immediate conventional implant placement (without SST) (Group C, n = 15) and test group with immediate implant placement using SST (Group S, n = 15). All of the sites received immediate chairside temporaries. All implants were restored either with screw- or cement-retained prostheses 4 months postoperative. Each control and test group was analyzed at two different durations: 15 days after placement of provisional and 15 days after placement of definitive prosthesis. Five parameters of Pink Esthetic Score (PES) were used for esthetic analysis, and digital periapical radiographs were used for radiographic analysis. Within the time frame of the study (15 days postplacement of definitive prosthesis), a statistically significant difference (p &lt; 0.05) was observed between PES of the two techniques. Test group S (mean = 9.07) showed better scores than control group C (mean = 6.87). It was observed that buccal bone was maintained in all the cases of test group S while there was loss of buccal bone in almost all the cases of control group C. Within the limitations of this short-term pilot study, better soft-tissue parameters were observed with SST as compared to a conventional graftless technique whenever a restoration on immediate implant placement is considered.

This study included chronic periodontitis (CP) patients divided into three groups Group I: CKD patients undergoing hemodialysis for less than a year; Group II: CKD patients undergoing hemodialysis for more than a year; and Group III: systemically healthy CP patients. Clinical parameters (bleeding on probing [BOP], probing pocket depth (PPD), and clinical attachment level [CAL]) were recorded at baseline (T0), 1 month (T1), and 3 months after scaling and root planing (SRP) (T2). C-reactive protein (CRP) and transferrin saturation (TSAT) were observed at T0 and at T2. Paired t-test and Chi-square test were applied to find the statistical significance (P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant at 95% confidence interval) between the T0 and T2 time within the groups. Clinical parameters such as PPD and CAL decreased with statistical significance in Group III alone, whereas BOP decreased with statistical significance in all the three groups. The study showed statistically significant reduction of CRP (in Group I and Group III) and TSAT increased with statistical significance in all the three groups after SRP. This suggests that SRP can bring an improvement in the systemic markers in CP patients under hemodialysis. However, we need a longitudinal study with a larger sample size to confirm the results.

The periostin-treated absorbable collagen matrices showed a statistically significant increase in the osteoblast adhesion compared to periostin-treated NcHC on days 2, 5, and 7 (P &lt; 0.001). The osteoblast activity as evaluated by ALP assay showed that there is increased activity in the periostin-treated ACS compared to the periostin-treated NcHC. From the observations of this study, it is evident that Periostin has a significant role in the modulating cellular response of the osteoblast cells. Further, incorporation of periostin into the ACS has been shown to increase the cell viability, proliferation, and adhesion of osteoblast-like Saos-2 cells.

Few systematic reviews (SRs) have reported improved clinical outcomes, while other studies reported significantly better results for the connective tissue graft (CTG). There is still unclear clinical evidence about APC\/PRF use to treat gingival recession (GR) defects. Then, the purpose of this SR was to evaluate the use of APC\/PRF membranes (2nd and 3rd generations) in root coverage (RC) procedures and assess its efficacy as a substitute biomaterial. An electronic search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Central, Web of Science, Google Scholar, BookSC databases, and gray literature.

Nine SRs were included. Only three articles described the technique of APC\/PRF production. Three studies reported unfavorable outcomes using APC, while six reported favorable results and postoperative discomfort reduction. Articles included in this SRs that provided information about APC\/PRF membranes (n = 13) showed no significant difference between APC\/PRF and the control group for the parameters analyzed. This implies that APC\/PRF may be considered a feasible substitute biomaterial for treating GR defects, although the CTG still provides superior outcomes.

In this case report, a 15-year-old female patient with an ongoing orthodontic treatment presented with labially protruded apices of lower anterior teeth and thin overlying soft tissue which caused esthetic and functional concerns. A combined periodontal-orthodontic approach was carried out starting with soft-tissue augmentation using bilaminar technique with sub-epithelial connective tissue graft and single incision access flap, followed by orthodontic repositioning of teeth. The augmented site healed uneventfully, and thick soft-tissue coverage was evident which helped the camouflage of the defect area and allowed for the recommencement of orthodontic treatment. Hence, orthodontic-induced alveolar defects with mucogingival complications can be successfully managed through a multidisciplinary approach with stable results after 1 year.","54":"Oral cavity is habitat for plethora of micro-organism causing various diseases.

Sixty patients were selected and divided into three groups, 20 each: Group A (slowly\/moderately progressing periodontitis), Group B (rapidly progressing periodontitis), and Group C (clinical periodontal health). Plaque index, gingival index, periodontal probing depth (PPD), and clinical attachment level were recorded. GT samples were collected from all 60 patients and MMP-9 expressions were measured using gelatin zymography and western blotting. Levels of active MMP-9 (aMMP-9) and latent MMP-9 (lMMP-9) were significantly high in both Group A (GA) (aMMP-9: 2.05 arbitrary unit [AU]\/lMMP-9: 2.54 AU) and Group B (GB) (aMMP-9: 1.32 AU\/lMMP-9: 1.74 AU) when compared to that of Group C (GC) (aMMP-9: 0.93\/lMMP-9: 1.08 AU). In GA, levels of aMMP-9 showed a significant correlation with PPD values. No other correlations were found. The levels of aMMP-9 and lMMP-9 were increased in both the types of periodontitis when compared with periodontally healthy individuals. A significant correlation was found between PPD and activities of aMMP-9 in slowly\/moderately progressing periodontitis patients. However, further studies are required to confirm these findings. ","65":"Gingiva-derived mesenchymal stem cells (GMSCs) have been identified and characterized from healthy tissues. However, reports on the influence of chronic inflammation on their stemness characteristics are sparse. The present study evaluated the potency and differentiation ability of GMSCs from periodontally healthy GMSC (H-GMSC) and inflamed GMSC (I-GMSC) tissues. Established H-GMSCs and I-GMSCs were evaluated on their potency characteristics, such as morphology, viability, proliferation rate, population doubling time, colony-forming ability, expression of stemness markers, and mesenchymal differentiation potential. H-GMSCs and I-GMSCs exhibited fibroblast-like morphology and showed &gt;95% viability with high proliferation potential and shorter doubling time. H-GMSCs showed fewer and smaller colonies, whereas I-GMSCs exhibited multiple and larger colonies. The evaluation of stemness markers revealed that both H-GMSCs and I-GMSCs were weakly positive for stage-specific embryonic antigen-4, Stro1, and CD105 (Endoglin), strongly positive for CD73 and CD90, and negative for the hematopoietic cell markers, CD34 and CD45. H-GMSCs showed a slightly higher osteogenic potential when compared to I-GMSCs, while I-GMSCs had a higher adipogenic potential than H-GMSCs. The findings showed that the inflammatory environment might have a stimulatory effect on the growth kinetics and ability of colony formation in GMSCs. However, varied osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation was observed between H-GMSCs and I-GMSCs. ","66":"Aim of the present meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of Aloe vera in various forms such as gel, mouthwash, and dentifrice on gingival and plaque index (PI) in comparison to various allopathic products such as chlorhexidine, metformin, chlorine dioxide, fluoridated toothpaste, and alendronate. A comprehensive electronic search was conducted on PubMed\/MEDLINE, GOOGLE SCHOLAR, and HAND SEARCH of reference list of archived articles published till January 2020. Randomized controlled trials were searched comparing the Aloe vera product with other products which used PI and gingival index (GI) to evaluate the outcomes. Finally, nine studies assessing PI and four studies evaluating GI were considered for the meta-analysis. After extracting the information, a risk of bias was estimated. The standardized mean differences (SMDs) and fixed and random effect models were obtained from the mean treatment differences. The estimates of SMD of PI from fixed effects (SMD = 0.271, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.00134-0.407, P &lt; 0.001) and random effects (SMD = 0.288, 95% CI = 0.048-0.529, P = 0.019) were found slightly different, the models showed consistent results yielding positive and significant treatment effects. For GI fixed effects (SMD = 0.27, 95% CI = -0.035-0.575, P = 0.0803, not significant) and random effects (SMD = 0.259, 95% CI = 0.049-0.469, P = 0.016, significant) were found slightly different and positive. However, one model showed significant and another model showed nonsignificant treatment effects. Results from our meta-analyses confirmed the beneficial effects of A. vera in improving the periodontal parameters and hence may be considered as a safe alternative drug delivery agent for the management of periodontal diseases in future.

In addition to the longer duration, there are several drawbacks such as increased predisposition to root resorption, caries, and gingival recession. Thus, clinicians are always on the lookout for better solutions or alternatives. This is where the technique of corticotomy came in. In the present study, two cases where a piezosurgical corticotomy was done for rapid tooth movement have been discussed. The entire treatment duration was about 7-8 months without any relapse or posttreatment complications.","70":"Excessive gingival display (EGD), known as \"gummy smile,\" is a major esthetic hurdle in today's population. The condition occurs due to various etiologies such as skeletal, dentoalveolar, or soft-tissue origin. The treatment modalities range from orthognathic surgery to periodontal plastic procedures. Lip-repositioning surgery (LRS) is a better alternative for the conventional orthognathic surgery and laser-assisted LRS can be a reliable and a less invasive alternative to conventional (scalpel) LRS. The present case describes the successful treatment of a young female exhibiting an EGD caused by hypermobility of the upper lip and was treated with a modified laser-assisted LRS coupled with gingival recontouring. In a study published earlier, a mild recurrence was observed and hence, to overcome the recurrence, a modified technique, by excising a strip of mucosa with an additional 2 mm of tissue along with the muscular attachment rather than scraping, was attempted.","71":"Drug-influenced gingival enlargement (DIGE) and reduced bone support caused by periodontitis are two of the etiologic factors for pathologic tooth migration (PTM). Comprehensive management, including surgical, orthodontic, and prosthodontic treatment, is usually required for recovery from severe DIGE and PTM. An 85-year-old Taiwanese male with a history of hypertension and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (DM) visited our dental department for severe gingival enlargement and spontaneous bleeding. He was diagnosed as having advanced periodontitis and DIGE. Remarkable PTM occurred on the front sextants of his dentition. The patient's DM was gradually controlled, and his calcium channel blocker treatment was substituted with a new regimen for 7 months. One year after nonsurgical periodontal treatment and reinforcing the patient's oral care, both DIGE and PTM were spontaneously resolved without any surgical or orthodontic intervention. We advocate the value of early diagnosis, improving patient's oral hygiene, and meticulous nonsurgical treatment for both DIGE and PTM.","72":"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive hematopoietic malignancy that left untreated or undiagnosed can lead to death within few days. Hence, early diagnosis and appropriate treatment become necessary. Oral manifestations in AML could be the presenting feature or could a part of systemic manifestations. Gingival lesions appear as generalized enlargement with hemorrhagic discoloration with or without spontaneous bleeding. Sometimes, gingival lesions itself could a presenting sign without any other systemic manifesto. We report a similar case which was undiagnosed earlier and the patient came with a complaint of only the gingival swelling.","73":"Gingival recession is associated with dentin hypersensitivity, unesthetic appearance, and carious or noncarious cervical lesions. Orthodontic treatment, gingival thickness (GT), and keratinized tissue width (KTW) play roles in gingival recession etiology. The study is aimed to compare the prevalence of gingival recession in the mandibular incisor region of orthodontically-treated females with untreated controls, and to identify if there is any correlation among the GT, KTW, and gingival recession. A total of 150 Saudi females were enrolled in this study. They were categorized into the treatment group (n = 75) and control group (n = 75). Background characteristics and clinical periodontal parameters including the plaque index, gingival index, GT, KTW, gingival recession length (GRL), and gingival recession width (GRW) were recorded and compared between groups, and any associations were identified. Among the orthodontically-treated females, 31 (41.33%) had at least one mandibular incisor with gingival recession, in contrast to 18 (24%) of the controls. Pearson's correlation analysis indicated a significant positive correlation between the GT and KTW and between the GRL and GRW (P &lt; 0.001). In addition, a significant negative correlation was observed between the KTW and GRL and between the KTW and GRW (P &lt; 0.001). However, no significant correlation was found between the GT and GRL or between the GT and GRW. Our findings indicated that orthodontic treatment is a predisposing factor for the development or progression of gingival recession, particularly in females with a narrow KTW. ","74":"The aim is to compare the clinical efficacy of diode laser and erbium, chromium-doped yttrium, scandium, gallium, and garnet (Er, Cr:YSGG) laser for implant stage 2 recovery procedure. A total of 30 patients who had undergone dental implant placement were included in this study. The subjects were randomly allocated into three groups. Group 1 patients (n = 10) had implant recovery using diode laser, Group 2 (n = 10) implant recovery with Er, Cr:YSGG and conventional scalpel method (n = 10) was the third group. The pain assessment was recorded using visual analog scale (VAS scale), time taken for the procedure, intra-operative bleeding, time taken for healing were recorded for the three groups. Data were tabulated and the results were analyzed using SPSS software version 26. Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare the postoperative analgesic used, postoperative VAS score, the time taken for recovery and time taken for healing between the three study groups. Results were considered to be statistically significant when P &lt; 0.05. Operation duration under Er, Cr:YSGG were much faster than the diode laser, however the results were not statistically significant (P = 0.051). The operation time under Er, Ch: YSGG and laser were faster than the conventional scalpel group (P = 0.000). The time taken for healing was faster in the Er, Cr:YSGG laser group than the diode laser and the scalpel group (P = 0.000). VAS scale at day 0 was higher in the conventional group than the two laser groups (P = 0.000). Considering the advantages of both these laser systems such as less anesthesia, less surgical trauma and faster healing, and post-operative comfort, lasers are an effective tool for implant stage two recovery techniques. However, since diode lasers are more cost effective when compared to Er, Cr:YSGG, diode lasers may meet the clinical needs when compared to hard-tissue lasers.

Coronally advanced flap modifications, namely Zucchelli's technique (ZT) and vestibular incision subperiosteal tunnel access (VISTA), are techniques, recommended in the correction of MGR. The purpose was to comparatively analyze the ZT and VISTA technique reinforced with the platelet-rich fibrin membrane in the management of MGR. This split-mouth, randomized study comprised 16 consenting, systemically healthy participants. The bilateral Miller's multiple class I and II lesions were managed with ZT and VISTA technique and had a follow-up period of 18 months. Gingival thickness (GT), mean percentage of root coverage, and patient-centered outcome scales, including patient comfort score, patient esthetic score, and hypersensitivity score, were the primary outcome measures. Further clinical parameters assessed were gingival index, probing depth, clinical attachment level, and width of keratinized gingiva. Paired t-test and unpaired t-test were used for intragroup comparison and intergroup analysis, respectively. While both the techniques exhibited high root coverage percentage (VISTA: 93.95% and ZT: 96.84%), statistically significant difference was noted with patient esthetic score and surgical mortality score in VISTA. Both ZT and VISTA were effective in terms of root coverage and GT augmentation in MGR management. From the patient's perspective, they preferred VISTA technique over ZT, stating its minimal postoperative morbidity and improved esthetic outcome. Hence, within the limitations of this study, the VISTA technique was found to be a superior alternative compared to that of ZT in MGR management.

It is therefore important to prevent it by taking effective plaque control measures. This research aimed at comparing the anti-plaque and anti-gingivitis effects of green tea (GT), GT plus ginger (GT + G), and chlorhexidine mouthwash (CHX) in children. This was a randomized clinical trial, with a sample size of 60 children between the age group of 10-14 years with plaque and gingivitis. They were randomly allocated in three different groups, depending upon the mouthwash used: Group A (GT mouthwash), Group B (GT plus ginger mouthwash), and Group C (CHX mouthwash). Plaque index and gingival index were recorded at baseline, then at interval of 15 days and 30 days after using mouthwash. The mean gingival score and plaque showed a significant reduction from the baseline among all the three groups when compared with subsequent recall visits (15 days after using mouth-rinse and 30 days after using mouthwash) with P &lt; 0.05. It can be concluded that the results of all three groups are comparable and hence herbal mouthwash can be used effectively as an alternative to CHX and as an adjunct to mechanical plaque control. ","79":"Periodontitis (PDD) is a chronic inflammatory condition by nature which destroys the surrounding tooth structures. Menopause (pre and post) worsens the inflammatory state. Biofluids could serve as sources of biomarkers that could diagnose or indicate the intensity and extent of both conditions. This study aimed to guestimate the various biofluids of neopterin (NP) levels in premenopause (pre-m) and postmenopausal (post-m) women with PDD after initial periodontal therapy (IPT). This was an interventional cross-sectional study. Based on menstrual history, within the age range of 40-60 years, 30 female patients having PDD participated, who were grouped into pre-m and post-m, each group comprised 15 subjects. A biochemical test of NP levels was done at the initial and three months following IPT. Statistics used: Group comparisons and percentage decrement using independent sample t-test and paired t-test for intragroup comparison were done with the version 21, IBM SPSS software. Intragroup NP analysis at different time points showed significant improvement. Intergroup comparison, however, has shown significant improvement in the premenopausal group (Group I) only. Reduced levels of NP were found in pre-m and post-m groups 3 months after IPT, inferring that IPT is a paragon in periodontal therapy and NP might be a good diagnostic marker to detect PDD.

Gingival IF is one of the most common reactive lesions and is usually sessile in nature, and its size is usually not more than 1.5 cm. Complete surgical excision along with the elimination of precipitating\/aggravating factors is the treatment of choice generally adopted by a general dentist without giving due consideration to its size, location, and postoperative sequel.

There have been cases reported where PG was found on extra-gingival sites such as the palate, lips, and tongue. We present the two cases of lobular capillary hemangioma (LCH) on extragingival sites, namely the palate and buccal mucosa, which manifested as a different lesion clinically and histopathological examination was indicative of LCH. The cases reported here show that relatively common pathologies can present on rare or atypical regions inside the oral cavity, and hence, it is imperative for the clinician to consider such lesions while formulating a diagnosis.","91":"Several disorders related to growth and development affect children during their early stages of life.

The study intended to determine if there was a difference in the oral health status of children with visual impairment and normal children and to evaluate the efficacy of the frequently used dental aids. The study population included 90 children, 45 children with visual impairment (study group) with age- and sex-matched 45 normal children (control group). Both the groups were further divided into three intervention subgroups. Subgroup A: manual toothbrushes, Subgroup B: manual toothbrush with medicated mouthwashes, and Subgroup C: powered toothbrushes. For each subject, oral hygiene index simplified (OHIS), Turesky-Gilmore-Glickman modification of the Quigley-Hein Plaque Index (TQPHI), and decayed missing filled teeth (DMFT) indices were recorded at baseline, i.e., before any intervention. This was followed by oral prophylaxis by ultrasonic scaling. The three indices were recorded in 0 (baseline), 30 days (1 month), 90 days (3 months), and 180 days (6 months), respectively. ANOVA test, Chi-square test, and student paired test were used for statistical analysis. The mean TQHPI and OHIS values of mouthwashes at the end of 6 months were 1.01 and 1.60, respectively, which were lower than manual and power brushes. No statistically significant reduction in the DMFT scores with the use of any of the adjuncts was noted.

The objective of this study was to compare the effect of full sulcular flap design versus papilla-sparing flap design on the periodontal parameters in periradicular surgeries. It was a systematic review and meta-analysis. Electronic and manual searches were conducted in multiple databases including PubMed, Dental and Oral Sciences, Cochrane, and CINAHL Plus until May 2019. Initial search yielded 2575 studies with 5 articles meeting the inclusion criteria. The primary outcomes assessed were gingival recession and change in the papilla height. The secondary outcomes evaluated were probing depth, clinical attachment loss, postoperative pain, bleeding, and discomfort. Random-effects model was employed for computation of effect size, and forest plots were made. Out of the five articles that satisfied the inclusion criteria, three were randomized control trials and two were nonrandom trials. No significant differences were found in the gingival recession (P = 0.79), papilla height (P = 0.55), gingival bleeding, and plaque indices. Statistically significant differences in probing depth (P = 0.006) and clinical attachment loss (P = 0.0004) were observed for the two flap designs in probing depth (P = 0.006) and clinical attachment loss (P = 0.0004). The present systematic review and meta-analysis showed that probing depth and attachment loss are affected by the choice of flap design. On the other hand, gingival recession and papilla height are not influenced by the type of incision.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the bone fill efficacy of Morinda citrifolia fruit extract in the periodontal bone defect. This randomized study included twenty patients indicated for periodontal regenerative therapy and were equally divided and assigned into the experimental and control group. Open flap debridement alone was performed in the control group, while placement of extract along with open flap debridement was done in the experimental group. Clinical parameters assessed were gingival index, probing pocket depth, and relative attachment level, and the amount of bone fill was assessed using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) at baseline and at 6-month interval. From the values of clinical parameters, there was a mean reduction in probing pocket and gain in attachment level and a 27.7% increase in bone fill in experimental group as compared to the control group from CBCT analysis. The use of M. citrifolia fruit extract in the intraosseous defect was found to be efficacious in terms of relative attachment level and the amount of bone fill, and it had shown some anti-inflammatory affect.

Concordance among the dentists in figuring out the esthetic outcomes after root coverage procedures is inconsistent. Hence, this study aims to evaluate inter- and intra-examiner reliability of root coverage esthetic scores (RES) between periodontists and nonperiodontists. The study was conducted using twenty baseline and 6-month posttreatment photographs of Miller's Class I and Class II gingival recessions. The participants that constituted ten periodontists and ten nonperiodontists were assembled in the seminar hall to receive training on protocol and procedures for RES by the investigator. All the participants were shown twenty projections of side-by-side baseline and 6-month outcomes of root coverage procedures. Each projection was shown for 30 s during which the participants were made to use RES system to evaluate the surgical outcomes. Periodontists showed the highest reliability in the scores of marginal tissue contour with an overall intraexaminer reliability to be perfect among periodontists. Intraexaminer reliability among nonperiodontists was fair, and gingival margin was the parameter with the highest reliability among them. Interexaminer reliability between periodontists and nonperiodontists showed slight reliability concerning gingival margin, and fair reliability was found for marginal tissue contour, soft-tissue texture, mucogingival junction, and gingival color. Satisfying the esthetic component of gingiva is the duty of every dentist in general and not only the periodontists. Significant variability was found in esthetic scores between the groups, which can probably be attributed to the lack of sufficient knowledge regarding pink esthetics among the nonperiodontists, which needs to be improved.

The aim of the study was to investigate the oral mucosal safety of widely used alcohol- and nonalcohol-based mouth rinses at their recommended doses. The clinical and cytological investigations were carried out by enrolling 120 systemically healthy volunteers fulfilling the inclusion criteria. The volunteers were subjected to a repeated mouth rinse for 60 days to either alcohol-based or alcohol-free mouth rinses at their recommended dosages. A comparative analysis for any clinical adverse response on the oral mucosa and efficacy, i.e., reduction of plaque and gingival index was done at the terminal of the exposure. The studies were also carried out to investigate the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity potential of alcohol-based and alcohol-free mouth rinses in the exposed mucosal cells. The data have been presented in comparative account between alcohol-based and alcohol-free mouth rinses in the volunteers at day 0 and day 60. The cytotoxicity and genotoxicity potential of prescribed doses of alcohol- and alcohol-free mouth rinses have also been evaluated using tetrazolium bromide salt 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide, neutral red uptake, and trypan blue dye, micronucleus and chromosomal aberrations. The study findings reveal no statistically as well as biologically significant adverse responses of both alcohol-based and alcohol-free mouth rinses at clinical and cytological level. Under cytological observation, repeated dose exposure up to 60 days of the mouth rinses (alcohol-based and alcohol-free) used in the study was found to be effective and safe at their prescribed dosages.

The second-stage surgery to uncover the implants may have an effect on the regeneration of papilla and various techniques such as the scalpel, diode laser, and punch technique are used. In the present study, an attempt has been made to evaluate papillary fill levels following three different techniques of second-stage implant surgery. A total of 35 patients with 45 implants (39 single implants and 3 sites with two adjacent implants) were randomly divided into three groups with 15 implants each: second-stage implant surgery with midcrestal incision using scalpel (Group I), with I-shaped incision using scalpel (Group II), and using diode laser (Group III). The mean papillary fill and mean crestal bone loss for all three groups were compared at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months of prosthesis delivery. Complete papilla fill at 6 months was seen in 60% and 73.3% of sites in Group II and Group III, respectively. Bone level contacting implant and adjacent teeth was less in both Groups II and III. Bone level from the contact point to the bone crest was least in Groups II and III. The use of diode laser during second-stage surgery showed maximum papillary fill and minimal crestal bone loss when compared with other two techniques. Irrespective of technique used for second-stage surgery, bone loss did occur after prosthesis delivery. ","115":"Adequate plaque control facilitates good gingival and periodontal health, prevents tooth decay, and preserves oral health. Toothbrushing is the primary method of removing plaque and can be classified into powered and manual toothbrushes. The primary objective was to compare the abrasiveness and surface roughness caused by four different power-driven toothbrushes with a different mode of action, on tooth surfaces in vitro. An in vitro experiment was conducted on eighty freshly extracted tooth specimens which were equally divided into four groups. Each group was brushed with the specifically assigned electric toothbrush to that group, but keeping parameters such as force applied during brushing, storage of tooth before and after brushing, and toothbrushing time same. A total of the 2-month study was done on each tooth specimen. Tooth surface roughness was recorded before and after the toothbrushing experiment to check the difference between surface roughness readings. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis was done afterward to analyse the surface topography of each group specimens. Paired t-test used for intergroup analysis and intragroup analysis was done using Kruskal-Wallis test. After comparing the baseline and final readings of each group, it has been found that the mean difference between values is highly significant in Group 1 (rotary\/oscillatory). The mean rank of Group 1 was least in all four groups, which showed the highest tooth surface abrasion in that group. SEM analysis also revealed that Group 1 tooth specimens had deeper scratches\/lines comparatively to other groups. Rotary\/oscillatory toothbrush caused the highest tooth surface abrasion when compared with other electronic toothbrushes.

Hence, its degradation is regarded as the main marker of periodontal disease progression. The aim of this study is to analyze and compare collagen fibers, their birefringence pattern in healthy and in diseased gingival tissues stained using picrosirius red stain (PRS) and the polarizing microscope. A total of 90 participants screened were divided into the control group (healthy gingiva) and experimental group (moderate periodontitis and severe periodontitis) based on the clinical parameters. Gingival tissue sections were stained with PRS and observed under the polarized microscope to assess the type of collagen fibers in healthy and diseased gingival tissue. Statistical analysis was performed using the one-way ANOVA and Tukey multiple comparison test. The healthy group revealed well-packed collagen in a parallel pattern with a strong birefringence, whereas in severe periodontitis group showed loosely packed collagen fibers in a haphazard pattern suggestive of severe destruction of the extracellular matrix. The moderate periodontitis group had a blended mixture of thick and thin fibers. Collagen fibers showed birefringence property when stained with PRS that helps in a better understanding of normal and pathological conditions. ","117":"At the 2017 World Workshop on the Classification of Periodontal and Peri-Implant Diseases and Conditions, periodontitis was reclassified according to a multidimensional staging and grading system. Grading takes variabilities in the rate of disease progression into account, relying on recognized progression risk factors, and is based on the assessment of bone loss at the worst-affected tooth in the dentition as a function of age, which is then modified by factors such as smoking and diabetes mellitus. In this context, the aim of this study was to determine whether there are correlations between radiographically calculated grades and grades modified by the presence of smoking or diabetes. In this descriptive study, individuals diagnosed with periodontitis according to the 2017 classifications were examined. The grade of periodontitis was measured using periapical radiography. A modified-grade level was assigned to the patients according to their glycated hemoglobin levels (in diabetics) or their smoking status. The study included 341 individuals. No statistically significant relationship was revealed by Chi-square testing (P &gt; 0.05) or in the kappa agreement index between the modified grades and the radiographic grades. Although there was no correlation between radiographic grade and modified grade in smokers and diabetic individuals, increasing the grade score in these individuals in accordance with the 2017 classification provides clinicians the opportunity to develop a risk-based treatment plan, commensurate with the severity of periodontal disease and the level of risk.

The explored literature from 22 studies shows that oral health parameters of oral health and levels of oral inflammatory markers were deranged and exaggerated in patients suffering from AD and dementia. Many studies have observed poor oral hygiene as result of lack or irregularity in toothbrushing. Regarding decayed, missing, and filled teeth status in AD\/dementia populations, no significant difference is reported. Periodontal diseases have been noted at raised levels in AD and dementia patients and shown progression with aggravation in neurological disorders. Both edentulousness and low chewing efficacies are associated with low cognition. Stomatitis and coated tongue and other oral pathologies are significantly higher in AD patients. AD patients have demonstrated higher bacterial load and inflammation levels than controls, and consequently, inflammatory biomarker levels are also raised. AD patients have reduced salivary secretions and with low buffering capacity. Evidence from the current literature update postulates that individuals suffering from AD and dementia have special oral health-care needs. Appropriate oral health management may thus significantly improve their oral health-related and general quality of life.","119":"","120":"","121":"Dentists across the globe are witnessing a completely unforeseen and uncertain professional situation during these times of COVID-19 pandemic.

In this case report, a patient who was treated for denture hyperplasia presented with a post operative complication which led to inadequate vestibular depth. Inadequate vestibule is a common challenge dental surgeons encounter while considering fixed or removable prosthesis and implants. Objective is to achieve acceptable retention and aesthetics for the prosthesis by increasing the vestibular depth and also to manage the complication encountered during the resection procedure. Several techniques have been employed to increase the vestibular depth and the width of attached gingiva in the literature. In this case the denture hypereplasia was resected using diode laser which resulted in bone necrosis and opening of the wound post surgically. This was managed with curettage and PRF application. Following this the patient presented with inadequate vestibular depth. Vestibuloplasty was performed with Diode laser to deepen the vestibular depth and augment keratinized tissue to facilitate prosthetic rehabilitation. Three months following vestibuloplasy, patient presented with adequate vestibule. At six months follow up there was sufficient keratinized tissue to facilitate prosthetic rehabilitation. This case presents a unique way of managing a complication encountered after denture hyperplasia resection followed by vestibuloplasty with diode laser.

The secondary outcome measures comprised clinical attachment level change, gingival thickness variation, width of keratinized tissue alteration, and postoperative healing. At 1 year postoperative, 80% of the treated sites achieved 100% root coverage. Based on clinical results, saddle flap technique could be considered as one of the possible treatment options for isolated gingival recession with good esthetic and patient satisfaction.","158":"The alveolar cleft is a bone-related developmental defect in the alveolar process of the maxillae, which is termed as cleft alveolus. The deformity occurs in 75% of the cleft palate and lip patients. Reconstructive surgery can provide both functional and esthetic benefits to such individuals. Conflicting opinions exist on the management of alveolar cleft, and these affect the treatment planning. We present the case of a 19-year-old female patient with a complaint of mobile teeth in the left frontal region of the upper jaw. On clinical examination, unilateral cleft alveolus was observed between the left lateral incisor and the canine region. A multidisciplinary approach was adopted, orthodontic treatment was started, and periodontal regenerative surgery was planned. This report also discusses the substitution of autogenous bone grafts with other materials such as allogenic grafts (demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft), platelet-rich plasma, platelet-rich fibrin membranes, and amnion membranes, which could serve as a new line of treatment for the condition.","159":"Rehabilitation of the long-standing edentulous posterior maxilla with dental implant poses a unique challenge. This is due to mainly two reasons - pneumatization of the maxillary sinus and atrophy of the alveolar bone. The challenge is intensified when the native bone is around 2-3 mm. This requires vertical bone augmentation in the form of direct sinus lift\/lateral wall sinus lift procedure. The most common complication associated with this procedure is the sinus membrane perforation resulting in unfavorable stabilization of the graft and associated bone regeneration. Simultaneous implant placement becomes all the more difficult in such situations. As a result, of which implant placement has to be deferred resulting in extended treatment duration and multiple surgical appointments. The present case report represents two such sinus membrane perforation repair cases associated with lateral wall osteotomy approach for sinus augmentation with simultaneous implant placement in the posterior maxilla.","160":"Adenomatoid odontogenic tumor (AOT) is benign tumor of the oral cavity characterized by its slow growth accounting to 3%-7% of the odontogenic tumors. AOTs mostly occur in the maxillary anterior region and most often than not associated with impacted anterior teeth. It affects the younger age group, especially below 20 years and is commonly seen in females. It occurs as two main variants - (a) central\/intraosseous which is more common and (b) peripheral which is rare. The location of the lesion, its association with the impacted tooth, is the basis for the classification of AOT. The intraosseous type may be related to unerupted tooth (follicular variant) or may not be related to unerupted tooth (extra-follicular variant). Radiologically, AOT presents predominantly as a unilocular cystic lesion enclosing the unerupted tooth. The lesion presents rarely with a cystic component. Radiopacities on the intraoral periapical radiograph are seen as discrete foci having a flocculent pattern within radiolucency even with the presence of minimal calcified deposits. AOT being benign in nature is enucleated with least chances of recurrence. Here, we present a rare case of extra-follicular variant of adenomatoid odontogenic tumor in a 19-year-old female patient.","161":"Substance abuse has often associated with high caries, poor periodontal health, and altered functioning of the individual. The substance abuse may be natural or synthetic in origin, both causing deleterious effect on the oral and overall health of the individual. To assess the oral health status and treatment needs of substance abusers attending deaddiction centers in Western Uttar Pradesh. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 220 substance abusers from 6 randomly selected deaddiction centers. The subjects were divided into four groups: Group 1, alcohol (A); Group 2, nicotine (N); Group 3, alcohol + nicotine (AN); and Group 4, other drugs (O). A demographic record along with full-mouth examination was recorded based on the World Health Organization pro forma. The overall results showed that out of the total participants, 144 had oral mucosal lesions. Alcohol group had significantly higher mean community periodontal index code 3 (pockets 4-5 mm) than the other groups (P &lt; 0.05). The prevalence of decayed, missing, filled teeth (DMFT) was 83.33%, and the mean DMFT of the alcohol group was significantly higher than the other combinations group (P &lt; 0.01). The oral health status of substance abusers was poor, with a large number of oral mucosal lesions. The dental caries status and periodontal status were the worst among the alcohol group. ","162":"Implant therapy, in India, has flourished in recent years and is being practiced widely by many dental practitioners today. Along with the increasing number of implants being placed today, there has also been a constant rise in the number of complications associated with it. The aim of this study is to evaluate the knowledge and awareness of implant placement and management of peri-implant diseases among dental professionals. A total of 568 dental practitioners were approached with a questionnaire for collecting data related to demographic details, experience, and knowledge about implant placement and management of its complications. Of these, only 262 were included as part of the statistical analysis. This data collected were compiled and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results showed that most dentists who participated in this study have adequate knowledge about etiological factors and its management. Those who acquired implant skills through sources that are not in accordance with accepted standards had unsatisfactory knowledge and practice behavior. The awareness and knowledge regarding the implant procedures and their complications such as peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis were higher in self-trained dentists and by dentists who are practicing for &gt;10 years and calls for updating of knowledge.

Baseline sensitivity was recorded by the operator using tactile and evaporative stimuli. Visual analog scale (VAS) was used to record the degree of sensitivity perceived by the patients. All the groups received applications of allotted materials on day 1, 7, 14, and 21. After each applications VAS scoring was recorded. On day 30 and 60, only pain evaluation was done to determine the durability of each test materials. One-way ANOVA, repeated measure ANOVA and post hoc test was done for multiple comparison. All the groups showed significant results in reducing DH. Among Groups A and B, Group B showed immediate postoperative result at the end of the 1st week.

Glucosamine sulfate (GS) was proven to have anti-inflammatory actions related to its ability to suppress neutrophil functions. Orthoboon, an anti-arthritic and anti-inflammatory drug, has shown to have a positive therapeutic effect due to its constituents made of a combination of GS, Vitamin C, and collagen. The aim of the study was to evaluate the host modulatory effects of Orthoboon on periodontal status and to estimate the C reactive protein (CRP) levels before and after nonsurgical periodontal therapy (NSPT). A total number of 40 patients with chronic periodontitis were randomly divided into two groups of 20 patients each. The test group patients (n = 20) received 500 mg Orthoboon three times daily for 45 days. Prior to the initiation of Orthoboon, all patients in both test group and control group were subjected to Phase I periodontal therapy. CRP levels were estimated immediately after phase I therapy and 45 days after therapy. Clinical parameters including plaque index, gingival index, and bleeding index were recorded before and after NSPT for the two groups. The mean CRP levels were reduced significantly in the test group before and after administration of Orthoboon and also there were statistically significant differences in the mean CRP levels at the end of 45 days between the test group and the control group. Administration of Orthoboon, i.e., GS, with a combination of Vitamin C and collagen was proved to be of a significant benefit in the test group than in the control group. ","168":"Dental esthetic awareness among patients led the clinicians to introduce newer materials and predictable techniques that satisfy the patients' esthetic demands. To evaluate and compare the efficacy of subepithelial connective tissue graft (SECTG) and acellular dermal matrix (ACDM) allograft in the treatment of Millers Class I or Class II recession with the determination of gingival thickness using an impertinent method, soft tissue cone-beam computed tomography (ST-CBCT). A split-mouth study with a total of ten patients with bilateral Millers class I or class II recession is randomly assigned by a coin toss method as Group I (SECTG) and Group II (ACDM) along with coronally advanced flap. Clinical parameters including recession height (RH), recession width (RW), probing depth, clinical attachment level (CAL), and height of keratinized tissue (HKT) were evaluated at baseline, 90th day, and 180th day for both groups. The thickness of keratinized tissue (TKT) was determined by most reliable, predictable and noninvasive method called ST-CBCT. Statistically significant reduction in RH and RW, gain in CAL, and increase in HKT and TKT in both Group I and Group II were seen in 90th day and 180th day. However, when both Group I and Group II were compared between 0 and 180th day, the change in RH and RW, gain in CAL, and increase in HKT and TKT did not show any statistically significant change. The present study suggested that root coverage with both SECTG and ACDM is very predictable procedure and it is stable for 6 months. ST-CBCT is a newer dimension in periodontal imaging and will certainly aid clinicians in the execution of various treatment modalities with increased predictability. ","169":"For any esthetic treatment planning, the shape and form of gingiva should be a prime factor of concern. The correct identification of gingival phenotype (GP) ensures a firm foundation for future health and prognosis of the treatment indicated. Hence, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the correlation between the GP in the anterior esthetic zone with different types of maloclussion and severity of crowding. A total of 110 periodontally healthy controls were equally divided into two groups depending on the type of malocclusion. They were further divided according to the levels of dental crowding as mild, moderate, and severe. GP was measured on the anterior esthetic teeth using transgingival probing, and width of the attached gingiva (WAG) was measured using histochemical staining method. In severe crowding group, the GP in 12 and 22 region was found to be thick (P = 0.035) while, in 32 and 42 region was thin (P = 0.042). The WAG shows a significant difference between WAG with 23 in severe crowding group with P = 0.042, whereas there was no significant relationship found between the GP with Angle's classification. Within the limitations of the study, it can be concluded that the teeth in the maxillary and mandibular anterior esthetic region showed the thin phenotype. When the severity of crowding increases, the GP and WAG vary depending on the position of the tooth. There is no association between the Angle's classification and the mean GP of the maxillary and mandibular anterior region teeth.

To achieve such accurate implant placement, presurgical evaluation of hard and soft tissue matters the most. Their efforts can be attained using various application programs such as digital imaging, implant planning software, laboratory- or computer-assisted surgical guides, and dynamic navigation approach. To overcome different opinions and choices regarding guided surgery, this article explains an evidence-based literature review to assess its various outcomes and allowing informed choices before using various guided surgical techniques based on its expectation and reality outcomes. This highlights a clinician's choice to guide his successful implant surgery without causing distress in the midway of treatment. An online search was done on PubMed\/Medline database to bring in accuracy to the expertise. This review includes reference of publications from 2000 to 2019, which is related to promising outcomes using computer-assisted static or dynamic navigation system for the placement of implant. Out of these, 809 were related to the computer-guided implant placement. Relevant papers were chosen in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. This review article contemplates to reflect the fact that computer-guided approach is considered to offer more predictable, safer, and faster implant placement with the predetermined final prosthetic outfit. Thus, digital planning and placing of dental implants in the correct position keep escalating to a higher achievement levels than a classical freehand approach. Nevertheless, this guided surgical approach also holds some errors and risks, which must be identified and rectified.","172":"","173":"","174":"Frequently, the clinicians are addressed to decide between the preservation of Grade III furcation molar and the implant replacement, due to the increased access among the population to this therapy over the years and high success rate of the osseointegrated implants. This case series presents clinical and radiographic data collected from 10 patients who underwent 13 root amputations for the treatment of degree Grade III furcation in maxillary molars with follow-up until 16 years. The results showed improvements in probing depth, bleeding on probing, and radiographic aspects. The follow-up time indicates that root amputation is an effective long-term treatment solution, especially when the patient's local, systemic, or financial conditions make it difficult or impossible to implant placement.","175":"Foreign body ingestion although unusual may be possible during dental treatment when placing any implants, prosthetic crowns, restoration, endodontic treatment, or orthodontic treatment. When the ingestion occurs, it is always crucial to locate the foreign body within the patient's body by taking bi-planar radiographs. Any features of airway distress or obstruction should be ruled out and if it is located in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, the nature and size of the material will decide the protocol of retrieval of the ingested object. However, there is always a risk of intestinal perforations or obstructions secondary to the ingestion. Here is a case report wherein there was an accidental ingestion of the paralleling pin during the first stage of the implant placement with indications of various GI investigations and recommendations to avoid instrument ingestion.","176":"Idiopathic gingival overgrowth can present itself as a part of syndrome or as an isolated entity.

Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the knowledge and awareness regarding the association of periodontitis and adverse pregnancy outcomes among the gynecologists practicing in Hubli-Dharwad city. The study involved a survey for 50 practicing gynecologists in Hubli-Dharwad city, a pretested close-ended questionnaire was distributed comprising 10 questions on oral health for expectant mothers, and thus, their knowledge and awareness levels were assessed. The results showed that majority of gynecologists agreed importance of maintaining good general health during pregnancy and supported that providing dental treatment during pregnancy improved the pregnancy outcomes. However, practical implementation and referring patients to dentists were less. The gynecologists were aware of the facts but failed to execute at the clinical level. Thus, this bilateral interdisciplinary protocol can thus reduce the incidence of maternal and neonatal complications.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of fluoride varnish (sodium fluoride [NaF]), diode laser, and the combination of NaF and diode laser in the treatment of dentin hypersensitivity. This was a randomized split-mouth clinical trial. Sixty patients aged 20-60 years suffering from dentin hypersensitivity to air-blast, cold, and tactile stimulation corresponding to 4 cm and above on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) in three quadrants with at least two hypersensitive teeth per quadrant were selected. Hypersensitive teeth were allotted to Group 1 - 5% NaF varnish application alone, Group 2 - 810-nm gallium-aluminum-arsenide laser (GaAlAs) diode laser (0.5 W) irradiation alone, and Group 3 - NaF varnish application, followed by diode laser irradiation. VAS score was recorded at baseline, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. A statistically significant reduction in dentin hypersensitivity was observed in all the three groups, from the baseline to the 1st-, 3rd-, and 6th-month follow-ups (P &lt; 0.05). Group 2 and Group 3 demonstrated a significantly higher reduction (P &lt; 0.05) in dentin hypersensitivity for all the stimuli as opposed to Group 1 at all follow-up intervals.

A randomized double-blind split-mouth design with Clinical Phase-i (aided brushing) and Clinical Phase-ii (unaided brushing) with a washout period of 3 days was conducted. The study duration was for 0-45 days. Two types of brushing that is manual and powered brushing were done. The recording of all clinical and microbial parameters were done on 0th day and 21st day while the clinical parameters were recorded up to 45th day. On intragroup comparison, throughout the study phases, both manual and powered brushing significantly reduced the Quigley-Hein plaque index (48%), gingival bleeding index (GBI) (44%), and modified gingival index (52%). The Pearson correlation between GBI and periodontal pathogens like Prevotella internedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum showed statistically significant relation (P &lt; 0.05) in powered brushing group.

The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the clinical and microbiological effects of Matricaria chamomilla (MTC) mouth rinse with chlorhexidine (CHX) and placebo mouth rinse for the management of chronic periodontitis. This double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, clinical trial involved seventy five patients, suffering from chronic periodontitis, which were randomly divided into three groups: negative control (SRP + placebo), positive control (SRP + 0.12% CHX), and test group (SRP + 1% MTC mouth rinse). Mouth rinsing (adjunctive therapy) was continued for 1 month while clinical parameters (plaque index, gingival index, sulcus bleeding index, probing pocket depth [PPD], clinical attachment level, gingival recession [GR], stain index) and microbial colony forming units were evaluated at base line, 6 weeks, and 3 months. All groups showed a significant change in parameters (except GR for placebo group) between base line and 3 months. MTC mouth rinse suggested added significant benefits over placebo group over the study period. However, it determined more but nonsignificant improvement in PPD (3.68 mm vs. 3.36 mm) and CAL (3.00 mm vs. 2.72 mm) as compared to CHX rinse at 3 months' period as compared to baseline. Advantages of using test group were comparable to CHX associated group; therefore, MTC mouth rinse can be used as an effective adjunct during nonsurgical periodontal therapy for chronic periodontitis.

However, due to its various disadvantages, alternate grafts such as acellular dermal matrix (ADM) grafts have been introduced for recession coverage. The present study compares the clinical outcome of these two grafts in treating Miller's Class I GR. All the 15 patients participated in the study who had totally 30 bilateral Miller's Class I GR were divided randomly into SCTG group and ADM group each containing 15 defects. In the SCTG group, coronally advanced flap (CAF) with SCTG was performed, and in ADM group, CAF with ADM was done. Clinical parameters were measured on the day of surgery (baseline) and after 6 months. Data collected were statistically analyzed using paired and unpaired t-tests. The analysis of the data collected at the baseline and 6 months later showed that there were no statistically significant differences in the recorded clinical parameters such as probing pocket depth, clinical attachment loss, and GR depth. ADM group showed a better color match than the SCTG group, while SCTG group achieved more keratinized tissue width than ADM group. From the outcome of the current study, we can conclude that ADM is an efficient substitute for SCTG for treating Miller's Class I GR.

The bony alterations make oral esthetic implant reconstruction difficult without hard- and soft-tissue augmentation. Placement of bone substitute material and immediate implant were not able to completely establish an esthetic outcome. A novel technique of retaining the buccal aspect of the tooth root during implant placement has shown preservation of esthetics. Hard and soft tissues were preserved in their original form around the replaced tooth. The retained root on the buccal aspect of an oral implant is observed to have formed cementum and to some aspects of osseointegration with the surrounding tissues. It is called socket-shield technique and if completed meticulously can be an alternative for regenerative materials and soft-tissue grafting. In our report, we completed 14 cases of the said technique with 5-year follow-up. The results looked promising as none of the cases required guided bone regeneration procedures.

Oral cavity is the gateway and the mirror of health. This link is often ignored. This lack of understanding of the correlation between oral and systemic health often leads to the poor systemic health because of the poor oral status. The aim of the study was to assess the awareness among the general public about periodontal diseases and its impact on systemic health. A questionnaire with 15 questions including general awareness about periodontitis and its impact on systemic health were given to patients and were asked to select their preferred option of yes, no, and don't know. The awareness of the individuals was categorized based on their educational qualification, age, and gender as well. The results obtained showed increased awareness among females, postgraduates, and 35-50 years group of individuals according to their category of gender, education, and age group, respectively. There is always a strong influence of oral health on systemic well-being. This link among the two is often ignored and overlooked. Oral health upholds the overall well-being of the patient.

The prevalence of periodontal disease among tribal population of Attapady was 87.5% (95% Confidence interval [CI] 78.48, 96.51).73.3% had gingival bleeding and 13.3% had no\/mild periodontitis, The proportion of periodontitis was 84.2% (95% CI 75.5, 92.8). Among chronic perioodntitis subjects 22.8% had moderate periodontitis and 61.4% had severe periodontitis. A significant association was observed between tobacco use (Odds ratio [OR] 5.6, CI 2.99, 10.74), bad oral hygiene habits (OR 4.9, CI 2.64, 9.43), unfavorable oral health beliefs (OR 3.21, CI 1.63, 6.32), and periodontitis. The prevalence of periodontal disease and periodontitis are high among tribal population of Attapady. Unfavorable oral health belief, bad oral hygiene habits, and detrimental habits like tobacco use were the modifiable risk factors identified in this group. ","197":"This randomized single-blinded clinical trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of diode laser and fluoride in the treatment of dentin hypersensitivity (DH) due to gingival recession. Twenty-eight individuals randomly distributed across three groups participated: 10 individuals who were treated with diode laser, nine who were treated with fluoride, and nine who received placebo. Pain was assessed with the Visual analog scale (VAS). Evaporative stimulus and tactile stimulus were evaluated with the verbal rating scale (VRS). VAS was applied shortly after, 6 h after, 12 h after, and 24 h after the single-session treatment for DH, whereas VRS was applied shortly after, 15 min and 7 days after the treatment. Participants' quality of life was assessed with the validated Brazilian version of the Dentine Hypersensitivity Experience Questionnaire assessing functional limitations, coping behaviors, emotional, and social impacts caused by DH. Descriptive statistics and the ANOVA test were used. Values of P &lt; 0.05 were statistically significant. Diode laser significantly reduced the DH to the evaporative stimulus (P = 0.002). The application of fluoride did not change the degree of DH to evaporative and tactile stimuli (P &gt; 0.05). The group of individuals who were treated with diode laser presented a higher reduction in DH (25.4%) when compared to the group of individuals treated with fluoride (17.1%), and the group of individuals among whom placebo had been used (2.9%). Descriptive analysis indicated that the items measuring the emotional and social impacts of DH were those with a more negative impact on the individuals. Therapy with diode laser was more effective in reducing DH than therapy with fluoride. ","198":"Several studies have recommended the use of lasers in treatment of dentinal hypersensitivity. These materials have been used alone or in combination with an active desensitizing agent. The present study aimed to evaluate the use of 1.23% acidulated phosphate fluoride (APF) gel and 810 nm diode laser when used alone and when used together on exposed dentinal tubules. Sixty-one extracted teeth were sectioned with a diamond saw and dentin slices were prepared. They were then treated with 37% orthophosphoric acid to remove the smear layer. One of the 61 sections was left as an untreated control, whereas the remaining sixty sections were divided into three groups of twenty sections each. The first set of sections (Group 1) was treated with laser alone, whereas the second set (Group 2) was treated with APF alone. A third set of sections (Group 3) was treated with a combination of laser and APF. The sectioned teeth were then evaluated using field emission scanning electron microscopy, and the percentage of dentinal tubule occlusion was observed. The Shapiro-Wilk normality test was performed to check for the normal distribution of data, whereas the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the mean percentage of dentinal tubule occlusion between the three groups. The Chi-square test was used to compare the number of images with complete tubular occlusion between the three groups. A total of 96 images were processed from the sixty sectioned samples. It was seen that the sections in Group 3 showed the highest percentage of dentinal tubule occlusion. Group 3 also showed the highest number of samples with complete dentinal tubule occlusion. Significantly lesser levels of dentinal tubule occlusion were seen in Groups 1 and 2. Diode lasers were effective in occluding dentinal tubules. The addition of 1.23% APF significantly increased the efficacy and thoroughness of dentinal tubule occlusion. Significantly lesser levels of dentinal tubule occlusion were seen in the sections treated with laser alone and APF alone. ","199":"Nanoparticles, owing to their smaller size, penetrate regions inaccessible to other delivery systems, such as periodontal pockets. Thus, the present study aimed to comparatively evaluate efficacy of 2% curcumin with nanocarrier and 1% chlorhexidine gel as a local drug delivery (LDD) in the treatment of periodontal pockets. Forty-five chronic periodontitis patients with pocket depth 5-7 mm in two or more teeth were selected. Full-mouth scaling and root planing (SRP) was done for all patients followed by random allocation to the three treatment groups, namely SRP group (Group 1), 2% curcumin with nanogel (Group 2), and 1% chlorhexidine gel (Group 3). Clinical parameter assessment and microbiological analysis of subgingival plaque samples for Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), and Tannerella forsythia (Tf) was done at baseline, 21st day, and 45th day. The results showed that when the two LDD agents were used as an adjunct to SRP in chronic periodontitis, there was an improvement in all clinical parameters. Evaluation of microbiological parameters also showed a significant reduction in Aa, Pg, and Tf levels. Comparison of 2% turmeric extract with a nanocarrier system with 1% chlorhexidine gel showed that both the agents had a comparable antibacterial effect on the three selected periodontopathic bacteria. The present study showed that both the LDD agents showed an effective improvement of clinical and microbiologic parameters. 2% curcumin delivered with a nanocarrier system showed results comparable to chlorhexidine gel and hence shows promising future as an LDD agent in the treatment of periodontal pockets.

A total of 28 patients underwent surgical excision of pyogenic granuloma in the period from September 2014 to May 2016. Two surgical techniques were used to remove pyogenic granuloma: simple excision with root planing and modified excision with deep curettage. Females (54%) were slightly more predominant than males (46%). The upper and lower jaws were almost equally affected by the lesion with more predilection toward the posterior region. The size of the lesion ranged from 0.5 to 3 cm in diameter with slow-growing rate. Rural residents were more affected (57%) than urban people. The lesion appears clinically as a small red mass with sessile base, and these clinical features were similar in pregnant and nonpregnant women. The recurrence rate was 14.8% and seen only in patients treated by simple excision. Histopathological feature was consistent with inflammatory hyperplastic lesion, and there was no radiographic evidence of bone resorption associated with the lesion. Modified excision with deep curettage prevents the recurrence of the lesion after 1-year follow-up.

The aim of the present study is to analysis ergonomic posture among dental students while performing supragingival scaling (SGS) procedure, using the standardized photometric assessment method (SPAM). A total number of 90 students from the third year (III year) to final year (IV year) and internship (Intern) (30 each) were included in the study. All the 90 students were asked to perform SGS procedure and were photographed and analyzed using the current technique. Eight dental ergonomic postures were analyzed in this study and grouped according to the classification system developed for scoring dental ergonomic postures by Garbin et al., in 2011. Analysis of variance test with Bonferroni correction was used to statistically analyze the collected data. The mean index value for III year, IV year and Intern were 2.00, 2.03, and 2.13, respectively, which was not statistically significant (P = 0.709). Analysis of the dental students using the current method showed that most of them come under inadequate and regular category which puts them in a high risk for developing WMSDs.

The prognosis of complex lesion involving both endodontic and periodontic components is complex, but success rate can be improved with regenerative therapies. However, there is paucity of literature regarding its effectiveness in the clinical scenario as only few case reports have been documented in literature for the use of platelet-rich derivatives in regenerative osseous surgery requiring both endodontic and periodontal treatment. We are hereby presenting three cases requiring both endo and perio treatment. The first two cases involve mandibular first molar and maxillary first molar, respectively. The third case involves maxillary central incisor. In all the cases, first, endodontic treatment was initiated, then open flap curettage along with alloplastic bone substitutes was done. Platelet-rich fibrin and platelet-rich plasma were used along with. Three of the treated cases showed significant improvement radiographically and clinically. There was gain in clinical attachment, reduction in probing depth, and radiographic bone fill. Autologous platelet-rich derivative can be used in combination with alloplastic bone substitute for the management of endo-perio cases.

The present study explored the prevalence of herpesviruses in periodontal disease of the North Indian population. In this case-control study, tissue samples were collected from the normal gingiva (control: n = 48) and deepest pocket (cases: n = 48) using a single curette stroke. Periodontal disease status was assessed through the gingival index, pocket depth, and clinical attachment level which were compared to viral marker positivity. Ninety samples from 48 healthy gingiva and 48 periodontitis patients were assessed between the age range of 17-60 years. The prevalence of cytomegalovirus was 2.083% (cases) and 2.083% (controls) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was 18.75% (cases) and 0% (controls). Odd's ratio for EBV in patients with periodontitis is calculated (Haldane-Anscombe correction) to be 21.82%. Herpes simplex virus 1\/2 and varicella-zoster virus were absent in both groups.

Due to increasing risk of developing antibiotic resistance and inability of nonsurgical periodontal therapy to completely eradicate the pathogenic microorganisms, lasers have been used as an adjunct to conventional therapy. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of diode lasers as adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) compared to SRP alone on various clinical and microbiologic parameters in chronic periodontitis patients. Patients were taken from the department of periodontology and implantology, who were having chronic periodontitis. A total of forty patients participated in the study and they were divided into Group I - the test group (SRP + diode laser) and Group II - the control group (SRP alone). The following clinical parameters were assessed: oral hygiene index simplified; clinical attachment level (CAL); probing pocket depth (PPD); bleeding on probing (BOP) at baseline, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks after the treatment; and colony-forming units (CFUs) 1 week postoperatively. The statistical analysis was performed using paired t-test, unpaired t-test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and Mann-Whitney test.

Numerous gingival depigmentation (GD) procedures have been attempted in the literature to evaluate the clinical outcome mostly. Hence, a randomized clinical-histopathological triple-blinded trial was planned to evaluate the pain experienced by the patient, gingival wound healing, and density of melanocytes following liquid nitrogen-assisted GD (LNAGD) and electrocautery-assisted GD (ECAGD) procedures. Thirty-two arches with bilateral physiologic labial\/buccal GMP extending from distal aspect tooth #14-24 and #34-44 in 16 healthy individuals were selected and were equally treated with LNAGD and ECAGD techniques. Dummett oral pigmentation index and Hedin melanin index were evaluated at baseline and 3 months' postoperatively (PO). The visual analog scale was utilized for the intensity of pain assessment at baseline (immediately after treatment) and 1st day and 7th day PO.

The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC50) was determined before the evaluation of cytotoxicity and wound healing property. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and morphological examination by direct invert microscopy were carried out to determine cytotoxicity. Wound healing was evaluated by scratch wound assay. The MIC50 of CHX and curcumin was at 0.1% and 0.003%, respectively. The mean percentage of fibroblast viability at different concentrations of CHX and curcumin at each time period showed a significant difference. Curcumin exhibited less cytotoxicity as compared to CHX at all concentrations and at varying time periods. There was a significant difference between mean percentage of fibroblast viability at MIC50 of CHX (0.1%) and curcumin (0.003%) at different time periods. The difference between percentage wound healing at antibacterial concentrations of CHX and curcumin at varying time periods was significant. The antibacterial concentration of curcumin (0.003%) exhibits less fibroblast cytotoxicity and excellent wound healing property as compared to CHX. Curcumin may offer as a promising chemical plaque control agent which is less cytotoxic, cost-effective, safe, easily available, and with a possibly beneficial effect on wound healing.

MALDI-TOF MS detected all the culture-grown bacteria. In primary dentition group, purple and yellow complex bacteria predominated. Streptococcus spp. was the predominant bacteria (51%) followed by Escherichia coli (19%) and Veillonella spp. (19%). In mixed dentition and permanent group also, Streptococcus spp. was predominant (46%) followed by Veillonella spp. (24%) and E. coli(19%). However, in both groups, orange complex bacteria (bridge complex) such as Prevotella nigrescens and red complex bacteria (Porphyromonas gingivalis, 3%) were seen. For majority of bacteria, the load increased with age. The bacterial isolates showed a distinct age-specific colonization. The use of advanced technique such as MALDI-TOF MS is helpful in the detection of periodontal pathogens, and the effective oral health programs can be implemented to minimize the risk of periodontal diseases.

In the digital smile design, the possibility of crown lengthening observed for teeth - upper left and right central incisors and upper left lateral incisor. A lip-repositioning procedure was also planned. An incision was performed at the mucogingival junction, and a parallel incision was realized at the top of the alveolar mucosa. Afterward, the incised gingival band was removed through vertical incisions in the planned border area. The muscular area was preserved. A simple suture was made, with the approach of the gingival margins around the surgical area. The crown-lengthening procedure was performed with the flapless technique.

Subjects were selected by a combination of systematic, cluster, and multistage sampling techniques. Primary, secondary, and tertiary sampling units were chosen as wards, areas, and households, respectively. Geriatric oral health assessment index was used to assess the OHRQoL among males and females. Periodontal status was assessed using the World Health Organization oral health survey pro forma with some modifications. Results were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 21 software. Gender-wise association of periodontal status with OHRQoL revealed a significant association with mobile teeth (P &lt; 0.05). No relation was seen between OHRQoL, gingival bleeding, periodontal pocket, and loss of attachment (P &gt; 0.05). No significant differences were observed in periodontal status among males and females, but OHRQoL was found to be better among males than females.

","229":"The relationship between oral health and systemic conditions has been increasingly debated over recent decades with one such discussion existing about oral hygiene and periodontitis with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Hence, a study was conducted to assess and compare the oral hygiene status and periodontal status of age and gender-matched participants with and without COPD and to correlate oral hygiene status and periodontal status with lung function status among them. This hospital-based study included a study population of 117 participants (39 patients of COPD and 78 participants without COPD) 35-75 years of age with at least 20 natural teeth. Participant's demographic details and history of smoking were recorded. Lung function was recorded using a spirometer. Periodontal health was assessed by measuring Probing Pocket Depth (PPD), Clinical Attachment Loss (CAL), and Oral Hygiene Index (OHI) by a trained and calibrated examiner. Higher mean of PPD, CAL, and OHI is being reported in the present study with 4.07 versus 3.50, 0.58 versus 0.24, and 5.24 versus 3.60, respectively, among patients with and without COPD which was statistically significant. The risk of having COPD was 0.4 times more in participants having poor oral hygiene and 0.07 times more in patients smoking. Smoking and oral hygiene, as independent variables, have a significant influence on COPD which is a dependent variable. A weak correlation was found of poor oral hygiene and loss of attachment among participants with COPD. Periodontitis and respiratory disease share a common risk factor, i.e., smoking. Smoking has a definite relation with periodontitis and COPD. Oral hygiene is significantly associated with increased risk for COPD when age and gender effects have been matched and when adjusted for smoking. However, no association was found of PPD with COPD.

Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) is autologous blood preparation which helps in wound healing and regeneration. Hence, this study focuses on evaluation of PRF, DFDBA, and their combination in the regeneration of intrabony defects. A total of 39 sites with intrabony defects were randomly assigned into three groups: (Group I - Open flap debridement, Group II - DFDBA alone, and Group III- DFDBA + PRF). Parameters such as probing pocket depth (PPD), relative attachment level (RAL), and radiographic bone fill were measured at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Intragroup comparison at various study intervals was made using one-way ANOVA test. Intergroup comparison was made using Tukey's multiple post hoc test. Reduction in the PPD and greater difference in RAL was observed over the study period in all the three groups with greater reduction in DFDBA + PRF group. Reduction in the radiographic defect depths was observed over the study period in all the three groups with the greatest reduction of 38.99% in the DFDBA + PRF group. However, no statistically significant difference was reported by DFDBA versus DFDBA + PRF group. Combination of DFDBA and PRF improved the clinical and radiographic parameters compared to PRF and DFDBA alone.

The aim was to assess and compare the effect of Curcumin gel (Curenext) and noneugenol periodontal dressing (Coe pak) on tissue response, wound healing in the early stages, and pain post periodontal flap surgery in patients diagnosed with chronic periodontitis. Twenty patients requiring periodontal flap surgery were allotted to two groups at random, one receiving periodontal dressing and the other receiving curcumin for this cross over split-mouth study. Flap surgeries were performed on 2 quadrants with 3 weeks' interval. After suture removal, postoperative sites were assessed for tissue response (tissue color [TC] and tissue edema [TE]) and early wound healing as primary outcomes of the study. The secondary outcome was pain assessment and the number of analgesics taken by the individuals. The two groups showed no significant differences with respect to tissue response, early wound healing, and pain perception. Curcumin group consumed lesser number of analgesics as compared to the one with periodontal dressing. It was confirmed that periodontal dressing and curcumin are effective in reducing the TE, normalizing the TC, enhancing the wound healing and reducing the pain perception. Curcumin can thus be used as an alternative to periodontal dressing. ","232":"\"Black gums\" due to melanin pigmentation of the gingiva is one reason for the demand of cosmetic therapy. Clinicians are often faced with challenge to achieve gingival esthetics in such cases because of its recurrence. Although many procedures were described in literature for gingival depigmentation, only few are mentioning about the intensity of repigmentation. Hence, this study was designed to compare two different techniques for treatment of gingival melanin pigmentation. Twenty patients who were not esthetically pleased with the color of gingiva were selected. A randomized, split-mouth, depigmentation procedure was performed using surgical scalpel and diode laser techniques. Clinical parameters such as plaque and gingival index, bleeding, pain perception, wound healing, recurrence, and intensity of repigmentation were evaluated. Paired t-test and Chi-square test were used for analysis of data. No bleeding was reported in patients treated with diode laser. Moderate pain was reported by patients treated with surgical scalpel, whereas none was reported in diode laser group. No statistically significant difference was observed for both treatment techniques in terms of wound healing, reappearance of gingival pigmentation, and intensity of the same at the end of 6 and 9 months postsurgically. Similar outcomes were observed for both the techniques. Few patients who resulted in no recurrence at 9 months were followed even up to 3 years.

The new generation of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF), namely advanced PRF (A-PRF), has different biological and mechanical properties compared to those of leukocyte-PRF (L-PRF). This study aimed to compare the effects of L-PRF and A-PRF on the viability and migration of human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs). In this in vitro study, the effects of A-PRF and L-PRF on the viability and migration of HGFs after 24 and 48 h were evaluated using the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay. The viability of the negative control culture medium was considered to be 100%. The mean optical density of the test groups was divided by that of the negative control group and reported as percentage. One-way ANOVA was applied to assess the effects of time and type of PRF on the viability and migration of HGFs. Pairwise comparisons were made using the Tukey's test. At 24 h, cell viability in the L-PRF group was significantly higher than that in the A-PRF group (P &lt; 0.05). However, no significant difference was noted between the two groups at 48 h. At 24 h, L-PRF caused significantly higher cell migration compared to the negative control group, whereas at 48 h, both A-PRF and L-PRF significantly increased cell migration compared to the control group. Within the limitations of this study, L-PRF and A-PRF had significant effects on the viability and migration of HGFs. Further studies on these platelet concentrates are warranted.

Various studies have proven the relationship between poor maternal oral health and the occurrence of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Hence, periodontal therapy becomes indispensable during pregnancy. Previous systematic reviews and meta-analysis conducted to assess the influence of periodontal therapy on the occurrence of adverse pregnancy outcomes have shown inconsistent results. Hence, we conducted the present review to assess the influence of periodontal therapy on the occurrence of adverse pregnancy outcomes including the studies published till date. We searched for the relevant studies using the databases PUBMED, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and EMBASE on the randomized controlled trials evaluating the influence of periodontal treatment on adverse pregnancy outcomes from 2000 to 2018. Nineteen studies were considered for the present review based on the predetermined criteria. The risk of bias tool by Cochrane was used to evaluate the risk of bias among the studies. Among the studies included for the present review, the occurrence of preterm birth among the pregnant mothers who received periodontal therapy ranged from 0% to 53.5%, while in the control group, the range was 6.38%-72%. The rate of LBW among the mothers treated for periodontal disease ranged from 0% to 36%, and in the control group, it varied from 1.15% to 53.9%. With best possible evidence, it can be inferred that nonsurgical periodontal therapy is safe during pregnancy. Even though it does not completely avert the occurrence of adverse pregnancy outcomes, it can be recommended as a part of antenatal care.

Therefore, controlling periodontal diseases may have a profound health effect. The importance of oral health is still a neglected and ignored social issue because most of the people are unaware of the relationship between oral health and systemic diseases. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge and awareness of periodontal diseases among Jordan University of science and technology students. A cross-sectional study was conducted by distributing self-administered structured questionnaires to 906 university students between the ages of 18-30 years after obtaining their verbal consents. A total of 906 students completed the questionnaire. Majority of students reported that they brush their teeth regularly while only 5.1% of students admitted that they never clean their teeth. Roughly one-quarter of students could define dental plaque correctly. A high \"percentage\" of females and medical students were more aware concerning gum inflammation signs and symptoms than males and students from faculties of engineering and science. Students of medical specialties and females were more aware of the relationship between smoking, diabetes mellitus, and heart diseases on the one hand and periodontal diseases on the other hand compared to opposite comparative groups. A low proportion of students were aware that proper scaling was not harmful to the teeth. In general, our study demonstrated that university students had poor knowledge regarding the etiology of periodontal diseases as well as the role of conventional treatment in maintaining good oral health by preventing the inflammatory process.

The inauguration of new classification scheme for periodontal diseases and conditions in 2017 World Workshop has a remarkable impact on the diagnosis of periodontal diseases worldwide. This study is based on comparison between the two classifications by American Academy of Periodontology for diagnosing periodontitis. This study focuses on the prevalence estimates of periodontitis by diagnosing the periodontal diseases using two different criteria simultaneously: the first criterion was based on the classification approved in 1999 World Workshop and the other criterion was based on the new classification scheme of periodontal diseases and conditions in 2017 World Workshop. It was found that there was significant reduction in the prevalence estimates (P &lt; 0.001) of periodontitis following the new classification scheme. The new classification scheme recognizes the clinical salience of periodontitis and is more likely to influence the treatment modality of long sufferings of the patients having periodontal problems across the globe. The new classification will also lay the base for future research in the field of dentistry. More future studies are required to assess the prevalence of periodontitis following new classification scheme on a larger scale.

The aim of the present study was to identify barriers to the utilization of the dental services and also the factors that concern the tribal mothers' visit to the dental office. A total of 300 tribal mothers visiting a tertiary care unit participated in this cross-sectional, observational study. A pilot study with twenty participants was conducted before the commencement of the study. Data were collected using a modified questionnaire consisting of demographic data and questions relating to oral health knowledge, attitude, and practices, as well as barriers to the utilization of dental services and factors that concern dental visits during pregnancy. Data analysis was done using SPSS software package 21.0. Nonparametric statistical tests were done to analyze oral health knowledge and attitude of the participants. Various factors were identified using univariate and multivariate models using simple logistic regression analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis. Among the two different tribes considered in the present study, the Saora tribe seemed to be more conscious toward oral health, and 29.7% of participants visited the dentist during pregnancy. The age and experience of the participants along with the educational level, employment status, and knowledge about oral health-related pregnancy outcomes influenced their dental visits. The most reported barrier included the lack of awareness and knowledge of the availability of the dental services. Accessibility and distance to the dental clinic were not found to be negative confounding factors among the participants for the utilization of the services. This study concludes that previous experience and consciousness of the mother to utilize the dental services played a vital role in the utilization of dental services among tribal pregnant women. However, the findings of the present study clearly indicate the need for further research to understand barriers to the utilization of dental services among underprivileged tribal groups of population.

Clinical parameters were evaluated at baseline,3 months and 9 months. Radiographic parameters were evaluated at baseline and 9 months. Histologic differences between light microscopy and SEM for both PRF and T-PRF was studied after sequential processing. There was marked reduction in Probing Pocket depth and gain in Clinical Attachment Level in both the T-PRF and PRF groups from baseline to 9 months in intragroup comparisons. However, on intergroup comparisons, no statistical significance was seen. Radiographically, mean defect depths for both the groups showed statistically significant reduction from baseline values to 9 months on intragroup comparisons but not on intergroup comparisons. In-vitro evaluation, on both light and scanning electron microscopy, T-PRF showed denser fibril meshwork as compared to PRF. The clinical parameters and radiographic outcomes showed marked improvement at 9 months with both PRF and T-PRF in the treatment of infrabony defects from baseline values in intragroup comparison.

Taking into consideration the side effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and the advantages of homeopathic medication, the analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties of ibuprofen (NSAID) and traumeel (homeopathic AID) following flap surgery were evaluated. A randomized, triple-blinded, split-mouth clinical trial, with a sample size of 20 (age range of 20-60 years) was planned. Subjects included patients diagnosed with moderate chronic generalized periodontitis. Two quadrants for each subject were operated on, with an interval of 3 weeks. Random assignment of the operated quadrants to the following medication protocols was carried out by a third person: Ibuprofen, 600 mg and traumeel, 600 mg (up to three tablets) every 8 h for first 24 h and SOS (Si Opus Sit\/if needed) thereafter for a period of 1 week as pain medication, respectively. After 1 week, sutures were removed. Primary outcomes were mean postoperative pain (modified visual analog scale) and number of tablets consumed in 1 week. The secondary outcome was postoperative tissue response. Any adverse effects were recorded. Number of tablets consumed and pain perception was lower in traumeel compared to ibuprofen Group (P &lt; 0.001). A better tissue response was shown by the group treated with traumeel as compared to the ibuprofen receiving group (P &lt; 0.05).

The mainstay of periodontal treatment is, therefore, the disruption of this biofilm by scaling and root planing (SRP). Other treatment protocols such as systemic antimicrobials have been administered as adjuvants after scaling and root planning. However, due to antimicrobial resistance, as well as a shift of the flora from a symbiotic to a dysbiotic one, this mode of treatment has its shortcomings. Thus, local drug delivery has gained prominence as a therapeutic tool. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of subgingivally delivered probiotics as a monotherapy, in combination with tetracycline fibers, and tetracycline fibers alone after SRP. This study was a parallel arm, randomized clinical and microbiological study. Thirty patients with chronic periodontitis aged between 20 and 50 years were selected from the outpatient ward of a tertiary referral care hospital in Hyderabad and equally divided into three groups.

Mechanical removal of plaque alone is not sufficient for the reduction of gingival inflammation associated with plaque. Mouthwashes are supplemented to it as a homecare product. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of 0.2% sodium hypochlorite mouthwash on plaque and gingival inflammation and to assess the clinical parameters of gingivitis patients from baseline to 21 days with the use of 0.2% sodium hypochlorite and 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwashes. This clinical trial study included 60 patients with gingival inflammation evaluated using clinical parameters such as bleeding on probing index, plaque index, and gingival index at baseline and 21 days. Group A patients were given Hi Wash mouthwash and Group B 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash with 30 patients in each group. The scores for clinical parameters were significantly reduced after 21 days in Group A and Group B patients, and there was a reduction in plaque-associated gingival inflammation without scaling and root planning. 0.2% sodium hypochlorite mouthwash is as effective as 0.2% chlorhexidine for the treatment of gingivitis as it is an adjunct to mechanical plaque removal in terms of safety, less side effects, less staining and can be used as a routine mouthwash.

The primary cause for the disease is anaerobic gram-negative bacteria thriving in a protective biofilm in subgingival periodontal pockets. The treatment of this infection is removal of these deposits by mechanical instrumentation (Phase I therapy). This can help achieve reduction of the bacterial load thus suppressing localized inflammation. Phase I therapy or mechanical debridement of the subgingival area causes a severe transient bacteremia along with some damage to the surrounding soft tissue, resulting in a systemic inflammatory response being elicited. The objective of the current study was to comparatively assess periodontal parameters, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and transitory alterations in hematological parameters; in 30-systemically healthy patients having chronic periodontitis, before and after Phase I therapy. The individuals underwent an intensive session of mechanotherapy with ultrasonic scalers. Blood samples were taken before treatment and at 1, 7, and 30 days after treatment to assess the parameters. There was a clear recuperation in periodontal parameters as well as marked improvement in the values of CRP and complete blood count (CBC) by 30 days after transient alterations occurring initially. Phase I (mechanotherapy) - the first step in treatment of periodontitis leads to transient bacteremia by systemic dispersal of bacteria harbored in dental plaque. This produces an acute-phase response resulting in variations in the levels of CRP and the CBC counts. After a month, both periodontal and hematological parameters show marked improvement, thus establishing periodontal health and decreasing the risk of inadvertent cardiovascular or thromboembolic episode.

Hence, we prepared \"Whole Human Tooth Allograft (whole tooth allograft [WTA])\" following standard protocols of tissue bank at Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India. The efficacy of WTA was evaluated in a 43-year-old patient who reported with Seibert Class-III alveolar ridge deficiency in the right maxillary canine region. Three-dimensional changes were evaluated on clinical and radiographic parameters at baseline and at 4-month follow-up.

Bovine-derived substitutes have been by far the most commonly used xenografts in dentistry. Albeit literature is replete with clinical studies in favor of bovine-derived graft materials, bibliographical data reporting on risks and clinical complications is scarce. Clinical impression and concern for patient safety led to the report we have provided. The aim of the present case series was to raise awareness on the long-term risks and late clinical complications of bovine-derived graft materials. Patients were referred to a private practice due to bone augmentation complications. Demographics, significant medical and dental findings are reported. Complications included sinus and maxillary bone pathoses, displacement of the graft materials, oroantral communications, implant failure, foreign body reactions, encapsulation, chronic inflammation, soft tissue fenestrations and associated cysts. Bovine-derived graft materials were not biodegradable. Resolution of the associated lesions and symptoms was achieved after the removal of the bone graft materials. The surgical removal of the xenograft materials may require advanced clinical skills because of the different configurations clinicians might encounter of the non-resorbed and migrated particles. The authors' concern is that patient morbidity may not be reduced with xenografts, due to the inherent risks and associated complications. Clinicians seeking to provide functional and esthetic outcomes should be aware of the complications of the bovine-derived graft materials.

This is a cross-sectional population-based study that used secondary data from the National Oral Health Survey (SB Brazil 2010) performed by the Ministry of Health. This study assessed 7328 adolescents aged 12 years and 5445 young people aged 15-19 years. The characteristics of the periodontal conditions were obtained by the community periodontal index, which provided the outcome variables of gingival bleeding and dental calculus. The predictor variables were demographic, socioeconomic, and oral clinical data. The results showed a high prevalence of gingival bleeding (32%) and dental calculus (33.1%) in the individuals assessed. In addition, as observed after adjusting to the Poisson regression model, the variables of 12 years of age, no tooth loss, fewer household residents, &gt;6 years of education, and no need for dental treatment were considered protective factors for gingival bleeding and dental calculus.

Hence, the aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a curcumin mucoadhesive film for postsurgical pain control. This was a split-mouth study, consisting of 15 systemically healthy patients with 30 sites, who were randomly allocated into test (curcumin mucoadhesive film) and control (placebo mucoadhesive film) groups using coin toss method. A questionnaire was given to patients to evaluate the postoperative pain and swelling and the number of rescue medications taken. Statistical analyses used were Friedman test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and McNemar's test. No adverse effects were reported and healing was uneventful in all patients. The Numerical rating scale pain score showed significantly lesser pain at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 24 h in the test group. Significantly more number of analgesics was consumed in total in the control group than that in the test group.

Thirty extraction sites were planned for implant placement and randomly divided into control (macrosurgical\/conventional) and test (microsurgery) sites. Clinical measurements were recorded at four different points of extraction socket, i.e., mesiobuccal, midbuccal, distobuccal, and midlingual\/palatal at baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months. Postoperative neovascularization at control and test site was evaluated by ultrasound Doppler flowmetry at baseline, 10th day, and 1 month. Radiological assessment of bone density (Hounsfield units) was measured at control and test sites at baseline, 6 and 9 months by computed tomography. Data was subjected to statistical analysis. Significant socket fill at all the four different sites was observed and found to be statistically significant at test as compared to control group with better tissue contour after 3, 6, and 9 months. Test group demonstrated better neovascularization (P &lt; 0.05) with significantly higher bone density (P = 0.000) at different time intervals.

Subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) technique by Langer and Langer provides excellent esthetics and is considered most predictable in obtaining marginal tissue recession coverage. However, the requirement of a second surgical procedure for harvesting CTG remote from planned site of recession coverage increases the chances of postoperative infection. There is also a limitation in the amount of graft that can be harvested and an increased operative time contributing to patient discomfort. Overcoming these difficulties has become possible with the introduction of \"periosteal pedicle graft\" (PPG). The study is a split-mouth design where patients with bilateral, isolated GR defects were treated using two different surgical techniques, i.e., PPG versus the SCTG in obtaining GR coverage. The objective was to analyze the comparative amount of root coverage and the gain in width of attached gingiva achieved by both the techniques. All the clinical parameters evaluated were comparable between SCTG and PPG when recorded at 6 and 9 months posttreatment. Both techniques produced satisfactory and predictable results.

Therefore, this study assessed NLR and PLR in chronic periodontitis (CP) patients before and after periodontal treatment, which to the best of knowledge has not been reported in the literature. Sixty participants were grouped as systemically and periodontally healthy (H) (n = 30) and with CP (n = 30). Plaque index, gingival index, probing pocket depth, clinical attachment loss, leukocyte counts, platelet (PLT) counts, NLR, and PLR were estimated at baseline and also after treatment in the CP group. NLR was calculated as total neutrophil count\/absolute lymphocyte count, and PLR was calculated as total PLT count\/absolute lymphocyte count. The data were statistically analyzed. Periodontal parameters differed significantly between groups H and CP at baseline and posttreatment. A pair-wise comparison of NLR and PLR between CP patients at baseline and posttreatment was significant. Correlation analyses were not remarkable. Receiver operating characteristics analyses provided significant NLR and PLR predictive cutoff values to differentiate between CP patients at baseline and posttreatment.

This case report aims to discuss the dilemma involved during diagnosis of localized aggressive periodontitis.","280":"Periodontitis is a highly prevalent oral disease affecting a wide range of people across all age groups and genders. It is the major cause of loss of teeth among all other oral diseases affecting the people. The current study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of different forms of periodontitis in patients visiting Government Dental College and Hospital, Hyderabad, over a period of 10 years. Retrospective study. This retrospective analysis was put into execution to evaluate the prevalence of periodontal diseases in 74,414 patients referred to the Department of Periodontics in Government Dental College and Hospital, Hyderabad, from January 2007 to December 2016. Descriptive analysis, Chi-square test. Out of the 74,414 patients who were screened, 38,898 were male and 35,516 were female. A total of 67,236 patients (90.35%) had chronic periodontitis and 7178 (9.64%) had aggressive periodontitis. The most commonly found type was chronic localized periodontitis. The results of this study have helped to ascertain the various forms of periodontitis in the population of Hyderabad. This can serve as a basis for future studies with the idea of finding ways to ameliorate oral health in this population.

The previous national-level survey among adolescents was held 15 years ago. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of periodontal disease among older adolescent students and to analyze its predictors as part of an oral health assessment survey conducted in Kerala. A multistage cluster sampling was employed among five districts of Kerala to examine 1065 students in the age group of 15-18 years from government and private schools of selected urban and rural areas. Sociodemographic and oral health behavioral data, modified Community Periodontal Index, Oral Hygiene Index Simplified, and Dental Aesthetic Index were taken. Descriptive statistics and bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were done to identify the predictors of gingival bleeding and periodontal pockets. The prevalence of gingival bleeding, periodontal pockets, and loss of attachment was 42%, 13.4%, and 2.7%, respectively. In the adjusted multivariate model for predictors of gingival bleeding, rural location of residence, studying in government schools, high mother's education and their working status, orthodontic treatment need, oral hygiene frequency, and poor oral hygiene status emerged as significant predictors of gingival bleeding. In the multivariate model for periodontal pockets, bleeding on probing emerged as the strongest predictor with an odds ratio of 12.85 when adjusted to poor oral hygiene. The prevalence of early periodontal disease among adolescents is significant. Sociodemographic factors, poor oral hygiene, and malocclusion are significant predictors for periodontal disease among adolescents.

The present study aims to ascertain PRF's beneficial role in wound healing after depigmentation surgery. A total of 12 systemically healthy controls included were divided into two groups after scalpel depigmentation procedure. PRF was prepared according to Choukroun's standard protocol. Using split-mouth design after depigmentation, one group received PRF membrane, and in second group non-eugenol periodontal dressing was placed. The participants were evaluated for visual analog scale (VAS), healing index (HI) on 3rd and 5th day. Epithelization test using toluidine blue and histological examination employing punch biopsy was done on the 5th day. On statistical scale, VAS, HI, epithelization test, and histological findings were statistically significant in the two study groups. PRF group proved better epithelization test and inflammatory cell infiltration was less in PRF group which confirmed superior wound healing in the group. PRF membrane postdepigmentation provided satisfactory patient comfort and enhanced the wound healing cascade.

To assess the effect of amine fluoride and probiotic mouthwashes on levels of P. gingivalis during orthodontic treatment, using real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A randomised controlled trial was performed including 45 patients. There were three groups: Group A (control group), Group B (patients using Amflor mouthwash) and Group C (patients using probiotic mouthwash). During the treatment, all the 3 groups were advised to brush twice a day using Colgate tooth paste and Group B patients were advised to swish 15 ml fluoridated mouthwash (Amflor) and Group C advised to swish probiotic for 60 s before swallowing, once in the morning and once before sleep. After gently removing supragingival plaque, subgingival plaque samples were collected by inserting a sterile dental curette into the bottom of the gingival crevice around 31, 32, 41, and 42 at two different intervals: T1 at start and T2 after 6 months of fixed orthodontic treatment. Sub-gingival plaque samples collected were transferred to laboratory within 48 h for RT-PCR analysis in Tris-buffer solution, to maintain the integrity of bacterial DNA. The levels of P. gingivalis were significantly decreased with probiotic mouth wash. Probiotic mouth wash can be used as an adjunctive measure along with regular brushing to improve periodontal status during fixed orthodontic treatment. ","286":"Due to the extensive use of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) in dentistry, especially in measuring thicknesses of hard and soft tissues, and the fact that CBCT has low contrast resolution, the aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of CBCT in measuring soft tissue thickness. In this cross-sectional study, pink baseplate wax as a soft tissue simulation was overlaid in different areas of the jaws on the dry human skull, and the probe was used to determine the thicknesses of 1, 2, 3, and 5 mm. These thicknesses were then measured accurately with a digital caliper by one person four times at interval of a week. The skull was scanned using two CBCT scanners, and the different thicknesses of wax were measured by two observers four times with a week interval. The CBCT measurements were compared with digital caliper measurements as a reference. Statistical analysis showed no significant difference between CBCT and digital caliper measurements for thickness &lt; 2 mm (P &gt; 0.05). Statistically, the difference between digital caliper and CBCT measurements was &lt; 0.1 mm, but this difference is not clinically important.

A total of 15 systemically healthy controls were recruited and 10 ml of blood sample was withdrawn from the individual. Following the standard centrifugation protocol, PRF and PRFM were prepared. The platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), transforming growth factor (TGF), and insulin growth factor (IGF) were evaluated for 23 days. The PDGF released from PRFM was statistically significant from PRF till the 15th day of release. The VEGF too had an increased release up till the 15th day from PRFM group as compared to PRF, but no statistically significant difference could be obtained. EGF from the 15th day to 23rd day had a greater release from PRFM group as compared to PRF group. FGF from 7th day to 23rd day had statistically significant difference in the PRFM group as compared to PRF group. TGF and IGF had statistically significant difference in PRFM group as compared to PRF group from 11th day to 23rd day and 1st to 17th day, respectively. The initial and robust release of GFs was seen in PRFM group at earlier days, whereas a steady and constant release of six GFs could be appreciated from PRF group upto 23rd day. Therefore, for a rapid and early healing and regeneration, both the platelet concentrates can be utilized in periodontal therapy.

The purpose of this experimental study was to evaluate the phagocytic activity of PMN in patients with chronic generalized periodontitis, generalized aggressive periodontitis, and chronic generalized gingivitis. A total of 60 patients, 20 patients with chronic generalized periodontitis, 20 patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis, and 20 patients with chronic generalized gingivitis were selected for this study. Blood samples were collected from the patients. Peripheral smears were prepared from the samples, and the slides were stained using nitroblue tetrazolium test, and the phagocytic activity of the neutrophils was compared using the test results. Intragroup comparison using Mann-Whitney U-test and intergroup comparison using Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA test were done. The results of the present study suggest that PMN phagocytic defect was present in most of the patients affected by generalized aggressive periodontitis; however, the phagocytic defect cannot be attributed to age, sex, or clinical parameters such as the plaque index or gingival index and probing pocket depths. The phagocytic activity of neutrophils in generalized aggressive periodontitis was low compared to chronic generalized periodontitis and chronic generalized gingivitis.

The objectives of this systematic review are to assess the amount of radiographic bone fill, clinical attachment level (CAL) gain, and reduction in pocket depth (PD) in patients with intrabony defects in periodontitis patients following the use of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2). Electronic bibliographic databases search of Medline, Science Direct, and Google Scholar was made from January 1980 to December 2017. Studies using rhBMP-2 to treat periodontal intrabony defects of the maxillary or mandibular region with follow-up period of at least 6 months were searched. Two reviewers performed the systematic review using the PRISMA Statement for reporting and the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used for quality assessment. It was found that rhBMP-2 showed statistically significant results with respect to radiographic defect resolution, CAL, and PD reduction at 9 months compared to open-flap debridement but showed statistically significant results only with respect to radiographic bone fill when compared with platelet-rich fibrin at 6 months. The rhBMP-2 may provide a promising alternative to traditional grafting procedures therapy that can enhance periodontal regeneration in patients having intrabony defects. Due to limited human studies, it can be concluded that no definitive evidence exists to ascertain the effectiveness of rhBMP-2 in the treatment of intrabony defects in periodontal diseases.

It can be due to jaw deformities, altered passive eruption, or tooth malpositioning. Usually, the corrective measures incorporate orthognathic surgery and orthodontic treatment. Orthognathic surgery results in significant morbidity and hospitalization. Lip repositioning can be employed as an alternative cosmetic treatment modality for the correction of an excessive gingival display with minimal risk or side effects. Although there are many articles existing in the literature on this topic, a series of three cases is unique in demonstrating the esthetic smile enhancement in an orthodontic patient and also a combination of lip-repositioning technique and laser-assisted crown lengthening in vertical maxillary excess cases. This case series also showed the predictability of lip-repositioning technique with a follow-up of 2 years.","295":"Marginal tissue recession (MTR) by definition is an apical shift of gingival margin, which leads to exposure of root surface. Patients affected with MTR often complain of sensitivity to cold on exposed root surfaces apart from esthetic concerns. In this article, a case of multiple Miller's class I MTR who presented with sensitivity to cold in relation to maxillary anterior teeth region was treated using Zucchelli's coronally advanced flap with pericardium membrane under operating microscope. The application of principles of periodontal microsurgery and guided tissue regeneration results in significant root coverage with reduction\/elimination of sensitivity.

The study aimed to investigate the awareness of the link between smoking and periodontal disease among the population seeking periodontal treatment. A self-administered questionnaire constructed in local Malay language consisting of 13 questions on sociodemographic details and 10 questions on the knowledge domain was distributed to eligible respondents while they were waiting for their consultation in the periodontal clinic waiting hall. There were 330 study participants aged 16 years old and above, who participated in this study from all 12 dental clinics in the state of Perlis, Malaysia. Data were entered into Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20.0 for analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the sociodemographic data, whereas association between potential factor and the knowledge of awareness was found using the Pearson Chi-square test of independence or a Fisher's exact test, depending on the eligibility criteria. Our study showed that 4.5% (n = 15) of the respondents were not aware that smoking did add risk for oral cancer, 14.5% (n = 48) were not aware that smoking could cause gum disease. Smoking status was significantly associated with the awareness of smoking effect on gum disease (P = 0.002). The proportion of the active smokers being aware that smoking could potentially cause gum disease was considerably less as compared to the nonsmokers (62.7% vs. 83.3%). Continuous dental health campaigns and awareness program are crucial to instil awareness and health-seeking behavior as well as to enforce public's knowledge.

However, very limited data are available till date, studying the coexistence of both the conditions. The aim and objective of this study are to determine the prevalence of periodontitis among patients affected with various pulmonary diseases in Moradabad District, Uttar Pradesh, India. A total of 700 patients suffering from pulmonary diseases including tuberculosis (TB), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or pneumonia within the age group of 12-70 years were selected for the study. A detailed case-history for both pulmonary and periodontal status was taken. Periodontal Disease Index and Periodontal Index for Risk of Infectiousness were recorded for all patients. The scores were calculated and subjected to statistical analysis. Individuals with pulmonary diseases showed a statistically significant prevalence of periodontal disease with higher values of periodontal disease index (31%) and periodontal index for risk of infectiousness (55%) at P &lt; 0.05. Patients suffering from TB within the age group of 51-60 (42%) showed the highest prevalence of periodontitis with a more number of males (43%) being affected as compared to females at P &lt; 0.01.

A total of 225 pregnant females participated in the study. After complete demographic assessment of participants, a questionnaire was provided to them. Questionnaire included simple multiple choice questions on how they maintained oral hygiene, their oral health status, visit to the dentist, and barriers in seeking treatment. This was followed by a questionnaire regarding common myths and understanding of the importance of oral health during pregnancy which had three choices: true, false, and do not know. The results were expressed in percentages, and one sample t-test for percentages was applied where ever required. Majority of participants self-reported some form of oral health problems with bleeding gums as a chief complaint leading the survey. Around half of the participants had never visited a dentist, and an abundant number of pregnant females reported safety concerns for developing the child as a reason for not taking any treatment during pregnancy. A highly significant number of participants were unaware of the importance of oral health during pregnancy and believed in age-old myths.

Inflammatory products released both by the microorganisms, and the host plays a pivotal role in causing both the diseases. Pentraxins are acute-phase proteins which are often found to be elevated in inflammatory states. Anti-inflammatory agents have a very important role to play in curbing infection of which, aspirin and omega-3 fatty acids (O3FAs) are being administered often nowadays. Nonsurgical periodontal therapy (NSPT) remains the gold standard of treatment, and other agents have been used as adjuvants only, to increase the efficacy of treatment. This study compares the effects of low-dose aspirin versus O3FAs when used as adjuvants to NSPT in patients with diabetes and chronic periodontitis. A total of 42 patients (mean age of 30-65 years) from a diabetic center who were diagnosed with Type II diabetes and chronic periodontitis were included in the study. This study was done in the department of periodontics of a tertiary referral care hospital in Hyderabad, in collaboration with a reputed diabetic center. Intragroup comparison was done using the paired t-test for continuous data and Wilcoxon signed-rank test for score data. Intergroup comparison was compiled using independent t-test.

The use of bone grafts in combination with guided tissue regeneration membrane is a predictable treatment option but is expensive. Platelet concentrates are increasingly being used owing to their ease of use and cost-effectiveness. The aim of this study is to evaluate the ability of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) to augment the regenerative effects exerted by demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft (DFDBA) in the treatment of mandibular degree II furcation defects. Twenty-eight defects in 14 patients with bilateral Degree II mandibular furcation defects were included in the study. The test group was treated with a combination of DFDBA and PRF, while in the control group DFDBA was used alone. Clinical parameters such as probing depth, relative vertical clinical attachment level, relative horizontal clinical attachment level (RHCAL), gingival margin level (GML), plaque index, and sulcus bleeding index were measured at baseline and 6 months. Radiographic parameters, such as vertical defect depth, horizontal defect depth and defect fill, were measured using cone beam computed tomography, taken at baseline and 6 months. The intragroup and intergroup comparisons were done using the paired t-test. The intergroup comparison of mean change in the parameters showed, statistically significant difference in RHCAL (&lt;0.001) and GML (0.014), and no significant difference in other parameters.

Furcation involvement poses challenge to the prognosis of a tooth, the use of bone grafts and a combination of grafts and membranes have proved to be beneficial in the treatment of furcation defects. Thus, the aim of the present study was to clinically evaluate and compare the effectiveness of collagen fiber bone graft with and without a membrane in the treatment of mandibular Grade II furcation defects. A clinical split-mouth randomized control trial, which included ten patients having bilateral mandibular Grade II furcation defects, was randomly assigned to Group I, treated with bone graft of hydroxyapatite with collagen fibers, and Group II, treated with bone graft of hydroxyapatite with collagen fibers and guided tissue regeneration membrane of polyglycolide and polylactide copolymer, respectively. The clinical measurements were recorded at baseline and 6 months after surgery; and plaque and gingival index were recorded at baseline and at 3 and 6 months after surgery. The data obtained was statistically evaluated. The overall results showed that the treatment procedures demonstrated statistically significant reduction in probing pocket depth, vertical defect fill, and horizontal depth of furcation, with a gain in clinical attachment level. On comparison of both the groups, Group II showed superior results with a statistically significant difference in all parameters except in gingival recession.

The use of triclosan-coated suture (TCS) or chlorhexidine-coated suture (CCS) could be one of the possible alternatives to reduce the microbial load. The study was designed to assess the antibacterial efficacy of resorbable TCS and CCS along with its effect on healing after periodontal flap surgery in comparison to noncoated sutures (NCSs). Thirty patients with chronic periodontitis indicated for periodontal flap surgery satisfying inclusion criteria were randomly assigned in the three groups: (1) NCS-polyglycolic acid sutures (control group), (2) TCS-polyglycolic acid sutures (experimental Group A), and (3) CCS-polyglycolic acid sutures (experimental Group B). All the patients were evaluated at day 0 (baseline), day 8, day 15, and day 30 for healing index (HI), postoperative pain (POP), and visible plaque index (VPI). Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial growth around each suture was evaluated after day 8. Two randomly chosen samples from each group were examined using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) for the presence of biofilm. Although intergroup HI and POP were statistically insignificant (P &gt; 0.05), intragroup evaluation showed statistically significant improvement. VPI was more in NCS compared to antibacterial sutures. There was significantly less concentration of anaerobic bacteria as compared to aerobic bacteria (P &lt; 0.05).

The precise etiopathogenesis of POF is unclear; however, it is suggested to originate from the connective tissue of periodontal ligament. This lesion predominantly occurs in the maxillary anterior region. The standard treatment protocol involves surgical excision followed by the biopsy of lesion. The reactive nature and unpredictable course attribute to a high recurrence rate of the lesion; hence, proper postoperative monitoring and follow-up of the lesion are necessary. The present case was surgically managed using diode laser and did not show any sign of recurrence during the follow-up period of 6 months. Minimum intraoperative bleeding and postoperative pain, ease of operation, and patient's acceptance enable laser-assisted growth excision as a better treatment modality to other conventional surgical procedures, thus offering diode laser as a viable and effective treatment alternative in the management of massive overgrowth.","313":"Attached gingiva plays a promising role in maintaining periodontal health. An adequate width of attached gingiva prevents plaque formation and soft-tissue recession. Among various techniques for augmenting width of attached gingiva, modified apically repositioned flap (MARF) is a simple and easy procedure that does not require a second surgical site.

A total of 19 chronic periodontitis patients were enrolled in the study and tested for serum 25(OH)D3 levels. Deficient patients were supplemented with Vitamin D3. PDL tissue of these patients was isolated after tooth extraction before and after supplementation of Vitamin D3 and analyzed for the presence of VDR in PDL tissue by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All the chronic periodontitis patients were found to be deficient in Vitamin D3. The mean serum 25(OH)D3 level before supplementation was 13.96 ng\/mL which significantly increased to 35.12 ng\/mL after supplementation of Vitamin D3 for 6 weeks. VDR analysis determined mean VDR conc. in PDL tissue to be -1.443 ng\/mL, which increased to 2.38 ng\/mL after supplementation. A concentration dependent correlation was seen between serum 25(OH)D3 levels and VDR conc. in PDL tissue after supplementation. The study determined Vitamin D Receptors (VDR) in PDL tissue after supplementation of Vitamin D. Thus in addition to the standard treatment modalities, Vitamin D3 supplementation would be an important factor for generation of adequate immune response.

Free gingival graft (FGG) has been successfully in use in this category of reconstructive therapeutic modality. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the literature with respect to efficacy of FGG in the management of Miller Class I and II localized gingival recessions. Search strategies were performed via electronic database which included Pubmed-Medline, Google scholar and manual search using University library resources. Two reviewers assessed the eligibility of the studies. Controlled clinical trials, randomized clinical trials and longitudinal studies evaluating recession areas treated by FGG with minimum of 6 months follow up were included. In-vitro and animal studies, studies mainly done on Miller Class III and IV gingival recession defect, studies on multiple gingival recessions and case series and case reports were excluded from the search. The electronic and manual search identified a total of 557 articles. A final screen consisted of 39 articles out of which 17 articles were selected for full-text assessment. Finally, 7 articles were selected for detailed evaluation for this systematic review. FGG has shown significant results in all the studies except for one study. FGG produces substantial results, however, highly depends on the case selection and operator's skill and experience. FGG gives an impression of being the best alternative option in zones where gingival recession presents with inadequate width of attached gingiva and depth of vestibular fornix.

However, there were several problems in CEJ identification. Due to the time consumption and inherent problems in CEJ identification, CAL measurements without using a stent in surveys or other clinical trials are highly questionable. The use of stent is recommended during clinical trials which will minimize the errors in terms of over and underestimation of CALs. Hence, the stent used for vertical probing (vertical\/occlusal stent), horizontal probing (furcation stent), and interdental papilla (IDP) stent for IDP-deficiency measurement is discussed to comprehend its clinical applications.","330":"The aim of this case report was to describe a modified free gingival graft technique for gaining vertical and horizontal soft-tissue growth in the posterior region of the mandible before installation of dental implants. Patient A.A., a 38-year-old female, received a modified free gingival graft in the posterior region of the mandible. After 90 days, an increase, both horizontally and vertically, of the gingival tissue was observed, and the patient was satisfied with the result. The dental implant was installed, and a 3-mm of the vertical gain of keratinized gingiva was observed. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of this technique before prosthetic dental implantation.","331":"In the treatment of Class II furcation defects, guided tissue regeneration (GTR) in combination with bone grafts has provided better treatment outcomes in comparison to GTR alone. A 48-year-old male patient reported with a chief complaint of pain and bleeding in the right lower back teeth area from 3 months. On clinical and radiographic evaluation, a Class II buccal furcation defect was detected in tooth #46. A bidirectionally positioned flap (BPF) technique in combination with bone graft was done to treat the defect following nonsurgical therapy. The healing was satisfactory postoperatively. The patient was recalled for supportive periodontal therapy at 3, 6, and 12 months. Clinical and radiographic outcomes after 12 months revealed possible new attachment and stable periodontal status. It is concluded that inner periosteal flap in BPF technique may serve as an alternative technique to GTR barrier membranes in case of Class II furcation defects.","332":"Enamel renal syndrome is a unique syndrome associated with kidney agenesis associated with kidney agenesis, amelogenesis imperfecta, and gingival hyperplasia. The prevalence rate of this rare syndrome is &lt;1\/1,000,000. A 17-year-old male patient came to the department of periodontics, with a chief complaint of dislodged crown in the anterior teeth region. On clinical examination, the patient had teeth with mottled enamel and gingival enlargement. The orthopantomograph and gingival biopsy revealed pulpal calcification and gingival calcification, respectively. Furthermore, the renal ultrasonography revealed absence\/agenesis of the left kidney. Thus, based on radiographical, histological, and ultrasound investigations, the patient was diagnosed with nephrocalcinosis syndrome. The patient was treated with periodontal therapy and prosthodontic full-mouth rehabilitation. This case report highlights the need of a periodontist to be acquainted about the signs and symptoms of the syndrome to benefit an individual in the right diagnosis and treatment plan.","333":"Dentine hypersensitivity (DH) is a relatively common problem which may affect the adult population. The etiology remains multi-factorial with interactions between stimulus and pre-disposing factors causing its aggravation. To study the prevalence of DH and associated factors and also to find the association between various factors and DH. A cross-sectional study was carried out and a total of 5091 patients, both male and females, were evaluated through questionnaire. Out of the total only 1400 patients were included in the study and were further evaluated clinically. A complete demographic data was obtained and the DH was confirmed by the use of air -water jet of the dental chair and scratching the suspected tooth with a dental probe. The pain response of the subject was recorded using the visual analog scale (VAS) and verbal rating scale (VRS). The data obtained was statistically evaluated and Chi-square test was applied for comparison of different demographic factors with DH. The overall prevalence of DH was 27.4%. Various demographic factors were found to affect DH such as age, gender, education, and diet. The most common stimulus was found to be cold (21.4%) and common predisposing factor was gingival recession and attrition (28.6%). Clinical examination yielded a statistically significant association between VAS and VRS scores for DH and demographic factors. The prevalence of DH in present study was 27.4% which is attributed to gingival recession as predisposing factor and cold stimuli as the precipitating factor. ","334":"The use of dental implants as a prosthetic treatment modality for partially edentulous or completely edentulous patients is increased more commonly ever since the concept of osseointegration has been accepted. The objective of this study is to assess the awareness, knowledge, attitude, and acceptance of dental implants as a treatment modality among patients visiting SDM Dental College, Dharwad. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 500 patients visiting SDM College of Dental Sciences and Hospital (SDMCDSH), Dharwad, using a self-explanatory questionnaire. A total of 500 individuals participated in the survey. The results of this survey indicate that 93.4% of the patients knew about dental implants, and for majority of them, the major source of information was through their dentist followed by relatives and friends and electronic media. About 60.4% patients disapproved the removable prosthesis as an option for the replacement of missing teeth. 77.2% patients expressed that they could not afford for the dental implant treatment. The major deterioration for this treatment was related to the cost in 80.4% patients, surgical procedure in 11.6% patients, and a long treatment time in 5.6% patients. While 60.4% patients felt that dental implants being expensive, is the treatment option only for the rich. The results of this survey showed that majority of the patients visiting SDMCDSH, Dharwad, were aware about dental implants as a treatment modality for the replacement of missing teeth. Although the attitude was positive and they did accept dental implants as a treatment option, the treatment cost mainly was the major reason to take a back step. ","335":"Lasers have become a part of modern dentistry since the past three decades. A wide-ranging assortment of lasers is being used in periodontology for both soft and hard tissue surgical procedures. Regardless of the frequent practice of using these well-known surgical lasers, there is another lesser familiar class of lasers called the low-level lasers. The main doctrine behind using low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is centered on the biostimulation, or the biomodulation effect, which relies on the dexterity of low-intensity laser energy when irradiated at a specific wavelength, is able to modify cellular activities (increase in cell metabolism and fibroblast and keratinocyte proliferation). The aim of the present study was to investigate the adjunctive use of LLLT on gingival healing after gingivectomy procedures. Ten systemically healthy patients requiring gingivectomy or gingivoplasty procedures bilaterally in either the maxillary or mandibular teeth were included in the study. After surgical intervention, a diode laser (810 nm) was randomly activated to one side of the operated area while other side did not receive any treatment and served as the control. The healing index given by Landry et al. was used to evaluate the soft tissue healing immediately postsurgery and at the 3rd day, 1 week, and 2 weeks postoperatively. After the follow-up period, results were analyzed using appropriate statistical tests. There was no statistically significant difference observed in the surface epithelialization between both groups on the 3rd and 7th-postoperative days, but highly significant differences were observed on the 14th day. Within the confines of this pilot study, the outcomes have indicated that gingival wound healing may be improved using LLLT after gingivectomy and gingivoplasty operations. ","336":"Frenectomy is complete excision of the frenum attachment to the underlying bone. Conventional frenectomy with blade has been widely used; however, laser-assisted frenectomy is the most recent alternative. The present study aims to compare two methods of frenectomy for the pain experienced, intraoperative bleeding, healing outcome, and need for analgesics. Twenty patients with high labial frenum attachment requiring frenectomy were included in this study. Patients were randomly divided into Group A: scalpel group and Group B: neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser group. Visual Analog pain score, intraoperative bleeding, number of analgesics used, and healing outcome 3 months postoperatively were recorded. Group B patients experienced less pain (P = 0.016), less bleeding (P = 0.016), and required fewer number of analgesics (P = 0.008). Healing outcome at 3 months showed no significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.095). Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that Nd:YAG laser is an efficient and a more comfortable alternative to scalpel for frenectomy.

Interdental papilla loss might occur due to several reasons as a consequence of periodontal surgery, trauma, and others. The present study was aimed to prepare economically feasible injectable form of hyaluronic acid (HA) gel in three different concentrations - 1%, 2%, and 5% HA to evaluate its efficacy in the enhancement of deficient interdental papilla (IDP). A total of 42 sites (mean age range was 29.6-30.6 years) was categorized into three groups; 1% HA group (16 sites), 2% HA group (14 sites), and 5% HA group (12 sites). Total 35 sites were followed up out of 42 in which 2% HA group included only 7 sites. Both maxillary (17 sites) and mandibular (18 sites) sites were included in this study. HA was injected at 2 mm apical to papillary tip at weekly interval for 3 weeks. The IDP augmentation was measured using UNC-15 probe and modified stent at 1, 3, and 6 months. The photographic analysis was done using Image J software. On clinical measurement, 5% of HA showed highly significant enhancement (P = 0.001) of 19.2%, 20.6% 18.2% at 1, 3, and 6 months, respectively. On photographic analysis, 5% of HA showed 41%, 42.9%, and 39.8% at 1, 3, and 6 months, respectively. However, intergroup comparison showed nonsignificant improvement. This study results suggest that the use of 5% of HA is effective for interdental deficiency treatment with minimal rebound at the end of 6 months. The modified stent for IDP measurement used in this study for the first time in the literature is highly recommended. The photographic analysis using image J Analyzer serves a useful and dependable tool. Further, long-term clinical studies would throw more insight in this regard.

With the increase in popularity of dental implants, augmentation of the alveolar ridge and soft tissue has also become a routine procedure in most of the cases. Although hard-tissue augmentation is performed by other specialists also, a periodontist needs to master the skills of soft-tissue management to deliver esthetic and functional results in implant-supported prostheses. This case report presents a single-staged ridge split approach using piezoelectric surgery with simultaneous implant placement followed by connective tissue grafting at second-stage surgery. Single-staged segmental ridge split technique not only reduces the total treatment duration but also the surgical morbidity for the patient. A subepithelial connective tissue graft is strongly advocated around implants as it is highly predictable while ensuring better esthetic results in terms of tissue color, texture, and long-term stability of the surrounding mucosa.","347":"Pemphigus is an autoimmune disease affecting the skin and mucosae.

As patients in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) are completely dependent on the caregivers, the knowledge, attitude, and practices of the nurses influence the recovery of patients to a greater extent. Unfortunately, oral health problems are usually overshadowed by other serious needs in critically ill patients. In addition, nursing staff appear to perceive oral health as the most difficult part of their work, hence been a low-priority intervention. Therefore, the aim of the study was to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practices of ICU nurses on oral care in critically ill patients. A total of 200 nurses working in 21 different hospitals in Mysore, Karnataka, participated in the cross-sectional survey. The survey instrument included the demographic details, knowledge, attitude, and practice of oral care, complications in ICU due to lack of oral care, and educative programs attended. Among the 200 ICU nurses, 67% had ICU experience of more than 5 years. About 94% were diploma candidates, 5% were graduates, and only 2% were postgraduates with a mean age of 27.5 years. All the participants were aware of the concept of focal infection theory and 93% knew about the potential complications associated with poor oral hygiene in ICU. About 95.5% of the nurses performed oral care after every shift change and used gauze soaked in chlorhexidine routinely. Nearly 76.5% of the participants stated mechanical obstruction as a main barrier toward oral care. A variety of oral care practices exist for ventilated patients but, the majority of nurses used chlorhexidine with gauze. They failed to adhere to the latest evidence-based practice despite ranking oral care as a high priority.

However, there are few studies on the effect of these hormones on periodontium. The aim of this study was to evaluate the periodontal status of hypothyroid patients on thyroxine replacement therapy. Clinical parameters (plaque index, bleeding index, probing pocket depth [PPD], and clinical attachment level [CAL]) and radiographic parameters (Mandibular cortical width and panoramic mandibular index) were recorded in 52 hypothyroid patients on thyroxine replacement therapy (Study group) and 50 individuals without signs and symptoms of thyroid dysfunction (Control group). The effect of dosage and duration of therapy on clinical and radiographical parameters were also assessed in the study group. Statistically significant higher PPD (P = 0.008) and clinical attachment loss (P = 0.032) were observed in the study group in comparison to the control group. However, no significant differences were observed within the hypothyroid group with varying doses and duration of therapy. Furthermore, there was no correlation between the dosage and duration of therapy with periodontal status. Regression analysis showed that hypothyroidism and thyroxine replacement therapy was a significant predictor of PPD and CAL even after controlling for the effect of age in hypothyroid patients. Hypothyroid patients on thyroxine replacement therapy may be at increased risk for periodontal destruction. However, this needs to be validated through longitudinal studies.

Thirty periodontitis patients were randomly divided into two equal groups in this double-blind, randomized, parallel group, and active-controlled trial: test group - scaling and root planning (SRP) plus CLM (500 mg thrice daily for 7 days, orally) was given, and control group - only SRP was done. Clinical analysis, such as gingival index (GI), probing depth (PD), and clinical attachment loss (CAL), were taken at baseline, 3 months, and 6-month intervals for both groups. Subgingival plaque samples were cultured for periodontopathic organisms. Immunological parameter C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were estimated. SPSS version 14 was used for statistical analysis. The intragroup comparison showed a significant reduction in the mean scores of all the parameters from baseline to 6 months. The intergroup comparison showed a statistically significant reduction of PD from baseline to 3 months (P &lt; 0.001). GI, CAL, and CRP levels were also reduced but not statistically significant. The mean colony-forming units (CFU) of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) showed a statistically significant reduction from baseline to 3 months only in the test group (P = 0.042) and (P = 0.046), respectively.

Plaque index (PI) and gingival index (GI) were evaluated at baseline, 6 months, and 9 months after surgery. Probing pocket depth (PPD) and clinical attachment level (CAL) were recorded at baseline and 9 months after surgery. Radiographic assessment was carried out to measure the periodontal defect depth and defect fill percentage (DF%) at baseline and 9 months after the surgery using radiovisiography. The statistical evaluation obtained after 9 months showed no significant difference between PI and GI at 9 months interval. Intergroup comparison of PPD and CAL has shown significant difference in Group C as compared to Group A and B with P &lt; 0.05. The defect depth was statistically significant at 9 months in all the groups, and DF percentage (DF%) has shown statistically significant results in Group C as compared to A and B with P = of 0.001.

The prognostic parameters evaluated include age, probing depth (PD), mobility, furcation involvement, diabetes, and molar type. The total score calculated from all parameters was used considered prognosis score for each molar. All patients were evaluated at baseline and 2-year posttreatment. The results of this study suggest that following prognostic factors, DM (hazard ratio [HR] =5.2), age (HR = 0.4), and molar type (HR = 0.6) were clinically significant at the end of the 2-year posttherapy from baseline.

Various treatment modalities have been present in the literature. The present article emphasized the treatment modalities and an effort to treat the recurrence of PG with the use of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) membrane. This case report presents a 28-year-old female patient who had reported with PG that recurred twice in 2-year period. The lesion appeared to be recurrent with sessile base and was diagnosed clinically and histopathologically as PG. The PG was excised with the conventional scalpel method exposing the underlying bone.

The factors evaluated included age, probing depth, mobility, furcation involvement, smoking, and molar type. A modified, 5 level, scoring criterion for smoking based on smoking-dose was adopted. MMPPI was computed as the sum of scores for all six prognostic factors. Appropriate periodontal treatment and supportive periodontal therapy were provided. All patients were evaluated at baseline and 2 years posttreatment. Hazard risk ratio (HR) was computed for each prognostic factor. A total of 3 (1.5%) teeth of the 200 molars were extracted over the 2-year follow-up duration, with a mean of 0.015 teeth lost.

In the socket-shield technique (SST) the root is bisected, and the buccal two-third of the root is preserved in the socket so that the periodontium along with the bundle bone and the buccal bone remains intact. A classification of SST technique is proposed depending on the position of the shield in the socket. This classification is required so as to help in understanding the preparation design and the role of shield and in maximizing the usage of the shield to achieve best possible esthetics in immediate implant placement sites.","400":"Grinspan syndrome is a syndromic complex which comprises a triad of hypertension, diabetes, and oral lichen planus.

A cross-sectional study was conducted in a clinical setting on 150 participants (50 each in Class I, Class II, and Class III skeletal pattern) within the age group of 13-30 years. Frenum was examined by direct visual method and intraoral photographs were taken for all the participants. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used. No gender-wise differences were found among the various frenum typologies. Mucosal type was the most prevalent in Class I and II and gingival type in Class III. Simple frenum was the common type in all the three groups. However, abnormal frenum categories based on its location and morphology were more in class III and found to be statistically significant. Papillary and papillary penetrating types are significantly associated with skeletal class III pattern and midline diastema (P &lt; 0.05). The prevalence of papillary and papillary penetrating types of frenum are significantly more in Class III skeletal pattern. A labial frenum that is attached close to the gingival margin could be an etiological factor in midline diastema, mucogingival problems, and affect the growth of the alveolar process.

Clinical features of oral lesions may include ulceration, nodules, granulomas, and fissures. TB in pregnant women is a major cause of obstetric complications and increased risk of maternal and child mortality. This report highlights a rare case of primary TB of gingiva, presenting as severe gingival overgrowth in a patient with 4th month of pregnancy. This case strongly suggests the importance of suspecting TB as the differential diagnosis of gingival overgrowth and therefore, playing a critical role in the early detection and treatment. Interdisciplinary collaboration for diagnosis and management resulted in the successful outcome and prevented the obstetric complications in this case.","416":"Pyogenic granuloma (PG) is a reactive hyperplasia of connective tissue that occurs in response to low-grade local irritation, traumatic injury, foreign materials, or hormonal causes and rarely associated with bone loss. Although solitary PG is a common lesion in the orofacial region, presence of multiple such lesions at the same time with associated bone loss is rare. In addition, repeated recurrences of such lesions sometimes frustrate the clinician.

Gingivitis is the most prevalent oral manifestations associated with pregnancy. The hormonal and vascular changes that accompany pregnancy are known to exaggerate the inflammatory response to the local irritants. Hence, a study was designed to assess oral hygiene status, gingival status, periodontal status, and treatment needs (TNs) among pregnant and nonpregnant women. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 120 pregnant and 120 nonpregnant women of 18-44 years age attending the Outpatient Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics in Government Hospital of Belgaum city, Karnataka, India. The study consisted of an interview and oral examination. Type 3 examination was followed. Simplified Oral Hygiene Index (OHI-S), Gingival Index, and Community Periodontal Index and TNs Index were used to assess \"oral hygiene status,\" \"gingival status,\" and \"periodontal status and TNs,\" respectively. The pregnant women showed poor oral hygiene with the mean OHI-S score as 2.68. Gingivitis was prevalent in almost all the pregnant and nonpregnant women. However, it was found more severe in pregnant women with mean gingival score as 1.25. A definite increase in gingivitis was found from Trimester II to Trimester III. The mean number of sextants showing healthy gingiva was significantly (P &lt; 0.01) lower among pregnant women. Pregnant women showed poor oral hygiene, more gingival inflammation, and more periodontal disease as compared to nonpregnant women. The severity of gingivitis increased in Trimester III.

The objective of this study is to investigate if the subgingival plaque biofilm resistance can be reduced using doxycycline in the presence of low-intensity electric field (bioelectric effect). The study was an in vitro microbiological study. Subgingival plaque samples from chronic periodontitis patients were collected to grow subgingival plaque biofilms on hydroxyapatite disks. Hydroxyapatite disks with the plaque biofilms from each patient were divided into four groups: (i) No intervention - control, (ii) current alone - CU; (iii) doxycycline - AB, and (iv) combined treatment - CU + AB. After respective treatments, the disks were anaerobically incubated for 48 h, the biofilm was dispersed and subcultured and colony-forming unit\/mL was estimated in all the four groups. Statistical analysis was done using Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests for intergroup comparisons. T-test was done to assess the difference in current flow between the groups CU and CU + AB. All the three treatment modalities showed antibacterial effect. Application of current alone resulted in reduced bacterial growth than control group. Doxycycline alone resulted in reduction in bacterial counts better than control and current alone groups. The combination treatment showed greatest inhibition of bacterial colonies. The ability of doxycycline antibiotic in inhibiting plaque biofilm was significantly enhanced by application of a weak electric field (5 volts for 2 min).

MCI correlation with MI (P &lt; 0.0001), PMI (P &lt; 0.0001) and age (P = 0.0029) indicated a highly significant variance. The positive association between MCI and chronic periodontitis in postmenopausal women confirms the high risk of osteoporosis in them. Furthermore, an increased percentage of patients with undetected decrease in BMD may be identified by screening with digital panoramic radiographs which are done on a routine basis for periodontal and other dental diseases and thus could be used as an effective aid to quantify bone density in future. ","459":"Periodontitis and atherosclerosis represent a chronic inflammatory process. The incidence of periodontitis in cardiac patients with atherosclerosis is a well-established fact. The role of viruses in the etiopathogenesis of both has been proposed. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of Torque Teno virus (TTV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) in cardiac patients with atherosclerosis and coexisting chronic periodontitis (CP). Thirty patients (17 males and 13 females) with atherosclerotic plaques and coexisting periodontitis were recruited for this cross-sectional study. Viral DNA was extracted from the subgingival and atheromatous plaque. The presence of CMV, EBV, and TTV in the plaque samples was identified using polymerase chain reaction. The collected data were statistically analyzed for the prevalence of the viruses and Chi-squared test was performed to find out its association with atheroma and CP. The prevalence of CMV, EBV, and TTV in atheromatous plaque was 63.3%, 56.7%, and 46.7%, respectively, as compared to rates of 80%, 63.3%, and 53.3% in subgingival plaque. Results also indicated no significant association of CMV, EBV, and TTV in both samples (P = 0.08, 0.346, and 0.261, respectively). There was no significant association of CMV, EBV, and TTV between subgingival and atheromatous plaque. The prevalence of CMV, EBV, and TTV was high in atheromatous plaque. TTV was isolated from more than 50% of participants in atheromatous plaque, which is a significant finding. ","460":"Association of neutrophil function abnormalities with localized aggressive periodontitis (LAP) has been reported in Indian population. There are no published studies on the familial aggregation of aggressive periodontitis (AP) and neutrophil function abnormalities associated with it in Indian population. The present study aimed to assess neutrophil chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and microbicidal activity in AP patients and their family members of Indian origin, who may or may not be suffering from AP. Eighteen families with a total of 51 individuals (18 probands, 33 family members) were included. Neutrophil chemotaxis was evaluated against an alkali-soluble casein solution using Wilkinson's method. Phagocytosis and microbicidal activity assay were performed using Candida albicans as an indicator organism. The magnitude of association between the presence of defective neutrophil function and LAP or GAP was calculated using odds ratio and relative risk. Total incidence of AP, and in particular, LAP in the families attributable to the presence of defective neutrophil function was calculated by attributable risk. The association between depressed neutrophil chemotaxis and presence of AP and LAP or GAP in all the family members (n = 51) was found to be significant (P &lt; 0.05) while that for phagocytic and microbicidal activity were observed to be nonsignificant. The results of the present study suggest high incidence of AP (LAP and GAP) within families was associated with depressed neutrophil chemotaxis. High prevalence of depressed neutrophil chemotaxis in the family members (61%) of LAP probands exhibiting depressed chemotaxis suggests that the observed abnormalities in neutrophil functions may also be inherited by the family members. ","461":"The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate whether patients with gingival recession would benefit from an acellular dermal matrix graft (ADMG) in ways that are comparable to the gold standard of the subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG). A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing ADMG to SCTG for the treatment of Miller Class I and II recession defects was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Excerpta Medica Database, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched up to March 2016 for controlled trials with minimum 6 months duration. The primary outcome was root coverage; secondary outcomes included attachment level change, keratinized tissue (KT) change, and patient-based outcomes. Both authors independently assessed the quality of each included trial and extracted the relevant data. From 158 potential titles, 17 controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis. There were no differences between ADMG and SCTG for mean root coverage, percent root coverage, and clinical attachment level gain. ADMG was statistically better than SCTG for gain in width of KT (-0.43 mm; 95% confidence interval: -0.72, -0.15). Only one study compared patient-based outcomes. This review found that an ADMG would be a suitable root coverage substitute for an SCTG when avoidance of the second surgical site is preferred. ","462":"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are biological molecules bridging the innate and acquired immune systems of the defense mechanism. They have been found to be effective against not only Gram-positive and -negative bacterial species but also fungi and viruses with their broad spectrum of activity. Among the various niches where they are found in the human body, in the oral cavity, the AMPs are secreted by the epithelial cells, defense cells, crevicular fluid, and in the salivary secretions and form the first line of defense against bacterial invasion. The present review gathers information from a number of literature reviews, systematic reviews articles, and original research work to come to a conclusion regarding the use of AMPs. AMPs are miraculous in that they either do not or develop resistance very slowly and hence are supposed to be great candidates for developing antibiotics. Their use in mouthwash formulations, topical applications, etc., as therapeutic modalities has found some success in the past but is still undergoing trials. In periodontal disease, their active role as biomarkers by the relative upregulations and downregulations during disease progression has also been recognized. The early recognition of these biomarker changes can help regulate the progression of periodontal diseases. They also control the development and progression of biofilm formation and might potentially contribute toward the development of therapeutic mimetics, probiotics, and antibiotics in the near future.","463":"","464":"","465":"Iatrogenic trauma though not serious is very common in dental practice. Orthodontic treatment can inflict such injuries as they are prolonged over a long period of time. Ill-fabricated orthodontic appliances, such as wires and brackets, or the patients' habits such as application of constant pressure over the appliance can traumatize the adjacent oral soft tissues.

Eight implants were placed in the maxilla, and after 12 months, a surgical reopening was performed, along with rehabilitation with a protocol-type prosthesis, for which a zirconia infrastructure was made. The patient was observed during a 10-month follow-up period in which an effective osseointegration of all implants was achieved as a result of such a technique. The split-crest technique followed by the immediate placement of implants and a particulate allogeneic bone graft proved to be effective, with a predictable osseointegration.","468":"Generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAP) is a rare form of periodontitis resulting in early loss of teeth. Most of the clinical evidence available in literature focuses on the diagnosis and management aspects of GAP. Systemic manifestations of GAP have been reported infrequently. To the best of our knowledge, the present case report is the first-ever evidence providing a possible mechanism and link between GAP, dimorphic anemia, and mental depression suggesting that dimorphic anemia and mental depression are probable systemic manifestations of GAP. A young female reported with her father to the hospital with a complaint of pain in her oral cavity and lack of desire to eat. On thorough examination, GAP with dimorphic anemia and mental depression were diagnosed. Periodontal treatment along with nutritional supplements was prescribed. An improvement was noticed in the patient's condition after a follow-up period of 6 months. Systemic manifestations of GAP should include the diagnoses of dimorphic anemia and mental depression and should be treated accordingly.","469":"Gingival enlargement is a very common side effect associated with the administration of several drugs, mainly anticonvulsants, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and immunosuppressants. Amlodipine (a CCB) is a safe antihypertensive drug with a longer duration of action. Gingival enlargement induced by amlodipine is less prevalent among CCBs. Since the pathogenesis is not well understood, it is still a challenge for clinicians to diagnose and manage cases effectively. This case presents an atypical unilateral palatal gingival enlargement in a 61-year-old hypertensive female taking amlodipine. Difficulty for a pathologist in diagnosing in spite of repeated sample submission from the lesion and repeated failure for the operator to reach the underlying pathology due to amlodipine-induced hyperplasia have also been discussed in this case report.","470":"The consequences of periodontal disease are not limited to the oral cavity. As schools are considered to be one of the principal systems in preventive oral health, teachers' knowledge pertaining to the periodontal disease, their awareness with regard to its implications and their role in increasing the awareness of the students regarding this disease comprises only one aspect with respect to the prevention of the periodontal disease. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the baseline awareness and knowledge of Saudi primary school teachers regarding the periodontal disease. For this purpose, a questionnaire was distributed among the participants of the study. It was observed that 91.4% of the participants reported that the periodontal disease does not need any treatment although 70% of the participants believed that it could result in tooth loss, and 95% considered the periodontal disease to be a preventable disease. Moreover, social media (44%) and television advertisements (39%) were the main sources from where they acquired information about the periodontal disease. Most participants have heard about the importance of periodontal health but are not sufficiently aware of its consequences and negative effects on their body. They are used to receiving information about periodontal diseases from nondental clinics and unreliable sources. This creates misconceptions. Although the participants were keen to attend educational events on periodontal health, the lack of medical communication between the health practitioners and the general public is evident. Mostly, investigated areas and individuals do not have any educational means to be aware of periodontal health.

It not only encompasses clinical and theoretical skills which play a crucial role in the success of therapy but also a lot of intrinsic work is accomplished in dentistry. In a journey to fulfill the above accomplishments and for facilitating early diagnosis of pathologies which usually go unnoticed, a clearer and magnified field of vision are also essential. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the awareness, attitude, and prevalence of the usage of magnification devices among the dental practitioners in the state of Andhra Pradesh. A questionnaire-based study was conducted to assess the awareness, attitude, and prevalence of magnification devices among the 370 dental practitioners in Andhra Pradesh. All the participants were provided with a prestructured questionnaire comprising of 24 questions and answering was completely self-based. Among the participants, majority were aware about magnification in dentistry (91.1%), and also of the different types of magnification devices available (90.5%). On the other hand, when the reason for not using magnification devices was taken into consideration, 32.7% attributed that they have not experienced the devices and 32.4% felt that devices were too expensive. Moreover, when regarding the usage of devices was taken into account, only 23.8% of the total participants were exposed to the usage of magnification aids. Among the selected group of participants, even though majority were aware of magnification in dentistry its application in practice was very less.

Till date, a standardized procedure to treat DH is missing, though several alternative treatment strategies have been designed, including laser therapies. The aim of the study was to treat DH with minimum chemical concentration and least laser energy level with longer follow-up period. One hundred and twenty patients were randomly divided into four groups: (i) Group 1-5% potassium nitrate (KNO3); (ii) Group 2 - gallium-aluminum-arsenide diode laser (62.2 J\/cm2, wavelength - 980 nm, noncontact pulse mode, and power wattage - 0.5 W); (iii) Group 3 - combined 5% KNO3 and the diode laser; and (iv) Group 4 - placebo (control). The visual analog scale (VAS) scores were recorded, analyzed, and compared to tactile stimuli, cold water, and air blast tests at different intervals for 6 weeks. Synergistic use of 5% KNO3 and diode laser (Group 3) significantly reduced the DH pain, which was almost negligible after 6th week (97%-99% of the pain was reported to be relieved) and showed promising results than any other studied groups. Further, the diode laser (Group 2) showed better results than 5% KNO3 (Group 1). One-way ANOVA and Bonferroni correction post hoc test revealed the combination of groups with significant differences in the mean VAS scores at the different interval of time (P &lt; 0.01).

The etiology of such defects is still unclear, though many hypotheses such as occlusal traumatism, trauma, and variation in root bone angulation have been put forward. Diagnosis of such defects is challenging clinically, and they cannot be appreciated in conventional radiographs. In many instances, they are accidentally discovered during periodontal and oral surgical procedures. These defects, if not treated, can affect prognosis and complicate healing of the affected teeth.

Obesity is excessive body fat in proportion to lean body mass, to such an extent that health is impaired. Obesity, a serious public health problem, relates to a chronic low-grade systemic inflammation and is involved in the development of obesity-linked disorders including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome. The accurate process whereby obesity can affect periodontal health is so far unclear. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between obesity (using body mass index [BMI] and waist circumference [WC]) and periodontal health and disease using various periodontal parameters. A total of 100 participants were randomly taken and were divided into two groups (fifty participants per group). The participants with BMI more than 30 were considered as obese and participants with BMI &lt;30 were considered nonobese. WC was also measured. Gingival index (GI), pocket probing depth (PPD), gingival recession (REC), and clinical attachment level (CAL) were measured by a single examiner. Independent t-test was performed to compare GI, probing depth, gingival recession, and clinical attachment level among obese and nonobese participants. The prevalence of periodontitis was significantly more in obese as compared to nonobese group (P &lt; 0.05 for GI, P &lt; 0.05 for PPD, and P &lt; 0.031 for CAL). Strong correlation was found to exist between obesity and periodontitis. Obese participants could be at a greater risk of developing periodontal disease.

Twenty sites were selected based on the selection criteria which included patients within the age group of 20-50 years and the presence of Class I and Class II recession of the papilla in the maxillary anterior region. They were divided randomly into Group A and Group B. Group A sites were treated with modified Beagle's technique, whereas Group B sites were treated by the Beagle's technique. The patients were recalled at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months postsurgery. Parameters including classification of loss of papilla height (Nordland and Tarnow), change in vertical dimension, mesiodistal dimension and area of the papillary defect, and radiographic parameters (papilla height and bone crest-root apex distance) were recorded preoperatively and postoperatively. At 6-month postsurgery, there was a statistically significant reduction in vertical dimension, mesiodistal dimension, and area of the papilla defect in Group A compared to Group B. At 6-month postsurgery, there was an increase in the height of the papilla in Group A, whereas there was a decrease in the height of the papilla in Group B. At 6-month postsurgery too, there was a reduction in the mean bone crest-root apex distance in both groups.

Our study was aimed to quantify and compare the red complex microorganisms in obese or overweight and normal weight participants with and without chronic periodontitis to identify obesity as a risk for the presence of red complex bacteria. The study group consisted of 120 participants of age between 20 and 45 years of both the sexes. According to periodontal status, the participants were categorized into four groups as follows: thirty overweight or obese individuals with generalized chronic periodontitis (Group I), thirty normal weight individuals with chronic periodontitis (Group II), thirty overweight or obese individuals with healthy periodontium (Group III), and thirty normal weight individuals with healthy periodontium (Group IV). After the assessment of periodontal parameters, subgingival plaque sample collection was carried out to quantify the red complex bacteria by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Increase in red complex bacterial count was seen in group I compared to other groups. A positive correlation of red complex bacteria with body mass index and waist circumference was seen in Group I and III. In our study, obese individuals with periodontal disease harbored increased red complex bacteria. This states that the obesity could be a risk for the colonization of red complex microorganisms, which in turn may further lead to periodontal inflammation.

The present case report describes the successful treatment of a young woman with an excess gingival display caused by a hyperactive upper lip and a mild vertical maxillary excess that was treated with a laser-assisted lip repositioning surgical technique accompanied by gingival recontouring. The procedure was accomplished by laser-assisted removal, through scraping a strip of mucosa from the maxillary buccal vestibule and suturing the mucosa of the lip to the mucogingival junction. This technique resulted in shortened vestibule and restricted the muscle pull of the elevator muscles of the lip, thereby reducing gingival display when the patient smiles. Laser-assisted lip repositioning surgery can be a viable, minimally invasive alternative to orthognathic surgery.","518":"Generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAP) is a debilitating form of the disease and it results in deteriorating effects on the esthetic and functional aspects of the oral cavity. This case report describes the comprehensive rehabilitation of GAP patient using dental implants. The treatment planning involved thorough scaling and root planning (SRP) with oral hygiene instructions. The patient was motivated to adhere to a strict oral hygiene regimen following which periodontal flap surgery employing guided tissue regeneration and bone grafts was performed. Bacterial culture for anaerobic microorganisms was done using a gas pack pre- and postperiodontal treatment to confirm the effectiveness of the periodontal treatment regimen and also to proceed with dental implant placement. The rigorous maintenance program ensured the stability of the periodontium following which immediate placement of dental implants in the maxillary and mandibular anterior region was done.

Multistage stratified random sampling and randomized cluster sampling were used in the selection of schools and study participants, respectively, in three educational districts of Kozhikode. Periodontal disease was assessed among 2000 school children aged 15-17 years, by community periodontal index. A content validated questionnaire was used to evaluate the sociodemographic characteristics and other risk factors. The prevalence of periodontal disease was estimated as 75% (72% gingivitis and 3% mild periodontitis). The prevalence was higher in urban population (P = 0.049) and males had significantly (P = 0.001) higher prevalence. Lower socioeconomic strata experienced slightly more periodontal disease burden. Satisfactory oral hygiene practices (material and frequency) were observed, but oral hygiene techniques were erroneous. Unhealthy dental treatment-seeking practices and unfavorable attitude toward dental treatment (ATDT) significantly influenced periodontal health status. Overall awareness about dental treatment was poor in this study population. The prevalence of periodontal disease among 15-17-year-old school children in Kozhikode district is 75% and is influenced by sociodemographic characteristics. Other risk factors identified were unhealthy dental treatment-seeking practices and unfavorable ATDT. Implementation of well-formulated oral health education programs is thus mandatory.

A randomized, controlled triple blind trial was carried out among 108 children in B. V. S Municipallity Girls High school in Nellore. Children were randomly allocated into four groups comprising 27 in each group. Four mouthrinses composed of 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate; 0.05% sodium fluoride, 10.6% stevioside and placebo were provided to the study participants. Plaque index, gingival index, and International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS) II, respectively, were used for assessing oral condition. The mouthrinsing was carried out for 6 months. Group C showed maximum reduction of 8% and 10% on plaque and gingival scores, respectively, followed by Group A and Group B. However, Group D participants showed 1.5% and 1.8% increase in plaque and gingival scores, respectively. Analysis of ICDAS scores at 6 months indicated that values recorded were same as baseline for all the three groups except that for Group D, there was an increase in the prevalence of cavitated lesion D2-6from 5.6% to 5.8%.

Furthermore, there is little knowledge about oral health practices among caretakers and visually impaired individuals, due to which oral health is often neglected when compared to the general health. Hence, there was a need to educate visually challenged individuals about oral hygiene practices in a customized format so that the comprehension of brushing techniques could be conveyed at its best. The present study was a randomized control trial of sixty visually impaired adolescents who were divided into three groups of 20 each. In Group 1, Braille was used, whereas in Group 2, audio-tactile performance (ATP) technique and in Group 3, a combination of both the methods were used to teach tooth brushing as a part of oral health education. Pre- and post-plaque index score using Silness and Loe (1967) after health education were calculated and tabulated for statistical analysis. The postintervention mean plaque index score increased in Group 1 from 29.45 to 42.98, whereas the mean plaque score decreased in Groups 2 and 3 from 30.83-29.9 to 30.23-18.73, respectively. Intergroup comparison of postplaque index score using Kruskal-Wallis and ANOVA analysis showed significant difference among all three study groups. The combination of Braille and ATP technique of health education served as the most effective medium to teach oral hygiene methods to visually impaired adolescents.

Nitrous oxide-oxygen inhalation sedation is very effective for adult patients with mild-to-moderate anxiety due to dental procedures and needle phobia. The present study was designed to perform periodontal surgical procedures under nitrous oxide-oxygen inhalation sedation and assess whether this technique actually reduces stress physiologically, in comparison to local anesthesia alone (LA) during lengthy periodontal surgical procedures. This was a randomized, split-mouth, cross-over study. A total of 16 patients were selected for this randomized, split-mouth, cross-over study. One surgical session (SS) was performed under local anesthesia aided by nitrous oxide-oxygen inhalation sedation, and the other SS was performed on the contralateral quadrant under LA. For each session, blood samples to measure and evaluate serum cortisol levels were obtained, and vital parameters including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and arterial blood oxygen saturation were monitored before, during, and after periodontal surgical procedures. Paired t-test and repeated measure ANOVA. The findings of the present study revealed a statistically significant decrease in serum cortisol levels, blood pressure and pulse rate and a statistically significant increase in respiratory rate and arterial blood oxygen saturation during periodontal surgical procedures under nitrous oxide inhalation sedation. Nitrous oxide-oxygen inhalation sedation for periodontal surgical procedures is capable of reducing stress physiologically, in comparison to LA during lengthy periodontal surgical procedures.

A total of 15 systemically healthy individuals between the age group of 15-25 years requiring third molar or orthodontic premolar extractions. Teeth were extracted atraumatically and transported to the laboratory. Stem cells were isolated from dental pulp and periodontal ligament. After attaining more than 90% confluency by the 7th day, these cells were tested for their viability and characterization. Stem cells were also incubated with PRF and viability was assessed on the 7th day. The mean number of cell for dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) and periodontal ligament stem cell (PDLSC) was statistically insignificant (P &gt; 0.05). The mean live cell viability was compared between DPSC (98.07%) and PDLSC (98%). Both DPSC and PDLSC showed a high percentage of expression of CD73 markers, 30.40% and 29.80%, respectively. However, DPSCs and PDLSCs lacked expression of CD34 expressing only 3.47% and 3.53%, respectively. PRF membrane as a scaffold exhibited no cytotoxic effects on DPCS's or PDLSC's. The cell viability of cells cultured with PRF was statistically insignificant (P &gt; 0.05) when compared to the cells cultured with culture media. The study thus indicates that dental pulp and periodontal ligament are both rich sources of mesenchymal stem cells and can be successfully used for obtaining stem cells. PRF exhibits no cytotoxic effects on the cells and can be used in conjunction with dental stem cells. ","546":"Plaque control has been shown to have a pivotal role in maintaining optimal periodontal health. Toothbrushing as a mechanical plaque control tool is the most popular and effective option for self-performed oral health maintenance. However, the detrimental effects of bristle hardness and force exerted by toothbrushes on the tooth surface are the areas of concern. The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the abrasive effect of two different manual toothbrushes exerting predetermined forces on cemental surfaces of the teeth. Sixty extracted first molars were selected. Totally six experimental groups were formed based on the three predetermined forces 1.5, 3, and 4.5 Newton (N) and two types of manual toothbrushes, i.e., soft and medium bristle hardness. Buccal and lingual surfaces were independently brushed for 5000 cycles using specially designed toothbrushing machine. Throughout the experiment, type and quantity of toothpaste were kept constant. Post 5000 cycles of toothbrushing, change in surface roughness was measured using profilometer in microns and change in weight indicating loss of substance was measured in milligrams. Abrasion of cementum is force dependent. Data revealed that both soft and medium bristle hardness toothbrushes cause significant cemental abrasion at 3 and 4.5 N forces. Higher is the force, more is the cemental surface abrasion. Soft bristled toothbrush causes more cemental abrasion than medium bristled toothbrush at 3 and 4.5 N forces.

Notably, periodontal disease, considered one of the most common inflammatory disorders in the oral cavity, has also been linked to the onset of other chronic inflammatory diseases common in the elderly. Thus, investigating immunity and inflammation during senescence may not only illuminate the pathophysiology of periodontal disease, but also identify new therapeutic targets. To this end, we retrospectively and systematically reviewed studies of immune molecules associated with periodontal disease. These studies were identified in PubMed from three independent searches based on distinct sets of search terms. The data highlight the need to further investigate inflammatory molecules involved in chronic periodontal disease in the elderly, but strongly suggest that interleukin (IL)-33 is involved. Indeed, various genetic and environmental factors appear to contribute to pathogenesis via IL-33. The IL-33 axis may be promising therapeutic target in elderly patients.

The present case report describes the replacement of a single mandibular first molar with two narrow-diameter implants, in a 41-year- old male patient. No postoperative complications were reported in the 3-year follow-up period. The placement of two narrow-diameter implants replacing a missing mandibular molar could eliminate the mesiodistal bending, double the support capacity in the buccolingual direction, and minimize stress on the implants.","551":"Moderate-to-severe chronic periodontitis results in clinical loss of attachment, reduced width of attached gingiva (AG), periodontal pockets beyond mucogingival junction (MGJ), gingival recession, loss of alveolar bone, and decreased vestibular depth (VD). The encroachment of frenal and muscle attachments on marginal gingiva increases the rate of progression of periodontal pockets, prevents healing, and causes their recurrence after therapy. Loss of VD and AG associated with continuous progression of pocket formation and bone loss requires two-stage surgical procedures. In this article, one-stage surgical procedure is being described for the first time, to treat the periodontal pockets extending beyond the MGJ by periodontal flap surgery along with vestibular deepening with diode laser to increase the AG. One-step surgical technique is illustrated whereby pocket therapy with reconstruction of lost periodontal tissues can be done along with gingival augmentation by vestibular deepening.","552":"There are many etiological factors for nonplaque-induced gingival diseases, out of which physical trauma due to psychiatric reasons leading to self-infliction is less studied upon.

These cases were recruited into the study only when they fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Vertical probing depth (VPD) and horizontal probing depth (HPD) of furcation defects were measured with and without opening the flap, following local anesthesia during initial surgery and at 6 months after collagen membrane placement. The defect fill (DF) was also noted. The mean measurements of clinical parameters were compared by two-tailed paired t-test at 5% level of significance. The difference between the measurements of VPD and HPD taken during transgingival probing and after opening the flap was lie in the range of 0.10-0.30 mm at the time of initial surgery and 6 months after surgery that was not statistically significant. Persons experienced slight discomfort or pain during opening the flap as compared to transgingival probing, and this method was also appreciated by the patients as it is easy, simple and does not involve the surgical procedure. The results of the study suggest that measurements recorded during transgingival probing and after opening the flap do not influence the required outcome of regenerative therapies, i.e., DF that was not statistically significant difference from surgical reentry.

This study aimed to investigate antibacterial capabilities of gallium-arsenic (Ga-As) laser on photosensitized periodontopathic organisms. The three bacteria selected for the study were Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella intermedia. The subjects for the study were selected from the patients visiting the Department of Periodontics, Karnataka Lingayat Education Society's Institute of Dental Sciences, Belgaum. In vitro study design. Subgingival plaque samples collected from chronic periodontitis patients were cultured anaerobically for 72 h. Predetermined number of colonies of each bacterium was taken and was then divided into cases and control groups. Both groups were photosensitized using toluidine blue O (TBO) dye and the case groups were irradiated with Ga-As laser. Bacterial colonies were then serially diluted and were incubated for subculture. After incubation period, the number of viable bacterial count was performed. Wilcoxon-signed rank test was carried out to determine significance of reduction on subsequent dilution within the bacterial group. Mann-Whitney U-test was performed to determine the significance of reduction between cases and control of particular bacterial group. The results revealed substantial reduction in the viable bacterial count. F. nucleatum was found to be most sensitive to killing by laser irradiation followed by P. intermedia and then P. gingivalis. Further, the TBO dye per se did not have any significant bactericidal effect. Photodynamic Therapy may prove to be a promising method for eradicating periodontopathic bacteria in near future.

The aim of this review is to know the different animal models used in various specialties of dental research and to know the ethical guidelines prior to the usage of experimental models with main emphasis on how to refine, replace, and reduce the number of animal models usage in the laboratory. An online search for experimental animal models used in dental research was performed using MEDLINE\/PubMed database. Publications from 2009 to May 2013 in the specialty of periodontics were included in writing this review. A total of 652 references were published in PubMed\/MEDLINE databases based on the search terms used. Out of 245 studies, 241 were related to the periodontal research published in English from 2009 to 2013. Relevant papers were chosen according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. After extensive electronic and hand search on animal models, it has been observed that various animal models were used in dental research. Search on animal models used for dental research purpose revealed that various animals such as rats, mice, guinea pigs, rabbit, beagle dogs, goats, and nonhuman primates were extensively used. However, with the new advancement of ex vivo animal models, it has become easy to investigate disease pathogenesis and to test the efficacy of newer therapeutic modalities with the reduced usage of animal models. This review summarized the large amount of literature on animal models used in periodontal research with main emphasis on ethical guidelines and on reducing the animal model usage in future perspective.","587":"","588":"","589":"The aim of this report is to diagnose the cause for episodic, shifting type of mild inflammation in the isolated areas of gingiva noted by the patient for 1 year. A 33-year-old female patient presented with a chief complaint of mild pain and occasional burning sensation confined to the gingiva to the Department of Periodontology and Oral Implantology. Clinical presentation of the gingiva was seen to mimic mild form of gingivitis for 1 year, with no noted systemic involvement gingival biopsy was performed. The presence of Tzanck cell was noted along with intraepithelial split pointing toward pemphigus.

APLAs in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) are well-known risk factors for cerebrovascular accidents. Stroke is the most common manifestation of APS in the central nervous system. Gingival enlargement is a known side effect of phenytoin which is an antiepileptic drug. This can have a significant effect on the quality of life as well as increasing the oral bacterial load by generating plaque retention sites. The management of gingival overgrowth seems to be directed at controlling gingival inflammation through a good oral hygiene regimen. Thus, this case report aims to describe the conservative management of phenytoin-induced gingival enlargement combined with inflammatory enlargement in a patient with APLA syndrome.","591":"The palatal approach of anterior superior alveolar (P-ASA) using WAND injection was reported to effectively provide a profound bilateral maxillary anesthesia of the soft tissue of anterior one-third of the palate and facial gingivae extending from canine to canine which lasted for more than an hour thus making it ideal for scaling root planing and minor periodontal procedures in the anterior maxilla. Our study suggests that the conventional P-ASA injection is of very short duration and the extent of anesthesia was not profound and consistent. This has not been reported earlier in the literature. Thirty-five cases (20 males and 15 females), who underwent scaling, root planing and minor periodontal surgical procedures such as abscess drainage, gingivectomy, and frenectomy in the maxillary anterior region in the age range of 19-45 years was assessed for the efficacy of the P-ASA injection. After the administration of the P-ASA injection, the subjective and the objective symptoms were used to evaluate the extent and duration of the anesthesia at 10, 15, and 20 min. This study suggests that the conventional P-ASA injection technique does not provide anesthesia for more than 20 min. Wilcoxon matched pairs test was used to compare the effect of anesthesia at the different time intervals and the results were found to be statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05). The conventional P-ASA injection technique is of very short duration and does not demonstrate effectiveness in periodontal surgery of the anterior maxilla.

Studies have demonstrated its anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and regenerative effects. The present study aimed to assess the clinical effects of the subgingival application of 0.8% hyaluronic acid gel as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) in the treatment of generalized chronic periodontitis. Patients with chronic periodontitis were recruited to participate in a study with a split-mouth design and provided informed consent. One hundred sites were included in the study and divided into fifty test sites and fifty control sites. These were assessed for plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), pocket probing depths, and relative attachment level (RAL) at-pretreatment (baseline), 4, and 12 weeks posttreatment. The patients received full-mouth SRP. A 0.8% hyaluronan gel was administered subgingivally in the test sites at baseline and after 1 week. Significant differences between test and control were evaluated using the t-test, analysis of variance (test) followed by Bonferroni post hoc test. A significant reduction in PI and GI was observed in both groups at 12 weeks (P &lt; 0.05). Significant reduction in the pocket probing depths and gain RAL was observed in both the groups as compared to baseline (P &lt; 0.05). The hyaluronan group compared to control at 12 weeks showed statistically significant reduction in the probing pocket depth and gain in RAL (P &lt; 0.05). The subgingival application of 0.8% hyaluronan gel in conjunction with SRP may have a beneficial effect on periodontal health in patients with chronic periodontitis.

The purpose of the study aimed to evaluate clinically and microbiologically the effectiveness of locally delivered NBF technology gel as an adjunctive therapy to scaling and root planing (SRP) in the treatment of chronic periodontitis. Six chronic periodontitis patients with 76 sites and probing pocket depth (PD) between 5 and 7 mm were selected in a randomized controlled clinical trial. SRP was performed in both control and test group followed by NBF gel application in 38 sites. The plaque index, gingival index, papillary bleeding index, probing PD, and clinical attachment level (CAL) were recorded at baseline, 6 weeks, and 3 months. Supragingival microbial plaque analysis was done at baseline and 6 weeks interval. The statistical analysis with paired t-test was used to compare the test and control sites. From baseline to a period of 3 months, a statistically significant difference was seen between both groups for PD, CAL, P value being PD (P = 0.001) and CAL (P = 0.01) along with the significant reduction of colony-forming units of aerobic periodontopathogens.

The present study was conducted to assess the differences in oral hygiene practices among patients from different socioeconomic status (SES) visiting the Outpatient Department of the Sudha Rustagi College of Dental Sciences. A cross-sectional survey was conducted from June to October 2014 to assess the effect of SES on the oral hygiene habits. The questionnaire included the questions related to the demographic profile and assessment of the oral hygiene habits of the study population. Toothbrush and toothpaste were being used significantly (P &lt; 0.05) more by lower middle class (84.4%) and upper middle class (100.0%). A significantly higher frequency of cleaning teeth (twice a day) was reported among the lower middle class (17.2%) and upper middle class (21.5%). The majority (34.3%) of the study population changed their toothbrush once in 3 months. The cleaning of tongue was reported by patients belonging to the upper middle (62.0%), lower middle (52.1%), and upper lower class (30.0%). The use of tongue cleaner was reported to be significantly (P &lt; 0.05) more among upper middle (10.1%) class patients.

Careful clinical examination and thorough history taking form the basis for diagnosis of DIGO. Histopathological examination is often neglected; however, it is an important aid that helps in differential diagnosis. Cessation or change of drug and meticulous plaque control often leads to regression of the lesion, which however might need surgical correction for optimal maintenance of gingival health.

The use of probiotics in the treatment of periodontal disease has caught on over the last decade or so. This review was performed to determine whether administration of probiotics produced a lasting clinical benefit in the treatment of periodontal disease. A MEDLINE, Cochrane database and a hand search was performed on human randomized placebo controlled trials using probiotics in the treatment of periodontal disease. A total of thirteen papers which addressed the question of the use of probiotics in the treatment of periodontal disease were retrieved. Most of the studies reviewed showed only a short term benefit with regards to reduction in gingival inflammation and probing depth reduction. Lasting clinical benefits were not seen in any of the studies. At least four different combinations and strains of probiotics have been used in the studies. There also existed significant heterogeneity in the methodology of the studies reviewed. It was concluded that current regimens of probiotics in the treatment of periodontal disease produce only short-term clinical and microbiologic benefits.","602":"Human identification during mass disasters using the stereotyped techniques such as fingerprint analysis is a cumbersome task.

However, less is known about its contribution to the field of ophthalmology. Corneal diseases are among major causes of blindness affecting millions of people worldwide, for which synthetic keratoprosthesis was considered the last resort to restore vision. Yet, these synthetic keratoprosthesis suffered from serious limitations, especially the foreign body reactions invoked by them resulting in extrusion of the whole prosthesis from the eye. To overcome these shortcomings, an autologous osteo-odonto keratoprosthesis utilizing intraoral entities was introduced that could positively restore vision even in cases of severely damaged eyes. The successful functioning of this prosthesis, however, predominantly depended on the presence of a healthy periodontium for grafting. Therefore, the following short communication aims to acknowledge this lesser-known role of the periodontium and other oral structures in bestowing vision to the blind patients.

However, the decision to choose the most appropriate technique for a given recession site still remains a challenging task for clinicians. Mucogingival deformities such as shallow vestibule, frenal pull, or inadequate attached gingiva complicate the decision and limit the treatment options to an invasive procedure involving soft tissue grafts. The situation is further comprised if there is a nonavailability of adequate donor tissue and patients' unwillingness for procedures involving a second surgical site. In such situations, the recession either remains untreated or has poor treatment outcomes. This case report presents a modified pedicle graft technique for treatment of multiple gingival recessions with shallow vestibule and inadequate attached gingiva. The technique is a promising therapeutic alternative to invasive surgical procedures such as soft tissue grafts for treatment of multiple gingival recessions.

MMP can affect the mucous membranes of oral cavity, conjunctiva, nasopharynx, larynx, esophagus, genitourinary tract, and anus and vary in its severity. The most commonly affected sites are oral cavity and conjunctiva. Since DG may be the early sign or only presenting sign of these conditions, most of the times, dental surgeon plays a key role in the diagnosis and prevention of the systemic complications of these diseases. We report a case of a 41-year-old male patient presented with DG. Histopathological examination revealed subepithelial clefting suggestive of MMP. The patient was treated with topical application of triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% 3-4 times a day for 1 month. ","608":"Odontogenic tumors (OTs) arising from the periodontium are quite rare.

Most of the times, these tumors are located within the bone, only a very few peripheral cases been noted so far. Although predominantly benign, the possibility of a malignant transformation prevails. Our case describes a rare presentation of a peripheral SOT involving the upper anterior gingiva in a 59-year-old patient, which presented clinically as a firm and fibrotic swelling. An excisional biopsy was performed as a part of surgical management and for microscopic evaluation to confirm the clinical diagnosis.

","628":"Gingival Recession defects are one of the most common defects for which patients seek periodontal treatment. Many treatment options are available for the management of gingival recession. Most of the treatments offered aim to treat the cause, cover the denuded root surface and produce a long term aesthetic result. The use of periosteal pedicle graft (PPG) is a recent innovation for the treatment of gingival recession defects and has gained much attention in a short span of time. Although studies have been done utilizing PPG successfully for the treatment of gingival recession defects (GRD) but it is still not clear, whether PPG technique should be included in the established list of techniques used to treat GRD? An effort has been made to arrive at a decision on the current utility of PPG in the treatment of GRD based on the scientific evidence available in literature. A review of current literature was done to critically evaluate the evidence related to the Periosteal pedicle graft technique. Periosteal Pedicle Graft has come up as a viable treatment option for the treatment of GRD although it's still too early to predict the long-term results associated with PPG. ","629":"Gingival recession (GR) is a condition resulting in root exposure which leads to root sensitivity, pain, root caries, plaque retention, poor esthetics, and tooth loss. Sites exhibiting Miller Class III and IV GR are not suitable for treatment with surgical root coverage techniques, and their prognosis are very poor with current techniques. In this case report, pedicled buccal fat pad (PBFP) was employed as subepithelial graft technique for root coverage of maxillary tooth with Class III GR defect along with furcation involvement and the absence of keratinized gingiva. PBFP as the subepithelial graft is likely to increase the predictability and outcome of root coverage procedures in the treatment of cases with poor prognosis, owing to its pedicled vascularity. PBFP may be considered as a reliable modality for root coverage of such severe maxillary posterior GR defects, as reported, that could not be repaired by other conventional procedures.

However, treating multiple recession cases is quite challenging, and therefore requires constant modifications of the prevalent treatment strategies as per the severity of the condition. The objective of this case report was to evaluate the effectiveness of coronally advanced flap (CAF) technique without vertical incisions using CAF brackets (CAF+B) for treating a patient presenting with class II gingival recession defects in relation to maxillary anteriors. Complete root coverage was observed, and the results were consistent even after 6 months. The current case report demonstrates good outcomes of the CAF + B technique without the use of any additional soft tissue grafts or vertical incisions, therefore, endorsing the promising potential of the CAF + B technique in multiple gingival recession cases. ","632":"Mucoepidermoid carcinomas (MECs) of minor salivary gland origin are rare in children and adolescents and have been reported rarely. Literature regarding their clinical features and biologic behavior is scanty. The purpose of this case report is to discuss the clinical manifestation, diagnosis, and treatment plan of MEC of the palate. A 16-year-old male subject visited the Department of Periodontics, The Oxford Dental College and Hospital, Bangalore, India complaining of a painless swelling in the left posterior area of the hard palate since 6 months. Several clinical, radiographic, and histopathological investigations were carried out to rule out the lesion. Incisional biopsy of the lesion confirmed the diagnosis of lesion as MEC of the palate following which a wide surgical excision with adjacent free margins was carried out. This case report highlights the need for proper diagnosis and treatment plan in the cases of malignant tumors as it can lead to morbidity and mortality.

Buccal mucosa is the most common intraoral site of lipoma followed by tongue, floor of the mouth, and buccal vestibule. The involvement of mucogingival junction is rare. We present a unique case report of oral lipoma occurring on mandibular mucogingival junction with review of literature which has emphasis on differential diagnosis. ","634":"Role of various etiologic factors in periodontal disease has been investigated by means of epidemiologic surveys and clinical studies. The community periodontal index of treatment needs (CPITN) provides a picture of the public health requirements in the periodontal field, which is essential for national oral health policy-making and specific interventions. This study was conducted on 4000 individuals among rural, semi-urban, and metro population of Gurgaon District, Haryana State, to find out the oral health status and periodontal treatment needs (TNs) using CPITN index. An inference was drawn from the results that among 4000 participants from all the four population groups' maximum, i.e., 63.80% of individuals needed TN2 whereas 18.20% of individuals needed TN3 and 18.10% of individuals needed TN1. It can be concluded with a word of hope and a word of warning. Hope lies in the fact that the measurement of periodontal diseases by epidemiological study of this condition is improving and receiving wide spread attention. The warning lies in the varied nature of the condition which goes to make up periodontal disease and perplexing ways in which these conditions blend. In addition to dental practitioner, periodontist and public health workers must devote more time and effort toward controlling periodontal disease than they seem to be devoting at present.

For each patient, venous blood sample were collected, and the estimation of total leukocyte count (TLC), differential leukocyte count, platelet count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was carried out. All the clinical and hematological parameters were measured at baseline, 1 week and 2 weeks after nonsurgical periodontal therapy. The study results showed that there was a statistically significant decrease in TLC, ESR, and platelet count at 1 week and 2 weeks following nonsurgical periodontal therapy. In this study, it has been concluded that there is a decrease in the hematological parameters after nonsurgical periodontal therapy, which may also reduce the risk of atherosclerosis formation in the blood vessel and possibly prevent cardiovascular diseases.

This cross-sectional study included 10 male subjects in the age group of 20-45 years. After analyzing the width of keratinized gingiva of the maxillary right central incisor, the radiographic assessment was done using a modified technique for RVG and CBCT, to measure the thickness of both the labial gingiva and labial plate of alveolar bone at 4 predetermined locations along the length of the root in each case. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test and Pearson's correlation test, with the help of statistical software (SPSS V13). No statistically significant differences were obtained in the measurement made using RVG and CBCT. The results of the present study also failed to reveal any significant correlation between the width of gingiva and the alveolar bone in the maxillary anterior region.

Awareness of root morphology and the condition of the periodontal tissues is essential for reliable periodontal pocket probing and for effective debridement of root surfaces. Clinically, it is challenging to observe exact nature of complex periodontal attachment loss. The aim of the present study was to evaluate patterns of periodontal destruction based on vertical and horizontal attachment loss. A total of 200 extracted teeth were obtained from chronic periodontitis patients. Prior to extraction, clinical measurements were recorded and after extraction, the teeth were stained with crystal violet. Root length, vertical and horizontal attachment loss were measured using digital caliper. There was a significant difference between clinical attachment level and vertical attachment loss for both maxillary and mandibular teeth. Mean vertical attachment loss varied between 5.17 mm and 9.17 mm. Interproximal surfaces exhibited statistically significant vertical attachment loss in both maxillary and mandibular dentition. Results indicated that vertical attachment loss was more severe with teeth belonging to the anterior sextant whereas the horizontal attachment loss was more pronounced with posterior teeth. Both vertical and horizontal attachment loss were observed in all periodontally involved teeth.

Ninety-five patients were divided into three age groups: Group 1: (20-39 years); Group 2: (40-59 years); and Group 3: (60 years and above). PRF was prepared from blood samples of all patients and were subjected to cell block cytology method of histological analysis and slides were prepared to histologically assess the age-related changes in (i) fibrin network patterns in terms of density and (ii) entrapment of platelets and white blood cells (WBCs) within fibrin meshwork. Two types of fibrin network pattern arrangements noticed: Dense and loose types in three age groups. However, there was a noticeable decrease in the dense type of fibrin network with progressing age and increase in the loose type of fibrin arrangement. Furthermore, variation in a number of platelets and WBCs entrapped within fibrin network in relation to age was noticed. From the current study it can be concluded that age can be considered as one of the influencing factors on quality of PRF in terms of fibrin network patterns and hence, platelet and WBCs entrapment within these fibrin networks.

Widespread use of drugs has resulted in the emergence of side effects, uncommon infections, and resistance. Plant medicine like Tulsi has been used in many clinical conditions, and it appears to be a suitable alternative to manage conditions affecting the oral cavity. Hence, the objective was to assess the in vitro antimicrobial activity of Tulsi leaves extract (Ocimum sanctum) on periodontal pathogens with doxycycline as standard, as doxycycline has been used as an adjunct to nonsurgical therapy in periodontitis patients. Ethanolic extract of Tulsi was prepared by cold extraction method. Extract was diluted with an inert solvent, dimethyl formamide, to obtain five different concentrations (0.5%, 1%, 2%, 5%, and 10%). Doxycycline was used as a positive control and dimethyl formamide, as a negative control. The extract and controls were subjected to the microbiological investigation against Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Agar well diffusion method was employed to determine the concentration at which Tulsi gave an inhibition zone, similar to doxycycline. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and Tukey post-hoc test was used for inter- and intra-group comparisons. At 5% and 10% concentrations, Tulsi extracts demonstrated antimicrobial activity against A. actinomycetemcomitans, similar to doxycycline with similar inhibition zones (P &gt; 0.05). P. gingivalis and P. intermedia, however, exhibited resistance to Tulsi extract that showed significantly smaller inhibition zones (P &lt; 0.05). Tulsi demonstrated effective antimicrobial property against A. actinomycetemcomitans, suggesting its possible use as an effective and affordable \"adjunct\" along with the standard care in the management of periodontal conditions. However, further research assessing the toxicity, durability, and other assessments followed by clinical trials is necessary to explore the potential of Tulsi in combating oral conditions.

The subgingival plaque was collected and immediately plated on selective media for Aa. The remaining plaque samples were used for DNA extraction. PCR was performed using specific primers for Aa. The detection of bacteria and the clinical parameters between the groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test. For assessing the agreement between the results of anaerobic culture and PCR, Kappa analyses were performed. Aa levels using culture and PCR was 51% and 69% in the CP group and 12% and 30% in the healthy group, respectively. The two groups showed significant differences (P &lt; 0.00001).

Miller in a conference at Pune in 2011. A semilunar vestibular incision technique described by Dr. P.D Miller was performed on two patients who presented with multiple recessions in the maxillary anterior teeth. About 90-100% root coverage was observed when the patients were on a follow-up for 1-year with a significant increase in the vestibular depth. The semilunar vestibular incision technique used in two cases resulted in predictable root coverage with a good color blend, an esthetic marginal morphology and most importantly the avoidance of the second surgical site.

This condition causes many difficulties such as limited tongue protrusion, breastfeeding difficulties, speech impairment and lack of self-confidence. It is very rarely associated with any other congenital craniofacial disorders such as cleft lip, X-linked cleft palate, Van der Woude syndrome, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, Orofacial digital syndrome, Beckwith Weidman syndrome or Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome. This article presents a rare case of ankyloglossia associated with cleft lip treated with diode laser in a 12-year-old Indian boy who had undergone surgical correction of associated cleft lip soon after birth. Correction of ankyloglossia at a young age would lead to enhanced phonetics, improved oral hygiene, and overall personality development.

It is frequently observed in adult subjects. The occurrence and severity of the gingival recession present considerable differences between populations. To prevent gingival recession from occurring, it is essential to detect the underlying etiology. The aim of the present study was to determine the occurrence of gingival recession and to identify the most common factor associated with the cause of gingival recession. A total of 710 subjects aged between 15 years to 60 years were selected. Data were collected by an interview with the help of a proforma and then the dental examination was carried out. The presence of gingival recession was recorded using Miller's classification of gingival recession. The Silness and Loe Plaque Index, Loe and Silness gingival index, community periodontal index were recorded. The data thus obtained were subjected to statistical analysis using Chi-square test and Student's unpaired t-test. Of 710 subjects examined, 291 (40.98%) subjects exhibited gingival recession. The frequency of gingival recession was found to increase with age. High frequency of gingival recession was seen in males (60.5%) compared to females (39.5%). Gingival recession was commonly seen in mandibular incisors (43.0%). Miller's class I gingival recession was more commonly seen. The most common cause for gingival recession was dental plaque accumulation (44.1%) followed by faulty toothbrushing (42.7%). Approximately half of the subjects examined exhibited gingival recession. The etiology of gingival recession is multifactorial, and its appearance is always the result of more than one factor acting together.

A synthetic bone substitute material composed of P-15 with anorganic bone mineral has been scantly studied. Hence, the present study was aimed to evaluate and compare the efficacy of anorganic bovine-derived hydroxyapatite matrix (ABM)\/cell binding peptide (P-15) in human periodontal infrabony defects with that of open flap debridement (OFD) alone. A split-mouth, randomized controlled clinical study was designed to investigate the efficacy of ABM\/P-15. In this clinical trial, 10 patients having bilateral periodontal infrabony defects were treated either with ABM\/P-15 or OFD and followed for a period of 9 months. At baseline and at 9 months probing pocket depth (PPD), relative attachment level (RAL), depth of a defect, and radiographic bone level were measured; and compared between test and control sites. A statistically significant reduction (P &lt; 0.001) in PPD was observed in test sites compared to control sites. Both sites showed a gain in RAL without any significant difference. Similarly, the radiographic evaluation revealed significantly higher radiographic defect fill in test sites as compared to control sites (P &lt; 0.001).

This study was thus conducted to evaluate the change in the peri-implant mucosal thickness and its effect on the marginal bone levels around dental implants treated in a conventional two-stage implant therapy. A total of 36 implants were placed in 22 subjects. Two subjects dropped out. Thirty-three implants in 20 subjects were then evaluated. Initial mucosal thickness, marginal bone levels on radiographs, pain, and exudation were evaluated. All these parameters were recorded at the time of implant placement, at the time of cementation of final restoration, 6 months and 12 months post cementation\/restoration. The peri-implant mucosal thickness reduced from implant placement to second stage and till restorations and was statistically significant, in both the thick and thin biotypes, however, at 12 months there was a rebound of the tissue thickness, which was more in the thick biotype (P &lt; 0.05). At 1-year follow-up, there was a reduction in the marginal bone levels, which was more in the thick biotype as compared to the thin biotype (P &lt; 0.05). The mucosa at implant sites undergoes a reduction in thickness from the time of implant placement till the placement of final restorations. The placement of the final restorations and then end of active therapy leads to a rebound of the tissue thickness. Sites with thicker tissues preoperatively have a lesser bone loss and better rebound as compared to thinner tissues.

A randomized parallel group study was designed for a period of 4 weeks on 45 systemically healthy subjects between 20 and 30 years having chronic gingivitis. The study population was divided into three groups. Group A - 15 subjects were advised experimental (probiotic) mouthwash. Group B - 15 subjects were advised positive control (chlorhexidine) mouthwash and Group C - 15 subjects into a negative control group (normal saline). Oral prophylaxis was done for all groups at baseline. After the proper oral hygiene instructions, all the three groups were instructed to rinse their mouth with 10 ml of their respective mouthrinse, undiluted for 1 min twice daily, 30 min after brushing. Clinical parameters such as plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), and oral hygiene index simplified (OHI-S) were assessed at baseline, 2 weeks and 4 weeks, respectively. At day 28, the PI, GI, and OHI-S were significantly reduced by all treatment modalities ranking probiotic and chlorhexidine is greater than saline.

Establishment of Th1 and Th2 subsets from a naive T-cell precursor depends on transcriptional regulation. The aim of this study was to compare the expression of master transcription factor regulators T-bet and GATA-3, respectively, to indicate the predominance of Th1 and Th2 subsets in the presence and absence of periodontal disease. A gingival tissue biopsy sample was obtained from each of 10 severe periodontitis patients (&gt;5 mm attachment loss) and 10 periodontally healthy patients (no attachment loss). Biopsies were immediately processed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and the difference in mRNA expression of T-bet and GATA-3 was assessed for each group. The mRNA expression of T-bet was marginally increased about 1.31-fold in disease, while the GATA-3 levels showed a significant decrease of 4.39-fold in disease. The advanced periodontal lesions lack Th2 cells, which produce anti-inflammatory cytokines. The biopsies were therefore dominated by Th1 cells, which activate macrophages and osteoclasts.

The latest CD4 count values were obtained from the hospital records. The study showed a 36.11% of prevalence of periodontal disease; however no statistically significant association was seen with its relation to CD4 counts. Other oral manifestations were seen in 46% of patients with a high prevalence of Oral Candidiasis lesions and a positive association with CD 4 counts was seen. Under the limitations of this study no significant association was seen between CD4 counts and prevalence of periodontal disease however candiasis showed a stronger association. As HIV infection gradually becomes a chronic disease the features and course of chronic periodontal disease and other oral manifestations in HIV infected patients require more careful and extensive investigation. ","731":"The aim of the present study was to compare various risk indicators of chronic periodontitis (CP) and aggressive periodontitis (AP) among patients of Davangere population. Totally, 89 CP and 90 AP patients were selected from outpatient Department of Periodontics, College of Dental Sciences, Davangere. Various clinical parameters proven to be risk indicators were determined for each patient such as age, gender, occupation, oral hygiene habits, personal habits, income, level of education, place of residence, frequency of dental visits, various oral hygiene indices, gingival status, wasting diseases, malocclusion, laboratory investigations, and the results were subjected to statistical analysis. This study demonstrated that AP is manifested early in life in susceptible individuals. Proven risk indicators for AP and CP in the present study population included young age, place of residence, income and education levels, frequency of dental visits. Patients with AP had better oral hygiene habits and oral hygiene index results than patients with CP. Paan chewing and smoking could be considered as risk factors, both in CP and AP cases. The similar association of plaque scores but higher bleeding tendency in AP patients supported the fact of higher susceptibility of AP patients to periodontal breakdown. Malocclusion being present in the majority of cases could also be put forth as a risk factor for AP and CP. This study identifies the different risk indicators for CP and AP and demonstrates the need for constructing nationwide oral health promotion programs to improve the level of oral health awareness and standards in Indian population.

Age, genetic factors, activity level, body weight, eating habits, medications, and hereditary factors are some of the causes of obesity. It is a risk factor for several chronic health conditions, as well as being associated with increased mortality. Obesity has also been associated with oral diseases, particularly with periodontal disease. The objective was to assess the periodontal status of obese and nonobese young individuals in colleges of Bangalore city. A cross-sectional study was undertaken to assess the periodontal status of 16-34-year-old obese individuals in colleges of Bangalore City. The students and staff of preuniversity and Degree Colleges of Bangalore City aged below 35 years were considered in the study. Data regarding demographic factors, oral hygiene habits, and dental visits were collected through a questionnaire. Periodontal status was examined using community periodontal index (CPI). Subjects were examined for weight and height as well as periodontal status. It was observed that pocket 4-5 mm (CPI Code 3) is significantly higher among obese when compared to nonobese with P &lt; 0.001 and loss of attachment 4-5 mm (Loss of Attachment Code 1) is significantly higher in obese when compared to nonobese with P &lt; 0.001. The results described earlier and related research indicate that obesity may have potential for periodontal disease among young and\/or those lacking oral health care.

Hence, to overcome these disadvantages, bone allografts were developed as an alternative source of graft material. In 10 patients with chronic periodontitis, 20 bilateral infrabony defects were treated with freeze dried bone allograft (FDBA-Group A) and decalcified freeze dried bone allograft (DFDBA-Group B). Clinical and radiographic parameters were assessed preoperatively and at 3 months and 6 months postoperatively. Data thus obtained was subjected to statistical analysis. Significant improvement in the reduction in probing depth and relative attachment level (RAL) from the baseline to 3 months to baseline to 6 months in group A and group B, which was statistically significant but no statistically significant reduction was seen between 3 months and 6 months. On inter-group comparison, no significant differences were observed at all-time points. In adjunct to the probing depth and RAL, the radiographic area of the defect showed a similar trend in intra-group comparison and no significant difference was seen on inter-group comparison at all-time points. Within the limitations of the current study, it can be concluded that DFDBA did not show any improvement in the clinical and radiographic parameters in the treatment of the intrabony defects as compared to FDBA.

The microbial-enzymatic N-benzoyl-DL-arginine-2-napthylamide (BANA) test is one of the modern alternatives to bacterial cultures. It detects the presence of three periodontal pathogens in the subgingival plaque (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola and Tannerella forsythia). The aim and objective of this study was to detect the presence of BANA micro-organisms and also to determine the effect of scaling and root planning in adult periodontitis patients. A total number of 20 patients (80 sites) all having periodontitis were selected. Four test sites (permanent molar from each quadrant) were selected from each patient and assessed for plaque index, bleeding index and pocket depth before and after scaling and root planning. BANA test was used for the detection and prevalence of the \"red complex\" bacteria in plaque samples. Showed that the BANA tests are statistically correlated with the severity of periodontal destruction. There was a significant correlation between the BANA test results and the quantity of bacterial plaque, the test being influenced by the composition of bacterial plaque. This study encourages the use of such chair-side tests for a proper diagnosis of periodontal disease and for a good evaluation of the treatment results. ","737":"The palatal masticatory mucosa is the main donor area of soft tissue and connective tissue grafts used for increasing the keratinized mucosa around teeth and implants, covering exposed roots and increasing localized alveolar ridge thickness. The aim of this study was to compare the thickness of the palatal masticatory mucosa as determined on a cone-beam computerized tomography scan versus thickness determined via bone-sounding. A total of 20 patients requiring palatal surgery participated. Thickness of the palatal tissue was measured at various points radiographically and clinically. The two techniques were compared to determine the agreement of the two measurement modalities. Statistical analysis determined that there was no significant difference between the two methods. Moreover, the tissue thickness was shown to increase as the distance from the gingival margin increased, and the tissue over the premolars was thicker than the other teeth. Cone-beam computerized tomography can be used as a noninvasive method to accurately and consistently determine the soft tissue thickness of the palatal masticatory mucosa with minimal bias at different locations on the palate.

This study aimed to estimate levels of serum interleukin (IL-10), an anti-inflammatory cytokine also associated with T2DM and evaluate its association with hyperglycemia. This investigation involved sixty participants divided into four groups comprising 15 participants each: Group 1 (healthy controls), Group 2 (CPD patients), Group 3 (T2DM patients with CPD) and Group 4 (T2DM patients). Plaque index, gingival index, probing pocket depths (PPD), clinical attachment loss, bleeding on probing, random blood sugar, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and serum IL-10 was measured. Interleukin-10 was detected in all four groups. Statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) differences were observed in most of the variables in all groups. IL-10 correlated significantly with PPD in Group 1 and with HbA1c in Group 4. IL-10 regressed with PPD in Group 1 and with HbA1c in Group 4. IL-10 levels were lower in Group 3 when compared with Group 4 and was lowest in Group 2. Low IL-10 levels associated with high HbA1c. Pathogenic mechanisms of CPD seem to regulate IL-10. Serum IL-10 levels may be one of the predictors of glycemia. ","740":null,"741":"Healthy teeth and gums make a person feel confident and fit. As people go about their daily routines and with different eating and drinking habits, the tooth enamel turns yellowish or gets stained. Polishing traditionally has been associated with the prophylaxis procedure in most dental practices, which patients know and expect. However, with overzealous use of polishing procedure, there is wearing of the superficial tooth structure. This would lead to more accumulation of local deposits. Also, it takes a long time for the formation of the fluoride-rich layer of the tooth again. Hence, now-a-days, polishing is not advised as a part of routine oral prophylaxis procedure but is done selectively based on the patients' need.

The emergence of host response modulation as a treatment concept has resulted from our improved understanding of the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. A variety of drugs have been evaluated as host modulation agents (HMA), including Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDS), bisphosphonates, tetracyclines, enamel matrix proteins and bone morphogenetic proteins. Chemically modified tetracyclines (CMTs) are one such group of drugs which have been viewed as potential host modulating agents by their anticollagenolytic property. The CMTs are designed to be more potent inhibitors of pro inflammatory mediators and can increase the levels of anti inflammatory mediators.

The technique was performed to limit the retraction of elevator muscles (e.g., zygomaticus minor, orbicularis oris, leviator anguli oris and levator labi oris.) The technique is fulfilled by removing two strips of mucosa from maxillary buccal vestibule on both the sides leaving the frenum untouched and creating a partial thickness flap between mucogingival junction and upper lip musculature, and suturing the lip mucosa with mucogingival junction, resulting in a narrow vestibule and restricted muscle pull, thereby reducing gingival display. This technique is different from the conventional surgical lip repositioning as labial frenum is left untouched over here as it helps in maintain Litton the midline for lip repositioning and reduces the morbidity associated with it.

Palato gingival grooves- anatomic aberrations are also infrequent occurrences that notoriously predispose to periodontal pathologies of varying extent. Both conditions independently are known to popularly affect maxillary lateral incisors. Coexistent fenestration defect and palato gingival groove in the same tooth is extremely rare and undoubtedly is a perfect combination to precipitate severe endodontic-periodontal consequences. In this report, a 34-year-old patient presented to the dental department with complaint of esthetics in relation to exposed root of right maxillary lateral incisor. On closer inspection, a palato gingival groove in addition to fenestration defect was evident on the root surface along with a periodontal pocket of &gt;5 mm. An interdisciplinary treatment was instituted which included endodontic treatment followed by root end resection, osseous bone graft placement and guided tissue regeneration procedures for repair of mucosal fenestration defect. Debridement of the palatal pocket, with saucerization of the groove and restoration with glass ionomer cement were simultaneously employed to correct the palatal defect.

Keeping this in view, the present survey was designed to evaluate the acquaintance, orientation and behavior of general medical practitioners; concerning the effects of periodontal disease on systemic health. A typed questionnaire carrying four sets of questions was distributed among general medical practitioners of seven different government and private medical colleges and hospitals. Questionnaire was developed to assess the acquaintance, orientation and behavior of general medical practitioners toward periodontal disease. Most of the respondents have knowledge regarding the signs and symptoms of periodontal disease and its association with cardiovascular disease. However, majority of them do not know about the potential effect of periodontal disease on other organ systems. General medical practitioners have inadequate knowledge regarding periodontal diseases.

Health care professionals have a key role to play to motivate and advise tobacco users to quit. The aim was to assess the attitudes and practice of dental professionals in Mumbai and Navi Mumbai toward tobacco cessation and the potential barriers faced. Questionnaire-based survey was conducted with 500 dental surgeons in Mumbai and Navi Mumbai. The questionnaire contained close-ended questions and assessed the smoking status of the professional, whether they impart tobacco cessation advice to their patients, whether the professional is trained for basic intervention, whether they would be eager to undergo training and also the potential barriers encountered by the professional. The SPSS version 17 was used. Frequencies and percentages were used to determine distributions of the responses for each of the variables. Chi-square test was used for analysis. It was observed that the majority of dental clinicians do not use tobacco and although 93% believed that it is the role of the dental professional to offer advice, 21% do not. Potential barriers reported were: Little chance of success, lack of training, lack of time, lack of remuneration, and the possibility of losing patients. Dental professionals must expand their horizon and armamentarium to tobacco intervention strategies inclusive of their regular preventive and therapeutic treatment modalities. Furthermore, the dental institutions (schools) should include tobacco intervention in the curriculum, but it should not be just theoretical knowledge rather it must have a practical component.

A cross-sectional study was conducted in out patient Department of Medicine, Government Medical College, Calicut. 133 patients taking antihypertensives were examined for the presence of GO using two different indices: Vertical GO in 6 points around each tooth and horizontal Miranda-Brunet index in the interdental area. Gingival index (GI), plaque index, and probing depth were also evaluated. The frequency of GO was significantly higher in nifedipine-treated cases than other drug groups. Frequency of GO was 75% for nifedipine, 31.4% for amlodipine and 25% for amlodipine + metoprolol. Higher gingival, plaque and calculus were observed in patients taking calcium channel blockers. Among the possible risk factors, only the GI showed a significant correlation with GO. Patients taking antihypertensives had poor oral hygiene. Patients taking nifedipine showed a higher frequency of GO. Gingival inflammation acts as a predisposing factor.

Underlying mechanisms involve modulation of immune-inflammatory mechanisms. These changes might contribute to potentiation of destructive periodontal disease. Therefore, the present study aimed to assess if there is an association of sleep deprivation with chronic periodontal diseases. Sixty subjects were categorized into 3 groups (n = 20 each) viz. clinically healthy, gingivitis and periodontitis. Periodontal status of subjects was assessed by gingival index and pocket probing depth. All the study subjects were administered Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire for the assessment of sleep deprivation. Present investigation revealed that mean PSQI was highest in the periodontitis group as compared to other two groups and the difference among three groups was statistically significant.

For this study, 50 patients diagnosed with CKD and 50 systemically and periodontally healthy individuals were subjected to a detailed general and intraoral examination. Whole un-stimulated saliva samples of all the selected subjects were collected and subjected to calcium (Ca), phosphorous (P), sodium (Na), potassium (K), bicarbonate and urea analysis. Paired t-test, Mann-Whitney test. Among 50 study subjects, 26 subjects had reduced salivary flow in the range of 0.1-0.4 ml\/min. Intraoral examination of the study subjects revealed pallor, increased deposition of calculus, bleeding gums, metallic taste, hypoplasia of teeth and fissured tongue. There was a significant difference between healthy and prehemodialysis patients in the salivary sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, urea levels and the difference was insignificant in relation to bicarbonate levels. Alterations in salivary calcium, phosphorous, urea, sodium, potassium levels were significantly higher in the study groups when compared to control groups and the difference was insignificant in relation to bicarbonate level.

Depression is associated with negligent oral health care and another mechanism proposed disturbance in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis system and hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid system, which can affect the periodontal status by affecting the immune system. The aim of this study was to assess the association between periodontal clinical parameters and depression rating. The study design is a case-control study with 35 patients each in case and control group. The periodontal parameters taken for measurement were probing depth and clinical attachment loss. Depression was calculated using Beck's depression scale. The statistical analysis was performed by means of SPSS software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA; version 17.0 under windows 2000). Student's t-test was used to determine the relationship between the clinical periodontal parameters and depression. Self-reported scoring of depression by using Beck's depression inventory has shown that periodontal patients had a significantly higher total depression score than normal controls. This study reveals that there is a direct correlation between the severity of periodontal disease and the severity of depression in patients.

Twenty partially edentulous patients were recruited for implant placement in the Clinic of San Martin de Porres University. For all the measurements, a vacuum-formed stent was fabricated for each subject. A buccal and lingual point was made in the stent to provide a reference of measurement for each implant site. RM measurements with the stent were obtained before and after surgical flap reflection. Two calibrated observers made the CBCT images measurements. T-test was used for the statistical analysis. Values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant. Also, specificity and sensibility of CBCT and RM were compared. Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC)_ was measure between CBCT measurements. A total of 62 implants sites were evaluated. No statistical significant differences were obtained with CBCT and RM measurements (P = 0,207). Detecting proper buccal-lingual ridge, the sensitivity and specificity were 59% and 91% for RM while CBCT obtained 92% of sensitivity and 94% of specificity. Concordance was found \"good\" (ICC 0.82). Both methods provide valid measurements. Even though, we found diagnostic limitations in the RM, it demonstrated to be a useful method for its exactitude, low cost, the immediate result and no need of radiation.

On the day of surgery prior to anesthesia, CBCT of the quadrant to be operated was taken. After reflection of the flap, clinical measurements of periodontal defect were made using a reamer and digital vernier caliper. The measurements taken during surgery were then compared to the measurements done with CBCT and subjected to statistical analysis using the Pearson's correlation test. Overall there was a very high correlation of 0.988 between the surgical and CBCT measurements. In case of type of defects the correlation was higher in horizontal defects as compared to vertical defects. CBCT is highly accurate in measurement of periodontal defects and proves to be a very useful tool in periodontal diagnosis and treatment assessment.

Seventeen subjects participated in this study, after DP disclosure with the erythrosine, their incisors, and a calibration scale ware photographed by two operators in duplicate, re-positioning the PPPD among each acquisition. A third operator registered the Quigley-Hein modified by Turesky DP index (Q-H\/TPI). After tooth brushing, the same operators repeated the photographs and the Q-H\/TPI. The image analysis system (IAS) technique allowed the measurement in mm(2) of the vestibular total tooth area and the area with DP. The reliability was determined with the intra-class correlation coefficient that was 0.9936 (P &lt; 0.05) for the intra-operator repeatability and 0.9931 (P &lt; 0.05) for inter-operator reproducibility. The validity was assessed using the Spearman's correlation coefficient that indicated a strong positive correlation with the Q-H\/TPI r s = 0.84 (P &lt; 0.01). The sensitivity of the IAS was evaluated with two sample sizes, only the IAS was able to detect significant differences (P &lt; 0.05) with the sample of smaller size (n = 8).

This is particularly the case when the esthetic restorative material chosen is ceramic rather than composite resin. The adoption of an anisotropic abutment, characterized by an elastic deformability, could allow decreasing the impulse of chewing forces transmitted to the crestal bone. According to research protocol, the mechanical resistance to cyclical load was evaluated in a tooth-colored fiber-reinforced abutment (TCFRA) prototype and compared to that of a titanium abutment (TA), thus eight TCFRAs and eight TAs were adhesively cemented on as many titanium implants. The swinging that the two types of abutments showed during the application of sinusoidal load was also analyzed. In the TA group, both fracture and deformation occurred in 12.5% of samples while debonding 62.5%. In the TCFRA group, only debonding was present in 37.5% of samples. In comparison to the TAs, the TCFRAs exhibited a greater swinging during the application of sinusoidal load. In the TA group, the extrusion prevailed, whereas in the TCFRA group, the intrusion was more frequent. The greater elasticity of TCFRA to the flexural load allows absorbing part of the transversal load applied on the fixture during the chewing function, thus reducing the stress on the bone-implant interface.

Gingival recession may be a concern for patients for a number of reasons such as root hypersensitivity, erosion, root caries, and esthetics (Wennstrom 1996). Recently, new techniques have been suggested for the surgical treatment of multiple adjacent recession type defects. These are mainly derived from the coronally advanced flap, a supraperiosteal envelope technique in combination with a subepithelial connective tissue graft, or its evolution as a tunnel technique. The current case reports introduce a novel, minimally invasive approach applicable for both isolated recession defects as well as multiple contiguous defects in the maxillary anterior region. Access to the surgical site is obtained by means of an approach referred to as vestibular incision subperiosteal tunnel access. ","776":"Replacement of missing maxillary anterior tooth with localized residual alveolar ridge defect is challenging, considering the high esthetic demand. Various soft and hard tissue procedures were proposed to correct alveolar ridge deformities. Novel techniques have evolved in treating these ridge defects to improve function and esthetics. In the present case reports, a novel technique using long palatal connective tissue rolled pedicle graft with demineralized freeze-dried bone allografts (DFDBAs) plus Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) combination was proposed to correct the Class III localized anterior maxillary anterior alveolar ridge defect. The present technique resulted in predictable ridge augmentation, which can be attributed to the soft and hard tissue augmentation with a connective tissue pedicle and DFDBA plus PRF combination. This technique suggests a variation in roll technique with DFDBA plus PRF and appears to promise in gaining predictable volume in the residual ridge defect and can be considered for the treatment of moderate to severe maxillary anterior ridge defects.

Recession coverage up to a certain extent has solved these problems, but these procedures need good maintenance after the surgery for long-term benefits. With increasing advances in the field of recession coverage, microscope has added another dimension in undertaking the surgical procedure. Thirty Miller's Class I and II recession were treated using the sub-epithelial connective tissue graft from the palate. In 15 sites, the graft was placed at the recipient site with unaided eye (Group A) and in other 15 sites the graft was placed using surgical microscope (Group B). Clinical evaluation was done at baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks postoperatively using plaque index, gingival index, vertical recession (VR), probing depth, clinical attachment level (CAL), width of attached gingiva, papilla height (PH) and width, malalignment index (MI) and esthetic appearance.

Since their discovery, they have always been considered tissue-destructive cells responsible for inflammatory tissue damage occurring during infections. Extensive research in the field of neutrophil cell biology and their role skewing the immune response in various infections or inflammatory disorders revealed their importance in the regulation of immune response. Neutrophils also release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) for the containment of infection and inflammation along with other antimicrobial molecules. Activated neutrophils provide signals for the activation and maturation of macrophages as well as dendritic cells. Neutrophils are also involved in the regulation of T-cell immune response against various pathogens and tumor antigens. Thus, the present review is intended to highlight the emerging role of neutrophil extracellular trap production in the regulation of immune response and its role in periodontal disease.

","883":"Need for having better esthetics is the new emerging trend seen in patients' demands and expectations. Various periodontal procedures including the mucogingival procedures have been designed to enhance the esthetics. The amount of gingival display of the patient is also an important parameter while considering the esthetics of the patient. Till date, very few studies have been done in which the amount of gingival visibility have been determined. So, the aim of this study was to evaluate the amount of visibility of gingiva during natural smile and forced smile in the patients visiting Himachal Dental College and Hospital. A total of 400 patients (242 females and 158 males), aged between 18 to 49 years, attending the outpatient department of Himachal Dental College, were included in this study. Patients were divided into two groups according to age and gender. Clinical photographs of the patients were taken and analyzed according to the following classification: (1) Very high smile line that is more than 2 mm of marginal gingiva visible or more than 2 mm apical to the cementoenamel junction visible for the reduced but healthy periodontium, (2) high smile line that is between 0 and 2 mm of marginal gingiva visible or between 0 and 2 mm apical to the cementoenamel junction visible for the reduced but healthy periodontium, (3) average smile line in which only gingival embrasures are visible, (4) low smile line in which gingival embrasures and cementoenamel junction not visible. Examination of the gingiva was done for both natural smile and forced smile. During smile analysis, the following results were revealed for Natural smile and forced smile. Natural smile analysis revealed following: C1: 1%, C2: 6%, C3: 43.50% and C4 was 49.50%. Forced smile analysis revealed the following: C1: 1%, C2: 15.50%, C3: 59% and C4: 24.50%. Excessive gingival display is an esthetic concern both to the patient and clinician. Therefore, understanding the etiology and treatment options is crucial for the treatment of such patients. So, it becomes utmost duty of the dentist to see that visual attractiveness of the smile is associated strongly with the health of the periodontium.

The present study was carried out to measure and correlate the interdental and interradicular bone loss in patients suffering from periodontitis using radiovisuography (RVG) for the purpose of early furcation diagnosis. A total of 50 patients suffering from chronic generalized periodontitis and with furcation involvement in mandibular molars were selected. Under standardized conditions, RVGs were taken and the morphologic measurements defining the furcation areas were recorded and analyzed. Interradicular bone loss of about 0.8 mm or more, was observed in the study subjects only when the bone loss at the interdental area was minimal of 3.7 mm. The correlation between the interradicular and the interdental bone loss was statistically highly significant (T-test, P &lt; 0.001). A stronger correlation was observed in subjects above 40 years of age as compared with the younger subjects. There was not much difference in the degree of correlation between the interradicular and the interdental bone loss when compared in the context of gender. The very first millimeter of interradicular bone loss was seen when the interdental bone loss was around 4 mm. Therefore, to detect the earliest lesions of furcations, the interdental bone loss can be kept as an approximate guide for the comprehensive diagnosis and management of such sites\/patients. The current investigation paves the path for future longitudinal studies with larger samples to ascertain these findings.

As the attached gingiva is an important anatomic and functional landmark in the periodontium, the identification of gingival biotype is important in clinical practice since differences in gingival and osseous architecture have been shown to exhibit a significant impact on the outcome of restorative therapy. Hence, the aim of this study was to determine the variation in width and thickness of facial gingiva in the anterior segment with respect to age, gender and dental arch location. 120 subjects were divided into three age groups: The younger age group (16-24 years), the middle age group (25-39 years) and the older age group (&gt;40 years) with 20 males and 20 females in each group. The width of the gingiva was assessed by William's graduated probe and the thickness was determined using transgingival probing in the maxillary and mandibular anterior segment. It was observed that the younger age group had significantly thicker gingiva but less width than that of the older age group. The gingiva was found to be thinner and with less width in females than males. The mandibular arch had thicker gingiva with less width compared to the maxillary arch. In the present study, we concluded that gingival thickness and width varies with age, gender and dental arch location.

","893":"Recent advances in periodontal plastic surgical procedures allow the clinician to reconstruct deficient alveolar ridges in more predictable ways than previously possible. Placement of implant\/s in resorbed ridges poses numerous challenges to the clinician for successful esthetic and functional rehabilitation. The reconstruction frequently utilizes one or combination of periodontal plastic surgical procedures in conjunction with autogenous bone grafting, allogenic bone block grafting, ridge split techniques, distraction osteogenesis, or guided bone regeneration (GBR) for most predictable outcomes. Current surgical modalities used in reconstruction of alveolar ridge (horizontal and\/or vertical component) often involve the need of flap transfer. Moreover, there is compromise in tissue integrity and color match owing to different surgical site and the tissue utilized is insufficient in quantity leading to post surgical graft exposition and\/or loss of grafted bone. Soft tissue expansion (STE) by implantation of inflatable silicone balloon or self filling osmotic tissue expanders before reconstructive surgery can overcome these disadvantages and certainly holds a promise for effective method for generation of soft tissue thereby achieving predictable augmentation of deficient alveolar ridges for the implant success.

Three cases were treated with electrocautery, one case with diode laser and one case with conventional scalpel technique. 1 week and 1 month post-operative follow-ups were done and healing was compared with the available literature. Manipulation of tissues was better in laser and electrocautery techniques when compared with scalpel. Post-operative complication of swelling and pain was seen in scalpel technique whereas it was largely uneventful in other techniques. Though, there was no difference in healing at the end of first month clinically, scalpel technique has shown better results in organization of muscle fibers. This clinical study indicates that laser and electrocautery treatment used for frenectomy operations provides better patient perception in terms of postoperative pain and function than that obtained by the scalpel technique.

TIMPs-1 was detected in all samples. Highest mean TIMP-1 concentrations in GCF were obtained for Group I, whereas the lowest concentrations were seen in Group II. This suggests that TIMP-1 levels in GCF decreases proportionally with the progression of periodontal disease and increases after treatment. There is a substantial decrease in the concentrations of TIMP-1 in CP patients than in healthy and after treatment individuals. Since TIMP-1 levels in GCF are negatively correlated with periodontal disease, TIMP-1 may be considered as a biomarker in periodontal disease progression. However, controlled, longitudinal studies are needed to confirm this possibility. ","922":null,"923":"Periodontitis is caused by bacterial biofilms and is modulated by a variety of risk factors. The periodontal ligament comprises heterogeneous cell populations which are lost in the disease process. A variety of regenerative therapies, such as bone grafts, guided tissue regeneration treatment, application of enamel matrix derivative, have been introduced, with some success in periodontal tissue regeneration. Topical application of recombinant cytokines is now one of the most effective methods to stimulate stem cells. Researchers are now exploring the potential applications and uses of fibroblast growth factor in periodontal regeneration. ","924":"Traditionally, only antimicrobials have been used as the chemotherapeutic modality for the treatment of periodontitis. Though bacteria are the primary etiologic factors of periodontal diseases, yet the extent and severity of tissue destruction seen in periodontitis is determined by the host immuno-inflammatory response to these bacteria. This increasing awareness and knowledge of the host-microbial interaction in periodontal pathogenesis has presented the opportunity for exploring new therapeutic strategies for periodontitis by means of targeting host response via host-modulating agents. This has lead to the emergence of the field of \"Perioceutics\" i.e. the use of parmacotherapeutic agents including antimicrobial therapy as well as host modulatory therapy for the management of periodontitis. These host-modulating agents used as an adjunct tip the balance between periodontal health and disease progression in the direction of a healing response. In this article the host-modulating role of various systemically and locally delivered perioceutic agents will be reviewed. ","925":"","926":"","927":"Esthetic zone restoration is a challenging aspect in implant dentistry because of two critical factors such as level of bone support and soft tissue dimensions. Preservation of healthy peri-implant tissues is of primary importance for ensuring better esthetics over an extended period. The aim of the present case-series was to evaluate a new staged approach of implant placement in immediate extraction sockets for preservation of peri-implant soft and hard tissues. Four subjects scheduled for extraction of teeth in the esthetic zone with neither a periapical nor periodontal infection and with thick tissue biotype were included. For all the subjects sand blasted, large grit, acid etched platform switched implant with a diameter 2 mm less than the diameter of extraction socket and a conical abutment-implant connection (Morse taper) were placed 2 mm below the crest of the socket, with almost 2 mm gap between the labial plate and the implant with shoulder placed palatally\/lingually. The implants were loaded after 2 months healing period and followed for a period of 1-2 years. In all the four patients there was preservation of both hard and soft tissues around the implant with a good esthetic outcome in all the follow up visits. Integrating immediate placement with stable implant-abutment connection, platform switching concept and careful case selection, we can achieve a very good esthetic outcome. ","928":"The complete and predictable restoration of the periodontium following infection or trauma remains a critical objective in regenerative therapy. Bone grafts remain among the most widely used therapeutic strategies for the correction of periodontal osseous defects. For periodontally compromised anterior teeth, reconstruction of the ridge along with natural tooth pontic serves both the purpose of regeneration and esthetics. The right lower central incisor of a 28-year-old male that was periodontally compromised was extracted. Autogenous chin grafting followed by retrograde surgery of the extracted tooth and replacement by natural tooth pontic was done. After 6 months, there was significant improvement in clinical picture and bone fill. This procedure provided excellent regenerative and esthetic results for the periodontally compromised lost anterior tooth. ","929":"Peripheral ossifying fibroma (POF) is a non-neoplastic enlargement seen more often in females, in the interdental papilla and the anterior part of the maxilla, accounts for about 9% of all gingival growths. Of unknown etiology, unpredictable clinical course and pronicity for recurrence, POF is a clinician's cause for concern. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice, but with a reported recurrence rate of 7-45%, the management is often frustrating. With increasing acceptance of lasers in the repertoire of clinician's armory, laser excision of such lesions has become a possible, feasible, and patient-preferred approach. The purpose of this article is to report successful management and 1 year follow-up of two cases of POF using neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd: YAG) laser. The absence of operative bleeding, relative ease of the procedure and patient acceptance lends the laser excision as an alternate therapeutic modality for excision of gingival enlargements of suspicious and vexatious nature. ","930":"Excessive gingival display is a frequent finding that can occur because of various intraoral or extraoral etiologies. This report describes the use of surgical lip repositioning technique for the management of a gummy smile associated with vertical maxillary excess and hypermobility of the upper lip. The procedure restricts the muscle pull of the elevator lip muscles by shortening the vestibule, thus reducing the gingival display when smiling. Healing was uneventful and follow-up examinations of 10 months revealed reduced gingival display. For patients desiring a less invasive alternative to orthognathic surgery, lip repositioning is a viable alternative. ","931":"Systemic antibiotic treatment has emerged as a powerful adjunct to conventional mechanical debridement for therapeutic management of the periodontal diseases. The conceptual basis for treating periodontal diseases as infections is particularly attractive in part because of substantial data indicating that these diseases may be associated with specific putative pathogens. Further, discrete groups of patients respond well to systemic antibiotics and exhibit improvement of clinical parameters, including attachment level and inflammation. This bacterial-host interaction, which is ever-so-present in periodontitis, directs us toward utilizing antimicrobial agents along with the routine mechanical debridement. This case report presents a case of a female patient with recurrence of the chronic generalized periodontitis with gingival enlargement, which is treated thrice by referral dentist. A through clinical examination was carried out pre-operatively and treatment was planned with systemic minocycline in conjunction with the conventional non-surgical approach. There was a significant reduction of pocket depth, gain in attachment with dramatic improvement clinically. ","932":"Gingival enlargement, one of the manifestations of gingival and periodontal disease, is also known as gingival overgrowth. Idiopathic gingival enlargement is a rare gingival overgrowth, which is of an undetermined cause. This unknown etiology has now been linked to specific genes and idiopathic gingival enlargement is at times referred to as hereditary gingival enlargement. This condition is a benign, slow growing proliferation of gingival tissues. Aggressive periodontitis is the rapid form of periodontal disease which is characterized by extensive periodontal tissue destruction, increased host-susceptibility toward periodontal disease progress and a genetic predilection toward disease occurrence. We present a rare case of idiopathic gingival fibromatosis associated with generalized aggressive periodontitis in a young female. The patient presented with classic clinical and radiographic presentation associated with gingival enlargement and aggressive periodontitis. The diagnosis was then confirmed by histopathological and neutrophil functions tests. ","933":"Central odontogenic fibroma (COF), which has been categorized under the subheading of odontogenic tumors of ectomesenchyme, is such an uncommon neoplasm that much of its nature is left uncharted. COF is a rare tumor that accounts for 0.1% of all odontogenic tumors. Clinically, the lesion grows slowly and leads to cortical expansion. Radiologically, the lesion may be unilocular or multilocular. In some cases, it may be associated with root resorption or displacement. Histopathologically, the lesion is characterized by mature collagen fibers and numerous fibroblasts. A case of COF of the mandible in a male patient aged 49 years is described in this report. The patient showed no symptoms, no history of swelling discomfort or pain, and was unaware of the presence of the lesion. Orthopantomogram (OPG) showed generalized bone loss along with a unilocular radiolucent area, with a clear sclerotic lining and angular bone loss. Surgical enucleation of the lesion along with placement of osseo-graft, which is a bioresorbable demineralized bone matrix (DMBM), and platelet-rich fibrin was carried out in the defect site. Following surgery, patient was recalled for revaluation of the lesion; the surgical site showed good healing and an increase in bone height was seen. ","934":"Pyogenic granuloma (PyG) is a common cause of swelling in the oral cavity during pregnancy and also as an exaggerated response to any minor trauma. The condition is frequently associated with periodontal pain and discomfort, in some cases interfering with mastication and creating esthetic problems. Six patients reported to the Department of Periodontics with gingival overgrowth in the lower anteriors. After recording the details of the patients' oral hygiene status, all the patients were provided initial therapy with scaling and were prescribed analgesics for the reduction of pain and discomfort. After 1 week, surgical excision of the overgrowth was performed and sent for histopathological analysis. The histopathological report is suggestive of PyG. ","935":"Juvenile ossifying fibroma (JOF) is an uncommon fibro-osseous lesion with highly aggressive clinical behavior, higher incidence in young adults, and a strong tendency to recur. Two categories, trabecular JOF (TrJOF) and psammomatoid JOF (PsJOF), based on histologic criteria and a distinct predilection for specific age groups have been identified. Juvenile trabecular ossifying fibroma of peripheral variety is an uncommon clinical entity with aggressive local behavior and high recurrence rate. This article reports a case of aggressive JTOF in the anterior mandibular region in a 13-year-old boy with history of recurrence. Complete surgical resection of the growth was done along with involved periodontal ligament and periosteum to minimize the possibility of recurrence. The case was followed up for more than 3 months without recurrence. ","936":"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most common enzyme defect in humans. G6PD deficiency is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical parts of the world and a conservative estimate is that at least 500 million people have a G6PD deficient gene. In several of these areas, the frequency of a G6PD deficiency gene may be as high as 20% or more. The vast majority of people with G6PD deficiency remain clinically asymptomatic throughout their lifetime. However, all of them have an increased risk of developing neonatal jaundice and a risk of developing acute hemolytic anemia when challenged by a number of oxidative agents. The most important treatment measure is prevention: Avoidance of the drugs and foods that cause hemolysis. ","937":"Since the incidence of gingival overgrowth induced by amlodipine remains poorly defined, this study was carried out with an aim to determine the incidence. Dental patients who received amlodipine (N = 115), for more than 3 months were studied to determine the drug-induced gingival overgrowth. Clinical diagnosis of drug-induced overgrowth was verified by disappearance or decreased severity of gingival overgrowth after withdrawal of the causative drug. The prevalence rate of amlodipine-induced gingival hyperplasia among experimental patients was 3.4%, while it was not observed among the control subjects. Oral examination revealed gingival overgrowth as a lobular or nodular enlargement on interdental papilla located in the anterior interproximal regions. In this study, there was a significant relationship between gingival inflammation resulting from dental plaque and drug dosage, and hyperplasia.

Forty-five systemically healthy patients with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis requiring flap surgery were enrolled in the study. They were randomly allocated to Amoxicillin, Doxycycline, and control groups. Surgical procedures were carried out with complete asepsis as per the protocol. Postoperative assessment of patient variables like swelling, pain, temperature, infection, ulceration, necrosis, and trismus was performed at intervals of 24 h, 48 h, 1 week, and 3 months. Changes in clinical parameters such as gingival index, plaque index, probing pocket depth, and clinical attachment level were also recorded. There was no incidence of postoperative infection in any of the patients. Patient variables were comparable in all the three groups. Though there was significant improvement in the periodontal parameters in all the groups, no statistically significant result was observed for any group over the others. Results of this study showed that when periodontal surgical procedures were performed following strict asepsis, the incidence of clinical infection was not significant among all the three groups, and also that antibiotic administration did not influence the outcome of surgery. Therefore, prophylactic antibiotics for patients who are otherwise healthy administered following routine periodontal surgery to prevent postoperative infection are unnecessary and have no demonstrable additional benefits.

A total of 600 subjects participated in the study, who were divided into four groups as control healthy individuals (group I), type 2 DM without periodontitis (group II), type 2 DM with periodontitis (group III), and periodontitis subjects without DM (group IV), matched for age, sex, and duration of diabetes. Serum concentrations of glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-c, Zn, and Mg were measured using enzymatic methods in an UV absorption spectrophotometer, and LDL-c was calculated using Friedwald's formula. Student's t-test, Pearson correlations, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were used for statistical analysis. The serum zinc level was found to be significantly increased in type 2 DM without periodontitis (group II) and periodontitis subjects without type 2 DM (group IV) (P &lt; 0.0001), and the level was lowered in type 2 DM with periodontitis (group III) when compared to control. The serum Mg level was found to be significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.0001) in group II, group III, and in group IV, when compared to control. We found a significant increased level of serum total cholesterol and LDL-c and decreased triglycerides and HDL-c in type 2 DM subjects with periodontitis (group III, P &lt; 0.0001). Patients with DM and periodontitis had altered metabolism of Zn and Mg which were linked to increased values of serum cholesterol and LDL-c and decreased HDL-c, contributing to the progression and complications of type 2 DM with periodontitis.

A single blinded cross-over study was conducted among 30 participants in the age group of 18-25 years. The mouthwash samples for the study were previously labeled assigning the letters: A (0.25% of green tea catechin mouthwash) and B (0.12% of chlorhexidine mouthwash). The study subjects were randomly divided into two groups of 15 each and the study was divided into two phases. In phase I, the mouthwash A was given to one group and other group was given mouthwash B. After a 15 day washout period, in phase II, both groups were given other mouthwash. At the end of each phase of 1 week, plaque score was recorded by using Turesky modification of the Quigley-Hein plaque index. The plaque scores were compared and the difference between the green tea catechin and chlorhexidine mouthwash was determined by t-test. The difference between plaque scores were not statistically significant (P &gt; 0.05). The results showed that both the groups that is green tea catechin mouthwash (0.25%) and chlorhexidine mouthwash (0.12%) have comparable results in plaque reduction. This study supports the effectiveness of green tea catechin mouthwash as an antiplaque agent. It should be explored as a cost-effective, long-term antiplaque rinse with prophylactic benefits.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a xanthan-based chlorhexidine gel versus herbal extracts' gel as an adjunct to periodontal therapy in the treatment of chronic periodontitis. A total of 150 sites, age group of 30-50 years, periodontal pockets measuring 5-8 mm and diagnosed with chronic periodontitis were selected for the study. The selected sites were randomized in five groups: Scaling and root planing (SRP) alone (Group A), SRP + Chlosite gel (Group B), SRP + Herbal gel (Group C), Chlosite gel alone (Group D) and Herbal gel alone (Group E). Clinical parameters such as Plaque Index, Gingival Index, probing pocket depth and clinical attachment level were recorded at baseline and 1- and 3-month intervals. After 3 months, there were statistically significant reductions in all the clinical parameters for Groups B and C compared with Group A. There was no significant reduction in all clinical parameters between Group D and E where no mechanical therapy was performed.

The aim of this study was to detect the presence of Tannerella forsythia (Tf) in subgingival plaque of periodontally healthy subjects and chronic periodontitis patients by using both culture and PCR technique and compare the two techniques. Pooled subgingival plaque samples were taken using sterile curettes from predetermined sites in 50 periodontally healthy subjects and from 50 periodontitis subjects. Samples were analyzed for the presence of T. forsythia using both techniques. Statistical analysis of the results was done using Chi-square test, sensitivity, and specificity tests. Both techniques could detect T. forsythia in subgingival plaque samples from healthy and periodontitis subjects. Periodontally healthy individuals and individuals with chronic periodontitis using the culture technique showed the presence of T. forsythia in 14 and 34%, respectively. PCR technique showed the presence of T. forsythia in 20% healthy and 40% chronic periodontitis patients. T. forsythia detection in the periodontitis group was statistically significantly higher when compared to the healthy group by both culture and PCR technique (P = 0.019 and P = 0.029). PCR demonstrated high sensitivity and low specificity when compared to the culture technique.

","950":"Gingivitis and periodontitis are initiated by inflammation caused by microorganisms. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from these microorganisms are recognized through various toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs). In this study, we have chosen five TLRs and two NLRs as representatives taking part in the recognition and inflammation process, along with a few of their signaling mediators including CD14, MYD88, and TRIF to compare their mRNA expression levels between healthy and diseased gingival tissues. This will provide deeper insight into the mechanisms underlying gingivitis and periodontitis. Understanding the mechanisms involved in the onset and progression of the periodontal diseases could greatly help in establishing effective ways for prevention and treatment of these diseases besides decreasing the risk factor for relevant systemic disorders. Gingival tissue samples for mRNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were taken from patients with gingivitis and periodontitis and from healthy control subjects. Messenger RNA expression of all genes was assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Among the genes studied in different groups, only MYD88 mRNA expression was significantly higher in the periodontitis group compared to that of the controls. The expression level of this molecule was also significantly higher in patients with severe periodontitis compared to other patients and also compared to healthy individuals. In different tissues, positive significant correlations were observed between the mRNA expression levels of some genes. Elevated mRNA levels of MYD88 in periodontitis might have a key role in the pathogenesis of this disease. Therefore, MYD88 may be a useful target for the therapy of this disease.

","969":"The prison population is a challenging one with many health problems, including oral health. In a country like India the information regarding the status of periodontal health in prisoners is scant. To assess the periodontal status of the jail inmates at Mangalore District Jail. CROSS SECTIONAL SURVEY PARTICIPANTS: A Randomly selected sample of 82 male inmates of age group 18-60 years were examined using community periodontal index (CPI) and loss of attachment from modified WHO oral health assessment proforma (1997). The prevalence of periodontal disease was 97.5%. Majority of the study population had CPI score of 2 and 1. Majority of the prisoners were severely affected with loss of attachment with 35% had loss of attachment more than 3 mm. As there are no oral health care facilities available in the prison set up, this study emphasizes the need for special attention from government and voluntary organizations to provide the oral health care services to inmates and improve the overall health status of the prisoners. ","970":"Schizophrenia is a psychosis characterized by delusions and hallucinations occurring in clear consciousness. Studies have shown that the cytokines may modulate dopaminergic metabolism and schizophrenic symptomatology in schizophrenia. Cytokine involvement in periodontal disease is also well documented. To date, however, there has been relatively little research assessing periodontal status of patients with schizophrenia. The present study was therefore mainly intended to understand the exact link, if any, between periodontal disease and schizophrenia. A total of 250 schizophrenic patients (140 males and 110 females), between 25 and 55 years of age, were selected from the out patient department of National Institute of Mental Health and Neural Sciences, Bangalore and their periodontal status was assessed as part of this cross-sectional epidemiological survey. ANOVA showed that there was increased evidence of poor periodontal condition, as evidenced by gingival index and plaque index in patients who had been schizophrenic for a longer duration of time (P &lt; 0.001). So also, higher probing pocket depths were found in schizophrenics suffering from a longer period of time than others (P &lt; 0.001). Although oral neglect might be a cause of poor periodontal health in schizophrenics, the possible link between periodontal diseases giving rise to schizophrenia cannot be overlooked due to the presence of cytokine activity which is present both in schizophrenia and periodontal disease. ","971":"Biostatistics is an integral part of research protocols. In any field of inquiry or investigation, data obtained is subsequently classified, analyzed and tested for accuracy by statistical methods. Statistical analysis of collected data, thus, forms the basis for all evidence-based conclusions. The aim of this study is to evaluate the cognition, comprehension and application of biostatistics in research among post graduate students in Periodontics, in India. A total of 391 post graduate students registered for a master's course in periodontics at various dental colleges across India were included in the survey. Data regarding the level of knowledge, understanding and its application in design and conduct of the research protocol was collected using a dichotomous questionnaire. A descriptive statistics was used for data analysis. Nearly 79.2% students were aware of the importance of biostatistics in research, 55-65% were familiar with MS-EXCEL spreadsheet for graphical representation of data and with the statistical softwares available on the internet, 26.0% had biostatistics as mandatory subject in their curriculum, 9.5% tried to perform statistical analysis on their own while 3.0% were successful in performing statistical analysis of their studies on their own. Biostatistics should play a central role in planning, conduct, interim analysis, final analysis and reporting of periodontal research especially by the postgraduate students. Indian postgraduate students in periodontics are aware of the importance of biostatistics in research but the level of understanding and application is still basic and needs to be addressed. ","972":"Alveolar bone loss is the most striking feature of periodontal disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway inhibitor and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor in the reduction of alveolar bone loss in an experimental periodontal disease (EPD) model. The study was conducted on 60 Wistar rats divided into three groups of 20 rats each and then subjected to a ligature placement around the left maxillary second molars. Group 1 rats were treated with COX inhibitor (diclofenac sodium 10 mg\/kg\/d), group 2 with NOS inhibitor (aminoguanidine hydrochloride 10 mg\/kg\/d) and group 3 served as controls, receiving only saline, intraperitoneally 1h before EPD induction and daily until the sacrifice on the 11(th) day. Leukogram was performed before ligation, at 6 h and at the first, seventh and 11(th) days after EPD induction. After sacrifice, all the excised maxillae were subjected to morphometric and histometric analysis to measure the alveolar bone loss. Histopathological analysis was carried out to estimate cell influx, alveolar bone and cementum integrity. Induction of experimental periodontitis in the rat model produced pronounced leucocytosis, which was significantly reduced by the administration of diclofenac sodium and aminoguanidine on the 11(th) day. In morphometric and histometric examinations, both the test drugs significantly (P &lt; 0.05) inhibited the alveolar bone loss as compared with the control group. Both COX inhibitor and NOS inhibitor are equally effective in inhibiting the inflammatory bone resorption in an experimental periodontitis model. ","973":"Saliva can be used as a diagnostic fluid in dentistry. Various enzymes have been proposed as markers for periodontal destruction. One of them is aspartate aminotransferase, for which salivary analysis can offer a cost-effective approach for monitoring the disease. Changes in enzymatic activity reflect metabolic changes in the gingiva and periodontium in inflammation. The purpose of this study was to assess the aspartate aminotransferase levels in saliva prior to and following scaling and root planning (SRP) at 1 month and 3 month interval and correlating it with the clinical parameters in generalized chronic gingivitis and chronic periodontitis patients. Thirty patients with generalized chronic gingivitis and 30 with generalized chronic periodontitis were selected. The activity of aspartate aminotransferase levels in saliva were assessed biochemically before and after SRP at 1 month and 3 months. The aspartate aminotransferase levels were correlated with clinical parameters (gingival index and probing depth). A paired t test was done. A decrease in gingival index, probing depth, and aspartate aminotransferase levels were seen in both the groups at 1 and 3 months which was found to be statistically highly significant (P value 0.00). Aspartate aminotransferase levels were statistically significantly correlated with the clinical parameters at baseline (P &lt; 0.05) but at 3 months, a positive correlation was seen in both the groups which was statistically insignificant (P &gt; 0.05). Elevated salivary aspartate aminotransferase levels were seen in generalized chronic gingivitis and chronic periodontitis patients, with higher values recorded in generalized chronic periodontitis correlating to the tissue destruction taking place in these conditions. ","974":"Ayurvedic drugs have been used since ancient times to treat diseases including periodontal diseases. Oral rinses made from ayurvedic medicines are used in periodontal therapy to control bleeding and reduce inflammation. The aim of this clinical study is to verify the efficacy of herbal mouthwash containing Pilu, Bibhitaka, Nagavalli, Gandhapura taila, Ela, Peppermint satva, and Yavani satva on reduction of plaque and gingivitis. A total of 100 volunteers with clinical signs of mild to moderate gingivitis were selected and assigned to Group A (only scaling done) and Group B (scaling along with the use of herbal mouthwash). After recording the clinical parameters, the patients were instructed to use herbal mouthwash 15 ml for 30 s twice daily after food in Group B and oral hygiene instructions were given to all patients. Plaque and gingivitis assessment were carried out using the plaque index (Silness nd Loe, 1964), Gingival index (Loe And Silness, 1963), Gingival bleeding index (Ainamo and Bay, 1975) at baseline and at 21 days of the herbal mouthwash use. Statistically analysis was carried out using the student's t-test for normally distributed data and Wilcoxson test or Mann-Whitney U-test for skewed data. Our results showed that herbal mouthwash was effective in treatment of plaque induced gingivitis in Group B when compared with the Group A. Herbal mouthwash is effective in treatment of plaque induced gingivitis and can be effectively used as an adjunct to mechanical therapy with lesser side-effects. ","975":"The gingival morphology of the maxillary anterior region plays an important role in determining the final esthetic outcome. Knowledge of the periodontal biotype is of fundamental importance because the anatomical characteristics of the periodontium, such as gingival thickness, gingival width and alveolar bone morphology, will determine periodontium behavior when submitted to physical, chemical, or bacterial injury or during periodontal or implant surgical procedures and orthodontic treatment. 50 subjects with healthy periodontal tissues with no loss of attachment and (b) presence of all anterior teeth in both upper and lower jaw were selected. On clinical examination gingival thickness was recorded based on the transparency of periodontal probe. Following parameters are recorded from dental cast, i.e., crown length, crown width, papillary length (PL) and papillary width. There was highly significant correlation between gingival biotype and crown length and area of papilla with P value -0.002 and 0.013 respectively. Significant correlation was found between area of crown and PL with P value -0.013 and 0.016. The results of discriminant function analysis showed that average crown length was the best single determinant of biotype and area of papilla was the next best choice. Within the limits of the current investigation, the existence and correlation of different gingival biotypes and dentopapillary complex dimension has been confirmed. These findings can be utilized as objective guidelines for determining the biotype and response of gingiva to many dental operative procedures. ","976":"Gingival recession defects (GRD) are one of the most commonly encountered conditions for which periodontal treatment is required. Several attempts have been made to classify GRD. Among all the classifications Millers classification for gingival recessions is the most accepted. Recently, several limitations and drawbacks have been pointed out in Miller's classification system. The aim of the present study is to test the reliability of the recently proposed Mahajan's Modification of the Miller's Classification for GRD. All 15 males and 11 females between the ages of 22 and 55 years (mean age, 37.15 year) with at least one buccal gingival recession were consecutively recruited by the same periodontist in order to test the reliability of the new classification of GRD. The classification was tested by two examiners blinded to the data collected by the other examiner. Intra-rater and inter-rater agreement was assessed. The new classification system of gingival recessions was tested in a total of 175 gingival recessions in 26 patients. The intraclass correlation coefficient for inter-rater agreement was 0.90, showing an almost perfect agreement between the examiners. The newly proposed classification system eliminates the drawbacks and limitations associated with Miller's classification system and can be used to classify GRD reliably. ","977":"A surface smear layer consisting of organic and inorganic material is formed on the root surface following mechanical instrumentation and may inhibit the formation of new connective tissue attachment to the root surface. Modification of the tooth surface by root conditioning has resulted in improved connective tissue attachment and has advanced the goal of reconstructive periodontal treatment. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of citric acid, tetracycline, and doxycycline on the instrumented periodontally involved root surfaces in vitro using a scanning electron microscope. A total of 45 dentin samples obtained from 15 extracted, scaled, and root planed teeth were divided into three groups. The root conditioning agents were applied with cotton pellets using the Passive burnishing technique for 5 minutes. The samples were then examined by the scanning electron microscope. The statistical analysis was carried out using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, version 15.0 for Windows). For all quantitative variables means and standard deviations were calculated and compared. For more than two groups ANOVA was applied. For multiple comparisons post hoc tests with Bonferroni correction was used. Upon statistical analysis the root conditioning agents used in this study were found to be effective in removing the smear layer, uncovering and widening the dentin tubules and unmasking the dentin collagen matrix. Tetracycline HCl was found to be the best root conditioner among the three agents used. ","978":"Fluorosis causes mineralization changes in the tooth and can lead to morphologic alterations of fibroblasts. To understand the effect of fluorosis on periodontal healing, the initial step during healing, such as fibroblast attachment to the root surface, needs to be evaluated. Hence, the objective of the present study was to study the attachment of fluorosed fibroblasts on the fluorosed and nonfluorosed root fragments. A total of 56 fluorosed and nonfluorosed, periodontally healthy and diseased tooth roots were obtained and allotted to eight groups: Fluorosed and nonfluorosed healthy controls (FH and NFH, respectively), fluorosed and nonfluorosed diseased controls (FD and NFD, respectively), fluorosed and nonfluorosed roots treated with scaling and root planing (FD + S and NFD + S, respectively), and similar groups treated with scaling and root planing and 24% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) gel application for 2 min (FD + SE and NFD + SE, respectively). After the respective treatment, the root fragments were incubated in the human periodontal ligament fibroblast cells obtained and cultured from freshly extracted healthy human fluorosed premolar tooth root. In the nonfluorosed roots category, greater attachment was found in the untreated nonfluorosed diseased (P = 0.036) and SRP-treated nonfluorosed diseased groups (P = 0.008) as compared to the nonfluorosed healthy group. While in the fluorosed roots category, no significant difference was observed in FL-FA (P &gt; 0.05) within the group. However, no attachment was observed in EDTA-treated fluorosed root fragments. When fluorosed groups were compared to nonfluorosed groups, no significant changes were noted between the groups. SRP proves to be a standard requirement for fibroblast attachment to occur both in fluorosed and nonfluorosed roots. Although there was no significant difference in attachment between SRP and SRP + EDTA among fluorosed roots, EDTA does not seem to be a promising agent for root biomodification in fluorosed roots in a given concentration and time of treatment. ","979":"In India, anemia is a common and serious health disorder among both sexes and all age groups, with anemia of chronic disease (ACD) being the second most prevalent anemia. Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease of the supporting tissues of the tooth caused by specific microorganisms. An immune response to bacteria and their products induces a major vascular response, offering explanatory mechanisms for the interactions between periodontal infection and a variety of systemic disorders. Therefore, periodontitis results in low-grade systemic inflammation, which may cause lower number of erythrocytes and, consequently, lower hemoglobin concentration. A total of 100 systemically healthy male patients visiting the outpatient department participated in the study. Of these, 50 patients had healthy periodontium and 50 patients had chronic periodontitis. Clinical parameters and red blood cell parameters of all the patients were assessed at baseline and 6 months after non-surgical periodontal therapy. Statistical analysis using Student's t-test was performed. Data analysis revealed that patients with chronic periodontitis showed an improvement in both clinical and red blood cell parameters from baseline to 6 months after non-surgical periodontal therapy. From the present study, it can be concluded that like any other chronic condition, chronic periodontitis can lead to ACD. It also provides evidence that non-surgical periodontal therapy can improve the anemic status of patients with chronic periodontitis.

The search for the pathogens of periodontal diseases has been underway for more than 100 years, and continues up today. Despite the increasing knowledge about oral microbiota, we are not able to implicate any one particular organism that can be considered as a candidate pathogen. In fact the term \"candidate pathogen\" has lost its steam with a myriad of microorganisms being incriminated from time to time. Most studies of the bacterial etiology of periodontitis have used either culture-based or targeted deoxyribonucleic acid approaches and so it is likely that pathogens remain undiscovered. The advent of 16S cloning and sequencing has facilitated identification of several uncultivable bacteria in the oral cavity. The concept that not one single organism, but several organisms contained in the biofilm orchestrating in a medley of the show appears to be more plausible.

The dental pulp is closely related to periodontal tissues through apical foramina, accessory canals, and dentinal tubules. Due to this interrelationship, pulpal diseases may influence periodontal health and periodontal infections may affect pulpal integrity. It is estimated that pulpal and periodontal problems are responsible for more than 50% of tooth mortality. Thus, these associations recommend an interdisciplinary approach. MTA appears to exhibit significant results even in periodontal procedures as it is the first restorative material that consistently allows for over-growth of cementum and may facilitate periodontal tissue regeneration.

Different lesions with similar clinical presentation make it difficult to arrive at a correct diagnosis. These lesions include pyogenic granuloma, irritation fibroma, peripheral giant cell granuloma, peripheral ossifying fibroma (POF). Among these lesions, an infrequently occurring gingival lesion is the POF. Considerable confusion has prevailed in the nomenclature of POF due to its variable histopathologic features. This is a case presentation of a 30-year-old female with gingival overgrowth in the mandibular left canine-premolar region. Clinically, the lesion was asymptomatic, firm, pale pinkish and sessile.

Non-surgical treatment, home care reinforcement, clinical indices records, and radiographic examination were completed in two consecutive 1-h appointments within 24 h. The patient was monitored frequently for the first 3 months. Subsequently, maintenance debridement visits were scheduled at 3-month intervals. The patient had a decreased probing pocket depth and a negative BoP index compared to initial clinical data, and the results were stable after 1 year. After 5 years of follow-up visits, there appeared to be rebound of the bone level radiographically. Within the limits of this case report, conventional non-surgical periodontal therapy with the adjunctive use of an 810-nm diode laser may be a feasible alternative approach for the management of peri-implantitis.

It is a type IV palmoplantar keratosis (PPK) while the palmoplantar keratodermas share some features of PPK, they are etiologically heterogeneous. PLS differs from other types of PPK by the presence of severe and early onset periodontitis. Genetic studies have shown that mutation in the major gene locus of chromosome 11q14 with the loss of function of cathepsin-C (CTSC) gene is responsible for PLS.

Both aggressive periodontitis (AP) and chronic periodontitis (CP) have a multifactorial etiology, with dental plaque as the initiating factor. However, the initiation and progression of periodontitis are influenced by other factors including microbiologic, social and behavioral and systemic and genetic factors. The prevalence of periodontal diseases varies in different regions of the world according to the definition of periodontitis and the study population, and there are indications that they may be more prevalent in developing than in developed countries. A cross-sectional study was conducted among the adolescents of 15-18 years of age in Mangalore City. One thousand one hundred students aged 15-18 years were selected for the study from the schools and colleges in Mangalore City using a convenient sampling method.

Competency of lips was also evaluated as competent or incompetent. Habits such as tongue thrusting, nail biting, and lip sucking were evaluated in relation to pathological migration of the tooth. The results showed that no single factor by itself is clearly associated with PTM. As bone loss increases, the association of PTM with additional factors such as tooth loss and gingival inflammation increases. Further studies would be of great help to identify under which circumstances PTM is reversible according to the influence of gingival inflammation, malocclusion, and other factors.

The results of the present study suggest that neutrophil functions, namely chemotaxis, phagocytosis and microbicidal activity, are deficient LAP patients. However, superoxide generation was significantly increased when stimulated by endotoxins, which may explain the tissue damage seen in LAP. These abnormal neutrophil functions may predispose to increased susceptibility for LAP. Further large-scale studies are required in the Indian population to ascertain the cause-and-effect relationship of defective host factors and aggressive periodontitis and to develop treatment strategies for more predictable periodontal treatment outcome.

There is currently significant interest in the possibility that bacteremia with oral bacteria may play role in pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. There are well-conducted studies that have determined the frequency of passage of periodontal microorganisms to the bloodstream after periodontal treatment. There is scarce information related to the incidence of periodontopathic microorganisms during bacteremia induced by this procedure. The aim of this study was to establish the frequency of passage of periodontopathic microorganisms in peripheric blood after scaling and root planing in patients with periodontitis. Forty subjects with chronic periodontitis were included in the study. Blood samples were drawn from each patient at following intervals pre-treatment i.e., before SRP (P1), immediately after SRP (P2), and 30 minutes after SRP (P3). Following SRP, blood samples were analyzed for following microorganisms: Porphyromonasgingivalis, Tannerella. forysthus, Eikenellanella. corrodens, Campylobacter species, Micromonas. micros, and Prevotella. intermedia. Chi-square test. Bacteremia was found in 70% (28\/40) immediately after SRP and after 30 min, it was reduced to 25% (10\/40) and 7.5% (3\/40) presented bacteremia before SRP. It was concluded that bacteremia frequently occurs immediately after SRP with P. gingivalis showing the highest frequency in blood.

To date, intra-oral radiographic techniques are the main non-invasive diagnostic aids for the detection and assessment of internal changes in mineralized periodontal tissues like alveolar bone. These analog radiographic techniques suffer from inherent limitations like: Two dimensional projection, magnification, distortion, superimposition and misrepresentation of anatomic structures. The evolution of novel imaging modalities, namely cone beam computed tomography, tuned aperture CT empowered dental researchers to visualize the periodontium three dimensionally. This improves interpretation of structural and biophysical changes, ensures densitometric assessments of dentoalveolar structures including variations in alveolar bone density, and peri-implant bone healing more precisely.

There has also been considerable evidence that proves the interrelationship between bacterial and viral infections and carcinogenesis. Periodontitis is a chronic oral infection thought to be caused by gram-negative anaerobic bacteria in the dental biofilm. Periodontal bacteria and viruses may act synergistically to cause periodontitis. Many studies have shown that periodontal pockets may act as reservoirs for human papilloma virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus, and suspected agents associated with oral cancer. Periodontitis, characterized by epithelial proliferation and migration, results in a chronic release of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, prostaglandins, and enzymes, all of which are associated with cancer development.

It is diverse beyond compare, tolerant without fail, and capable of behaving appropriately with a myriad of infections and other challenges. Dendritic cells (DCs) are required to explain how this remarkable system is energized and directed. DCs consist of a family of antigen presenting cells, which are bone-marrow-derived cells that patrol all tissues of the body with the possible exceptions of the brain and testes. DCs function to capture bacteria and other pathogens for processing and presentation to T cells in the secondary lymphoid organs. They serve as an essential link between innate and adaptive immune systems and induce both primary and secondary immune responses. As a result of progress worldwide, there is now evidence of a central role for dendritic cells in initiating antigen-specific immunity and tolerance.

A successful result must also include an esthetic and functional restoration surrounded by stable peri-implant tissue levels that are in harmony with the existing dentition. In an attempt to improve long-term bone maintenance around implants, a new implant-to abutment connection referred to as \"platform switching\" has been proposed. It refers to the use of an abutment of smaller diameter connected to an implant neck of larger diameter. Platform switching is a simple and effective way to control circumferential bone loss around dental implants.

Gingival recession is one of the most common esthetic concerns associated with periodontal tissues. Although various treatment modalities have been developed, subepithelial connective tissue grafting remains the most successful and predictable technique for treatment of gingival recession. Harvesting a connective tissue graft from the palate is many times not only traumatic, but also very painful for the patient. Use of single incision to harvest the subepithelial connective tissue graft is one of the least traumatic, but relatively difficult technique to accomplish. This article presents a modified single incision technique, which is not only less traumatic and painful, but comparatively simple to employ and master. Two new instruments have been introduced to make harvesting of the connective tissue graft easier. ","1016":"Traumatic injuries are the most studied yet most challenging for a dentist. Extrusive luxation injuries are usually managed by repositioning tooth in the original position and pulp sensibility is evaluated at regular periodic intervals. However, when injuries are chronic, tooth is necrotic with compromised periodontal support, treatment is a challenge. Intentional replantation utilizing growth factors in fibrin rich network of platelet rich fibrin can be a treatment modality in such patients where other restorative modalities to establish function-esthetics rehabilitation is not possible.

Intentional replantation is a procedure in which an intentional tooth extraction is performed followed by reinsertion of the extracted tooth. Many authors agree that it should be reserved as the last resort to save a tooth after other procedures have failed or would likely to fail. The main reason of failure in replanted teeth is root resorption, specifically ankylosis or replacement resorption. Although the success rate is not always high, intentional replantation may be a treatment alternative that deserves consideration to maintain the natural dentition and avoid extraction of the tooth.

Both primary cells and cell lines have been shown to respond to BMPs. Further the ability of embryonic cells to respond to BMPs by differentiating into cartilage and bone cells suggests that they are involved in the development of embryonic skeletal system. In addition, these proteins can also promote the angiogenesis, regulate the activity of some growth factors, and affect the production of these growth factors, which is helpful for the osteogenesis. BMPs have been considered as the most potent growth factors that can promote the bone regeneration.

They were divided into three groups of 100 patients each: Group A had clinically healthy gingiva, Group B who had generalized chronic gingivitis and Group C who had generalized chronic periodontitis. The randomized unstimulated saliva from each patient was collected and pH was tested. Data was analyzed statistically using analysis of variance technique. The salivary pH was more alkaline for patients with generalized chronic gingivitis as compared with the control group (P = 0.001) whereas patients with generalized chronic periodontitis had more acidic pH as compared with the control group (P = 0.001). These results indicate a significant change in the pH depending on the severity of the periodontal condition. The salivary pH shows significant changes and thus relevance to the severity of periodontal disease. Salivary pH may thus be used as a quick chairside diagnostic biomarker. ","1058":"This study was designed to compare inorganic salivary calcium, phosphate, flow rate and pH of un-stimulated saliva and oral hygiene of healthy subjects, patients with periodontitis and dental caries and to correlate salivary calcium level with the number of intact teeth. The present study consisted of 90 patients aged between 18 and 55 years and were divided into three groups, periodontitis, dental caries and controls. Oral hygiene index-simplified, probing pocket depth, clinical attachment level and number of teeth present, teeth with active carious lesions were recorded. Salivary flow rate and pH was recorded and subjected to biochemical investigation. Estimation of inorganic calcium and phosphate was performed by colorimetric method. Results showed statistically significant increase in salivary inorganic calcium and phosphate levels, poor oral hygiene status, pH and salivary flow rate in patients with periodontitis when compared with dental caries group and controls. Individuals who have increased salivary inorganic calcium, phosphate, pH, flow rate and maintain poor oral hygiene could be at a higher risk for developing periodontitis and may have less dental caries and more number of intact teeth.

This study had a single-blind, three-group (n = 35 each) parallel design, including a 21 days experimental period during which group I rinsed with chlorhexidine (CHX) 0.2% alone, group II used chlorhexidine (CHX) followed by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) 1.5%. Group III rinsed with the same mouthwashes in reverse order. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the three groups. The examination for plaque, and stains was done after 1, 2, and 3 weeks of rinsing. Group II showed significantly less stain intensity in comparison with group I after 14 and 21 days (P values 0.025 and 0.005, respectively). The proportion of stained surfaces was less in the group II than in the group I and was significant at the end of 1 week. The plaque formation was significantly less in groups II and III than group I at 7, 14, and 21 days. The adjunctive use of hydrogen peroxide to chlorhexidine proved to be superior to chlorhexidine alone with regard to the inhibition of plaque and development of stains.

Tea tree oil (TTO) can be used as adjunct to conventional periodontal therapy in patient with chronic periodontitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of adjunctive treatment of TTO on the clinical parameters and the level of pentraxin-3 (PTX3) in chronic periodontitis. A total of 40 patients with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis were divided into two groups, Group I received scaling and root planing (SRP) only, Group II received SRP and TTO gel. Clinical parameters were recorded and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) samples were collected from each subject for measuring PTX3 levels at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment. In all evaluation periods, there was statistically significant reduction in each of the studied clinical parameters and PTX3 level in Group II as compared with Group I. The local delivery of TTO gel in case of chronic periodontitis may have some beneficial effects to augment the results of the conventional periodontal therapy. Moreover, it places a focus on the value of monitoring GCF levels of PTX3 as a marker of periodontal tissue healing.

It is widely known for its medicinal uses in wound healing, as an analgesic, and for its anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of this study is to evaluate the anti-inflammatory property of aloe vera mouthwash on plaque-induced gingivitis. Forty-five patients who were diagnosed with plaque-induced gingivitis were included in the study. They were divided into three groups with fifteen patients in each group. Group 1 was asked to rinse with 10 ml of aloe vera mouthwash twice daily for three months. Group 2 were treated with scaling only. Group 3 patients were asked to rinse with aloe vera mouthwash and scaling was done. The clinical changes were evaluated with Loe and Silness gingival index (1963) and Muhlemann and Son's Sulcus bleeding index (1971) at baseline, after one month and three months, respectively. The data obtained was compared statistically. The paired 't' test was done for intragroup comparison and one-way analysis of variance with a post hoc Tukey test was used for intergroup comparison. The data was obtained at the baseline, end of first month, and end of the third month. The result suggested reduction in gingival inflammation in all the three groups, but it was more in the aloe vera mouthwash and scaling group. Hence, it was concluded that aloe vera had a significant anti-inflammatory property. Thus, it can be used as an adjunct to mechanical therapy for treating plaque-induced gingivitis. ","1063":"Conventional anti-microbial therapy largely consisted of systemic administration of various drugs effective against periodontal pathogens, but fraught with several problems. Based on the concept of local drug delivery a bioresorbable device made of pure fibrillar collagen has been developed. The aim of this study was to study the release of Tetracycline from this collagen fiber (Type I collagen) impregnated with Tetracycline and its antibacterial activity against Porphyromonas gingivalis. Porphyromonas gingivalis was isolated from plaque samples of chronic periodontitis patients by using a CO2 incubator. DNA isolation was done followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification to confirm the presence of bacteria. The release pattern of Tetracycline was assessed for a period of 10 days in water (group I) and Serum inoculated with Porphyromonas gingivalis (group II). A significant presence of Tetracycline on all days in Group I and group II and the zone of inhibition was also present in both groups with a steady decline from day 1 to day 10. Since the results were well within the therapeutic concentration of drug required to inhibit the growth of gram -ve bacteria (Porphyromonas gingivalis), this bioresorbable Tetracycline fiber has the potential for clinical application.

Though it appears innocuous by itself, there are retinues of hazards associated with it on various organ systems in the body. Some of these unwanted effects and measures to avoid or ameliorate the same are elaborated here. Exposure to ultrasonic scaling is inevitable before any other treatment procedure. Aerosol contamination, vibrational hazards, thermal effects on the dental pulp, altered vascular dynamics, disruption in electromagnetic device, diminished hearing and dental unit waterline contamination are some of the probable off-shoots a patient has to bear. Uses of barrier devices, proper attention to usage of equipment, protection for ear and water treatment are few of solutions for the same. Though documented evidence for the existence of all effects is lacking, it is never the less significant for the overall safety of the patient. A conscientious clinician should therefore inculcate the available steps to overcome the hazards of ultrasonic scaling.

Subgingival plaque and calculus can be secondary to recession. An argument about plaque as a source of microorganisms might be plausible in case of inflammation, although various microorganisms are normal for the oral cavity. From the viewpoint of general pathology, being an atrophic condition, recession can progress due to repeated damage. On the author's opinion, calculus removal is not indicated at least for aged patients with marked gingival recession, having modest esthetic demands.

Hegde Charitable Hospital Deralakatte Mangalore were included in the study. Variables age more than 40 and gender were also analyzed. Of the 30 patients analyzed in this study, periodontitis was recognized in 11 patients of the acute coronary syndrome group and 10 patients in the healthy group. Fisher's exact test yielded a p value of 0.4539 with an odds ratio of 0.727(95% confidence interval 0.151 to 3.493). No significant association was found between periodontal disease and acute coronary syndrome. Periodontitis may contribute to cardiovascular disease and stroke in susceptible subjects. Properly powered longitudinal case control and intervention trials are needed to identify how periodontitis and periodontal interventions may have an impact on cardiovascular diseases. ","1104":"Increased knowledge of anaerobic bacteria in the development of periodontal diseases has led to new treatment strategies aiming primarily at suppression or elimination of specific periodontal pathogens. Over the last few decades, green tea has been subjected to many scientific and medical studies. The purpose of the present study was to assess the effect of green tea catechins on the red complex organisms using Polymerase Chain Reaction for microbiological analysis. A split mouth study was conducted, in which a total of 20 subjects were included. Green tea catechin as local drug delivery was placed at study sites. Clinical parameters namely probing pocket depth (PPD), gingival index (GI), plaque index (PI) were recorded. Sub-gingival plaque samples were collected, and red complex micro-organisms were studied using PCR. Clinical and microbiological parameters were recorded at baseline, 1(st), and 5(th) week after treatment. The results showed statistically significant difference in PPD, GI, and PI and significant reduction of red complex organisms from baseline to 1(st) week and baseline to 5(th) week in both study and control groups (P &lt; 0.001). Intergroup comparison between study and control group was statistically insignificant for PPD, PI, and GI. A significantly greater reduction in Tannerella forsythus (Tf) at 1(st) week and 5(th) week and Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) at 1(st) week was observed in study group when compared to control group. Green tea catechin can be used as an effective local drug delivery along with scaling and root planing in treatment of chronic periodontitis.

As gingival enlargement develops, it affects the normal oral hygiene practice and may interfere with masticatory functions. It gradually becomes a source of pain and the condition often leads to disfiguration. Within the group of patients that develop this unwanted effect, there appears to be variability in the extent and severity of the gingival changes. It would seem pertinent to identify and explore possible risk factors and relating them with the treatment plan. This article throws light on respective drugs and their association with gingival overgrowth and approaches to treatment based on current knowledge and investigative observations. ","1109":"Various classifications have been proposed to classify gingival recession. Miller's classification of gingival recession is most widely followed. With a wide array of cases in daily clinical practice, it is often difficult to classify numerous gingival recession cases according to defined criteria of the present classification systems. To propose a new classification system that gives a comprehensive depiction of recession defect that can be used to include cases that cannot be classified according to present classifications. A separate classification system for palatal recessions (PR) is also proposed. This article outlines the limitations of present classification systems and also the inability to classify PR. A new comprehensive classification system is proposed to classify recession on the basis of the position of interdental papilla and buccal\/lingual\/palatal recessions. ","1110":"Current concept in periodontal diseases (PDs) states that it is the host's response toward the periodontal pathogens which leads to tissue destruction and attachment loss. Hence the role of immune response in the progression and resolution of PD must be considered vital. Any alteration in the immune system disturbs the homeostasis of the periodontium. Decline in immune system is the hallmark of aging, leading to increased susceptibility of elderly individuals to bacterial infections. The periodontal apparatus which is being constantly exposed to plaque biofilm is more vulnerable to destruction in aged individuals. Ageing related alterations in immune system has been discussed elsewhere as a contributor to various chronic inflammatory diseases like atherosclerosis, preterm, and low birth weight, etc. This paper reviews on the possible role of aging in periodontal destruction through altered immunity. Aging has long been associated with altered systemic inflammation. It has been discussed whether (1) this systemic inflammation is a consequence of increased occurrence of chronic inflammatory diseases upon aging or (2) aging associated systemic inflammation leads to such diseases. The immune responses which are protective at the first stages of life might result detrimental in the elderly. Hence it might be very difficult to individuate genetic profiles that might allow to identify individuals with a major risk for one or more age related diseases. Taking this into consideration, the cause of PDs in elderly is addressed with a systemic approach in order to understand the complex interplay between the aging immunity and PDs. ","1111":"Periodontitis is an infectious disease with marked inflammatory response, leading to destruction of underlying tissues. The aim of periodontal therapy is to eradicate the pathogens associated with the disease and attain periodontal health. This is achieved by non-surgical and surgical therapy; however, mechanical debridement and topical application of antiseptics may not be helpful in all cases. In such cases, adjunctive systemic antibiotic therapy remains the treatment of choice. It can reach micro-organisms at the base of the deep periodontal pockets and furcation areas via serum, and also affect organisms residing within gingival epithelium and connective tissue. Before advising any anti-microbial agent, it is necessary to have knowledge of that agent. The aim of this review article is to provide basic details of each systemic anti-microbial agent used in periodontal therapy. The points discussed are its mode of action, susceptible periodontal pathogens, dosage, its use in treatment of periodontal disease, and mechanism of bacterial resistance to each anti-microbial agent. It might be of some help while prescribing these drugs. ","1112":"GENES are made of DNA - the code of life. They are made up of two types of base pair from different number of hydrogen bonds AT, GC which can be turned into instruction. Everyone inherits genes from their parents and passes them on in turn to their children. Every person's genes are different, and the changes in sequence determine the inherited differences between each of us. Some changes, usually in a single gene, may cause serious diseases. Gene therapy is 'the use of genes as medicine'. It involves the transfer of a therapeutic or working gene copy into specific cells of an individual in order to repair a faulty gene copy. Thus it may be used to replace a faulty gene, or to introduce a new gene whose function is to cure or to favorably modify the clinical course of a condition. It has a promising era in the field of periodontics. Gene therapy has been used as a mode of tissue engineering in periodontics. The tissue engineering approach reconstructs the natural target tissue by combining four elements namely: Scaffold, signaling molecules, cells and blood supply and thus can help in the reconstruction of damaged periodontium including cementum, gingival, periodontal ligament and bone.

In a cross-sectional survey, randomly selected medical doctors (n = 267) practicing in Nellore District were interviewed through a questionnaire survey about their knowledge of periodontal diseases and the bidirectional relationship between general health and periodontal diseases. Data were analyzed through percentages. All the medical doctors (100%) were aware that there existed a relation between oral health and general health. But only 10% of respondents refer their patients to dentists without patients asking for referral. Very few respondents (21.3%) knew about different branches of dentistry. Screening and referral by healthcare professionals may benefit their patients by improving access to dental care. Therefore, there is a need to educate doctors about oral health and general health.","1116":"Implant failure can be divided into early (prior to prosthetic treatment) or late (after prosthetic rehabilitation). Early failure is generally due to interference in the healing process after implant placement. Implants undergoing early failure will show progressive bone loss on radiographs during the healing period (4 to 6 weeks). In the present case report, early progressive bone loss was seen at 6 weeks, after placement of a non-submerged single piece mini implant. Clinical examination revealed peri-implant bleeding on probing and pocket and grade-1 mobility. Treatment protocol included mechanical debridement (plastic curettes), chemical detoxification with supersaturated solution of citric acid, antibiotics and guided bone regeneration therapy using the collagen membrane as guided bone regeneration barrier in combination with bioactive glass as bone grafting material. The 6 month postoperative examination showed complete resolution of the osseous defect, thus suggesting that this technique may hold promise in the treatment of implants undergoing early failure.","1117":"The data on Indian population with regard to severity\/prevalence of chronic periodontitis in association with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is scarce. We are describing an interesting case of severe periodontitis associated with CKD. The patient had unusual inflammatory gingival overgrowth which persisted even after treatment. By describing this case we want to highlight our current lack of understanding with regard to etiopathogenesis of periodontal disease in CKD patients and need for further research in this area.","1118":"Dentists traditionally think of periodontal treatment as a means of saving the teeth while leaving the patient with an esthetic problem. The goal of gingival esthetics is to maintain normal healthy gingival appearance around teeth that must be restored. Gingival recession represents a significant concern for patients and a therapeutic problem for the clinician. Root coverage is the goal of periodontal plastic surgery when treating gingival recessions in the esthetic zone. Correction of mucogingival recession deformities with a variety of periodontal plastic surgical procedures have been described each demonstrating a variable degree of success. This case report presents to you the treatment outcomes and predictability of modified semilunar coronally advanced flap (Kamran Haghighat) techniques described for the treatment of recession defects on single and multiple adjacent teeth, respectively.","1119":"Gingival recession in anterior teeth is a common concern due to esthetic reasons or root sensitivity. Gingival recession, especially in multiple anterior teeth, is of huge concern due to esthetic reasons. Various mucogingival surgeries are available for root coverage. This case report presents a new bridge flap technique, which allows the dentist not only to cover the previously denuded root surfaces but also to increase the zone of attached gingiva at a single step. In this case, a coronally advanced flap along with vestibular deepening technique was used as root coverage procedure for the treatment of multiple recession-type defect. Here, vestibular deepening technique is used to increase the width of the attached gingiva. The predictability of this procedure results in an esthetically healthy periodontium, along with gain in keratinized tissue and good patient's acceptance.","1120":"Enlargement of the gingiva can be due to various causes. Most prevalent are the inflammatory type and drug-induced type of gingival hyperplasia. However, sever enlargement associated with an aggressive type of periodontitis is an infrequent finding. Reported here is a case of a female patient aged 18 years who presented with severe enlargement of the maxillary and mandibular gingiva. Examination revealed enlargement extending up to the incisal edge of all the teeth and also an associated generalized loss of attachment with radiographic evidence of reduced bone height resembling an aggressive type of periodontitis. There were no associated systemic signs and symptoms or any family history except that there was generalized vitiligo of the skin and oral mucous membrane. The case was treated by gross electrosection of the gingiva.","1121":"This case report presents two female patients whose chief complaint was discoloration of teeth. On careful clinical examination it was found that the patients had features of amelogenesis imperfecta and localised aggressive periodontitis.

Eight patients were selected with 16 sites that were divided into control and experimental sites based on split mouth study design. Plaque index, gingival index, probing depth, clinical attachment level, gingival margin position were recorded at baseline and 9 months and radiographic assessment was done at baseline and 9 months after recording clinical parameters, the sites were randomly treated either with hydroxyapatite granules Periobone-G or hydroxyapatite granules (control group) was used to fill the osseous defect and calcium sulfate (Capset) (experiment group) barrier was placed. The plaque score reduction was statistically highly significant within control and experimental groups. The gingival score reduction was significant within control and experimental groups, although there were no significant difference between the 2 groups. The pocket depth reduction was significant within control and experimental group, however, the hydroxyapatite + capset group showed significant reduction as compared with hydroxyapatite alone group. The clinical attachment gain and gingival margin position was significant within control and experimental groups, although there was no significant difference between the 2 groups. The amount of defect fill was significant in both control and experimental groups but the difference between the 2 groups was not significant. The mean change in alveolar crest level between control and experimental groups was significant (P=0.02). The percentage of original defect resolved was not significant.

The shift in therapeutic concepts from resection to regeneration has significantly impacted the practice of periodontology. The objective of the present study is to compare the relative efficacy of intra-oral autogenous graft and decalcified allogenic bone matrix (DABM) in the treatment of periodontal intrabony defects. In the present study, 30 patients in the age group of 30-50 years with two almost identical intrabony defects, on either side of the mouth\/upper and lower jaw, based upon the radiographic observations were selected from amongst the patients visiting the Department of Periodontology and Oral Medicine, Punjab Government Dental College and Hospital, Amritsar. One of the defect was selected randomly and filled with autogenous cancellous graft and the other with DABM. Post-operative assessment was done by taking radiographs, 12 weeks and 24 weeks post-operatively. Definite bone fill was achieved both with intra-oral free osseous autograft and with DABM at 12 weeks observation, which further increased significantly at 24 weeks observation. The bone fill obtained with intra-oral free osseous autograft was found to be significantly higher than that with DABM both at 12 weeks and 24 weeks post-operative observation.

Mast cells are able to phagocytose, process and present antigens as effectively as macrophages. The present study was undertaken to quantify the mast cells in health and disease, whether they correlate degree of inflammation and clinical features of periodontium. Ten cases of localized chronic periodontitis (CP), 10 cases of dental plaque-induced gingivitis (DPIG) and 10 cases of clinically healthy gingival tissues were selected. Samples were obtained from patients undergoing for periodontal surgery in CP and DPIG. In health group third molar impacted and covered with operculum without any inflammation were selected.

The purpose of the present study was to assess the influence of personality characteristics using questionnaire on oral hygiene performance and gingival health. In total, 155 patients were subjected to personality questionnaire using Eysenck Personality Questionnaire. Clinical parameters such as Patient oral hygiene performance index and gingival index were recorded. Based on Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, the subjects were divided into three groups: Psychoticism, extroversion, and neuroticism. Data analysis showed that subjects in psychoticism and neuroticism groups displayed moderate gingivitis, whereas subjects in extroversion group had severe gingivitis. Subjects in all the three groups demonstrated poor oral hygiene status. No statistically significant relation was found. A considerable clinical correlation was observed between the different personality traits and gingival health status of the subjects. It was not statistically significant.

There are many studies correlating the effect of periodontal disease on the adverse pregnancy outcomes. The development of periodontal diseases during pregnancy can be influenced by factors such as preexisting oral conditions, general health, and socio-cultural background. There is very little data studying the effect of socio-demographic factors on the periodontal health of pregnant women. This study evaluated the periodontal status of a sample of pregnant women of Chandigarh and adjoining areas. The study also investigated the relationship between these variables and a series of demographic and clinical variables. The participants were 190 pregnant women attending Gynecology and Obstetrics outpatient department of Government Medical College and Hospital, Chandigarh. The participants were examined for their periodontal health and various socio-demographic variables were recorded on performas designed for the purpose of study. Statistical analysis was done. The results revealed that the mean bleeding index scores and probing depth increased with statistical significance when the socio-economic status was lower (P&lt;0.05). No significant differences were found in bleeding index scores and mean probing depth among different categories of profession, education, place of residence, and trimester of pregnancy (P&gt;0.1). The plaque index was not significantly associated with the socio-economic status, profession, place of residence, and trimester of pregnancy (P&gt;0.1). In the population of pregnant women investigated under this study, the clinical and socio-demographic characteristics showed non-significant correlation except socio-economic status which showed statistically significant correlation with bleeding on probing and pocket depth.

Thirty pregnant and 10 nonpregnant women within the age group of 20-35 years having a probing pocket depth (PPD) of 3-4 mm were included in the study. The pregnant women were equally divided into 3 groups of 10, each belonging to I, II, and III trimester. Plaque index, gingival index, PPD, and microbiologic evaluation for specific bacterial counts for Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Parvimonas micra, and Fusobacterium nucleatum were carried out for all subjects. Mann-Whitney U test. Increase in gingival inflammation was observed in II and III trimester as compared with I trimester and control. Plaque scores did not show any significant difference between pregnant and nonpregnant women. Specific bacterial examination revealed an increase in proportion of P. intermedia in pregnant women of both II and III trimester as compared with I trimester and nonpregnant women. A definite increase in proportions of P. intermedia occurs in subgingival plaque microflora in pregnancy that may be responsible for the exaggerated gingival response.

One hundred and twenty subjects were grouped based on their age as young and elderly. Each group was subgrouped (20 subjects) as controls, gingivitis and periodontitis. Unstimulated whole saliva was collected from patients and flow rate was noted down during collection of the sample. Salivary protein estimation was done using the Biuret method and salivary albumin was assessed using the Bromocresol green method. pH was estimated with a pHmeter and buffering capacity was analyzed with the titration method. Student's t-test, Fisher's test (ANOVA) and Tukey HSD (ANOVA) tests were used for statistical analysis. A very highly significant rise in the salivary total protein and albumin concentration was noted in gingivitis and periodontitis subjects of both young and elderly. An overall decrease in salivary flow rate was observed among the elderly, and also the salivary flow rate of women was significantly lower than that of men.

In addition to the conventional risk factors, chronic infection and the subsequent generation of a systemic inflammatory response may be associated with this increased risk. This study was conducted to determine whether the presence of chronic periodontitis and subsequent non-surgical periodontal therapy could influence the serum levels of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) in patients with severe chronic generalized periodontitis. Participants were selected from subjects who attended the Department of Periodontics and Oral Implantololgy, Government Dental College, Thiruvananthapuram. Sera were obtained from 25 patients with periodontitis for baseline examination and reassessment after completion of treatment. As a control, sera were also obtained from 20 subjects without periodontitis. Interleukin-6 was determined by sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) was measured using latex turbidometric immunoassay. Data were analyzed using computer software, Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 10. The level of interleukin-6 and hsCRP in the sera of periodontitis patients was seen to be higher than those of healthy controls. Interleukin-6 level tended to decrease with improvement of the periodontal condition following treatment and approached that of control subjects, and this decline was statistically significant. The hsCRP levels also showed a decreasing trend following periodontal treatment. In this study, we were able to show that periodontal disease significantly affects the serum levels of systemic inflammatory markers and that non-surgical periodontal therapy could bring about a decrease in the levels of these inflammatory markers.

A sample of 90 subjects; 30 periodontally healthy individuals, 30 chronic gingivitis cases (n=30), and 30 chronic periodontitis cases (n=30) with an age range of 25 to 65 years were included in the study. Periodontal parameters including Plaque Index, Gingival Index, Probing Depth, and Clinical Attachment Level were recorded. Venous blood samples were obtained after 12 hours fasting period from antecubital vein and serum levels of TGL, TC, HDL, and LDL cholesterol were measured. The levels of TGL, TC, and LDL cholesterol were significantly higher for periodontitis group (P&lt;0.05) as compared to gingivitis and periodontally healthy groups. HDL cholesterol levels were significantly lower in periodontitis group (P&lt;0.05) as compared to periodontally healthy and gingivitis groups. The results of the present study indicate that periodontal infection has a definite role in altering lipid metabolism leading to hyperlipidemia.

Four hundred and eight type 2 DM patients (Study Group) and 100 non-diabetic patients (Control Group) among the age group of 35-75 years were included in the study. The study group was divided based on Glycated hemoglobin levels into well, moderately and poorly controlled. Relevant information regarding age, oral hygiene habits and personal habits was obtained from the patients. Diabetic status and mode of anti-diabetic therapy of the study group was obtained from the hospital records with consent from the patient. Community periodontal index (CPI) was used to assess the periodontal status. The results were statistically evaluated. The mean CPI score and the number of missing teeth was higher in diabetics compared with non-diabetics, and was statistically significant (P=0.000), indicating that prevalence and extent of periodontal disease was more frequent and more severe in diabetic patients. The risk factors like Glycated hemoglobin, duration of diabetes, fasting blood sugar, personal habits and oral hygiene habits showed a positive correlation with periodontal destruction, whereas mode of anti-diabetic therapy showed a negative correlation according to the multiple regression analysis. The odds ratio of a diabetic showing periodontal destruction in comparison with a non-diabetic was 1.97, 2.10 and 2.42 in well, moderately and poorly controlled diabetics, respectively. Our study has made an attempt to determine the association between type 2 DM (NIDDM) and periodontal disease in Bangalore city.

Various other treatment modalities have been tried and tested to treat periodontal diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of antioxidant therapy on the progression of periodontal disease as monotherapy and\/or as an adjunct to nonsurgical debridement. 70 subjects were divided into three groups, i.e. clinically healthy, gingivitis and periodontitis group on the basis of Community Periodontal Index of Treatment Needs score. Gingivitis and periodontitis groups were further subdivided into three subgroups. At the baseline, periodontal attachment loss was recorded and scaling and root planing was performed in two subgroups. 6 mg antioxidant was administered in three divided doses for 2 weeks. Saliva samples were collected at baseline, 15(th) day, 30(th) day and 45(th) day for evaluation of uric acid levels. Uric acid levels were significantly low in patients with more periodontal attachment loss as compared to clinically healthy and gingivitis groups.

Orthodontic forces induce a multifaceted bone remodeling response. Osteoclasts responsible for bone resorption are mainly derived from the macrophages and osteoblasts are produced by proliferations of the cells of the periodontal ligament. Orthodontic force produces local alterations in vascularity, as well as cellular and extracellular matrix reorganization, leading to the synthesis and release of various neurotransmitters, cytokines, growth factors, colony-stimulating factors, and metabolites of arachidonic acid. Although many studies have been reported in the orthodontic and related scientific literature, research is constantly being done in this field resulting in numerous current updates in the biology of tooth movement, in response to orthodontic force.

Study teeth were divided into four groups -: the HBO2 therapy, the HBO2 + scaling scaling group, the scaling group and the control group. Subgingival anaerobic organisms were measured with anaerobic culture, and number of obligate anaerobes and facultative anaerobes and Bacteroides melaninogenicus was counted. Comparisons of changes in the clinical indices, and subgingival anaerobes were made between the groups. Highly significant differences in gingival index (GI), probing depth (PD), attachment loss (AL), and Plaque index (PLI), and tooth odontoseisis (TO) were seen in the HBO2, the HBO2 + scaling and the scaling groups when compared with the control group (P&lt;0.01). The number of subgingival anaerobes as well as the types of obligate anaerobes and facultative anaerobes and the number of Bacteroides melaninogenicus were reduced markedly in these three treatment groups. Highly statistical differences in clinical indices, subgingival anaerobe number and types of obligate anaerobes and facultative anaerobes and Bacteroides melaninogenicus were found when comparisons were made between the HBO2 + scaling and the HBO2 groups, as well as between the HBO2 + scaling and the scaling groups. Clinical follow-ups indicated that the GI, PD, AL, TO, PLI and subgingival anaerobes number of the three therapeutic groups were reduced more severely than the control group. HBO2 had good therapeutic effects on Chinese patients with AgP. HBO2 therapy combined with scaling and root planing was the most beneficial in the treatment of AgP.

The aims are: to provide a comprehensive literature that can easily be consulted, on the subject; to draw the attention of health practitioners to the impact of oral health on the general well-being; and to emphasize the need for a deeper interaction between medical and dental training. The Medline database was searched for relevant literature by combining each of the following terms, \"oral health,\" \"oral infection,\" \"periodontitis,\" with \"systemic diseases.\" Manual library search and review of bibliographies of published literature were also conducted. Periodontitis is a constant potential source of infection and has been considered as a separate risk factor for some cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine, musculoskeletal, and reproductive system related abnormalities. Oral health impacts on the general well-being, and if comprehensive health care is ever to be achieved, oral health should not be seen as a separate, distant, and less important area of health, which is totally unrelated to lifespan and its quality.","1150":"The capillary hemangiomas represent developmental hamartomatous lesions of vascular tissue and their growth stops after certain period of time, following which some of the hemangiomas may involute. Capillary hemangiomas are common tumors of infancy and adolescents. Although head and neck are the most prevalent sites for origin of hemangiomas, they are very rarely observed arising on attached gingiva. This paper presents a rare case report of capillary hemangioma on attached gingiva of posterior maxilla in an adult female. Surgical management was done by Widman's periodontal flap operation with satisfactory uneventful healing. The characteristic clinical and histo-pathologic features of vascular tumors and malformations, especially capillary hemangiomas are discussed.","1151":"Pemphigus is a group of autoimmune diseases characterized by formation of intraepithelial bullae in skin and the mucous membrane. Pemphigus vulgaris affects the oral mucosa in nearly all cases. Pemphigus vulgaris is characterized by auto antibodies directed against desmosome-associated protein antigens (desmoglein-3) found in epithelial and epidermal intercellular substance. We report here a case of pemphigus vulgaris of gingiva in an adult female patient at an early stage followed by dermatologic involvement. Perilesional incision was taken and histopathological and direct immunofluorescence was done for identification of specific antibodies. The oral lesions were treated with 0.1% Triamcinolone acetonide ointment and Prednisolone 20 mg twice daily with multivitamins was administered systemically for skin lesion.","1152":"An increasing number of adult patients have been seeking orthodontic treatment, and a short treatment time has been a recurring request. To meet their expectations, a number of innovative techniques have been developed to accelerate orthodontic tooth movement. Significant acceleration in orthodontic tooth movement has been extensively reported following a combination of selective alveolar decortication and bone grafting surgery with the latter being responsible for the increased scope of tooth movement and the long-term improvement of the periodontium. Six patients who have been diagnosed as class I malocclusion with bimaxillary protrusion were selected. A modified corticotomy procedure was carried out The active orthodontic treatment was begun within 1 week after surgery and follow up. All the patients reported the minmalpain and mild swelling 2 days following the surgical procedure. The mean treatment time for these patients was 17.4 months, with the distalization of the canines being mostly completed in 8.5 months. Periodontallyaccelerated osteogenicsorthodontic tooth movement procedure or selective alveolar decortications or corticotomy approach is one of the surgical techniques developed to reduce the time for orthodontic treatment. This newer approach is leading to short orthodontic treatment time and great patient acceptance.","1153":null,"1154":"The various treatment modalities available to treat furcation involvement either maintain the existing furcation or increases access to furcation or leads to elimination of furcation (root resection, bicuspidization etc). Newer treatment modalities include regenerative procedures like placement of bone graft and organic or synthetic membranes. In this study we have evaluated the use of a new xenograft based tissue engineered bone material which provides both the inorganic and organic component; individually and in conjunction with a synthetic bioresorbable material. 6 patients with 18 mandibular grade 2 furcations were selected after the completion of initial phase in all the patients. Selected sites were divided into control and experimental groups randomly and were treated by split mouth design. The control sites were treated with flap debridement and placement of ABM graft, whereas the experimental site received flap debridement, ABM graft and a synthetic bioresorbable membrane. All the parameters recorded showed significant reduction from baseline to 9 months in both the experimental and control group. When compared in between the control and experimental group, all the parameters showed marginally better results in the control group, although none of them were clinically significant. The results of this study suggest that the use of ABM along with a bioresorbable membrane and without membrane is both beneficial for the treatment of grade 2 furcation. On the cost benefit basis, the bone graft alone seems to be a better choice for regenerative treatment of furcation involvement.

This human study was performed to evaluate the possible effects of moderate to advanced periodontal disease on the different aspect of dental pulp structure. Twenty hopeless permanent teeth were extracted from systemically healthy adults because of moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis, with a bone loss of &gt;6 mm and a mobility of grade 2 or 3. Upon extraction, the apical 2 to 3 mm of the roots were immediately sectioned. Four to five sections were mounted on each slide, and every third slide was stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The specimens were histologically processed and examined by an oral pathologist. Non-inflamed pulp, with partial or complete necrosis in some sections and several non-necrotic sections, was found in only 6.3% of teeth. Most teeth (58.3%) displayed edematous pulps. Slightly fibrotic pulps were seen in 52.1% of sections. Odontoblastic integrity was seen in 31.3% of teeth. Most teeth (77.1%) displayed no pulp stones. In 43.8% of teeth, the pulp vessels displayed dilatation. Moderate to advanced periodontal disease can affect the dental pulp. Careful consideration of diagnostic and treatment planing in patients with endodontic-periodontal involvement is therefore recommended. ","1157":null,"1158":"Initial research has shown a positive correlation between the severity of periodontal disease and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) concentrations in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF). However, there are no enough reports to correlate the MMP-3 concentrations in GCF in periodontal health, disease and after treatment. Hence, the present study is to estimate the levels of MMP-3 in GCF in periodontal health, disease and to evaluate the effect of periodontal therapy on MMP-3 concentrations in GCF. Periodontal examination and collection of GCF by extracrevicular method was performed in 30 subjects selected randomly and categorized into three groups. Group I (Healthy, n=10), group II (Chronic periodontitis, n=20) and group III (After treatment group, n=20). Scaling and root planing (SRP) was performed and GCF was collected after 8 weeks of treatment. MMP-3 levels were estimated in GCF samples using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). MMP-3 was detected in all samples. Highest mean MMP-3 concentrations in GCF were obtained for group II (7.490 ng\/ml), while the lowest concentrations were seen in group I (0.344 ng\/ml) and group III (2.129 ng\/ml). This suggests that MMP-3 levels in GCF increases proportionally with the progression of periodontal disease and decreases after treatment. There is a substantial increase in the concentrations of MMP-3 as periodontal disease progresses. Since MMP-3 levels in GCF are positively correlated with gingival index, probing pocket depth and clinical attachment level, MMP-3 may be considered as a \"novel biomarker\" in periodontal disease progression. However, controlled, longitudinal studies are needed to confirm this possibility. ","1159":"To evaluate the efficacy of Aloe Vera mouth rinse on experimental plaque accumulation and gingivitis. In this randomized, controlled, and double-blind study, a total of 148 systemically healthy subjects were screened in the age group of 18-25 years. Finally, 120 subjects were requested to abstain from oral hygiene (tooth brushing) for 14 days and used a specially fabricated plaque guard. Following cessation of tooth brushing in the specified area, the subjects were randomly divided into Group A (test group) who received 100% Aloe vera, Group B (negative control group) who received placebo (distilled water), and Group C (positive control group) who received 0.2% chlorhexidine. The rinse regimen began on the 15(th) day and continued for 7 days. Plaque accumulation was assessed by Plaque Index (PI) and gingivitis was assessed by Modified Gingival Index (MGI) and Bleeding Index (BI) at baseline (0), 7(th), 14(th), and 22(nd) days. There was statistically significant decrease in PI, MGI, and BI scores after the rinse regimen began in both Group A (test group) and Group C (chlorhexidine) compared with Group B. Mouth wash containing Aloe vera showed significant reduction of plaque and gingivitis but when compared with chlorhexidine the effect was less significant. Aloe vera mouthwash can be an effective antiplaque agent and with appropriate refinements in taste and shelf life can be an affordable herbal substitute for chlorhexidine.

They are getting more concerned about the esthetics and thus are not ready to compromise the appearance of black holes, especially in the anterior region of the mouth. Various techniques like orthodontic correction, prosthetic veneers and various periodontal surgical methods have been used to cover these unaesthetic open embrasures. In the present study, a variant technique given by Beagle in 1992 was used to cover these open gingival embrasures. The technique uses a gingival flap from the labial aspect to close the open gingival embrasures thus solving the problem of black holes. This clinical study was aimed to reconstruct the lost or blunted interdental papillae with gingival tissue for esthetic purpose and for maintaining oral health with the objective to determine the extent to which the procedure can revert the maxillary esthetics. The patients selected were those who were having a complaint of at least one black hole in the maxillary anterior region with grade '0' or '1' type of contour of interdental tissues. A total of 39 open embrasures were surgically closed using this technique. Various indices were taken pre-surgically and then again post surgically. Plaque index and gingival index showed an initial increase in the scores at the end of 1 week. Later, there was a gradual fall till the end of the study. Bleeding index significantly increased at the end of 12 weeks (P&lt;0.001) but reduced to insignificant levels at the end of 24 weeks (P&lt;0.09). The sulcus depth increased by about 1.19 mm. There was improvement in the contour of interdental tissues in 51% of cases and in 38.46% the interdental papillae completely obliterated the open embrasures. The surgical technique used here for reconstruction of interdental papilla was fairly successful. However, use of bone grafts or soft tissue grafts would have improved the results further.

One thousand and twenty-six subjects were selected by multistage stratified randomized sampling technique. They were examined in free dental camps organized in preselected rural areas by using community periodontal index of treatment need. The impact of known risk factors for periodontal disease, e.g., oral hygiene habits, age, gender, smoking, and pan + tobacco chewing, was also observed. Deep pockets were observed in 52.7% of the subjects and 17.8% of the sextants. Shallow pockets were observed in 37.4% of the subjects and 36.4% of the sextants. Calculus had the highest score in 9.8% of the subjects and 43.8% of the sextants. None of the subjects and negligible number of the sextants was found to be having bleeding or healthy periodontium as the highest score. Periodontal disease severity was found to be increased with increasing age. Severity was also more in smokers and in the subjects using finger and powder to maintain their oral hygiene. ","1163":"Dental implants have evolved dramatically over the last decade, and so have our expectations from them in terms of functional and esthetic criteria. The maintenance and augmentation of the soft tissue has emerged as an area of concern and focus. The triad of anatomical peri-implant characteristics, soft tissue response to the implant material, and clinical skill form the fundamental principles in augmenting soft tissue. However, as clinicians, where are we with regards to the ability to augment and maintain soft tissue around dental implants, about 40 years after the first implants were placed? We now understand that peri-implant soft tissue management begins with extraction management. Our treatment modalities have evolved from socket compression post-extraction, to socket preservation with an aim to enhance the eventual peri-implant soft tissue. This short communication will assess the evolution of our thought regarding peri-implant soft tissue management, augmentation of keratinized mucosa around implants, and also look at some recent techniques including the rotated pedicle connective tissue graft for enhancing inter-implant papilla architecture. With newer research modalities, such as cyto-detachment technology, and cutting-edge bioengineering solutions (possibly a soft-tissue-implant construct) which might be available in the near future for enhancing soft tissue, we are certainly in an exciting era in dentistry.","1164":"According to World Oral Health report 2003, the prevalence of periodontitis is 86% in India. Dental care can sometimes be a forgotten part of a healthy life style. While its importance is often underestimated, the need for regular dental care cannot be overstated. Oral health has been neglected for long in India. The scarce literature on dental health awareness, attitude, oral health-related habits and behavior among the adult population in Rajasthan prompted us to assess the preventive oral health awareness and oral hygiene practices in patients attending outpatient department of Vyas Dental College and Hospital (VDCH), Jodhpur through this study. A total of 500 patients in the age group 15-50 years were selected using random sampling technique. A self-administered structured questionnaire including 16 multiple choice questions was given to them. The results were analyzed using percentage. The result of this study shows an acute lack of oral hygiene awareness and limited knowledge of oral hygiene practices. In Jodhpur, few people use tooth brush. Hence, there is an urgent need for comprehensive educational programs to promote good oral health and impart education about correct oral hygiene practices. ","1165":"The investigation of disease-related oxidant-antioxidant imbalance is difficult due to the limited availability of specific biomarkers of oxidative stress, and the fact that measurement of individual antioxidant may give misleading picture because antioxidants work in concert through chain breaking reactions. Therefore, analysis of total antioxidant capacity may be the most relevant investigation. As the total blood is continuously exposed to oxidative stress, the aim of the current study was to investigate total blood antioxidant capacity in healthy and periodontitis patients by using novel Nitroblue Tetrazolium reduction test. The study was conducted on 30 non-smoking volunteers with age ranging between 18-40 years. They were categorized into two groups; chronic periodontitis group and healthy group, respectively. Total antioxidant capacity in whole blood was assessed using Nitroblue Tetrazolium reduction test. Results of the present study has shown that the total antioxidant capacity in whole blood in patients with periodontitis was significantly (P&lt;0.005) lower than in control subjects. The reduced total blood antioxidant status in periodontitis subjects warrants further investigation as it may provide a mechanistic link between periodontal disease and several other free radical-associated chronic inflammatory diseases.","1166":"The correlation between certain systemic diseases and ABO blood group is a well-documented fact. The association between periodontal disease and ABO blood group is not studied in relation to a specific geographic location. Here is a study conducted on a group of patients belonging to South Kanara district of Karnataka state. A total of 750 subjects aged between 30and 38 years belonging to South Kanara district were selected on random basis. The study subjects were segregated into healthy\/mild gingivitis, moderate\/severe gingivitis, and periodontitis group, based on Loe and Silness index and clinical attachment loss as criteria. The study group was further categorized and graded using Ramfjord's periodontal disease index. Blood samples were collected to identify ABO blood group. Prevalence of blood group O was more in South Kanara district, followed by blood groups B and A, and the least prevalent was AB. The percentage distribution of subjects with blood groups O and AB was more in healthy\/mild gingivitis group (group I) and moderate\/severe gingivitis group (group II), while subjects with blood groups B and A were more in periodontitis group III. There was increased prevalence of subjects with blood groups O and AB with healthy periodontium, while subjects with blood groups B and A showed inclination toward diseased periodontium. There is a correlation existing between periodontal disease and ABO blood group in this geographic location. This association can be due to various blood group antigens acting as receptors for infectious agents associated with periodontal disease. This broad correlation between periodontal disease and ABO blood group also points toward susceptibility ofthe subjects with certain blood groups to periodontal disease. ","1167":"Melanin pigmentation often occurs in the gingiva as a result of an abnormal deposition of melanin, due to which the gums may appear black, but the principles, techniques, and management of the problems associated with gingival melanin pigmentation are still not fully established. Depigmentation procedures such as scalpel surgery, gingivectomy with free gingival autografting, electrosurgery, cryosurgery, chemical agents such as 90% phenol and 95% alcohol, abrasion with diamond bur, Nd: YAG laser, semiconductor diode laser, and CO2 laser have been employed for removal of melanin hyper pigmentation. The following case series describes three different surgical depigmentation techniques: scalpel surgery, abrasion with rotary abrasive, and a diode laser. Better results of depigmentation were achieved with diode laser than conventional scalpel and with rotary abrasion with respect to esthetics. The results point out that lasers are an effective and a safe means to removal of hyperpigmentation from the gingiva. Healing was uneventful and no repigmentation occurred.","1168":"Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) enzyme is involved in the destruction of the human periodontium. The present study was conducted to determine the presence and levels of ALP activity in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) in periodontal health, gingivitis, and chronic periodontitis. GCF samples were collected from 45 sites which were divided into three equal groups of healthy samples and gingivitis and chronic periodontitis samples. Various clinical parameters were evaluated and the levels of ALP were estimated using a semi-autoanalyzer. Analysis of variance was employed to compare the ALP levels in different groups. Pearson's correlation coefficient was utilized to find the correlation between ALP levels and various clinical parameters. Difference in the mean ALP levels between healthy and gingivitis groups was found to be nonsignificant (P&gt;0.05) and that between the chronic periodontitis group and healthy as well as gingivitis groups was found to be highly significant (P&lt;0.001). Significant correlations existed between ALP levels and gingival index, probing depths, as well as clinical attachment levels. The finding of the present study confirms the relationship between ALP level and periodontal disease, thus indicating that GCF ALP levels can be used as potential biochemical markers for the detection and progression of periodontal disease. ","1169":"Dental implants placement can sometimes be limited due to physical conditions, wherein the horizontal space is limited by adjacent teeth and roots or situations in which there is narrow alveolar ridge, By using a narrow diameter implant (NDI), the need for bone augmentation can be avoided.

It may develop as an isolated disorder but can feature along with a syndrome. A case of 12 year old female child who presented with generalised severe gingival overgrowth, involving both the arches and covering almost the entire dentition, and had all the teeth remaining invisible within the confinement of gingival tissues. The excess gingival tissue, in this non-syndromic case was removed by conventional gingivectomy using local as well as general anaesthesia. The post-operative result was uneventful and the patient appearance improved considerably. Good aesthetic result was achieved to allow patient to practice oral hygiene measures. After treatment regular recall visits are necessary in order to evaluate oral hygiene and stability of periodontal treatment.","1172":null,"1173":"Squamous cell carcinomas of the gingiva make up a significant percentage of oral squamous cell carcinomas and are one of the most common causes of death worldwide. Cancers of the gingiva often escape early detection, and hence an early intervention, since their initial signs and symptoms resemble common dental and periodontal infections. This article presents a case of a 29-year-old female patient who presented with a non-healing wound for about 1.5 months post-extraction. The wound was associated with pain and suppuration. A provisional diagnosis of alveolar osteitis was derived at with a differential diagnosis of osteomyelitis and carcinoma of the alveolus. The patient was advised a complete hemogram, orthopantomograph, and intra-oral periapical radiograph of the extraction socket. An incisional biopsy was carried out. Radiographs revealed extensive bone loss, and the biopsy report confirmed the diagnosis of well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the alveolus. Carcinoma of the gingiva often mimics inflammatory lesions and hence is often misdiagnosed. Therefore, any oral lesion should strike a chord of suspicion, and practitioners should base their diagnosis on careful examination, and valid evidence.","1174":"In periodontology, Guided Tissue Regeneration (GTR) is based on the concept of providing a space for entry of cells with regenerative potential into the wound environment to initiate the regeneration of structures lost due to periodontal disease. First generation GTR membranes were primarily non-absorbable membranes like expanded polytetrafluorethylene which required a second surgery for its removal. This led researchers to explore absorbable materials like collagen and synthetic biodegradable polymers to fabricate GTR membranes. In the present study, biodegradable Polylactic acid (PLA) is used to fabricate membranes with the potential to be used for GTR therapy. Biocompatibility of the PLA membranes were evaluated in a subcutaneous guinea pig model. Antimicrobial effect of the drug-loaded PLA membranes were assessed against a drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacterial isolate. The cytocompatibility of the drug-loaded membranes were evaluated using HeLa cell lines. The PLA membranes were shown to be biocompatible. The drug-loaded PLA membranes showed significant activity against the bacterial isolate. Among the drug-loaded membranes, tetracycline-loaded membrane showed minimal cellular toxicity. The results of this study indicate that biodegradable drug-releasing polylactide membranes have the potential to be used for periodontal regeneration. It has the necessary characteristics of a GTR membrane like biocompatibility, space maintaining ability, and tissue integration. Among the various antimicrobial agents loaded in the PLA membranes, tetracycline-loaded membranes exhibited minimal cellular toxicity against HeLa cells; at the same time showing significant activity against a pathogenic bacterium.

The unifying term \"OFG\" has been introduced to integrate the spectrum of various disorders, including Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome and granulomatous cheilitis (which is sometimes considered to be a monosymptomatic form of Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome), and has been shown to be associated with Crohn's disease, sarcoidosis, and infectious diseases such as tuberculosis. Although various etiological agents such as food substances, food additives, dental materials, and various microbiological agents have been implicated in the disease process, its precise pathogenesis is yet to be elucidated. Delayed type of hypersensitivity reaction appears to play a significant role, although the exact antigen inducing the immunological reaction varies in individual patients. However, evidence for the role of genetic predisposition to the disease is sparse. The underlying immunological mechanism appears to show some similarities between OFG and Crohn's disease, emphasizing the need for more comparative studies of the two entities. The aim of this article is to report a case of OFG, along with a detailed literature review of the facts and variations associated with its nomenclature, clinical presentation, and etiology. It also projects the challenges that a professional has to face in the diagnosis and treatment planning of such cases.","1177":"Gingival cyst of adult is an uncommon cyst of gingival soft tissue occurring in either the free or attached gingiva. This odontogenic epithelial cyst is most frequently seen near mandibular canine and premolar region, believed to represent the soft tissue counter part of the lateral periodontal cyst.

The radiographic and clinical features are variable, and the diagnosis is therefore not easy. A case of OM of the maxilla is described in a 19-year-old female, previously diagnosed as inflammatory gingival enlargement. Clinical, histological, radiographic, and computed tomographic (CT) scan assessments were done, which were confirmatory for OM. Surgical excision of the lesion was done. The patient was put on periodic recall, as the recurrence rate of the lesion was high. The biological spectrum of OM was highly variable and diagnosis at an early stage was very difficult. Gingival enlargement presentation might not always be an inflammatory reaction. All possible differential diagnosis should be explored and various diagnostic tools utilized, to screen the enlargement.","1179":"Anatomical aberrations and abnormalities are frequently associated with functional, psychosocial, and emotional problems. One such aberration is crestal attachment of frenum or muscle on the alveolar processes of the jaws. Crestal attachment of buccinator muscle is a rare phenomenon, which may pose various problems in routine oral exercises\/functions or restoring the edentulous area. A case of abnormal buccinator muscle attachment is presented here, which was relocated apically by surgical means using an acrylic stent. The healing was uneventful and significant apical repositioning was observed. A fixed bridge was fabricated and the long-term results of the restorative therapy were assured because the patient could maintain the oral hygiene well after the muscle repositioning operation.","1180":"Complete or partial absence of the second sex chromosome, with or without a mosaic karyotype, is detected in approximately 1 per 2,500 live-born females. Such a cytogenetic finding coupled with clinical features, such as short stature and ovarian failure, supports the diagnosis of Turner's syndrome (TS). It is typically characterized by the combination of physical features and cytogenetics in females. The presenting clinical features can vary widely among affected individuals. Consequently, whereas short stature and gonadal dysgenesis are almost universal in TS, many other organ systems are affected to varying degrees and at different stages of life. The periodontal status of three females diagnosed with TS has been reported here.","1181":"Resorption of alveolar bone - a common sequel of tooth loss jeopardizes the functional and esthetic outcome of treatment, especially in the maxillary anterior areas. Therefore, augmentation of deficient alveolar ridges is an important aspect of dental implant therapy. A case of severe maxillary ridge deficiency successfully treated with horizontal ridge augmentation to facilitate implant placement is described. Ridge augmentation was achieved using a combination of autogenous block graft, particulate grafting, and guided bone regeneration (GBR). Follow-up was done next day, after ten days, three months, and six months. Various approaches can be followed in order to achieve an increase in the ridge width. In our case, we used a combination of different techniques for ridge augmentation. A significant improvement in ridge width was noticed at six months thus facilitating the placement of implants.","1182":"A case describing perio-restorative management of an accidental trauma in the mid portion of root on an upper left canine tooth following an ostectomy surgery is presented here. The traumatized root area was undergoing fast resorption and a chronic periodontal abscess had developed in relation to the lesion. The article illustrates the clinical and radiographic photo series of a periodontal flap surgery done to gain access into a subgingival region for the placement of Glass ionomer restoration on the root and its periodic follow up. The clinical condition of the area suggests 8 mm clinical attachment gain over the restoration and the review radiographs at definite intervals up to 18 months revealed evidence of consistent bone regeneration around the restoration. The article also highlights the various other possibilities, where this restorative material can be effectively used in conjunction with periodontal surgical procedures.","1183":"Gingival recession may present problems that include root sensitivity, esthetic concern, and predilection to root caries, cervical abrasion and compromising of a restorative effort. When marginal tissue health cannot be maintained and recession is deep, the need for treatment arises. This literature has documented that recession can be successfully treated by means of a two stage surgical approach, the first stage consisting of creation of attached gingiva by means of free gingival graft, and in the second stage, a lateral sliding flap of grafted tissue to cover the recession. This indirect technique ensures development of an adequate width of attached gingiva. The outcome of this technique suggests that two stage surgical procedures are highly predictable for root coverage in case of isolated deep recession and lack of attached gingiva.","1184":"The purpose of the present study was to determine the prevalence and extent of gingival overgrowth in patients treated with calcium channel blockers for cardiovascular diseases. Calcium channel blockers are widely used in the treatment of hypertension, vasoplastic angina, and cardiacarrythmias. Gingival overgrowth resulting from the use of calcium channel blockers is of primary concern to dentists. The purpose of the present study is to determine the prevalence and extent of gingival overgrowth in patients treated with calcium channel blockers for various cardiovascular diseases, to assess their periodontal status and to correlate the factors like age, sex, duration, dosage, type of drugs that result in gingival overgrowth. A cross-sectional study was done in cardiac patients treated with calcium channel blockers, visiting The Railway hospital, Perumbur, Chennai. Information regarding medical history, type, duration, dosage of medication were recorded and analyzed. The periodontal condition of the patients was assessed using the plaque index, gingival index, calculus index, papillary bleeding index, and extent of gingival overgrowth using appropriate indices. The data was later subjected to statistical analysis. In this study, a total of 213 cardiac patients (145 males and 68 females) who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were screened. The patients were between 19 and 69 years. From the results of the present study it can be concluded that gingival overgrowth does occur with calcium channel blockers. Elderly males appeared to be more susceptible to the development of drug-induced gingival overgrowth, which was independent of dosage, duration of drug administered but the presence of local factors seemed to aggravate the same.

A total of 650 subjects reporting dentine sensitivity were included in the study comprising of 270 males and 380 females. All the subjects completed an interview and the subjects reporting dentine hypersensitivity were examined further using air syringe to put a blast of air to confirm the diagnosis of dentine hypersensitivity. Periodontal attachment loss and gingival recession of all the sensitive teeth were examined and recorded. The prevalence of dentine hypersensitivity was 25% in the oral test. The subjects receiving the treatment of hypersensitivity were only 15.1%. The older group in the 50-59 years had the highest number (98%) of subjects with dentine hypersensitivity. Most commonly affected teeth were mandibular incisors. The other factors related to dentine hypersensitivity were the socioeconomic status, lower education level, and access to dental care. The periodontal factors related to hypersensitivity were gingival recession and poor oral hygiene. The prevalence of dentine hypersensitivity was 25% in the rural population of Punjab.

Seven hundred and fifty teenagers in the age group of 14-17 years, constituting visually impaired, deaf and dumb, intellectually disabled, physically challenged and normal teenagers, were studied. Oral hygiene status and periodontal status were assessed using clinical indices and compared. Among the five groups chosen for the study, the intellectually disabled group had the highest plaque scores and poor oral hygiene. The visually impaired and deaf and dumb had better oral hygiene compared with other disability groups. Physically handicapped showed higher loss of attachment scores and deleterious and parafunctional habits. Normal teenagers had good oral hygiene and lower plaque scores. Oral health status relied basically on proper use of oral hygiene aids and training of the groups by their care takers. Disabled groups showed poor oral hygiene and higher incidence of periodontal disease, which may be attributed to the lack of coordination, understanding, physical disability or muscular limitations. Hence, more attention needs to be given to the dental needs of these individuals through ultimate, accurate and appropriate prevention, detection and treatment. ","1187":"In the present study, a new electronic model ROBOTUTOR was designed to compare the efficacy of different modes of dental health education for demonstration of the Bass toothbrushing technique and also to evaluate its efficacy with different modes of dental health education in patient understanding. Total 150 subjects were randomized into two groups, Group 1 (Questionnaire) and Group II (Investigators). Subjects with history of gingivitis and only mild periodontitis were included. Demonstration of Bass technique was given to each subject with the help of three different modes, i.e., ROBOTUTOR, clinician, and audio-video aids. The result was evaluated in terms of effectiveness, ease of understanding, attraction, and recollection. In the present study, the best mode of education is clinician demonstration and the least effective one is the audio-video mode. In contrast, the ROBOTUTOR model was found to be more attractive than the other two. Although demonstration by clinician is the best, it is time consuming and not feasible for community purpose. ROBOTUTOR would thus save clinician's chair side time and help in effective demonstration of the brushing technique. ","1188":"Obtaining predictable and aesthetic root coverage has become an important part of periodontal therapy. Several techniques have been developed to obtain these results with variable outcomes. The aim of this study was to compare and evaluate the effectiveness of acellular dermal matrix allograft (ADMA) and subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) in combination with coronally positioned flap in the treatment of multiple gingival recessions in aesthetic areas. Total 10 patients were selected for this study, aged between 18 to 40 years and were randomly assigned to one of the groups ADMA and SCTG. The clinical parameters including probing pocket depth, clinical attachment level, gingival recession, width of keratinized tissue were recorded at baseline and at 6 months after surgery and data was statistically analyzed. No significant differences in gingival recession reduction were noted between ADMA and gold - standard SCTG. Within limits of this clinical study, the use of ADMA may represent an acceptable alternative to the SCTG for treating gingival recession. The use of ADMA eliminates the need for the palatal donor site thus represents a less invasive surgery for treating multiple gingival recessions. These results suggest that ADMA may be a useful substitute instead of subepithelial connective tissue graft for root coverage.

Antimicrobial therapy frequently fails to cure H. pylori infection, which suggests there may be sanctuary sites where the organism resides. This study was aimed to assess the role of oral cavity as a reservoir of H. pylori by evaluating the occurrence of the organism in subgingival plaque of dyspeptic patients by polymerase chain reaction as well as culture. Thirty chronic periodontitis patients whose biopsy specimens were found to be H. pylori positive with rapid urease test and histopathologic examination were considered as cases and 20 chronic periodontitis patients who never had any symptoms of gastritis or peptic ulcer were taken as controls. Subgingival plaque samples were collected and sent to microbiological laboratory for detection of H. pylori by 16S rRNA based polymerase chain reaction as well as culture. 60% of the samples were found to be positive with polymerase chain reaction in the case group when compared to 15% in the controls. Also, 30% of the cases were found to be positive with culture compared to none in controls. A higher frequency of detection of H. pylori in those patients with positive antral biopsy report was seen. Also, polymerase chain reaction was found to be more sensitive than culture for detection. Thus, we conclude that detection of H. pylori in dental plaque of dyspeptic patients cannot be neglected and might represent a risk factor for recolonization of stomach after systemic eradication therapy. ","1191":"The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of scaling and root planing (SRP) alone versus tetracycline fiber therapy used adjunctively with SRP in the treatment of chronic periodontitis sites in maintenance patients. A total of 30 patients with a diagnosis of chronic periodontitis (60 localized chronic periodontitis sites) in the age group of 35 to 55 were selected. None of these patients had received any surgical or non-surgical periodontal therapy and had sites of periodontal pockets measuring 4-7 mm clinically and demonstrated radiographic evidence of moderate bone loss. Two non-adjacent sites in separate quadrants were selected in each patient for monitoring based on criteria that the sites had localized chronic periodontitis. Plaque index (PI) (sillness and loe) and Gingival-bleeding index (GI) (loe and sillness) were measured at baseline and 15(th), 30(th), 60(th), and 90(th)day. Clinical pocket depth (PD) and microbial analysis (MA) were analyzed at baseline and 90(th) day. At 0 and 3 months adjunctive tetracycline fiber therapy was significantly better in reducing PI, GBI, (P&lt;0.001) than S and RP alone. In comparison, the reduction in the PD was non-significant at 0 and 3 months (P&lt;0.001). The microbial analysis showed significant reduction in Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia though there was no significant reduction in the Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Overall, these results indicate that fiber therapy significantly enhanced the effectiveness of SRP in the management of chronic periodontitis. ","1192":"The aim of our clinical trial was to assess the efficacy of 0.1% turmeric mouthwash as an anti-plaque agent and its effect on gingival inflammation and to compare it with 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate by evaluating the effect on plaque and gingival inflammation and on microbial load. 60 subjects, 15 years and above, with mild to moderate gingivitis were recruited. Study population was divided into two groups. Group A-30 subjects were advised chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash. Group B-30 subjects were advised experimental (turmeric) mouthwash. Both the groups were advised to use 10 ml of mouthwash with equal dilution of water for 1 min twice a day 30 min after brushing. Parameters were recorded for plaque and gingival index at day 0, on 14 (th) day, and 21 (st) day. Subjective and objective criteria were assessed after 14(th) day and 21(st) day. The N-benzoyl-l-arginine-p- nitroanilide (BAPNA) assay was used to analyze trypsin like activity of red complex microorganisms. On comparison between chlorhexidine and turmeric mouthwash, percentage reduction of the Plaque Index between 0 and 21 (st) day were 64.207 and 69.072, respectively (P=0.112), percentage reduction of Gingival Index between 0 and 21(st) day were 61.150 and 62.545 respectively (P=0.595) and percentage reduction of BAPNA values between 0 and 21(st) day were 42.256 and 48.901 respectively (P=0.142). Chlorhexidine gluconate as well as turmeric mouthwash can be effectively used as an adjunct to mechanical plaque control in prevention of plaque and gingivitis. Both the mouthwashes have comparable anti-plaque, anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial properties. ","1193":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of subgingivally administered xanthan-based chlorhexidine gel when used in the maintenance phase following scaling and root planing (SRP) in the treatment of chronic periodontitis. A randomized, controlled, single-center study was conducted involving 92 sites in 46 systemically healthy patients suffering from moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis with isolated pockets. The selected sites were randomized to two treatment arms: Group A (SRP alone) and Group B (SRP + insertion of chlorhexidine gel after 1 month). The gingival index, plaque index, probing pocket depth (PPD) and clinical attachment level (CAL) were recorded at baseline and subsequently after 1 month and 3 months. Both the groups showed significant reductions in PPD and CAL at both follow-up visits when compared with the baseline values (P&lt;0.001). The results suggest that the application of xanthan based chlorhexidine gel following SRP in the maintenance phase might be beneficial in treatment of the chronic periodontitis in comparison to SRP alone. Greater improvements may be achieved when antimicrobial agents are used following SRP. ","1194":"It is now well established that removal of bacterial plaque can reduce the severity of chronic inflammatory periodontal disease. Periodontal disease is seen to progress faster interdentally and plaque control in these areas is of great importance. Various types of interdental cleaning aids have been developed in recent years. This study was aimed at evaluating the efficacy of a newly developed interdental cleaning aid, BrushPick, in a split mouth randomized clinical trial. This was a split mouth design study where the quadrant on one side of the oral cavity served as the control while another quadrant on the opposite side served as the test sample. Fifty-seven patients with mild-to-moderate periodontitis, presenting with open interdental embrasures, were selected for the study. After non-surgical periodontal therapy, they were asked to use the BrushPick in the embrasures on one side of the arch in a spilt mouth design study and the embrasures on the other side acted as controls. The Rustogi et al. modified Navy plaque index (RMNPI) and interdental bleeding index (IBI) were recorded at baseline, seven days, 14 days, and 28 days. The mean differences between test and control sites were compared using the studentt test. The mean difference was compared between different durations using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The mean RMNPI was significantly different between the test and control sites at P&lt;0.001 on both days 14 and 28. At 28 days the mean IBI was 0.08 (SD=0.02) for the experimental sites and 0.28 (SD=0.11) for the control sites. The difference was statistically significant at P&lt;0.001. ANOVA showed that the mean RMNPI scores and mean IBI scores showed a statistically significant difference when compared at different durations at the test sites (P&lt;0.0001). But, at the control sites there was no significant change. This study suggested that BrushPick reduces plaque and gingival bleeding in open interdental embrasures. Further large sampled clinical trials and comparative studies using gold standard interdental cleaning aids are required to establish the efficacy of this device.

To study the association between psychological stress and chronic periodontitis. One hundred and eleven dentate individuals, of age 40 years and above, were selected. The clinical examination included, the number of teeth present, plaque index, Probing Pocket Depth, and Clinical Attachment Level. Assessment of Psychological stress levels were done by a questionnaire and were correlated with salivary cortisol levels, which were estimated biochemically by using the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method. Statistical analysis was done by using the student 't' test and Mann Whitney test. According to our observation, chronic periodontitis showed a significant correlation with hypercortisolemia (P&lt;0.0001), work tension (P=0.04), economic problems (P&lt;0.0001), clinical stress syndrome (P&lt;0.0001), plaque index (P&lt;0.0001), and unsecured job (P=0.003).

Routine salivary cortisol assessment may be an economical and useful diagnostic marker to rule out stress in periodontitis patients. ","1197":"Host responses to periodontal disease include the production of different enzymes released by stromal, epithelial or inflammatory cells. Important enzymes associated with cell injury and cell death are aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase (AST, ALT), alkaline phosphatase, acidic phosphatase (ALP, ACP), and gama glutamyl transferase (GGT). Changes in enzymatic activity reflect metabolic changes in the gingiva and periodontium, in the inflammation. In this article we examined the activity of AST, ALT, GGT, ALP, and ACP in the saliva from patients with periodontal disease, before and after periodontal treatment (experimental group - 20 gingivitis patients and 20 periodontitis patients), and in the saliva from healthy subjects (control group - 20 samples). Periodontal disease was determined based on the clinical parameters (gingival index (GI), probing depth (PD), and clinical attachment loss (CAL)). Patients with periodontal disease were under conventional periodontal treatment. The stimulated saliva of the patient was collected in a sterile test tube and analyzed using the Automatic Analyzer. The obtained results showed statistically significant increased activity of AST, ALT, GGT, ALP, and ACP in the saliva from patients with periodontal disease, in relation to the control group. A significant reduction in the enzyme levels was seen after conventional periodontal therapy. Based on these results, it can be assumed that the salivary enzymes (AST, ALT, GGT, ALP, and ACP) can be considered as biochemical markers for evaluating the diagnosis and prognosis of the functional condition of periodontal tissues in disease and health, and in the evaluation of the therapy effects in periodontal disease.

The remaining ten specimens from each group were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline on a rotary shaker and designated as 'Agitated'. The roots were processed for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to assess and compare the clot adhesion on them. The scores were compared through standard statistical packages. The highest mean blood clot adhesion score was observed in roots treated with a combination of citric acid and tetracycline, whereas, the least score was observed in roots treated with saline. The root specimens treated with the combination of citric acid and tetracycline as well as citric acid alone, best supported the fibrin clot.

The Department of Periodontics of the K. M. Shah Dental College and Hospital, Vadodara, (Gujarat, India). SIXTY PERIODONTALLY COMPROMISED EXTRACTED HUMAN TEETH WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO FOUR GROUPS: (1) scaling and root planning (SRP) alone; (2) passive topical application of Carisolv + SRP; (3) active topical application of Carisolv + SRP; (4) multiple applications of Carisolv + SRP. Carisolv gel was applied to the root surfaces for 30 seconds, followed by scaling and root planing, consisting of 30 strokes, with Gracey curettes in an apical-coronal direction, parallel to the long axis of the tooth. The only exception was group 4, where the roots were instrumented until a smooth, hard, and glass-like surface was achieved. All specimens were further analyzed by SEM. The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) method was used. Active application of Carisolv gel produced more extensive morphological changes than passive application and SRP alone. When multiple applications of Carisolv with SRP were performed, there was a significant decrease in the smear layer compared to a single application of the gel, either passively or actively. The Carisolv gel failed to remove the smear layer completely, especially with a single application, independently of the method of application.

","1203":"The prevention and treatment of periodontal disease is based on accurate diagnosis, reduction or elimination of causative agents, risk management and correction of the harmful effects of the disease. The practice of risk assessment involves dental care providers identifying patients and populations at increased risk of developing periodontal disease. This can have a significant impact on clinical decision making. Risk assessment reduces the need for complex periodontal therapy, improve patient outcome and, ultimately, reduce oral health care cost. The awareness of risk factors also helps with the identification and treatment of co-morbidities in the general population as many periodontal disease risk factors are common to other chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and stroke.","1204":"It is well-recognized fact that periodontal diseases are caused by multifactorial etiologies, in which microorganisms play an important role. An essential component of therapy is to eliminate or manage these pathogens. This has been traditionally accomplished through mechanical means by scaling and root planning which is ineffective in some of the aggressive periodontal diseases. These aggressive diseases involve particular groups of microorganisms which are not eliminated by mechanical means; and they require anti-infective therapy, which includes local and systemic antimicrobials. This approach of therapy is of interest to periodontist due to the aforementioned shortcomings of conventional methods. A manual and electronic search was made for human studies up to March 2011 that presented clinical and microbiological data for the efficacy of a systemic antibiotics in generalized aggressive periodontitis along with scaling and root planning. A systematic approach was followed by two independent reviewers and included eligibility criteria for study inclusion, quality assessment, and determination of outcome measures, data extraction, data synthesis, and drawing of conclusion. Only three randomized controlled human trials qualified, and they concluded that both scaling and root planing (SRP) mono-therapy and SRP with antibiotics proves beneficial in improving clinical and microbiological parameters in aggressive periodontitis. Better results were seen in SRP with antibiotic groups as compared with SRP alone. Because of the insufficient quantity and heterogenecity of studies, no adequate evidence could be gathered to use the beneficial effects of these antibiotics along with SRP in aggressive periodontitis compared with SRP alone.

Intra oral examination showed non tender gingival swelling with spontaneous bleeding associated with maxillary arch. On initiation of phase I therapy using hand instruments, spontaneous brisk bleeding was encountered which was difficult to control. Because of severe nature of hemorrhage encountered, some type of vascular abnormality was suspected. Ultrasonography followed by angiography confirmed AVM in relation with upper lip.

Since many teeth were extracted without evidence of infection, thereby providing no relief of symptoms, the theory was discredited and largely ignored for many years. Recent progress in classification and identification of oral microorganisms and the realization that certain microorganisms are normally found only in the oral cavity have opened the way for a more realistic assessment of the importance of oral focal infection. It has become increasingly clear that the oral cavity can act as the site of origin for dissemination of pathogenic organisms to distant body sites, especially in immunocompromised hosts such as patients suffering from malignancies, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, or in patients undergoing other immunosuppressive treatment.

This paper reports a case of a peripheral osteoma in the hard palate of a 45-year-old man, which was treated by periodontal flap surgery with surgical excision of the bony lesion. Peripheral osteomas of jaw bone are uncommon and usually associated with Gardner's syndrome. Histological examination confirmed the clinical impression of a peripheral osteoma. Patient was reviewed after one year and was asymptomatic with no recurrence of the lesion.","1242":"Paget's disease of bone is a common condition characterized by increased and disorganized bone turnover which can affect one or several bones throughout the skeleton. These abnormalities disrupt normal bone architecture and lead to various complications such as bone pain, osteoarthritis, pathological fracture, bone deformity, deafness, and nerve compression syndromes. Genetic factors and environmental factors like paramyxovirus infection have been implicated in etiology. This is a case report of a patient who presented with Paget's disease and the periodontal surgical management, after the pretreatment was employed with diagnostic procedures like computed tomography and serum alkaline phosphatase tests.","1243":"Desquamative gingival lesions are non-plaque induced inflammatory gingival lesions. It is a clinical description and not a diagnosis. These desquamative lesions represent oral manifestations of various dermatoses. Discoid lupus erythematosus is one of the rare dermatoses which show desquamative lesions as oral manifestations. This article presents a rare case report of discoid lupus erythematosus with oral lesions involving gingiva of a 66-year-old female patient.","1244":"Distraction osteogenesis is a method of inducing new bone formation by applying mechanical strains on preexisting bone. The process of osteogenesis in the periodontal ligament during orthodontic tooth movement is similar to the osteogenesis in the midpalatal suture during rapid palatal expansion. A new concept of \"distracting the periodontal ligament\" is proposed to elicit rapid canine retraction in two weeks. At the time of first premolar extraction, the interseptal bone distal to the canine was undermined with a bone bur, grooving vertically inside the extraction socket along the buccal and lingual sides and extending obliquely toward the socket base. Then, a tooth-borne, custom-made, intraoral distraction device was placed to distract the canine distally into the extraction space. It was activated 0.5 mm\/day, immediately after the extraction. Canine was distracted 6.5 mm into the extraction space within two weeks.","1245":"Osseous choristoma is a rare, benign lesion of the oral cavity occurring usually on the tongue. It appears as a tumorous mass of normal bony structure with mature cells in an ectopic position. Some lesions represent developmental malformations, whereas others may be reactive lesions, after trauma or chronic irritation. This is the first ever reported case of an osseous choristoma of the periodontium in the lingual aspect of posterior mandible.","1246":"Plasma cell gingivitis is a rare condition characterized by diffuse and massive infiltration of plasma cells into the sub-epithelial connective tissue. Clinically, it appears as a diffuse reddening and edematous swelling of the gingiva with a sharp demarcation along the mucogingival border. Though considered as a hypersensitive reaction to an allergen, the etiology of this bizarre condition is still not properly understood. Here, we present an interesting case of plasma cell gingivitis associated with an enlarged and fissured upper lip, which is quite a rarity. The condition was diagnosed based on clinical and histopathologic findings and treated by gingivectomy. The associated cheilitis has dramatically reduced after treatment of the gingival lesion.","1247":"We report an unusual case of recurrent periodontal abscess in a 31-year-old male electrician due to his habit of using his teeth as a tool for stripping electrical wires. The patient was not aware of the consequences of this habit. Clinically, there was presence of moderate depth of periodontal pocket around the tooth and, radiographically, there was a vertical defect mesial to the involved teeth. The patient was educated about the consequences of his habit and surgical treatment was undertaken. A papilla preservation flap with regenerative periodontal surgical procedure was done, orthodontic and restorative treatment was planned at the follow-up. This case highlights the importance of eliciting a proper and complete personal history, including occupational details. In our patient these details helped us correlate the destruction of the periodontium to the unusual etiology.","1248":"Guided bone regeneration (GBR) in implant therapy is especially useful for implant placement with dehiscence defects or fenestration defects. In alveolar ridges with marked facial\/buccal depressions or in knifeedge alveolar crests, the position and direction of fixture placement is restricted. Improvement of alveolar ridge morphology becomes possible with GBR. This article describes a case in which the fenestration defect around an implant was treated by the application of platelet rich fibrin, a second generation platelet concentrate along with bone graft, and guided tissue regeneration membrane.","1249":"Oral squamous cell carcinomas represent 3% of cancers in men and 2% of cancers in women. More than 90% of oral cancer occurs in people older than 45 years Lesions of gingiva account for approximately 10% of the oral squamous cell carcinomas and may present clinically as an area of ulceration, exophytic mass, or red\/white speckled patches. The proximity to the underlying periosteum may invite early bone invasion. Carcinoma of gingiva constitutes an extremely important group of neoplasms as the lesion frequently mimics the reactive and inflammatory conditions affecting the periodontium, delaying the diagnosis and making the prognosis of the patient poorer. A rare case of gingival squamous cell carcinoma has been reported here, in a 40 Year old male patient. Careful recording of the case history and results of clinical examination, radiographic, and laboratory investigations, along with a critical review of similar conditions led to the diagnosis, and treatment was initiated.","1250":"Smoking is detrimental to gingival and periodontal health. It has been reported to produce changes in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) flow, but the cumulative effects of smoking on GCF have not been studied till date. The present study was designed to discover and evaluate transitional dynamics, if any, in GCF flow just immediately before and after smoking. The study comprised age- and gender-matched 20 male subjects. Half of the study population was constituted by non-smokers who comprised the control group and the remaining half of the study population was chronic smokers constituting the test group. The GCF samples were collected using the micropipettes before smoking, immediately after, and 10 min after smoking for the test group and during similar timings for the control group. The study reveals an overall low GCF volume in smokers than in non-smokers. More interestingly, a transitional decrease immediately after smoking is followed by a marked increase in GCF volume 10 min after smoking. ","1251":"The aim of this study was to compare root surface characteristic following root planing with various hand and power driven instruments. A total of 20 single rooted teeth were used in this study, of which two specimens were used as control (no instrumentation done) and remaining 18 specimens were equally divided into three groups. Specimens from each group were then subjected to root planing by one of the following instruments: (1) a Gracey curette (2) Ultrasonic tip and (3) a Rotary bur. In each case, the time required for scaling and root planing was measured. After treatment, the specimens were observed under scanning electron microscope and surface roughness was measured by using Roughness and loss of tooth substance index (RLTSI). The mean RLTSI scores for Gracey curette, ultrasonic and rotary instrument group were 2.5, 2.0 and 0.667 respectively. The mean scores of time spent for scaling and root planing by Gracey curette, ultrasonic and rotary instrument group in seconds were 42.50, 35.83 and 54.50. All the three instruments namely Gracey curette, Ultrasonic tip and Rotary bur were effective in mechanical debridement of root surface. The results favoured the use of rotary instruments for root planing to achieve smooth clean root surface; however, the use of rotary instrument was more time consuming which might limit its use in clinical practice. ","1252":"The purpose of the present study was to clinically and radiographically assess the soft and hard tissue changes around the immediately loaded single tooth implants bioactivated with platelet-rich plasma (PRP), placed in the mandibular posterior region. A total of 11 patients having single tooth edentulous space in the mandibular posterior region were selected. An endosseous implant was placed after clinical and radiographic examination in each selected site using single stage surgical approach. The patients were followed up at 3, 6, 9, and at 12 months of post implant insertion. The patients were subjected to recording of clinical parameters like modified plaque index, modified gingival index, probing depth, and clinical implant mobility scale. Radiographs made at different intervals were subjected to assessment of bone level mesial and distal to each implant using computer assisted image analysis. Scores for clinical parameters were minimal and comparable. The probing depth around the implant was measured during the follow-up period and the changes observed were statistically non-significant. None of the implants were clinically mobile during the follow-up period. Radiographically, the peri-implant bone resorption both on mesial and distal sides was within normal limit after one year of immediate loading. Finally, the overall success rate for the immediately loaded bioactivated implant placed in the mandibular posterior region was recorded as 100%. The use of platelet-rich plasma may lead to improved early bone apposition around the implant; and thus, results in increased rate of osseointegration. Single stage implant procedure with the adjunctive use of PRP enhances the ability of peri-implant healing tissue to create favorable soft and hard tissue relationships. It also gives the added advantage of psychological boost for the patient by getting fixed replacement of tooth within a short time period. ","1253":"The aim of the study was to clinically evaluate the effect of miswak as an adjunct to tooth brushing on plaque levels and gingival health in subjects diagnosed with mild to moderate chronic generalized marginal gingivitis in comparison with those of toothbrush users. The study comprised of 30 systemically healthy subjects, aged 18-35 years diagnosed with mild to moderate gingivitis. The study was designed as a randomized, single-blind, parallel-armed study. Subjects were randomly divided into three groups. Group A (toothbrush users), group B (toothbrush and miswak users), and group C (miswak users). Subjects were advised to use toothbrush, miswak, or both, three times daily depending on their respective allocations. Gingival index according to Loe and Silness, Plaque index, according to Turesky modified Quigley-Hein plaque index, and the digital photographs of the total labial surfaces of the teeth were taken for image analysis. Recording of data were done at baseline, 2(nd), 4(th), 6(th), and 8(th) week time intervals. Obtained data were analyzed using repeated measure ANOVA and student t test (independent samples). Group B showed statistically significant (P&lt;0.0001) decrease in plaque score and gingival score compared to group A and group C, respectively, from 2(nd) to 8(th) week, whereas no statistical significant difference was found in plaque score, when group A was compared with group C (P&gt;0.05) from 2(nd) to 4(th) week. Further at the 6(th) and 8(th) week, there was significant difference (P&lt;0.05) in plaque score between group A and group C. The difference in gingival score was not significant (P&lt;0.05), when group A was compared with group C on all the indicated time intervals. Results showed significant improvement in plaque score and gingival health when miswak was used as an adjunct to tooth brushing. ","1254":"The palatal masticatory mucosa is widely used as a donor material in periodontal plastic surgery. The thickness of graft tissue is an important factor for the graft survival. The purpose of this study was to determine the thickness of palatal mucosa by a bone sounding technique. The association of age and gender with the thickness of palatal mucosa was also examined. Twenty four healthy subjects had participated in the study. The younger age group of 16-30 years consisted of 12 subjects of 7 females and 5 males, and the older age group of 31-54 years consisted of 12 subjects, of 5 females and 7 males. A bone sounding method using a periodontal probe was done to assess the thickness of palatal mucosa at 15 measurement sites defined according to the gingival margin and palatal line. Mann-Whitney test was used to determine the difference in mucosal thickness between both the groups. The younger age group had thinner mucosa ranged from 2 to 3.1 mm in thickness than the older age group which ranged from 3.2 to 3.7 mm. In the same age group, females had thinner mucosa than males in the same age group. The mean thickness of palatal masticatory mucosa ranged from 2.5 to 3.7 mm. The younger subjects had thinner mucosa than older subjects. The canine and premolar areas appeared to be the most appropriate donor site for grafting procedures. ","1255":"To evaluate the efficacy of 15% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-S (EDTA with soft soap) preparation for the removal of smear layer at human root surfaces. Twenty teeth indicated for extraction due to periodontal disease were sectioned using high speed cylindrical bur under copious irrigation. The root surfaces were instrumented with Gracey 7-8 curette (Hu-Friedy), 12 times to induce an \"experimental smear layer\". Following root planning, the root surface was cut using diamond disc and separated from the crown. Samples were randomly distributed into five groups. One group was control, saline and test groups were EDTA 15% alone, by active and passive applications (groups 2 and 3), and EDTA 15%+soft soap, by active and passive applications (groups 4 and 5). Specimens were then subjected to scanning electron microscope study. Smear layer removal was evaluated according to Sampaio et al., index. EDTA-S removed the smear layer better than plain EDTA and the control group, while active application of the root conditioning agent had significant difference than the passive application of the agent. EDTA-S has favorable benefits over EDTA alone, and active application is better in comparison with passive application of root conditioning agent. Removal of smear layer has been considered as an important step in periodontal regenerative therapy. Scaling and root planning alone with saline irrigation does not remove the smear layer. EDTA is a commonly used root conditioning agent in periodontal therapy. The addition of a detergent to EDTA proved to remove smear layer more efficiently than EDTA alone. ","1256":"The association between Gram negative enteric rods and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in periodontal diseases has received little attention in the literature. The objective of this study was to explore the relationship between these organisms and clinical parameters of periodontal disease. Clinical parameters and occurrence of Gram-negative enteric rods and A. actinomycetemcomitans were examined in 76 patients with chronic periodontitis. Chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests were used to determine differences in clinical variables versus the presence or absence of both microorganisms. Correlation among both organisms and clinical data were determined using Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Gram-negative enteric rods and A. actinomycetemcomitans were detected in 20 (26.3%) and 18 (23.7%) individuals, respectively. A total of 14 (18.4%) patients harbored both microorganisms studied. There were significantly positive correlations between enteric rods and presence of A. actinomycetemcomitans (r=0.652, P&lt;0.0001). Both microorganisms were significant and positively correlated with probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level, and bleeding on probing (P&lt;0.0001). The mean PD (mm) of the sampled sites was significantly deeper in patients with presence of A. actinomycetemcomitans and Gram-negative enteric rods. The results of the present study suggest a strong positive correlation between Gram-negative enteric rods and A. actinomycetemcomitans in the population studied. This finding must be taken into account when considering the best therapeutic approach, including the utilization of antimicrobials. The adverse clinical outcomes observed in presence of these microorganisms could have implications in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease and a possible impact on outcomes after treatment. ","1257":null,"1258":"Chronic periodontitis is the inflammation within the supporting tissues of the teeth resulting in attachment loss and bone loss. There are certain environmental factors such as smoking that can modify the host response to plaque organisms; hence can account for the aggressive progression of the disease. Smokers show a decreased expression of clinical inflammation even in the presence of abundant plaque accumulation. Neutrophils are the predominant host defense cells which protect the periodontal tissues from plaque organisms, deficiencies of neutrophil function, such as chemotaxis and phagocytosis, often result in increased susceptibility to periodontitis. Smoking can induce alteration in the neutrophil function; therefore, it is of importance to know the changes caused by smoking on neutrophil chemotaxis. This study will provide an essential basis for evaluating the role of nicotine in pathogenesis of periodontal disease by assessing the neutrophil activity. A total of 60 smokers and 60 non smokers were examined for this study. Both the groups included 20 subjects with gingivitis, periodontitis, and healthy periodontium. The periodontal status of the study subjects were assessed by gingival index, Russels periodontal index, sulcus bleeding index, and clinical attachment level. The blood sample was taken from each individual for the chemotactic analysis using agarose method. In this study, there was a significant decrease in the neutrophil chemotaxis in smokers with gingivitis, periodontitis, and healthy periodontium, compared to non smokers with similar findings. Delayed neutrophil chemotaxis was found in smokers compared to non smokers with same periodontal status. ","1259":"Traditional methods of periodontal therapy produce results in healing of tissues by repair; however, what we require is regeneration of the lost tissues. The periodontal ligament (PDL) cells appear to be important in periodontal wound healing. Platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), a potent mitogen and useful mediator for wound healing, has been extensively studied in periodontal regeneration. This in vitro study was designed to evaluate the effect of PDGF-AB on human PDL fibroblasts (hPDLF) at 50, 100 and 150 ng\/ml dosages at 24, 48 and 72 hours time duration. Tissue explants from three different patients were harvested from the roots of freshly extracted, uninfected and impacted third molars. The cells cultured from all samples were divided into 4 groups: Group-1 was the control group, and the experimental groups were designated as Group-2, Group-3 and Group-4, to test the effect of PDGF-AB at 50, 100 and 150 ng\/ml by proliferation assay carried out at 24, 48 and 72 hours. The results revealed maximum mitogenic response of PDL cells at 100 ng\/ml and at 48 hours, suggesting that the mitogenic response of PDGF-AB is both, time and dose dependent. The results of this in vitro study suggest that PDGF has maximum mitogenic response on hPDLF at 48 hours and for 100 ng dose. However for clinical application, randomized controlled clinical trials are required to substantiate the results of this in vitro study. ","1260":"Local delivery of antimicrobial has resulted in good clinical outcome along with scaling and root planing. The present study is carried out to evaluate and compare the efficacy of local delivery of 10% doxycycline hyclate in adjunct to scaling and root planing in the treatment of periodontitis. A randomized crossover split mouth design was performed, a total number of 130 sites from 4 patients, 63 sites from patients with aggressive periodontitis and 67 sites from chronic periodontitis patients were selected and divided into scaling and root planing (SRP) group, SRP and doxycycline group and doxycycline alone group. Clinical parameters viz. plaque index, modified gingival index, bleeding index, clinical attachment level (CAL), and sub gingival temperature were evaluated on day 0, 15(th), 45(th), and 90(th) day. CAL recording was performed only on day 0 and 90(th) day. In 90 days study, all the three groups showed significant reduction in clinical parameters. But on comparison, SRP and doxycycline group showed better results than doxycycline alone group and SRP alone group. The results of this study demonstrated that doxycycline hyclate 10% gel (Atridox) is as effective as SRP in reducing the clinical signs of periodontitis. ","1261":"An inter-relationship between periodontal disease and systemic health has been suspected for centuries, but evidence to explain the connection has only been elucidated in the past few decades. Among the systemic diseases, end stage renal disease has been shown to affect not only the general health of the patient but also oral and periodontal health. This study was undertaken to gain an insight into whether duration of dialysis therapy influences the oral and periodontal health of these patients and also to see if these parameters reflect their biochemical values. The study was conducted on 75 patients undergoing dialysis and a control group of 25 subjects. The study group was divided into three subgroups depending upon the duration of dialysis. Oral hygiene and periodontal disease status were measured by Simplified Oral Hygiene Index by Greene and Vermillion and Periodontal Disease Index by Ram-fjord. Biochemical parameters measured were blood urea nitrogen and salivary urea levels. Comparison of these parameters was made between the study and control groups through analysis of variance (ANOVA) and student's t-test. Prevalence of periodontal disease was evident in the dialysis group. Oral hygiene status was poor in comparison with the control group. Clinical and biochemical parameters showed statistically significant difference between the groups rather than within the groups. Oral and periodontal health appeared to be compromised. Their deteriorating general health is anticipated to cause negligence towards oral health care. This population needs comprehensive oral and periodontal care right from the diagnosis of chronic renal failure. There exists a need for communication between nephrologists and oral health care professionals. Longitudinal studies warranted in this regard. ","1262":"There is abundant literature delving into whether periodontal infection contributes to atherosclerosis. However, whether periodontitis is a definite risk factor for atherosclerosis still remains empirical, with no systematic reviews or longitudinal studies to confirm this hypothesis. The prevalence of periodontitis and coronary artery disease also varies among racial and ethnic groups based on various factors such as diet, lifestyle, and genetic predisposition. This study was designed in a south Indian population with the aim of assessing and correlating the lipid levels (a surrogate biomarker for coronary heart disease) in patients with periodontitis and health. (1) To assess the levels of total cholesterol, low density lipoproteins (LDL), high density lipoproteins (HDL), and triglycerides in periodontal disease, and health in a south Indian population. (2) To assess associations between elevated lipid profiles and periodontal disease. This case control study included 60 individuals. Blood sampling for lipid levels and periodontal examination were performed for each study group. Appropriate statistical tools like Chi-square (P&lt;0.05) and student's \"t\" test were used. The lipid levels were separately regressed using logistic regression to determine any association with periodontitis cases. The differences between the mean lipid levels of cases and controls were not statistically significant (P&gt;0.05) after eliminating confounding factors. Odds Ratio=(Total cholesterol (1.005), HDL (0.971), LDL (1.006), VLDL (0.997), CHO-HDL (1.358), TGL (1.007), LDL-HDL (1.180)). The odds ratio stated that there is no significant relation between the lipid levels and periodontal condition. The above findings confirm that there is still no concrete evidence which determines if periodontitis is an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Future periodontal interventional studies and assessment of genetic markers can ascertain the validity of this hypothesis. There is no association among periodontal disease and the levels of total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides. ","1263":null,"1264":"Growth of scientific evidence suggests an exquisite association between oral infection and systemic diseases. Though etiologies of periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are separate, their underlying pathological processes are sufficient to warrant consideration of hypothesis that individuals at risk of developing RA may also be at the risk of developing periodontitis and vice versa. To test their relationship, a study was carried out on 80 individuals. Part A: Forty subjects having rheumatoid arthritis (RA group) were compared to 40 controls without arthritis (NRA group). Their periodontal indices rheumatoid arthritis clinical laboratory parameters were also correlated with periodontitis in group. Part B: Omplete periodontal treatment was done for 10 patients of group suffering from periodontitis. All parameters of periodontal indices were measured pre-operatively and weeks after completion of periodontal treatment. (1) There was high prevalence of mild (12.5%) to moderate (75%) periodontitis in group. (2) Extent severity of periodontal disease rheumatoid arthritis were positively correlated. (3) Statistically significant differences were present in periodontal parameters of RA group compared to NRA group. (4) There was statistically, significant reduction in parameters postoperatively with concomitant decrease in periodontal parameters in RA group. Thus, an association exists between periodontal disease with an underlying dysregulation of the molecular pathways in the inflammatory response. Also, there are significant management implications in the future as new host modifying medications are developed. ","1265":"Aim of the study was to compare the response to non-surgical periodontal therapy between patients with and without type-2 diabetes from clinical and metabolic stand point. A comparative clinical study was performed between type 2 diabetics and non-diabetics with moderate generalized chronic periodontitis. The study period was six months. Conventional periodontal scaling and root planing were performed, and the response to this treatment was compared between the groups at three and six months, measuring the plaque index, bleeding index, gingival index, and probing depth. In diabetic patients, the clinical response was related to measurements of HbA1c and glucose in blood at three and six months. Multi Variant Analysis of Variance was used to compare following variables between groups and function of time. Improvement in all clinical variables was observed in both the groups. The improvement observed in blood HbA1c levels in diabetic group confirmed a positive metabolic response to non-surgical periodontal treatment. With this study, we conclude that there is a definite reduction in HbA1c level in diabetic patients after conventional non-surgical periodontal treatment. ","1266":"In this present era, when a significant number of patients seeking orthodontic treatment are adults, importance of multidisciplinary treatment approach cannot be overemphasized. Higher susceptibility of plaque accumulation in patients undergoing orthodontic treatment makes involvement of periodontist almost unavoidable. Also, orthodontic treatment frequently results in undesirable periodontal changes which require immediate attention. More recently, orthodontics has been used as an adjunct to periodontics to increase connective tissue support and alveolar bone height. The purpose of this article is to review the adverse effects of orthodontic treatment on the periodontal tissues and to discuss the mutually beneficial relationship shared between the two specialties.","1267":"Treatment of periodontal disease involves complex mechanical, surgical, and medical modalities. Some of the treatment regimens are patient centered, some involve a great amount of technical expertise and competence from a practitioner, and often involve complex procedures like use of tissue-engineered products. In spite of several advances, treatment of periodontal disease depends on scaling and root planing and various surgical procedures as the mainstay, but results of treatment are not always predictable and are often frustrating. The ultimate aim of periodontal treatment is regeneration of periodontal tissues and more particularly lost alveolar bone support. The treatment options include a myriad of approaches and scientists and researchers have tried various tools and agents to improve alveolar bone status and improve periodontal health. These approaches vary from simple monotherapy with systemic antibiotic usage to exotic and novel procedures like shock wave therapy, photodynamic therapy and application.","1268":"","1269":"","1270":"Oral malignant melanomas are extremely rare lesions and occur commonly in the maxillary gingiva more frequently on the palate with fewer incidences in the mandibular gingiva. Though these lesions are biologically aggressive, they often go unnoticed since they are clinically asymptomatic in the early stages and usually present merely as a hyperpigmented patch on the gingival surface. These lesions if diagnosed at an early in situ stage are potentially curable and definitely have a better prognosis, but unfortunately as they are clinically asymptomatic, it results in delayed diagnosis thus making the prognosis extremely poor. This paper presents the case of a patient who visited our department with the complaint of darkened patches on the gums and his concern was purely aesthetic. There were no symptoms associated with the hyperpigmented lesions and hence the patient did not approach us earlier. When the lesions grew larger and were unsightly, the patient has seeked dental advice. Histopathologic investigation confirmed the diagnosis as 'Oral Malignant Melanoma'. Though aggressive therapy was instilled immediately, unfortunately, the patient succumbed to death within a few months after diagnosis as the lesion was highly invasive. Due to the biologically aggressive but clinically silent nature of progression of the lesion, the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion and early detection and diagnosis for any pigmented gingival lesions cannot be overemphasised. Diagnosis must be based on thorough detailed history and valid histologic evidence.","1271":"Cosmetically acceptable smiles show a gingival display of up to 3 mm. Gingival display of greater than 3 mm results in a gummy smile which is often unsightly for the individual and correction is sought. There are a variety of procedures used for surgical crown lengthening. Here, we describe two such cases requiring two different approaches for surgical crown lengthening.","1272":"Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) commonly presents as non-tender, enlarged lymph nodes, accompanied by diffuse symptoms of fatigue and low-grade intermittent fever and it is derived predominantly from the cells of the B lymphocyte series. NHL cases occur extra-nodally and in 3% of these cases the initial presentation may be in the oral cavity. Though extra-nodal NHL of the oral cavity is a rare finding, patients with oral lesions of NHL commonly present at the dental clinic in the first instance. A careful clinical evaluation supported by histopathological and other laboratory investigations will help in identifying the disease at an early stage, resulting in better prognosis. Any delay in diagnosis has important implications on the morbidity and mortality of the condition. Due to the rarity of intraoral NHL, we present one such a case with a complaint of tumor-like mass on the gingiva of lower molar region. The lesion was clinically thought as pyogenic granuloma and later diagnosed as extra nodal NHL of the oral cavity.","1273":"It is an undisputed fact that sound and strong periodontal health is a must in patients seeking orthodontic treatment. Does this mean that we are going to deny orthodontic treatment for those adults whose number is rising, more often secondary to periodontal deterioration and pathological migration of teeth resulting in aesthetic and functional problems? Need of the hour is to have an integrated approach where in periodontal treatment precedes orthodontic treatment to restore periodontal health. Orthodontic treatment should be performed under strict plaque control measures to place the teeth in a structurally balanced and functionally efficient position. Aim of this article is to familiarize the practicing clinicians both in the field of orthodontics and periodontics with current thoughts and successful clinical techniques used in the field of periodontology to regenerate lost periodontal structures. Furthermore, it aims to integrate such techniques into the orthodontic treatment of patients with severe bone loss.","1274":"The use of guided tissue regeneration (GTR) has become a standard of care in Periodontology. GTR using membrane barriers and\/or bone grafting materials has also been used in periapical surgery. However, the application of the GTR principle, particularly in communicating endodontic-periodontal lesions with loss of the buccal cortical plate, is a very challenging task, with very few reported human clinical studies. An interdisciplinary approach, combining endodontic and periodontal (surgical) procedures can save a tooth in the long run that has been defined as hopeless at the preliminary stage of treatment.","1275":"Hereditary gingival fibromatosis is a rare disorder characterized by various degrees of attached gingival overgrowth. Gingival fibromatosis usually develops as an isolated disorder but can be one feature of a syndrome. A case of a 17-year-old female who presented with a generalized severe gingival overgrowth, involving the maxillary and mandibular arches and covering almost the whole dentition. Excess gingival tissue was removed by conventional gingivectomy under local anesthesia. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient's appearance improved considerably. Good esthetic result was achieved without recurrence of the gingival overgrowth. After treatment, regular recall visits are necessary in order to evaluate oral hygiene, and the stability of the periodontal treatment.","1276":"A beautiful smile definitely enhances the personality of an individual and reveals self-confidence. The harmony of the smile is determined not only by the shape, position, and color of the teeth but also by the gingival tissues. Gingival pigmentation results from melanin granules which are produced by melanoblasts. Although melanin pigmentation of the gingiva is a completely benign condition and does not pose any medical problem, complaints of \"black gums\" are common particularly in patients having a very high smile line. The different treatment modalities that have been reported for depigmentation are bur abrasion, partial thickness flap, cryotherapy, electrosurgery, and lasers. In this paper we have compared the results of electrosurgery and scalpel technique, i.e., partial thickness flap.","1277":"Azadirachta indica (neem), a Meliaceae family tree, has been used in India for several decades for the treatment of several diseases in medicine and dentistry. Neem has been considered to have antiseptic activity, but still its use for the treatment of gingivitis and periodontitis is not very clear. Hence, the purpose of the present study was to assess the efficacy of neem based mouth rinse regarding its antigingivitis effect. Forty five subjects with plaque induced gingivitis were selected for the study. They were equally divided into three groups. Group I patients were asked to rinse with 15 ml of neem mouthwash twice daily, group II with 15 ml of chlorhexidine mouthwash twice daily, and group III with 15 ml of saline twice daily. The three groups were asked to perform the routine oral hygiene procedures thought out the study period. Bleeding on probing and gingivitis were evaluated by Muhlemann and Son's Sulcus bleeding index (1971) and Loe and Sillness gingival index (1963), respectively, at base line, after every week till one month. Our result showed that an A. indica mouthrinse is equally effective in reducing periodontal indices as Chlorhexidine. The results demonstrated a significant reduction of gingival, bleeding, and plaque indices in both groups over a period of 21 days as compared to placebo. A. indica-based mouth rinse is equally efficacious with fewer side effects as compared to chlorhexidine and may be used as an adjunct therapy in treating plaque induced gingivitis. ","1278":"To evaluate the effectiveness of a resorbable, semi rigid guided tissue regeneration (GTR) membrane in the treatment of periodontal intraosseous defects. Randomized controlled clinicoradiological re-entry study. Eight patients with bilateral, identical intraosseous defects were selected. The sides for test and control group were randomly allocated to treat either with bioresorbable semi rigid membrane (test group) or open flap debridement (control group). Radiographic analysis was done by comparing intraoral peri apical radiographs taken at baseline and at six months. Extended cone paralleling device with grid was used to standardize radiographs. Auto CAD software was used for the analysis. Paired-t test. On surgical reentry at six months, the mean reduction in depth of the defect at the test site was 2.63 mm. The mean gain in Relative attachment level was 1.75 mm. The control sites showed a statistically insignificant gain. The mean percentage defect fill assessed on radiographs using auto CAD software was 15.54%. The resorbable, semi-rigid GTR membrane can be effectively used for the treatment of human one-walled angular defects. ","1279":"The relationship between diabetes mellitus and periodontal disease is not clear, even though studied intensively. From the available data, it seemed reasonable to believe that diabetics were more susceptible to periodontal disease than non.diabetics. The present study was to clinically evaluate the relationship of diabetes mellitus with periodontal disease along with various parameters. Fifteen hundred patients with diabetes mellitus were examined. A thorough oral examination was carried out and relevant history was recorded for all the patients. Results indicated that the prevalence of periodontal disease in diabetic patients was 86.8%. It can be concluded that poorer the glycemic control, and longer the duration of diabetes, the greater will be the prevalence and severity of periodontal disease. ","1280":"Survey. The objective of the study was to evaluate the periodontal health status among cigarette smokers and non cigarette smokers, and oral hygiene measures. Cross sectional study. The study included 400 male (200 cigarette smokers and 200 non smokers) aged 18-65 years. The subjects were randomly selected from the patients attending dental out-patient department of civil hospital and Himachal Dental College, Sundernagar. Community Periodontal Index (CPI) score was recorded for each patient and a questionnaire was completed by each patient. Chi square and t-test. Periodontal condition as assessed by CPI score showed that there was statistically significant difference in the findings between cigarette smokers and non-smokers. Within the limits of this study, positive association was observed between periodontal disease and cigarette smoking. It was found that cigarette smoking was associated with lesser gingival bleeding and deeper pockets as compared to non-smokers. ","1281":"The destructive action of the chronic periodontitis on the periodontal tissues has provided a continuous challenge to the dental profession to develop better methods to achieve repair of the recession regions and even regeneration of post periodontal tissues. To assess the effect of periodontal muco-periostal flap surgery with gingival fiber retention technique on minimizing the post surgical recession. The sample for the study comprised of 20 patients. The criteria for selection included patients with moderate periodontitis, with minimum recession in the anterior teeth, with adequate width of the attached gingiva, and with no traumatic occlusion. Periodontal muco-periosteal flap surgery with gingival fiber retention technique was done in the experimental site with internal bevel incision, and in control site, muco periosteal flap surgery with crevicular incision was done. Thereafter, observation period was of one week, four weeks, and eight weeks were done for both the sites. The results were subjected to statistical analysis using student's t'-test. The result of this study suggests that the periodontal flap surgery with gingival fiber retention technique has a beneficial effect on the anterior teeth, as it maintains the esthetics, recontours the gingiva with minimal recession. The area of recession was more on the control site as compared to experimental site at 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks. Gingival fiber retention technique showed less post-surgical recession and also there was fall in values of plaque index, gingival index, and periodontal index scores, throughout the study.

An association between periodontal disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been observed. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential association between periodontal health and COPD and to assess the potential health status of patients with and without COPD. In this observational study, the association between periodontal disease and COPD has been assessed. HUNDRED PATIENTS WERE CHOSEN FOR THE STUDY: group A comprising 50 COPD patients and group B consisting of 50 patients without COPD. Gingival Index (GI) and Papilla Bleeding Index (PBI) were used to assess the gingival status. Periodontal indices included Russell's Periodontal Index (PI) and Periodontal Index for Risk of Infectiousness (PIRI), which were assessed in all 100 patients. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was the statistical analysis used. After eliminating age affects using ANCOVA, the mean indices of all variables between groups were found to be highly significant (P&lt;0.001). The scores were highly significant in COPD group than in non-COPD group. The findings of the present study show that there is an association between periodontal disease and COPD. It is suggested that periodontitis is one of the risk factors for COPD. ","1285":null,"1286":"The key to good oral health is hidden in nature. Natural herbs like neem, tulsi, pudina, clove oil, ajwain, triphala and many more has been used since ages either as a whole single herb or as a combination against various oral health problems like bleeding gums, halitosis, mouth ulcers and preventing tooth decay. The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy of a commercially available herbal mouthrinse (Herboral) with that of chlorhexidine gluconate which is considered to be a gold standard as an anti-plaque agent. A randomized, two-group, parallel study as a 'de novo' plaque accumulation model was carried out on 50 subjects (23 males and 27 females). At baseline, all participants received a professional prophylaxis and were randomly assigned to the test (Herbal mouthrinse) and control (Chlorhexidine Gluconate) group. On the following three days, all subjects rinsed with 10 ml of the allocated mouthrinse twice daily for 1 min. They were asked to refrain from use of any other oral hygiene measures during the study. At the end of the experimental period, plaque was assessed and a questionnaire was filled by all subjects. Chlorhexidine (mean plaque score=1.65) inhibited plaque growth significantly more than the herbal mouthrinse (mean plaque score=1.43, P&lt;0.001). The results of the questionnaire showed that Herboral was preferred by patients for its taste, its convenience of use and taste duration (aftertaste). However, Chlorhexidine was considered to be more effective in reducing plaque as compared to Herboral. Herbal mouthrinse was found to be a potent plaque inhibitor, though less effective than Chlorhexidine Gluconate. However, it can serve as a good alternative for the patients with special needs as in case of diabetics, xerostomics, and so on. ","1287":null,"1288":"Minimally invasive dentistry is a concept that preserves dentition and supporting structures. However, minimally invasive procedures in periodontal treatment are supposed to be limited within periodontal surgery, the aim of which is to represent alternative approaches developed to allow less extensive manipulation of surrounding tissues than conventional procedures, while accomplishing the same objectives. In this review, the concept of minimally invasive periodontal surgery (MIPS) is firstly explained. An electronic search for all studies regarding efficacy and effectiveness of MIPS between 2001 and 2009 was conducted. For this purpose, suitable key words from Medical Subject Headings on PubMed were used to extract the required studies. All studies are demonstrated and important results are concluded. Preliminary data from case cohorts and from many studies reveal that the microsurgical access flap, in terms of MIPS, has a high potential to seal the healing wound from the contaminated oral environment by achieving and maintaining primary closure. Soft tissues are mostly preserved and minimal gingival recession is observed, an important feature to meet the demands of the patient and the clinician in the esthetic zone. However, although the potential efficacy of MIPS in the treatment of deep intrabony defects has been proved, larger studies are required to confirm and extend the reported positive preliminary outcomes.","1289":"Tissue engineering is a highly promising field of reconstructive biology that draws on recent advances in medicine, surgery, molecular and cellular biology, polymer chemistry, and physiology. The objective of using tissue engineering as therapeutic application has been to harness its ability to exploit selected and primed cells together with an appropriate mix of regulatory factors, to allow growth and specialization of cells and matrix. The authors reviewed controlled clinical trials which also included histological studies that evaluated the potential of tissue engineering as a clinical tool in regeneration. PubMed\/MEDLINE databases were searched for studies up to and including June 2010 to identify appropriate articles. A comprehensive search was designed, and the articles were independently screened for eligibility. Articles with authentic controls and proper randomization and pertaining specifically to their role in periodontal regeneration were included. Studies demonstrated that the periodontal regeneration with the use of combination of tissue engineered products with an osteoconductive matrix improve the beneficial effect of these materials by accelerating cellular in growth and revascularization of the wound site. Studies have suggested the use of rh Platelet-derived growth factor + beta tricalcium phosphate for regeneration of the periodontal attachment apparatus in combination with collagen membranes as an acceptable alternative to connective tissue graft for covering gingival recession defects. The studies concluded that growth factors promote true regeneration of the periodontal attachment apparatus and the use of combination protein therapeutics which is commercially available can provide more predictable, faster, less invasive, less traumatic, and efficient outcome for the patient.","1290":"Inflammatory periodontal disease caused by dental plaque is characterized by the clinical signs of inflammation and loss of periodontal tissue support. The mechanical removal of this biofilm and adjunctive use of antibacterial disinfectants and antibiotics have been the conventional methods of periodontal therapy. But the removal of plaque and the reduction in the number of infectious organisms can be impaired in sites with difficult access. The possibility of development of resistance to antibiotics by the target organism has led to the development of a new antimicrobial concept with fewer complications. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) involves the use of low power lasers with appropriate wavelength to kill micro organisms treated with a photosensitizer drug. PDT could be a useful adjunct to mechanical as well as antibiotics in eliminating periopathogenic bacteria.","1291":"The objective of this review is to bring the reader up-to-date on the current understanding of chronic and aggressive forms of periodontitis and the implications for diagnosis and treatment of these diseases. The only difference between chronic periodontitis and aggressive periodontitis with regard to tissue destruction appear to be perhaps the magnitude, sequelae, and control of the response. While there may be some differences in the cellular infiltrate between these two diseases, the molecular mediators and pathologic processes are generally the same.","1292":"Early detection of disease plays a crucial role in successful therapy. Early diagnosis and management reduces the severity and possible complications of the disease process. To overcome this challenge, medical researchers are devoted to finding molecular disease biomarkers that reveal a hidden lethal threat before the disease becomes complicated. Saliva, an important physiologic fluid, containing a highly complex mixture of substances, is rapidly gaining popularity as a diagnostic tool. Periodontal disease is a chronic disease of the oral cavity comprising a group of inflammatory conditions affecting the supporting structures of the dentition. In the field of periodontology, traditional clinical criteria are often insufficient for determining sites of active disease, for monitoring the response to therapy, or for measuring the degree of susceptibility to future disease progression. Saliva, as a mirror of oral and systemic health, is a valuable source for clinically relevant information because it contains biomarkers specific for the unique physiologic aspects of periodontal diseases. This review highlights the various potentials of saliva as a diagnostic biomarker for periodontal diseases.","1293":"Periodontal diseases are multi-factorial in etiology, and bacteria are one among these etiologic agents. Thus, an essential component of therapy is to eliminate or control these pathogens. This has been traditionally accomplished through mechanical means (scaling and root planing (SRP)), which is time-consuming, difficult, and, sometimes, ineffective. From about the past 30 years, locally delivered, anti-infective pharmacological agents, most recently employing sustained-release vehicles, have been introduced to achieve this goal. This systematic review is an effort to determine the efficacy of the currently available anti-infective agents, with and without concurrent SRP, in controlling chronic periodontitis. Four studies were included, which were all randomized controlled trials, incorporating a total patient population of 80, with 97 control sites and 111 test sites. A meta-analysis completed on these four studies including SRP and local sustained-release agents compared with SRP alone indicated significant adjunctive probing depth (PD) reduction for 10% Doxycycline hycylate (ATRIDOX), minocycline hydrochloride (ARESTIN), tetracycline hydrochloride (PERIODONTAL PLUS AB), and chlorhexidine gluconate (PERIOCHIP). Essentially, all studies reported substantial reductions in gingival inflammation, plaque scores, and bleeding indices, which were similar in both the control and the experimental groups. Use of antimicrobial sustained-release systems as an adjunct to SRP does not result in significant patient-centered adverse events. Local drug delivery combined with SRP appears to provide additional benefits in PD reduction compared with SRP alone.","1294":"","1295":"","1296":"The aim of the study was to evaluate the relationship between obesity and periodontitis. A total of 300 subjects aged 20 years and above suffering from generalized periodontitis were recruited from Department of Periodontics, Pacific Dental College and Hospital, Udaipur. Periodontal status of the subjects was recorded. Body mass index and waist circumference were used as measure to assess obesity. Other variables like age, gender, oral hygiene index were also recorded. When evaluation was done for prevalence of periodontal disease according to BMI in obese and non-obese, the prevalence of periodontal disease was significantly (P=0.03) more in obese (88%) than in non-obese (74.4%) individuals. [OR=-20.4 and 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-1.3]. The prevalence of periodontal disease is higher among obese subjects. Obesity could be a potential risk factor for periodontal disease in all age groups. ","1297":null,"1298":"Periodontal diseases result in damage and destruction of the supporting structures of the teeth, including the bone and periodontal ligament. In some cases, there is loss of gingival coverage of the teeth in esthetic regions, with gingival recession and loss of interdental papilla. The surgical treatment in such situations is costly, requires prolonged healing time, and the results are often unpredictable; this makes it an unpopular choice. The reconstruction of these areas with prosthesis like gingival veneer can be useful to correct the deformities remaining after the control of periodontal diseases, especially in the maxillary anterior region. Dental practitioners can provide comfortable and accurately fitting gingival veneers, that are very stable and esthetically restore the interdental papilla and gingival recession defects. This method is an innovative treatment option for dealing with esthetic challenges and long-term dental health.","1299":"Oral changes following radiotherapy are not uncommon. Oral mucositis, alteration in salivary gland function, radiation caries, and gingival changes have all been reported following radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The gingival changes seen after radiotherapy may be unusual and often cause diagnostic dilemma. Metastasis to the gingiva has also to be ruled out in these cases. A 30-year-old female patient presented with enlargement of the gingiva of 6 months' duration and lower lip swelling of 7 months' duration. She was a known case of carcinoma of nasopharynx and had received radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Based on the history, the clinical appearance of the gingiva, and the other oral changes we considered both post-radiotherapy gingival enlargement and secondary metastasis to gingiva as possibilities. An incisional biopsy was performed (internal bevel gingivectomy). The histopathological report did not reveal any metastatic changes. Thus, we diagnosed post-radiotherapy gingival enlargement. For the multiple carious teeth, extraction and root canal treatment was carried out as necessary. The patient was referred to the department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery for management of swelling of the lips, which was diagnosed as lymphedema of the lip. Gingival enlargement is rare post radiotherapy. Such nonplaque-associated gingival enlargement in a patient who has undergone radiotherapy should be subjected to biopsy and histopathological examination to distinguish between secondary metastasis and post-radiation changes.","1300":"Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a group of rare disorders histologically characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells. Multiple organs and systems may be involved by the disease. Typically, there is bone involvement and, less frequently, lesions may be found in the lungs, liver, lymph nodes, skin, and mucosa. Oral soft tissue lesions without bone involvement are rare. We present a case of oral lesions associated with LCH in a young woman.","1301":"Odontogenic tumors mainly occur as intraosseous growths but sometimes may present in a peripheral location on the gingiva where they are referred to as peripheral odontogenic tumors (POTs) which are a rare entity, the most common of them being the peripheral odontogenic fibroma that is an otherwise uncommon, slowly growing, benign odontogenic neoplasm of the periodontal soft tissues. In fact, peripheral odontogenic fibroma is the only POT that is more frequent than its central counterpart. Although considered to be with a potential to recur after excision, the actual recurrence rate is not known due to paucity of literature. This paper presents a case report along with review of the available literature and reinforces the importance of patient follow-up in addition to radiographic and histological examination of seemingly innocuous gingival exophytic lesions.","1302":"Ankyloglossia or tongue-tie is the result of a short, tight, lingual frenulum causing difficulty in speech articulation due to limitation in tongue movement. In this article, we have reported a 24-year-old male with tongue-tie who complained of difficulty in speech following which he underwent frenectomy procedure under local anesthesia without any complications. Finally, he was given speech therapy sessions.","1303":"An aberrant frenum is postulated to create functional and aesthetic problems. Archer's 'classical frenectomy' is an extensive procedure including the excision of fibers, interdental papilla, and exposure of alveolar bone up to the palatine papilla. The resultant delayed healing, loss of interdental papilla, and abnormal scar led towards the conservative approaches like Edward's frenectomy, frenum relocation by Z-plasty and free gingival graft; with their technical and aesthetic limitations. A better approach to make a primary closure in midline and to avoid anesthetic scar by creating a zone of attached gingiva, frenectomy is assisted with lateral pedicle graft. The interdental papilla is left surgically undisturbed and healing takes place by primary intention. Miller, in his study on 27 subjects, suggested that the newly created zone of attached gingiva might have bracing effect inhibiting reopening of diastema. A case series of this technique with its distinct advantages is presented.","1304":"The preservation or reduction of alveolar ridge resorption following tooth extraction is important in patients especially for those intended for implants at a later stage. One way to achieve this is by using membranes, graft materials, and biodegradable space fillers to prevent alveolar bone resorption and promote regeneration. A major attraction for using biodegradable and biocompatible polymers as space fillers for ridge preservation is their safety profile in comparison to xenograft materials like lyophilized bone and collagen. Biocompatible polylactide space fillers were fabricated by fusing porous polylactide particles. The sponges were loaded with drugs by placing them in the respective solutions. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from a chronic periodontitis patient and in vitro anti-microbial evaluation was done with the drug loaded sponges. Chlorhexidine loaded space filler showed significant anti microbial effect against multiple drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from a patient with chronic periodontitis. The results of this study indicate that biodegradable drug releasing polylactide space fillers has the potential to be used for ridge preservation following tooth extraction. Release of drugs in the socket may prove useful in preventing development of alveolar osteitis post extraction which can interfere with normal healing of the socket. Synthetic biodegradable polymers also exhibit a controlled degradation rate to achieve complete resorption within the intended time. ","1305":"The objective of this double-blind clinical trial was to evaluate the effects of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), ketoprofen, on patients with chronic periodontitis. Two similar local drug delivery preparations of a poloxamen gel containing 1.5% ketoprofen and a placebo were indigenously prepared for this purpose. Ten subjects aged 33-55 years with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis were recruited and were monitored for a period of 90 days. Three sites in each patient (total 30 sites) with a probing pocket depth of 5-8 mm were selected and divided randomly into three groups: 1) group A: scaling and rootplaning (SRP) + drug A; 2) group B: SRP + drug B; and 3) group C: SRP. Clinical parameters and blood smear (from intracrevicular blood) were assessed to determine the differential count and Arneth index. All parameters were assessed at baseline, 30 days and 90 days, respectively. Highly significant values were achieved for plaque index (P=0.00), and significant values were obtained for gingival index (P=0.044). Reduction in bleeding on probing was found to be highly significant. Probing depth and clinical attachment level showed no inter group variation. The results of this double-blind trial indicate that the combined effect of locally delivered ketoprofen with SRP was more effective in controlling periodontal disease than SRP alone. ","1306":"Various mouth rinses have been used in the treatment of halitosis, but most of the evidence for the efficacy of mouth rinses is anecdotal. In the present study, 0.2% chlorhexidine rinse and an essential oil mouth rinse are compared for their efficacy in reducing the breath mercaptan levels. Fifteen patients with the chief complaint of oral malodor were randomly divided into 3 groups and were provided with the respective mouth rinses. Pre rinsing measurements were performed on the Day 1 and no other periodontal treatment was instituted. Post rinsing estimation of mercaptan levels was performed after 7 days. When comparing chlorhexidine with the essential oil mouth rinse, the reduction in VSCs was highly significant in the chlorhexidine group (P&lt;0.01). However, the reduction in the organoleptic scores was not significant among the two groups. Organoleptic scores showed very highly significant correlations with the VSC concentrations measured by the spectrophotometric method. The spectrophotometric technique employed in this study appears to be a promising new method for evaluation of oral malodor. Chlorhexidine still appears to be the agent of choice as a short term regimen in cases of oral malodor. ","1307":"The present study was designed to evaluate clinical and antimicrobial effects of a single episode of subgingival tetracycline or chlorhexidine (CHX) irrigation in the absence of scaling and root planing. Thirty patients diagnosed with chronic periodontitis were recruited for this study, each providing four non-adjacent untreated periodontal pockets with a probing depth equal to or exceeding 6 mm. The four deep periodontal pockets in each patient were assigned to be irrigated with 150 ml each of CHX digluconate 0.2% (group A), tetracycline HCl at concentrations of 10 and 50 mg\/ml (groups B and C, respectively), or sterile saline (group D) in a single episode. Recordings of plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), probing pocket depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and subgingival bacterial counts from paper point samples were made pre-irrigation (day 0), and at days 7, 28, 56, and 84, post-irrigation. The mean PI and GI scores for all the four groups were reduced post-irrigation, the reduction being significantly higher in group C compared to the other groups. The reduction in the PD and CAL was more significant in group C from day 0 to day 7, whereas the other groups showed minimal changes during this period. The change in the bacterial count was altered towards one of the periodontal health, it being more significant and consistent in the group C. The results of this study suggest that subgingival irrigation with high concentrations of tetracycline may play a beneficial role in the management of chronic periodontitis patients. ","1308":"Conventional diagnostic indicators cannot distinguish between disease activity and inactivity but can detect the past tissue destruction. A proper and true periodontal diagnosis is essential in order to have a rational treatment and preventive strategy and to identify sites at risk. The present longitudinal study was designed with an aim to examine the relationship between gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and periodontal disease progression and to analyze the level of AST in GCF before and after the initial therapy in chronic periodontitis patients and determine the relationship between AST and conventional measures of periodontal status. A total of 20 patients with chronic periodontitis were randomly selected. Two diseased sites and one healthy site were selected in each patient. The periodontal status and GCF-AST levels were recorded at baseline and 3 months post-initial therapy and statistically analyzed. There was a statistically significant difference in AST levels between diseased periodontal sites and healthy sites (P&lt;0.05), and between baseline and post-initial therapy (P&lt;0.05). Improvements in clinical status were noted following periodontal therapy and there was a corresponding decrease in AST levels. In conclusion, it is suggested that AST levels may be a useful adjunct in the clinical assessment of periodontal disease sites since AST level decreases when periodontal status improves.

When conventional therapy is found inadequate to attain periodontal health in chronic periodontitis, local antimicrobial agents have been used as an adjunct with scaling and root planning (SRP) which has reproduced encouraging results. Hence, this study was undertaken to evaluate the new sustained released local drug Chlosite clinically and microbiologically in smokers and non-smokers. The patients were grouped into experimental group A treated with SRP plus Chlosite (SRP + CHL), experimental group B treated with Chlosite alone (CHL), and control group C treated only with SRP alone. A total number of 141 sites from six patients (67 sites from three non-smoker patients and 74 sites from three smoker patients) participated in this study. The clinical parameters, Plaque index (PI), Gingival index (GI), Bleeding index (BI), and Relative attachment level (RAL), were recorded and subgingival plaque samples were collected and subjected to microbiological analysis. On comparison of smokers and non-smokers, in SRP group, non-smokers showed a higher reduction in BI and GI and smokers showed a higher reduction in PI. There was no significant gain in RAL of both smokers and non-smokers. In SRP + CHL group, non-smokers showed a higher reduction in relation to BI and GI and smokers showed a higher reduction in relation to PI. There was no significant gain in RAL of both smokers and non-smokers. In CHL group, both smokers and non-smokers showed a nonsignificant reduction in BI, GI, and RAL, but smokers showed a significant reduction in PI as compared with non-smokers. All the groups showed reduction in the microbial count of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Tannerella forsythia which were found to be statistically not significant when it was compared between non-smokers and smokers. In this study, all treatment groups were found to be efficacious in the treatment of periodontal disease as demonstrated by improvement in PI, GI, BI, and RAL. Combination of SRP and Chlosite resulted in added benefits compared with the two treatment groups.

In the present study, hydroxyapatite and the bioactive glass-coated implants were evaluated for their behavior in osseous tissue following implantation in 14 patients. Bioactive glass and hydroxyapatite formulated and prepared for coating on Ti-6Al-4V alloy. Hydroxyapatite coating was applied on the implant surface by air plasma spray technique and bioactive glass coating was applied by vitreous enameling technique. Their outcome was assessed after 6 months in vivo study in human. Hydroxyapatite and bioactive glass coating materials were nontoxic and biocompatible. Uneventful healing was observed with both types of implants. The results showed bioactive glass is a good alternative coating material for dental implant. ","1312":"A paucity of conclusive research exists on the optimal design and mode of action of toothbrushes, leading to the introduction of new generation of toothbrushes. Sonic and ionic toothbrushes belong to this new generation of toothbrushes. The aim of the present study was to clinically assess and compare the efficacy of the sonic and ionic toothbrushes. A single blind study, using a split-mouth method, was conducted for 45 days on a total of 22 (11 males and 11 females) student volunteers, with age of 17 to 21 years. Plaque, gingival, and bleeding indices were recorded after every 15 days. Both the toothbrushes showed significant reduction in all three parameters. However, the sonic toothbrush proved to be more effective than the ionic toothbrush on the percentage basis, the difference in parameters was statistically nonsignificant. It may be concluded from the present study that though the sonic toothbrush was insignificantly superior to the ionic toothbrush, both the toothbrushes are clinically effective in removing plaque and improving the gingival conditions. ","1313":"Recent interest and advances in the field of alternative medicine has promoted the use of various herbal and natural products for multiple uses in the field of medicine. Aloe vera is one such product exhibiting multiple benefits and has gained considerable importance in clinical research. This clinical study focuses on Aloe vera and highlights its property when used as a medicament in the periodontal pocket. A total number of 15 subjects were evaluated for clinical parameters like plaque index, gingival index, probing pocket depth at baseline, followed by scaling and root planing (SRP). Test site comprised of SRP followed by intra-pocket placement of Aloe vera gel, which was compared with the control site in which only SRP was done, and clinical parameters were compared between the two sites at one month and three months from baseline. Results exhibited encouraging findings in clinical parameters of the role of Aloe vera gel as a drug for local delivery.

The regulatory mechanisms governing the osteoclast and osteoblast are critical for understanding the health and disease of the skeletal system. These interactions are either by cell to cell contact or by the secretion of immune regulatory mediators like cytokines and chemokines by immune cells that are governed by the RANKL (TRANCE)-RANK- OPG axis. TRANCE-RANK signaling has served as a cornerstone of osteoimmunology research. There is increased recognition of the importance of the inflammatory and immune responses in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. Thus, this field has provided a framework for studying the mechanisms underlying periodontal destruction.

Although clinical melanin pigmentation does neither present itself as a medical problem nor a disease entity, it is a major esthetic concern for many people, especially Asians. Esthetic gingival depigmentation procedures can be performed in such patients with excellent results. This case series presents a split mouth de-epithelization procedure using popular surgical techniques such as scalpel, bur abrasion or electrosurgery. These techniques were successfully used to treat gingival hyperpigmentation. Although we found that electrosurgery increased the efficacy of our work, giving a cleaner and neater work field, it required a lot of precision.

The study was carried out as randomized controlled two-group parallel clinical trial. Forty patients in the age group of 30-65 years suffering from mild to moderate chronic periodontitis, having pocket depth ranging between 5 and 8 mm, were selected for the study. At the screening visit, complete history taking, periodontal examination and full-mouth supragingival scaling was carried out for each patient. At the baseline visit (on the 7(th) day), all clinical parameters and radiographic parameters were recorded at selected sites and patients were randomly assigned to either the control group (group A) or the treatment group (group B). All patients in both the groups received complete subgingival scaling and root planing. Then, in group B, chlorhexidine chip (Periocol CG) was inserted at the selected site. Patients were recalled at 1 month, 2 months and 3 months from the baseline for recording clinical observations, and radiographic parameters were recorded at the end of the study. Mean, standard deviation, Chi-square test, \"t\" test for equality of means and paired samples correlations were used. There was a statistically significant clinical attachment gain, reduction in bleeding index scores, probing pocket depth reduction and bone gain in both the groups, but group B showed better results than group A, and these differences were statistically significant.

A sample of 22,452 individuals aged 15 years and above was selected using a random cluster sampling from the population. All the subjects sampled were weighed by age, sex, community, income group, educational level, diet pattern, and habitation. The WHO CPITN was used to assess the levels of periodontal condition and treatment needs. Score 2 was most prevalent in all the groups. Periodontal disease is widespread in West Bengal and a positive relation appears to exist between age, sex, socio-economic status, education level, and dietary habits with periodontal status.

Thirty subjects were selected and randomly assigned into three groups of ten subjects each, which received a propolis-containing mouthrinse, or a negative control (Saline) or a positive control (Chlorhexidine 0.2%). Plaque index and gingival index were assessed at baseline and at a five-day interval. Chlorhexidine mouthwash was found to be better than propolis and saline in inhibiting plaque formation. Propolis was found to be only marginally better than chlorhexidine in improving gingival scores. The present study suggests that propolis might be used as a natural mouthwash, an alternative to chemical mouthwashes, e.g., chlorhexidine.

Because of the increasing prevalence and associated comorbidities, there is a need for the development of new diagnostic tests that can detect the presence of active disease, predict future disease progression, and evaluate the response to periodontal therapy, thereby improving the clinical management of periodontal patients. The diagnosis of active phases of periodontal disease and the identification of patients at risk for active disease represent challenges for clinical investigators and practitioners. Advances in diagnostic research are moving toward methods whereby the periodontal risk can be identified and quantified by objective measures using biomarkers. Patients with periodontitis may have elevated circulating levels of specific inflammatory markers that can be correlated to the severity of the disease. Advances in the use of oral fluids as possible biological samples for objective measures of the current disease state, treatment monitoring, and prognostic indicators have boosted saliva- and other oral-based fluids to the forefront of technology. Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) is an inflammatory exudate that can be collected at the gingival margin or within the gingival crevice.

Often, in these patients, soft and hard tissue defects result from a variety of causes, such as, periodontal infection, trauma, and tooth loss. These create an anatomically less favourable foundation for ideal implant placement. For prosthetic-driven dental implant therapy, reconstruction of the alveolar bone, through a variety of regenerative surgical procedures has become predictable. This article documents the soft and hard tissue treatment management of a patient with Generalized Chronic Periodontitis, who required hard and soft tissue augmentation of the ridge, prior to implant placement. We augmented the height and width of the ridge (Seibert's Class III ridge deficiency) using an Autogenous J-shaped graft involving the chin and lower border of the mandible, followed by soft tissue augmentation of the ridge with a subepithelial connective tissue graft. A significant increase in the ridge dimensions was achieved.","1342":"The efficacy of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent, ketorolac tromethamine, was evaluated in pain control after periodontal surgery. This type of agent acts peripherally by inhibiting the release of prostaglandins and minimizing the local inflammatory response. Thus, there may be an advantage in pretreatment administration of ketorolac tromethamine, 10 mg, compared with placebo on operative pain during periodontal surgery. Two groups of 40 outpatients from the Department of Periodontology, Darshan Dental College and Hospital, Udaipur, were selected for this study. Patients who were to undergo periodontal surgery were randomly given either one group 10 mg ketorolac immediately before surgery or the other group placebo tablets at least 30 minutes before administration of local anesthesia (LA). All procedures were performed under LA, and the total volume of anesthetic used was recorded. The duration of surgery from the time of incision to the placement of the last suture was recorded. At the completion of the surgery, patients were supplied with printed record forms and were asked to rate their subjective operative pain intensity using a visual analog scale. The data were analyzed using the student t test. Results indicated that preoperative treatment with ketorolac significantly reduced initial pain intensity of operative pain as compared with placebo.

The existence of micro organisms as polyspecies in an oral biofilm and dental plaque has profound implications for the etiology of periodontal disease. The adhesion of streptococci to the tooth surface is the first step in the formation of dental plaque. Antiadhesive agents which can disrupt the biofilm formation can be an effective alternative to antibacterial therapy. A total of 10 patients both male and female between the age group of 20-40 years were included in the study. Plaque samples were taken and subjected to culturing on rabbit's blood agar plate for the growth of streptococci colonies for 24-48 h. The streptococci colonies were identified and was further subjected to subculturing for 24-48 h with disc containing ethyl alcohol+cranberry extract (Group A) and water+cranberry extract (Group B). Both these groups A and B were further divided into subgroups I, II, III, IV, and V according to concentration 1:2, 1:4, 1:40, 1:100 and 1:600 respectively. Zone of inhibition of Group A with subgroup I disc was 2 mm. while with subgroups II, III, IV, V disc was 4mm. Whereas the zone of inhibition seen of Group B was same (2mm) in subgroups I, II, III, IV discs however a significant zone of inhibition (10mm) was observed in subgroup V disc. CRANBERRY JUICE (ACTIVE INGREDIENT: Non dialyzable material) inhibits the adhesion and reverses the coaggregation of various oral micro organisms.

Genetic studies have shown that mutations in the major gene locus of chromosome 11q14 with loss of function of cathepsin C gene are responsible for Papillon-Lefevre syndrome. This report presents two siblings with classic signs and symptoms of Papillon-Lefevre syndrome. The exact cause for periodontal destruction in patients with Papillon-Lefevre syndrome is not known but it is thought to be due to defect in neutrophil function, immune suppression and mutations in cathepsin C gene.","1371":"Placement of endosseous implants into infected bone is often deferred or avoided due to fear of failure. However, with the development of guided bone regeneration [GBR], some implantologists have reported successful implant placement in infected sockets, even those with fenestration defects. We had the opportunity to compare the osseointegration of an immediate implant placed in an infected site associated with a large buccal fenestration created by the removal of a root stump with that of a delayed implant placed 5 years after extraction. Both implants were placed in the same patient, in the same dental quadrant by the same implantologist. GBR was used with the fenestration defect being filled with demineralized bone graft* and covered with collagen membrane**. Both implants were osseointegrated and functional when followed up after 12 months.","1372":"A clinical report describing the successful use of the lip repositioning technique for the reduction of excessive gingival display. A female patient aged 34 years reported with a chief complaint of gummy smile and was treated with this technique performed under local anesthesia with the main objective to reduce gummy smile by limiting the retraction of elevator muscles (e.g., zygomaticus minor, levator anguli, orbicularis oris, and levator labii superioris). The technique is fulfilled by removing a strip of mucosa from maxillary buccal vestibule and creating a partial thickness flap between mucogingival junction and upperlip musculature, and suturing the lip mucosa with mucogingival junction, resulting in a narrow vestibule and restricted muscle pull, thereby reducing gingival display.","1373":"Idiopathic gingival enlargement is a proliferative fibrous lesion of the gingival tissue that causes esthetic and functional problems. Both genetically and pharmacologically induced forms of gingival enlargement exist. This case report addresses the diagnosis and treatment of a case of idiopathic gingival enlargement in a 13-year-old female. The patient presented with generalized diffuse gingival enlargement involving the maxillary and mandibular arches extending on buccal and lingual\/palatal surfaces and covering incisal \/ occlusal third of the tooth resulting in difficulty in speech and mastication since last three years. Patient also gave a history of surgical treatment being carried out four years back in upper anterior region suggesting of recurrence. Biopsy report confirmed the diagnosis of gingival hyperplasia.

Fifteen nondiabetics and fifteen type-2 diabetics with moderate to severe periodontitis were selected after meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria. Periodontal pocket probing was performed using a Williams graduated periodontal probe and comparisons of the clinical and biochemical parameters like plaque index, gingival index, probing depth, glycated hemoglobin, and lipid profile (total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein, triglycerides and very low density lipoprotein) were done between and within two groups at baseline and 3 month. A correlation was observed between clinical and biochemical parameters between and within two groups at baseline and 3 month. The P value of diabetic group was&lt;0.001 in all clinical parameters (plaque index PI, Gingival index GI, and Probing Pocket Depth PPD) in diabetic and nondiabetic group, showed statistically highly significant difference in GI, PI, PPD, &lt;.01 in Glycated Hemoglobulin (HbAlc1) in test group and&lt;0.05 in control group showed statistically significant difference.

The P value &gt;0.05 showed no statistical significance of correlation between the test and control groups. Both groups of patients showed an improvement in clinical and metabolic parameters assessed at 3 months after nonsurgical periodontal therapy. ","1375":"It is a well established fact that periodontitis is caused by a group of highly specific microorganisms, organized as a bio-film on the tooth surface. Hence, therapeutic modalities are directed against elimination or adequate suppression of these organisms. Thorough debridement of these sites is possible mainly by scaling and root planing (SRP) and open- flap debridement in deeper sites. Open- flap debridement includes conventional surgical procedures such as the modified Widman flap procedure. Surgical procedures, however, have a number of disadvantages and hence efforts have been on at improving various non-surgical approaches, which are directed more specifically at the microbial nature of periodontal disease. Use of local drug-delivery devices is one such approach. The combined therapy of SRP and local drug delivery has been showing promising results in improving all the parameters in periodontal disease. This study compares the clinical, as well as, microbiological results of a split-mouth trial using modified Widman flap and non-surgical therapy of SRP and the use of a controlled release drug-delivery device (Chlorhexidine chip), in the management of moderate to deep pockets. The results showed that the non-surgical most sites subjected to the non-surgical treatment were found to be maintainable without further deterioration, during the study period.

The study sample consisted of 20 patients who were partially edentulous in the anterior maxillary region. They were divided into two groups. In group I (IL) 10 implants were placed and immediately provisionalized and restored with a metal ceramic crown on the 14th day. In group II (DL) 10 implants were placed and loaded after 4 months. Single-piece implants were used for the IL group and two-piece implants were used for the DL group. All soft tissue parameters i.e., modified plaque index (mPI), modified bleeding index (mBI), papillary index (PPI), marginal level of soft tissue (ML) and width of keratinized mucosa (WKM) were recorded at baseline, Day 60, Day 120 and Day 180. The success rate in group I was found to be 80%, which was lower than the success rate in group II which was found to be 90%. On comparison, there is no statistically significant difference in success rate between the two study groups. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups over time in parameters like mPI, mBI, ML and WKM. The mean PPI score in group II showed a significant increase from when compared to group I.

The study group consisted of 120 cleft patients. Subjects were divided into two groups of 60 each. Group I - patients with UCLPA and Group II - patients with CP. For comparison, all the four quadrants were defined, Q1-right upper quadrant, Q2-left upper quadrant, Q3-left lower quadrant and Q4-right lower quadrant, in both groups and the following parameters were recorded: Plaque Index (PI, Silness and Loe), Sulcus Bleeding Index (SBI, Muhlemann and Son), Probing Pocket Depth (PPD), Clinical Attachment Level (CAL), Mobility Index (Miller) and Radiographic Amount of Bone Loss. The periodontal destruction was seen to be higher in UCLPA patients compared with CP patients. The poor oral hygiene status, as indicated by higher values of PI, and the periodontal status, evaluated by SBI, PPD, CAL, mobility and Radiographic Amount of Bone Loss, were higher in patients with UCLPA than in patients with CP.

Samples from both groups were immediately transported to the Department of Microbiology for gram staining, acridine orange staining, bacterial culture and to the Department of Oral Pathology for dark field microscopy. Gram staining revealed presence of bacteria within the samples.Dark field microscopic examination revealed presence of filamentous organisms, spirochetes, and motile short bacilli.

However, in all the previous studies, CRP levels were measured by using high-sensitivity CRP assay kits with minimal detection limits of 0.1 to 3 mg\/L, which was much below the normal value of 10 mg\/L. These high-sensitivity CRP assays need a proper laboratory setup, and these methods cannot be used as a routine chair-side test in the dental office. The purpose of this study was to investigate the serum CRP levels in subjects with periodontal disease by using a rapid chair-side diagnostic test kit with a lower detection limit of 6 mg\/L and to compare the CRP levels before and after periodontal therapy. A total of 45 systemically healthy subjects were selected for the study. Subjects were divided into three groups: group A: healthy controls, group B: gingivitis, group C: periodontitis. Serum levels of CRP were determined by using a latex slide agglutination method with commercially available kit with lower detection limit of 6 mg\/L. CRP was negative in all the 15 subjects in groups A and B at baseline, 7th and 30th day. CRP was positive only in 2 subjects in Group C at baseline and 7th day. Estimation of serum CRP by using a rapid chair-side diagnostic test kit is not of any significance in subjects with periodontitis.

Exclusive data is available on the association between these two chronic diseases till date. Articles published on this relationship often provide the knowledge of definitions of diabetes mellitus and periodontal diseases, prevalence, extent, severity of periodontal disease, complications of diabetes along with the possible underlying mechanisms. The authors reviewed human epidemiological studies, cross-sectional observations and longitudinal cohort, case control that evaluated variables exclusively over the past 30 years and the predominant findings from the \"certain\" articles are summarized in this review. This review clarifies certain queries such as 1) Do periodontal diseases have an effect on the metabolic control of diabetes? 2) Does diabetes act as a risk factor of periodontitis? 3) What are the possible underlying mechanisms relating the connection between these two chronic diseases? 4) What is the effect of periodontal intervention on metabolic control of diabetes? After a thorough survey of literature, it was observed that diabetes acts as a risk factor in development of periodontitis as periodontitis is significantly aggravated in patients suffering from diabetes having long term hyperglycemia. Different mechanisms underlying the association between the accelerated periodontal disease and diabetes are emerging but still more work is required. Major efforts are required to elucidate the impact of periodontal diseases on diabetes. At the same time, patients are needed to be made aware of regular periodontal maintenance schedule and oral hygiene.","1385":"","1386":"","1387":"Tobacco use has been recognized to be a significant risk factor for the development and progression of periodontal disease. Its use is associated with increased pocket depths, loss of periodontal attachment, alveolar bone and a higher rate of tooth loss. Nicotine, a major component and most pharmacologically active agent in tobacco is likely to be a significant contributing factor for the exacerbation of periodontal diseases. Available literature suggests that nicotine affects gingival blood flow, cytokine production, neutrophil and other immune cell function; connective tissue turnover, which can be the possible mechanisms responsible for overall effects of tobacco on periodontal tissues. Inclusion of tobacco cessation as a part of periodontal therapy encourages dental professionals to become more active in tobacco cessation counseling. This will have far reaching positive effects on our patients' oral and general health.","1388":"Talking about periodontic-orthodontic interrelationships is related primarily to the 1960s, where a generalized increase in salivary bacterial counts, especially Lactobacillus, had been shown after orthodontic band placement. The purpose of this article is to provide the dental practitioner with basic understanding of the interrelationship between periodontics and orthodontics by means of representing classical studies, and, to give an update on this topic by demonstrating the most recent opinions concerning periodontic-orthodontic interrelationships. Specific areas reviewed are the ability of orthodontic treatment to afford some degree of protection against periodontal breakdown, short-term and long-term effects of orthodontic treatment on the periodontium, and some mucogingival considerations. Topics considering orthodontic treatment in periodontally compromised patients were not included in this review. While past studies have shown that orthodontic treatment can positively affect the periodontal health, recent reviews indicate an absence of reliable evidence for the positive effects of orthodontic therapy on patients' periodontal status. Periodontic-orthodontic interrelationships are still controversial issues. However, a standard language between the periodontist and the orthodontist must always be established to eliminate the existing communications barrier, and to improve the outcomes of the whole treatment.","1389":"Retrograde peri-implantitis constitutes an important cause for implant failure. Retrograde peri-implantitis may sometimes prove difficult to identify and hence institution of early treatment may not be possible. This paper presents a report of four cases of (the implant placed developing to) retrograde peri-implantitis. Three of these implants were successfully restored to their fully functional state while one was lost due to extensive damage. The paper highlights the importance of recognizing the etiopathogenic mechanisms, preoperative assessment, and a strong postoperative maintenance protocol to avoid retrograde peri-implant inflammation.","1390":"This clinical case report presents a technique utilizing autogenous cancellous bone from maxillary tuberosity to fill two infrabony defects distal to mandibular molars in a patient diagnosed with aggressive periodontitis. After debridement a 6 mm defect was present distal to mandibular right first molar and 6.5 mm defect was present distal to mandibular second molar of same side. Autogenous bone graft from maxillary tuberosity was placed in both the defects. There was a significant bony fill present six months post surgery and probing depth reduced by 7mm on both the sites.","1391":"Titanium dental implants have been used in the treatment of partial or complete edentulism. The height and width of the residual alveolus and surrounding anatomical structures can determine the proper position and path of insertion of dental implants. The following case report describes the treatment of a malpositioned osseo integrated dental implant with an apex perforating the buccal cortex of alveolar bone. A 61-year-old male was referred by his local dentist for the chief complaint of a swelling at site of tooth 14 where an implant was present. Intraoral clinical examination revealed an implant supported porcelain fused to metal crown replacing the maxillary right first premolar. A peri-apical radiograph of the implant revealed no signs of peri-implant bone loss or radiolucency. Surgical exploration and modification of the protruding implant. The area healed uneventfully without the need of explantation of the implant in site of tooth 14. We felt that the conservative treatment provided was prudent and treatment of choice and anticipate that the implant will most likely continue to function for a lifetime.","1392":"Periodontal diseases are microbial induced chronic inflammatory conditions characterized by infiltration of leukocytes, loss of connective tissue, alveolar bone resorption, and formation of periodontal pockets. In response to periodontal pathogens, the leukocytes (PMN) elaborate destructive oxidants, proteinases and other factors. The balance between these factors, the antioxidants and endogenously synthesized antiproteinases determine the extent of periodontal damage. Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder. Most of the complications of diabetes are due to hyperglycemia. Persons with diabetes are at a greater risk for periodontal disease Malnutrition is characterized by marked tissue depletion of antioxidant nutrients and impaired acute phase protein response to infections resulting in impaired healing. Diabetes mellitus also alters the micronutrient levels. Malnutrition is characterized by marked tissue depletion of antioxidant nutrients and impaired acute phase protein response to infections resulting in impaired healing. Malnutrition, which usually involves concomitant deficiencies of several essential macro and micro nutrients, therefore, has the potential to adversely influence the prognosis of periodontal infections. This study has been conducted to evaluate and compare the serum levels of vitamin C, zinc and copper in diabetic and healthy individuals with periodontitis. In this case control study 60 subjects inclusive of both sexes were selected and divided into 3 groups of 20 each. Group 1 comprised of 20 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and periodontal disease, Group 2 comprised of 20 healthy subjects with periodontal disease. And Group 3 comprised of 20 healthy subjects without periodontal disease. Venous blood samples were collected and centrifuged at 3000rpm for 15 minutes and the superanatant serum is collected to measure the vitamin C, zinc and copper levels. The vitamin C levels of clinical samples were measured using spectrophotometric quantitation (dinitrophenyl hydrazine method) and zinc and copper levels were measured using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The results showed that the levels of vitamin C and zinc decreased and copper levels increased in diabetic patients with periodontits compared to healthy individuals with periodontitis. It may be reasonable to suggest vitamin and\/or mineral supplements for patients whose nutrition might be inadequate. Future research should focus on an evaluation of which nutrients may help to prevent the onset and progression of periodontal disease.

These methods may injure the gingival sulcular epithelium. Hence, the present study is carried out to evaluate the effect of different retraction materials, such as, Expasyl, Magic Foam Cord, and impregnated retraction cord on the gingival sulcular epithelium. This study included 30 cases of bilateral premolar extraction patients with Loe and Silness gingival index zero. Retraction materials were kept in the dry, isolated labial gingival sulcus for the required time. The retraction materials were removed by rinsing with water. Retracted gingiva of 2 - 3 mm from the gingival margin along with the tooth was extracted and the decalcified sections were microscopically studied. Data were analyzed by applying the chi-square test. This study showed better results with retraction paste as compared to the retraction cord, and there was a significant association between retraction materials and the relative degree of injury to the sulcular epithelium. There is a significant association between retraction materials and gingival sulcular epithelium. It can be stated that impregnated retraction cord, may be used commonly but it needs proper tissue manipulation and is technique sensitive. Newly advanced material in the form of retraction paste like Expasyl or Magic Foam Cord was found to be better than cord as assessed histologically, it respects periodontium.

The occurrence of postoperative bacteremia following periodontal flap surgery was studied in 30 patients. On these patients, 30 quadrant wise flap surgeries were carried out without any preoperative prophylactic antibiotics and 30 surgeries carried out after prophylactic administration of amoxycillin preoperatively. A blood sample was taken from each patient at the time of maximum surgical trauma and was cultured for micro-organisms and antibiotic sensitivity. 18 out of 60 blood samples were positive for micro-organisms. There was a significant reduction in post operative bacteremia after amoxycillin prophylaxis (x(2) - 7.96 with P&lt;0.01) as post operative bacteremia was found in 14 of the non medicated patients as compared to only 4 of the pre medicated patients. The micro-organisms encountered in the study are as follows:- 1) Staphylococcus albus coagulase negative, 2) Klebsiella, 3) Psedomonas aerugenosa, 4) Streptococcus viridans, 5) Alpha hemolytic streptococcus, 6) Neisseria catarrhalis On the basis of the study, it is concluded that the incidence of postoperative bacteremia following periodontal flap surgery is not as high as previously reported. The clinical results show that Amoxicillin is highly effective in reducing postoperative bacteremia in periodontal flap surgery and thus in preventing the possible sequelae (Infective Endocarditis and other systemic maladies) in susceptible patients.

However, how the osteoplant alters osteoblast activity to promote bone formation is poorly understood. To study how the osteoplant induces osteoblast differentiation in mesenchymal stem cells, the expression levels of bone-related genes, and mesenchymal stem cell markers are analyzed, using real time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). The osteoplant causes induction of osteoblast transcriptional factors such as osterix (RUNX2), and of bone-related genes such as osteopontin (SPP1) and osteocalcin (BGLAP). In contrast the expression of ENG (CD105) is significantly decreased in stem cells treated with osteoplant, with respect to untreated cells, indicating the differentiation effect of this biomaterial on stem cells. The obtained results can be relevant to better understand the molecular mechanism of bone regeneration and as a model for comparing other materials with similar clinical effects.

Resolution of inflammation and the return of tissues to homeostasis protect us against excessive tissue injury and promote the restoration of function and structure. Resolution of inflammation, which was considered a passive event, is actually an active process where new families of endogenous lipid mediators from omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids play an important role in removing proinflammatory mediators generated from arachidonic acid. These chemical mediator families, termed Resolvins and Protectins, are potent stereoselective agonists that control the duration and magnitude of inflammation, along with the Lipoxins as signals in resolution. This review examines the mapping of these circuits and recent advances in our understanding of the biosynthesis and actions of these novel proresolving lipid mediators. A search in the electronical databases PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was carried out. The search strategy applied was: \"Omega fatty acid\" AND \"resolution of inflammation,\" including articles from January 1,1985 to October 2009.

Comparative evaluations of GMP measurements in various periodontal therapies are scarce. Thus, the objectives of this study are to measure the alteration in the gingival margin position following various therapies, and to compare GMP alterations among different treatment modalities from the baseline to six months after therapy. The changes in GMP were studied for MB, B, DB, ML, and L sites for SRP, curettage, and flap surgery, and for MB, B, and DB sites for crown lengthening cases at the end of one, three, and six months after therapy. The results were interpreted from baseline to one, three, and six months posttreatment. The results were subjected to statistical analysis. Paired 't'-test was used for intra-group comparisons and intergroup comparisons were done by one-way ANOVA. The GMP changed from baseline in all the sites at different time periods following various therapies. The net results after six months were an apical shift of GMP in SRP, curettage, and flap surgery, and a coronal shift of GMP in crown lengthening. GMP shows various patterns of alteration after various periodontal therapies. One should wait for the GMP to become stable before attempting any restorative procedure.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of locally administered minocycline microspheres (Arestin) in the treatment of chronic periodontitis. A total of 60 sites from 15 patients in the age group of 35-50 years, who had periodontal pockets measuring 5-8 mm and had been diagnosed with chronic periodontitis, were selected for the study. The selected groups were randomly assigned to either the control group (group A) or the treatment\/test group (group B). Only scaling and root planing were done at the base line visit for the control sites followed by local application of Arestin (1 mg). Clinical parameters such as plaque index, gingival index, and gingival bleeding index were recorded at baseline, day 30, day 90, and day 180 in the selected sites of both the groups. Probing pocket depth also was recorded at baseline, day 90, and day 180 for both the groups. A statistically significant reduction was observed in both groups. Group B showed better results than Group A and these differences were statistically significant. The results of this study clearly indicate that treatment with scaling and root planing plus minocycline microspheres (Arestin) is more effective and safer than scaling and root planing alone in reducing the signs of chronic periodontitis. ","1410":"Nitric oxide (NO) is not only important in host defense and homeostasis but it is also regarded as harmful and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a wide variety of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The presence of NO in periodontal disease may reflect the participation of an additional mediator of bone resorption responsible for disease progression. The aim of this study was to assess the level of NO in serum in chronic periodontitis, and correlate these levels with the severity of periodontal disease. Sixty subjects participated in the study and were divided into two groups. NO levels were assayed by measuring the accumulation of stable oxidative metabolite, nitrite with Griess reaction. Results showed subjects with periodontitis had significantly high nitrite in serum than healthy subjects. NO production is increased in periodontal disease, this will enable us to understand its role in disease progression and selective inhibition of NO may be of therapeutic utility in limiting the progression of periodontitis.","1411":"The aim of the present study was to investigate systemic levels of inflammatory markers of cardiovascular diseases like C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 in patients with chronic periodontitis, in comparison to periodontally healthy individuals. A total of 42 individuals, both males and females above the age of 30 years, were included in the study. Healthy controls (Group I, n = 14), chronic localized periodontitis (Group II, n = 14), and chronic generalized periodontitis (Group III, n = 14), all without any medical disorder, were recruited. Peripheral blood samples were taken and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were estimated in the serum samples by using the Particle-Enhanced Turbidimetric Immunoassay (PETIA) technique. Serum samples of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) were assayed by using the Chemiluminescent Immunoassay (IMMULITE) technique. When mean CRP levels were compared between the groups, group III showed statistical significance when compared to group I (P = 0.04). Group III had a higher median IL-6 level (6.35 pg\/mL) than Group II (&lt; 5.0 pg\/mL) and group I (&lt; 5.0 pg\/mL). Differences in median values of IL-6 were not statistically significant in any group (P = 0.29). Periodontitis results in higher systemic levels of CRP and IL-6. These elevated inflammatory factors may increase inflammatory activity in atherosclerotic lesions and potentially increasing the risk for cardiovascular events. ","1412":"Periodontal destruction is initiated by bacteria that stimulate host responses leading to excess production of cytokines. Anticytokine therapy for periodontal diseases especially targets proinflammatory cytokines, that is, TNF-alpha, IL-1, and IL-6, because these are essential for the initiation of the inflammatory immune reaction and are produced for prolonged periods in periodontitis. This therapy aims to bind the cytokines with the receptors present on target cells such as the fibroblasts. The three basic treatment strategies are: (1) neutralization of cytokines, (2) blockage of cytokine receptors, and (3) activation of anti-inflammatory pathways, such as, immune-suppressive pathways.This new therapy can act as a host response modulator in the control of inflammatory diseases of gums and may provide the basis for new molecular therapeutic approaches to the treatment of periodontitis.","1413":"","1414":"It is important for a dentist to be well informed and updated on the latest research on the association of oral and systemic health. Of late, the metabolic syndrome has gained importance in dental literature, and metabolic syndrome and periodontal disease have been linked. Metabolic syndrome (MeS) is a group of three or more (up to five) interrelated metabolic abnormalities, which increases the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Also, both MeS and periodontal disease may be linked through a common pathophysiological pathway. Some studies have been conducted to show such an association and additional studies are required to establish this association. A dental surgeon can play a major role in evaluating patients with MeS and thus prevent the development of overt cardiovascular disease.","1415":"Bacterial plaque has been implicated as the primary etiological factor in the initiation and progression of periodontal disease. Anatomic factors such as cervical enamel projections, enamel pearls, and developmental grooves are often associated with advanced, localized periodontal destruction. Enamel projections and pearls are mostly associated with molars. Enamel projections in the furcation areas of molars have no true attachment and are therefore highly susceptible to the creation of a deep periodontal pocket. A close association has been reported in the past between enamel projection and furcation involvement. Here, we present a case report with bilateral cervical-enamel projection and its management by flap operation with odontoplasty, and regenerative procedure by placement of graft in the osseous defect. Decreased pocket depth and a gain in clinical attachment level were observed on follow-up.","1416":"An adequate amount of keratinized gingival tissue that is under proper plaque control, is a fundamental requirement for periodontal health. When the teeth erupt uneventfully in the center of the alveolar ridge, an adequate amount of keratinized tissue will surround the erupted permanent tooth. Labially or buccally erupting teeth show reduced dimensions of the gingiva as abnormal eruption of permanent teeth restricts or eliminates the keratinized tissue between the erupting cusp and the deciduous tooth. A lack of attached gingiva poses a potential risk for gingival recession in labially or buccally erupted teeth due to the possibility of accumulation of plaque and\/or traumatic tooth-brushing during subsequent orthodontic treatment. A good understanding between the orthodontist and periodontist along with proper management of periodontal tissues, can prevent these problems. Various surgical techniques can be employed to uncover impacted teeth. This paper discusses the validity of utilizing periodontal surgery to increase a band of keratinized tissue in a case of an impacted canine erupting from the alveolar mucosa.","1417":"Gingival overgrowth represents an over-exuberant response to a variety of local and systemic conditions. Certain anticonvulsants, immuno-suppressive drugs and a number of calcium channel blockers have been shown to produce similar gingival overgrowths in certain susceptible patients. Amlodipine is a comparatively new calcium channel blocker and has been used with increasing frequency in the management of hypertension and angina. Although amlodipine is considered as a safe drug, very rarely it may induce gingival overgrowth also. A rare case of amlodipine-induced gingival overgrowth has been reported herein in a 50-year-old female patient. The treatment aspect included Phase-1 therapy, substitution of the drug, the surgical excision and the maintenance and supportive therapy resulting in excellent clinical outcome.","1418":"Histoplasmosis is a systemic fungal disease that takes various clinical forms, among which oral lesions are rare. The disseminated form of the disease that usually occurs in association with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is one of the AIDS-defining diseases. Isolated oral histoplasmosis, without systemic involvement, with underlying immunosuppression due to AIDS is very rare. We report one such case of isolated oral histoplasmosis in a HIV-infected patient.","1419":"Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the tooth-supporting structures. The treatment of this condition is largely based on the removal of local factors and restoration of the bony architecture. Moreover, in the era of modern dentistry, successful implant therapy often requires sound osseous support. Traditionally, osseous surgery has been performed by either manual or motor-driven instruments. However, both these methods have their own advantages and disadvantages. Recently, a novel surgical approach using piezoelectric device has been introduced in the field of periodontology and oral implantology. This article discusses about the wide range of application of this novel technique in periodontology.","1420":"Cell interaction between dendritic cells (DC) and natural killer (NK) cells in the periodontal milieu is not yet fully known, although these cells are individually known to contribute to the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. Fifty subjects (25 males and 25 females) were included in the study. The subjects were divided into three groups: Group A comprised 16 subjects with clinically healthy gingiva; group B 17 subjects with gingivitis; and group C 17 subjects with gingivitis; and group C 17 subjects with moderate periodontitis (PPD &gt;\/= 5 mm and CAL &gt;\/= 3 mm in at least six sites). Gingival samples were collected and immunohistochemical study was done using CD57 and CD1a antibody. Statistical analysis was done using analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison for CD1a and Tukey's highly significant difference (HSD) test for CD57. The study showed an inverse relationship between the CD1a(+) (langerhans) cells and CD57(+) (natural killer) cells. There was a significant increase in CD57(+) cells and reduction in CD1a levels as periodontal disease progressed. The significant reduction in CD1a levels in periodontal disease when compared to health could possibly be a result of NK cells down regulating it. Reduction in CD1a levels may result in a low inflammatory response subsequently resulting in tissue destruction. ","1421":"Circulating C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are a marker of systemic inflammation and are associated with periodontal disease, a chronic bacterial infection associated with elevation of proinflammatory cytokines and prostaglandins. CRP has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preterm delivery, preeclampsia, and intrauterine growth restriction. Furthermore, periodontal disease has been associated with increased risk of preterm low birth weight, low birth weight, and preterm birth. The present study was conducted to assess plasma CRP levels in pregnant women with and without periodontal disease; to evaluate the effect of periodontal therapy on the incidence of preterm delivery; and to compare the incidence of preterm delivery in pregnant women with and without periodontal disease. A total of 90 pregnant women aged between 18-35 years with gestational age between 12-28 weeks were recruited and divided into three equal groups (control group, study group, treatment group) of 30 each. Blood samples were taken for estimation of C-reactive protein levels from all groups at 12-20 weeks of gestation, determined using ultrasensitive turbidimetric immunoassay (QUANTIA-CRP US). The treatment group comprised plaque control, scaling, and root planning and daily rinsing with 0.2% chlorhexidine mouth before 28 weeks of gestation. The mean value of C-reactive protein levels in subjects with periodontal disease was higher compared to control group i.e., 1.20 +\/- 0.247 mg\/dl and 1.22 +\/- 0.250 mg\/dl, respectively, compared to 0.713 +\/- 0.139 mg\/ dl (P = 0.001). The mean value of CRP levels before treatment was greater than the mean value after treatment i.e., 1.22 +\/- 0.25 compared to 0.84 +\/- 0.189 (P &lt; 0.001). The incidence of preterm delivery (&lt; 37 weeks) was 31.7% in the periodontal disease group (study group) compared to 8.3% in the control group (P = 0.001). The incidence of preterm delivery in the treatment group was 15.0% compared to 31.7% in the nontreatment group (study group). The findings from the study suggest that periodontal disease in pregnant women is associated with increased C- reactive protein levels in early pregnancy, incidence of preterm delivery is higher in pregnant women with periodontal disease compared to healthy controls, periodontal therapy during pregnancy reduces plasma CRP levels and there is decrease in incidence of preterm delivery after periodontal therapy. ","1422":"To determine the efficacy of Biograft-HT((R)) as a bone graft material in the treatment of vertical defects in generalized chronic periodontitis patients and their clinical and radiological evaluation. Twenty patients diagnosed with generalized chronic periodontitis having two or more vertical defects were selected for this study. Clinical parameters like plaque index, gingival index, probing pocket depth and clinical attachment levels were recorded at different points of time over six months. Radiographic evaluation included the depth of the bone defect and the percentage of bone defect fill and was carried out for both the groups at baseline, three months and six months. After recording clinical parameters and administering phase-1 therapy, the sites were randomly treated either with Biograft- HT((R)) or open flap debridement only. At the end of six months there was a significant reduction in the plaque and gingival scores in both test and control groups. There was 64% decrease in probing pocket depth for the test site as compared to 54.52% decrease seen for the control group. Similarly there was an 84.82% gain in clinical attachment level from the baseline to six months post operatively for the experimental group in comparison to 68.83% gain for the control group. Furthermore, 43.57% bone fill was observed for the experimental site whereas only 17.98% of bone fill was evident in the control site. Biograft -HT improves healing outcomes, leads to a reduction of probing depth, a resolution of osseous defects and a gain in clinical attachment, compared with open flap debridement by itself. ","1423":"The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the biochemical and morphologic changes in human primary gingival fibroblasts (hPGF) treated with curcumin (CUR) and insulin (I) plus curcumin (CUR) in a dose-dependent fashion. Human gingival fibroblasts were obtained from gingival biopsies. Curcumin was dissolved in ethanol, diluted with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) to obtain dilutions and bovine insulin was dissolved in 0.01 N HCl and diluted with DMEM. Cells were exposed to different concentrations of CUR and insulin (1 mug\/ml) plus CUR for next 48 hours at 37 degrees C and cellular growth profile was assessed using sulforhodamine-B (SRB), 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). The cell viability in both the treatments at lower concentrations of SRB (1 and 10 muM) and MTT (1 muM) were found to be significantly higher than that observed at higher concentrations, while apoptosis in both the treatments at lower concentrations was observed to be significantly lower than at higher concentrations. Also, the cell viability of I + CUR at lower concentrations of SRB (1, 10 and 25 muM) and MTT (1 muM) were found to be significantly higher than the respective CUR, while apoptosis at higher concentrations (50, 75 and 100 muM), especially at 75 muM was significantly low. The IC(50) of I + CUR of SRB, MTT and FACS were 1.1, 1.0 and 1.4 times higher than respective concentrations of CUR. Insulin (1 mug\/ml) exerted cytoproliferative and curcumin exerted cytocidal effects (in a dose-dependent manner) on hPGF. Insulin (1 mug\/ml) and curcumin at different concentrations when added together decreased the cytocidal effect of curcumin. ","1424":"Modern concepts of treating inflammatory periodontal disease aim at changes in the subgingival ecosystems within the periodontal pockets to alter the complex microbial community into a microbiota compatible with good periodontal health. Systemic antimicrobial therapy, although effective, involves a relatively high dose with repeated intakes over a prolonged period of time to achieve the required inhibitory concentrations in the sulcular fluid. The adjunctive use of local drug delivery may provide a beneficial response, especially in specific areas where conventional forms of therapy might fail. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of two local drug delivery systems, one containing metronidazole and the other containing tetracycline hydrochloride as adjuncts to mechanotherapy in the treatment of chronic periodontitis. There were three groups that were labeled as group A (Scaling + Tetracycline), group B (Scaling + Metronidazole), and group C (Scaling alone). A microbiological analysis was carried out to determine the efficacy of these systems in changing the pathogenic flora in deep pockets. In addition, a multiplex polymerase chain reaction was carried out to confirm the presence of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), and Tannerella forsythensis in the flora associated with chronic periodontitis. There was clinical improvement in groups A and B, which correlated with an improvement in the microbiological parameters; these results were sustained for 90 days following therapy. In Group C, the flora showed a shift towards baseline at the end of 90 days. According to this study, both the local antibiotic therapies resulted in greater improvement in microbiological parameters when used as an adjunct to mechanotherapy as compared to mechanotherapy alone. ","1425":"The use of anti-platelet therapy has reduced the mortality and morbidity of cardiovascular disease remarkably. A considerable number of patients presenting before a dentist or periodontist give a history of anti-platelet therapy. A clinical dilemma whether to discontinue the anti-platelet therapy or continue the same always confronts the practitioner. Diverse opinions exist regarding the management of such patients. While one group of researchers advise continuation of anti-platelet therapy rather than invite remote, but possible, thromboembolic events, another group encourages discontinuation for variable periods. This study aims at reviewing the current rationale of anti-platelet therapy and the various options available to a clinician, with regard to the management of a patient under anti-platelet therapy. Current recommendations and consensus favour no discontinuation of anti-platelet therapy. This recommendation, however, comes with a rider to use caution and consider other mitigating factors as well. With a large number of patients giving a history of anti-platelet therapy, the topic is of interest and helps a clinician to arrive at a decision.","1426":"","1427":"","1428":"Orthodontic therapy has a big role in the treatment and prevention of malpositions. The signs and symptoms experienced by patients with occlusal trauma are mobility of teeth, temperomandibular joint pain, pain on mastication and periodontal disease. Early diagnosis, proper treatment plan and correction of malocclusion can lead to a successful outcome. Lack of awareness of orthodontic treatment in patients with occlusal trauma can even lead to loss of tooth structure.","1429":"Orthodontic treatment in adult patients is one of the most frequently encountered components involving multidisciplinary approaches. In the present report, a 28-year-old male patient was treated for localized chronic periodontitis with pocket formation, mobility, pathologic migration and malalignment of maxillary left lateral incisor tooth #22. The periodontal therapy included motivation, education and oral-hygiene instructions (O.H.I.), scaling and root planing and periodontal flap surgery. Subsequently on resolution of periodontal inflammation, orthodontic therapy was carried out using the orthodontic aligner for a period of 6 months. Post-treatment (3 years) results showed complete resolution of infrabony pocket with significant bone fill, reduced tooth mobility and complete alignment of the affected maxillary left lateral incisor, thus restoring the esthetics and function.","1430":"According to the literature, the prevalence of supernumerary teeth is 1% to 4% of permanent dentitions; and among these, the presence of fifth mandibular incisor - a supernumerary eumorphic tooth - has rarely been described in literature, and its association with localized aggressive periodontitis is an even more rare entity. This paper reports a very rare case of unusual association of supernumerary eumorphic fifth mandibular incisor with aggressive periodontitis in a Muslim individual, so that these findings generate curiosity and inspire others to carry out further studies and investigations.","1431":"Laser has been used efficiently for treatment of oral lichen planus, leukoplakia, aphthous ulcers and oral manifestations of HIV. Two cases of recalcitrant oral pemphigus vulgaris that were successfully treated with CO(2) laser are described. The patients had been treated by a dermatologist with pulse therapy of methyl prednisolone and cyclophosphamide over a period of 6 to 8 months, but the clinical course was characterized by episodes of painful flare-ups and nonresponsiveness. The patients were extremely uncomfortable with recurrent oral lesions. CO(2) laser at low power was used to irradiate the lesions. It was shown to be effective in relieving pain and healing of lesions, with nonrecurrence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of such a treatment of oral pemphigus vulgaris. Further clinical studies are warranted to confirm efficacy and to optimize the treatment protocol.","1432":null,"1433":"The main objective of the study is to assess mandibular bone changes in pre and postmenopausal women with chronic generalized periodontitis using different radiomorphometric indices, mandibular cortical index (MCI), mental index (MI), and panoramic mandibular index (PMI) in Indian population. Panoramic radiographs of 60 patients visiting the Department of Periodontology were taken and divided in two groups - pre and post-menopausal. Detailed medical and menopausal history was recorded for each patient. All the radiographs were assessed for PMI, MI and MCI and presence of periodontitis. The destructive periodontitis was assessed as distance from the cementoenamel junction to the alveolar crest greater than 2mm. Student-t test was applied to compare mean values of MI and PMI. Intra and inter group comparison of MCI were made using chi-square test. Correlation of age and MI and PMI was found by Pearson's correlation coefficient. MCI, PMI and MI were related to the menopausal status. Patients with C3 category were seen only in post-menopausal group after 54 years of age. Higher mean values for both MI (p&lt;0.05) and PMI (p&lt;0.05) were observed in pre-menopausal group with statistically significant differences. MI showed negative correlation with age in both the groups; however PMI was positively correlated with age. Radiomorphometric indices could be used by general dentists after a little training to detect post-menopausal women at higher risk of osteoporosis. ","1434":null,"1435":"Proteases play a major role in the tissue destruction involved in periodontal disease. It is known that the balance between proteases and their inhibitors is a major determinant in maintaining tissue integrity. The association between the proteases and periodontitis is well established, but not many studies have been carried out to know the role played by a protease inhibitor like salivary leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) in periodontitis. The aim of the present study was to correlate SLPI with periodontitis. Case-control study. Seventy-five clinically confirmed cases of periodontitis and 20 controls were included in the study. A detailed case history and periodontal index (PI) were recorded. Two milliliters of unstimulated saliva samples was obtained and subjected to quantification of SLPI leaves using SLPI in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Based on the periodontal index score of the individuals, the cases and controls were divided into groups A, B and C, and the obtained SLPI levels were compared among the groups. Mann-Whitney U test and correlation coefficient test. The results showed that in the initial stages of periodontitis there is a tendency of SLPI levels to be raised. The SLPI levels were found to be reduced in the terminal stages of periodontitis. It appears that SLPI accumulates in the local environment, at least in the initial stages of the periodontal disease, probably to inhibit the action of increased elastic activity. ","1436":"Compliance to recall visit is directly related to the medium and long-term success of active periodontal therapy. To determine the percentage of patients who were compliant to recall visits by the practitioner and to find out the reasons for noncompliance by noncompliant patients. Cross-sectional study was carried out in the Department of Periodontology, Amrita School of Dentistry. The study participants were former patients of the Department of Periodontology. A total of 216 patients were selected for the study - 116 males and 100 females. They were divided according to their socioeconomic status - professionals and nonprofessionals. Nonprofessionals were divided into those who had completed high school education and those who had not. They were followed up to find out how many were compliant to recall visits and the reasons for noncompliance by noncompliant patients. The data was entered into SPSS version 11.5. Descriptive statistics were used. The frequencies of responses were calculated. Of the total study population, 48.1% was compliant, of which 58.6% and 37.6% of males and females were compliant, respectively. In terms of percentage, 60.6% of professionals, 52.4% of those who had completed high school education and 31.3% of those who had not completed high school education were compliant. Compliance to recall visits by the periodontitis patients depends largely on the practitioner. Inadequate motivation by the practitioner and inadequate education in general are responsible for noncompliance to periodontal treatment. ","1437":"In dentistry, esthetics has a special place. Although gingival melanin pigmentation does not present a medical problem, clinicians are often faced with a challenge of achieving gingival esthetics. A method of de-epithelialization of the pigmented gingiva using Kirkland's gingivectomy knife is described. Twenty patients who were conscious about their gingival melanin pigmentation were selected. The gingiva of the whole of the arch was abraded until the entire visible pigmentation was removed. Clinical observations for intensity of pigmentation were recorded at baseline and then after surgery at monthly intervals over a period of 9 months according to Dummett-Gupta Oral Pigmentation Index scoring criteria proposed by Dummett C. O. in 1964. The mean gingival melanin pigmentation score came down to 0.407 after 9 months as compared to preoperative score, which was 2.24. No repigmentation occurred in fair-complexioned persons. In persons with wheatish complexion, repigmentation was seen in 85.71% of the cases, but scores came down to 0.38 postoperatively as compared to 2.27 preoperatively. In dark-complexioned persons, repigmentation occurred in all cases, but the mean scores were 0.93 as compared to 2.40 preoperatively. The difference between preoperative and postoperative mean scores for each segment was put to statistical analysis by applying paired t test and was found to be significant. As this method has shown statistically significant results, it can be used in patients who are conscious of pigmented gingiva and want an esthetically satisfactory color. ","1438":"Obesity is characterized by the abnormal or excessive deposition of fat in the adipose tissue. Its consequences go far beyond adverse metabolic effects on health, causing an increase in oxidative stress, which leads not only to endothelial dysfunction but also to negative effects in relation to periodontitis, because of the increase in proinflammatory cytokines. Thus obesity appears to participate in the multifactorial phenomenon of causality of periodontitis through the increased production of reactive oxygen species. The possible causal relationship between obesity and periodontitis and potential underlying biological mechanisms remain to be established; however, the adipose tissue actively secretes a variety of cytokines and hormones that are involved in inflammatory processes, pointing toward similar pathways involved in the pathophysiology of obesity, periodontitis and related inflammatory diseases. So the aim of this article is to get an overview of the association between obesity and periodontitis and to review adipose-tissue - derived hormones and cytokines that are involved in inflammatory processes and their relationship to periodontitis.","1439":"","1440":"","1441":"","1442":"Time has seen the emergence of more efficient and effective devices like jet abrasives. However, the role of rubber cups with prophy angles cannot be overlooked as they are still being widely used and provide an economical alternative. Owing to several shortcomings associated with the air polishing device using sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO(3)), trends are shifting towards the usage of low abrasive powders. Recent demonstration of Glycine Powder Air Polishing (GPAP) in removing subgingival biofilm results in less gingival erosion than hand instrumentation or NaHCO(3) air-polishing. Despite the emergence of latest advances in polishing, data suggesting selective polishing of teeth is compelling.","1443":"Localized gingival enlargement is often associated with specific systemic medication, abscess formation, trauma or reactive lesions. Scant literature is available reporting enlargement of gingiva due the metastasis of adenocarcinoma from lung. The case report presents a unique case of an adenocarcinoma in the lung metastasizing to the buccal and lingual interdental papillae of teeth numbering 34 and 35. A 72-year-old female was referred to the Mayo Clinic with a recent diagnosis of metastatic stage IV adenocarcinoma of the left lung presented with an abnormal mass located on the left posterior buccal keratinized tissue adjacent to teeth numbering 34-35. Biopsy of the lesion was performed for CK7, CK20, TTF-1 and p63. The tumor cells were positive for CK7 and TTF-1, and weakly positive for p63 suggesting a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. The periodontist may be in the unique position to be the first oral health care provider to evaluate any biopsy suspicious intra-oral lesions.","1444":"Treatment of gingival recession has become an important therapeutic issue due to increasing cosmetic demand. Multiple surgical procedures have been developed to obtain predictable esthetic root coverage. More specifically, after periodontal regenerative surgery, the aim is to achieve complete wound healing and regeneration of the periodontal unit. A recent innovation in dentistry is the preparation and use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP), a concentrated suspension of the growth factors, found in platelets. These growth factors are involved in wound healing and postulated as promoters of tissue regeneration. This paper reports the use of PRF membrane for root coverage on the labial surfaces of the mandibular anterior teeth. This was accomplished using laterally displaced flap technique with platelet rich fibrin (PRF) membrane at the recipient site.","1445":"Minocycline and other tetracycline analogs are well known to cause discoloring of alveolar bone, teeth and other tissues. The present case reports palatine torus discoloring, in a 91-year-old patient, after long term minocycline therapy. The patient was presented with staining of the palatal torus resulting from prior minocycline use for three-and-a-half years. The diagnosis of minocycline staining of palatal torus was done during a routine hygiene examination. The patient was informed that the bluish appearance of the palatal torus was the result of long term minocycline use. The patient was not willing to discontinue the antibiotic and was not concerned about the appearance. The clinician should inform patients on long term minocycline therapy about the possible side effects of staining of the alveolar bone, teeth and other soft tissue.","1446":"Cosmetic treatments have become an integral part of periodontal treatment. One of the commonly used esthetic periodontal procedures is coverage of denuded root surface. While considering the elimination of these defects two criteria should be considered, the esthetic aspects and the functional aspects. This case report has describes a two stage surgical technique using double pedicle flap with connective tissue graft followed by coronally advanced flap for the treatment of a severe localized gingival recession measuring 15 mm. The recession measurement at the end of 12 months was 1 mm. It showed a predictable result at the end of one year. The advantages of this technique are excellent colour matching, dual blood supply to graft and very predictable results. The promising result suggest that this technique can be used in severe gingival recession cases with minimum amount of keratinized tissue.","1447":"Gingival enlargement is a well recognized unwanted effect associated mainly with anticonvulsant drugs, immunosuppressant drugs and calcium channel blockers. Amlodipine influenced gingival enlargement is comparatively less prevalent amongst calcium channel blockers. It causes aesthetic disfigurement, speech disturbances, abnormal tooth movement and difficulty in mastication. The management of drug influenced gingival enlargement is a challenge for the periodontist, mainly due to less understanding of its pathogenesis, difficulties in selection of proper line of management and recurrence of the enlargement. This report discusses the importance of conservative approach (scaling and root planning along with drug replacement) in the management of a case of amlodipine influenced gingival enlargement. The need for extensive surgery was decreased after this approach.","1448":"Implant related prosthesis has become an integral part of rehabilitation of edentulous areas.

The probing depth, percentage root coverage, width of the keratinized gingiva and the gain in clinical attachment, papilla width, papilla height, area of the papilla at the donor site, were recorded at baseline, 3 months and 12 months. All parameters except probing pocket depth, significantly improved from baseline to 12 months. The mean recession defect of 2.67 +\/- 0.03 mm present at baseline reduced to 0.13 +\/- 0.35 mm at the end of the 3(rd) months and stabilized at 0.27 +\/- 0.59 mm at 12 months. The mean reduction in recession depth was 2.40 +\/- 0.03 mm at the end of the study. Complete recession coverage was obtained in 13 of the 15 (87%) of the cases treated with a mean percentage recession coverage at 12 months being 86 +\/- 35.19%. The gain in the width of the keratinized gingiva was 1.33 +\/- 0.13 mm at the end of the study. There was no postoperative morbidity from where the graft was harvested at the end of the study period.

Recording of CEJ location was made using a UNC-15 (Hu-Friedy) probe, before (close CEJ) and after (Open CEJ) the reflection of the flap from the lower edge of the stent in those subjects who were indicated for flap surgery, at baseline. We used statistical analysis involving intra-group comparison done by Paired-'t' test. The close and the open CEJ measurements demonstrated a, statistically, non-significant difference. The equi-measurements of close and open CEJ numerical data were remarkably lower than the under and overestimation of measurements. Thus, despite certain disadvantages of stent, the FRP provides a simple solution for CAL measurement. The results of this study confirms the objective of the study and strongly suggests that CAL measurements done without FRP is subjected to great variation and the diagnostic and prognostic interpretation of CAL should be viewed seriously in periodontics.

It is defined as anemia occurring in chronic infections, inflammatory conditions or neoplastic disorders which are not due to marrow deficiencies or other diseases, and occurring despite the presence of adequate iron stores and vitamins. Periodontitis is one of the most prevalent chronic inflammatory diseases in humans. This study aimed at finding out if periodontitis, like other inflammatory conditions, could lead to anemia. Thirty chronic generalized periodontitis male patients with hemoglobin levels below 15 mg\/dl and serum ferritin values above 30 ng\/ml were selected. The various blood parameters recorded at baseline were hemoglobin levels(Hb), erythrocyte count (RBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), mean corpuscular volume(MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). PERIODONTAL PARAMETERS RECORDED AT BASELINE INCLUDED: plaque index, gingival index, probing pocket depth, clinical attachment level. Periodontal treatment including surgery if required was carried out in all the patients. Periodontal status of patients was monitored by repeating evaluation of periodontal indices at three months and at the end of one year. The hematological values were again measured at the end of one year. The results showed that correction of periodontal inflammation resulted in a significant increase in hemoglobin levels and erythrocyte counts. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate showed a reduction indicating resolution of periodontal inflammation. There was a significant, but much lesser, improvement in MCV, MCH and MCHC values. The results of this study showed that treatment of periodontitis leads to an improvement in hematocrit and other related blood parameters in chronic generalized periodontitis patients with anemia.

Bacteria implicated in the etiology of this disease causes destruction of connective tissue and bone. As a result of stimulation by bacterial antigen PMN produces free radicals via respiratory burst as a part of host response to infection. Patients with periodontal disease display increased PMN number and activity. This proliferation results in high degree of free radical release culminating in heightened oxidative damage to gingival tissues, periodontal ligament and alveolar bone. Damage mediated by free radicals can be mitigated by \"ANTIOXIDANT DEFENSE SYSTEM \".

H. pylorus was isolated from the dental plaque of these patients using culture method and rapid urease test (RUT). It was compared with the dental plaque from control group (25 students). The specificity and sensitivity of RUT was compared with culture method. The oral hygiene index (OHI) score and plaque index were assessed. Ten percent positivity was observed in the study group by culture. Though RUT showed 70% positive isolation it is neither a specific test nor a conclusive test as compared to culture. The result correlates with oral hygiene in study population. Further, more studies are needed to compare RUT and culture, with serology and polymerase chain reactions. The ability to detect H. pylori from dental plaque using these methods offer the potential for the noninvasive test for infection and would aid in support of oral transmission of H. pylori. ","1459":"Dentists need to make clinical decisions based on limited scientific evidence. In clinical practice, a clinician must weigh a myriad of evidences every day. The goal of evidence-based dentistry is to help practitioners provide their patients with optimal care. This is achieved by integrating sound research evidence with personal clinical expertise and patient values to determine the best course of treatment. Periodontology has a rich background of research and scholarship. Therefore, efficient use of this wealth of research data needs to be a part of periodontal practice. Evidence-based periodontology aims to facilitate such an approach and it offers a bridge from science to clinical practice. The clinician must integrate the evidence with patient preference, scientific knowledge, and personal experience. Most important, it allows us to care for our patients. Therefore, evidence-based periodontology is a tool to support decision-making and integrating the best evidence available with clinical practice.","1460":"Ultrasound offers great potential in development of a noninvasive periodontal assessment tool that would offer great yield real time information, regarding clinical features such as pocket depth, attachment level, tissue thickness, histological change, calculus, bone morphology, as well as evaluation of tooth structure for fracture cracks. In therapeutics, ultrasonic instrumentation is proven effective and efficient in treating periodontal disease. When used properly, ultrasound-based instrument is kind to the soft tissues, require less healing time, and are less tiring for the operator. Microultrasonic instruments have been developed with the aim of improving root-surface debridement. The dye\/paper method of mapping ultrasound fields demonstrated cavitational activity in an ultrasonic cleaning bath. Piezosurgery resulted in more favorable osseous repair and remodeling in comparison with carbide and diamond burs. The effect of ultrasound is not limited to fracture healing, but that bone healing after osteotomy or osteodistraction could be stimulated as well.","1461":"Esthetic concerns of the patient have become an essential part of dentistry, especially Periodontics. Periodontal plastic surgery is a rapidly emerging field, which helps us to meet this criterion. Root coverage is being achieved by a variety of techniques namely pedicle grafts and free soft tissue grafts. This article highlights on 2 case reports in which a new pedicle graft technique has been used for root coverage.","1462":"In this study, infiltrating lymphocytes subpopulation in gingival sections of healthy, inflamed, and periodontitis lesions was investigated. A set of cluster of differentiation (CD) antigen specific monoclonal\/polyclonal antibodies to detect different cell types within the tissues was used. These included anti-CD3 (pan T-cell), anti-CD45RO (memory T-cell), anti-CD20 (B-cell), and kappa light chain (plasma cells). Biopsies of gingival tissue were obtained from 17 patients who had clinically healthy gingiva, from 18 patients with gingivitis, and 17 patients with periodontitis.A significantly greater proportion of T-cells (P &lt; 0.00) was observed in healthy gingival and gingivitis tissue samples compared to periodontitis tissue samples. In addition, a greater proportion of B-cells was observed in periodontitis lesions than in the gingival lesions (P &lt; 0.00). The memory T-cells and the kappa light-chain plasma cells were present in both healthy and diseased tissues, suggestive of previous activation by periodontal pathogenic microorganisms.In conclusion, these differences in the relative proportions of B- and T-cells may reflect a difference in the immunopathology of periodontitis and gingivitis lesions.","1463":"Diabetes mellitus is a systemic condition that has long been associated with an increased risk and severity of periodontal disease. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) play a key role in the maintenance of gingival and periodontal health. Reduced PMN function has been found in patients with diabetes. The objective of this study was to evaluate PMN functions in 15 diabetic patients with chronic generalized periodontitis. Chemotaxis, superoxide production, phagocytosis and killing of Porphyromonas gingivalis by diabetic PMNs were evaluated relative to healthy and matched controls. These analyses revealed a significant (P &lt; 0.01) depression in the number of diabetic PMNs migrating along an fMLP gradient. In addition, a significant (P &lt; 0.01) enhancement of diabetic PMN superoxide production was observed. Phagocytosis (P &lt; 0.05) and killing by diabetic PMN of P. gingivalis was also impaired significantly (P &lt; 0.01). ","1464":"The human characteristics of curiosity, wonder, and ingenuity are as old as mankind. People around the world have been harnessing their curiosity into inquiry and the process of scientific methodology. Recent years have witnessed an unprecedented growth in research in the area of nanoscience. There is increasing optimism that nanotechnology applied to medicine and dentistry will bring significant advances in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. Growing interest in the future medical applications of nanotechnology is leading to the emergence of a new field called nanomedicine. Nanomedicine needs to overcome the challenges for its application, to improve the understanding of pathophysiologic basis of disease, bring more sophisticated diagnostic opportunities, and yield more effective therapies and preventive properties. When doctors gain access to medical robots, they will be able to quickly cure most known diseases that hobble and kill people today, to rapidly repair most physical injuries our bodies can suffer, and to vastly extend the human health span. Molecular technology is destined to become the core technology underlying all of 21(st) century medicine and dentistry. In this article, we have made an attempt to have an early glimpse on future impact of nanotechnology in medicine and dentistry.","1465":"Ultrasonic is a branch of acoustics concerned with sound vibrations in frequency ranges above audible level. Ultrasound uses the transmission and reflection of acoustic energy. A pulse is propagated and its reflection is received, both by the transducer. For clinical purposes ultrasound is generated by transducers, which converts electrical energy into ultrasonic waves. This is usually achieved by magnetostriction or piezoelectricity. Primary effects of ultrasound are thermal, mechanical (cavitation and microstreaming), and chemical (sonochemicals). Knowledge of the basic and other secondary effects of ultrasound is essential for the development of techniques of application.","1466":"Glanzmann's thrombasthenia (GT) was reported and described as a bleeding diathesis seen in children and characterized by diminished clot retraction. The disorder is caused by a deficiency in the platelet membrane glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex, with bleeding due to defective platelet hemostatic plug formation. The recurrent features of GT include purpura, epistaxis, gingival hemorrhage, and menorrhagia. GT being an autosomal recessive trait is reported to be especially prevalent in populations where intermarriage is common. Typically, the patients are diagnosed in infancy within the age of five. Though no differences appear to occur based on sex men more frequently present with gingival bleeding. We report the case of a female patient with GT who presented with the chief complaint of gingival bleeding. The patient was given periodontal treatment under platelet transfusion followed by proper oral hygiene instructions. The report discusses periodontal consideration for GT patients.","1467":"In the changing era of perio surgeries one innovative remedy has ended the inconvenience of suturing and has allowed the clinician to meet growing expectations and demands of today's dental patient, and the remedy is fibrin glue. When periodontal plastic surgical procedures done or implants placed in esthetic zone, fibrin sealants may be variable alternative to closing flaps with sutures and with histologic benefits and has potential uses in field of medicine. Fibrin sealant is an excellent beginner in the era of sutureless periodontal flap surgery, and this article is a humble effort to prove it.","1468":"Recent evidences prove that, release of potent lysosomal enzymes e.g. beta-Glucuronidase by degranulation of polymorponuclear leukocytes in host gingiva may contribute significantly to tissue destruction and the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. The purpose of the present study was to compare and correlate GCF beta-Glucuronidase with periodontal status among diabetic and non-diabetic patients with chronic periodontitis. A total number of 75 patients were equally divided into Group I (control group), Group II (non diabetic with chronic periodontitis) and Group III (diabetic with chronic periodontitis). Clinical parameters like Plaque index, Gingival index, Probing Pocket Depth and RBS were recorded. The beta-Glucuronidase level in GCF of all three groups was determined by spectrophotometric analysis. It was observed that the periodontitis patients irrespective of their diabetic status, showed increased periodontal destruction with elevated level of beta-Glucuronidase than the controls. Also, the diabetic patients showed increased severity of periodontal destruction and the elevated level of beta-Glucuronidase, thus indicating diabetics at a higher risk for progressive periodontal destruction.","1469":"Periodontal diseases produce physical and chemical alterations in the root cementum. Various topical applications as root conditioning agents have been recommended as an adjunct to mechanical root surface debridement to remove smear layer, endotoxins and to expose collagen fibers on dentin surface. The objectives were to compare dentin surface changes following applications of tetracyclines and citric acid to the instrumented root surface of periodontally involved human teeth under scanning electron microscope.The study group comprised of 80 dentin samples, which were prepared from periodontally-compromised teeth, planned for extraction. Diseased surfaces were root planed. The teeth were sectioned and solutions of tetracycline HCl, minocycline, doxycycline and citric acid were applied to the surfaces with cotton pellets for 5minutes.The root surface samples were then examined by scanning electron microscope.Removal of smear layer in all the four groups was near total except a few areas. All four groups showed slight difference in mean number of total dentinal tubules. Minocycline and doxycycline showed no significant difference. The proportion of patent dentinal tubules was (74%) in tetracycline HCl group compared to minocycline (48.3%), doxycycline 42%), citric acid (52%), showing the differences statistically significant. Tetracycline group showed higher number of patent tubules when compared to minocycline, doxycycline and the difference was statistically significant.Results of this study suggest that tetracycline is the best current tetracycline form for root surface conditioning as measured by its ability to affect both dentin smear layer removal and tubule exposure.","1470":"Periodontology is a fast evolving field where newer insights into existing concepts are changing the face of the traditional periodontal treatment. Constant research is taking place so as to develop a number of newer avenues in the treatment of the periodontal diseases. However, the protocol of management of periodontal diseases in the setup of general dental practice has undergone little change over the last decade. So, a survey was carried out among 100 general dental practitioners by means of a questionnaire to identify the current status of periodontal treatment in dental clinics, the protocol of maintenance therapy, and the general awareness of the dental profession toward periodontal care.","1471":"","1472":""},"articletitle":{"0":"Comparative evaluation of implant stability with and without autologous platelet-rich fibrin prior to prosthetic loading - A split-mouth randomized clinical trial.","1":"Time to usher in concepts anew.","2":"In vitro Analysis of Surface Roughness Produced by an Air Polishing Device and Conventional Root Planing on Cementum: A Profilometric Study.","3":"Multidisciplinary treatment of an impacted maxillary canine with immediate implant installation.","4":"Metabolomics: Paving the path for personalized periodontics - A literature review.","5":"A study to evaluate the prevalence of teeth without clinically detectable mucogingival junction.","6":"Known, unknown and the hypothesis: A captivating introduction!","7":"In vivo investigation of gingival health and oxidative stress changes in patients undergoing orthodontic treatment with and without fluoride use.","8":"In vitro assessment of the antimicrobial activity of tetracycline hydrochloride diluted in three different vehicles against Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum.","9":"Surgical management of autogenous bone block graft exposure followed by prosthetic rehabilitation of thin residual ridge.","10":"Comparative evaluation of subgingival irrigation with propolis extract versus chlorhexidine as an adjunct to scaling and root planing for the treatment of chronic periodontitis: A randomized controlled trial.","11":"Comparison of salivary calprotectin levels in periodontitis associated with diabetes mellitus after low-level laser therapy as an adjunct to scaling and root planing: A randomized clinical trial.","12":"A 5-year Prospective validation of the Miller-McEntire Periodontal Prognostic Index.","13":"Fibrosarcoma: Origin, differential diagnosis, and report of a case in the mandible.","14":"The migration of the bovine-derived xenograft particles: A case series.","15":"Comparative assessment of exfoliated gingival cells in healthy individuals and chronic periodontitis patients with and without tobacco chewing habit: A cytomorphometric study.","16":"Evaluation of the efficacy of concentrated growth factor along with bovine-derived xenograft and collagen membrane in the treatment of Degree II mandibular molar furcation defect - A clinicoradiographic study.","17":"Treating short upper lip with \"Unified lip repositioning\" technique: Two case reports.","18":"An interdisciplinary approach for reconstruction of worn dentition.","19":"Can a single molar root act as a whole tooth?","20":"Peripheral giant cell granuloma of maxilla.","21":"Psychometric approach to evaluate periodontal disease using Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire.","22":"The relationship between children's body mass index and periodontal status.","23":"Microbiological Effects of Virgin Coconut Oil Pulling in Comparison with Palm Oil Pulling as an Adjunctive Oral Hygiene Care for Patients with Gingival Inflammation: A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.","24":"Effect of liquorice (root extract) mouth rinse on dental plaque and gingivitis - A randomized controlled clinical trial.","25":"Comparative evaluation of peri-implant tissues in definitive and repeated abutment replacements: A randomized clinical trial.","26":"Evaluation of the reactive oxygen metabolite levels in plasma, gingival crevicular fluid, and saliva in generalized chronic periodontitis patients before and after nonsurgical periodontal therapy: A case-control and interventional study.","27":"Thermal Effect of Operatory Room Temperature, Surgical Drill Diameter, and Temperature of Irrigants at Different Depths of Implant Site Preparation - Thermographic Analysis on Goat Mandible.","28":"Quantitative evaluation of modified advanced platelet-rich fibrin buffy coat among diabetic patients and tobacco smokers with chronic periodontitis.","29":"Evaluation of mechanical properties of platelet-rich fibrin membrane for implant surgery: An analysis in vitro.","30":"Free haem levels in gingival crevicular fluid and their relationship to periodontal clinical parameters, smoking and subgingival microbial composition.","31":"Photobiomodulation of human gingival fibroblasts with diode laser - A systematic review.","32":"Reforms and role models.","33":"An Immensely happy, educative, eruditive and prosperous new year.","34":"Writing an abstract: Revealing the essence with eloquence.","35":"Decision-making process for esthetic treatment of gummy smile: A surgical perspective.","36":"Soft-tissues stabilization after immediate implant;
