The analysis is carried out on the basis of demographic data from small area units, which include the results from the most recent 1991 census. Although it had already been possible in the 1970s to discern first indications of such a process setting in, in the decade 1981-91 indicators of population growth and migration balances agree in pointing to a polarization reversal.\" (SUMMARY IN ENG)","1":"The reduction of the rate of growth of the Brazilian population from 3% in the 1960s to 2% by 1993 resulted from a significant reduction of fertility. According to the 1986 national maternal-child health and family planning survey (PNSMIPF) results, 43.3% of women were using some type of contraception: 65.6% of married or cohabiting women. Women relied most on sterilization (17.2%), followed by oral contraceptives (OCs) (17%), the rhythm method (2.8%), the condom (1.1%), and others (5.2%). Only in the south was OC use more prevalent (28.5%) than sterilization (12.2%). The proportion of sterilization reached 27.8% in the north\/center-east urban regions. In urban areas sterilization averaged 18.7% vs. 12.7% in rural areas. 26.9% of currently married women in the age range of 15-44 years had been sterilized. A 1990 international estimation indicated that the proportion of sterilization amounted to 36.9% in China, 30.95 in India, 29.7% in Brazil, 47.6% in South Korea, 30.4% in Thailand, and 36.5% in the Dominican Republic. The 1986 PNSMIPF survey also indicated that sterilized women were better informed than other women about contraception. 75% of the former had used OCs, 5% had used the diaphragm, 3% the IUD, 30% the condom, and 35% coitus interruptus at one time or other. The sterilized women had an average of 1.7 more children than those who were using other methods of contraception. 48.6% of women were sterilized before the age of 30, when they had had an average of 3.6 children. 66.6% of the sterilized women who had given birth before the age of 20 had 4 or more live births as compared to 5.9% of sterilized women aged 30 with the same number of children. 47% of women without any schooling were using some kind of contraception vs. 77% of those who had completed secondary school. A multivariate analysis also showed that the age of the mother, the number of live births, the educational status of the mother, and family income were positively correlated with sterilization.","2":"\"The paper analyses the population development of French urban agglomerations of more than 50,000 inhabitants over the last three decades (1962-90).  Trends of net migration, natural increase and total population change are examined with respect to different functional and structural city types.  The results show changes of long established growth patterns:  an overall decrease of urban growth rates in the seventies and the resurgence of the growth of the largest metropolitan areas in the eighties.\" (SUMMARY IN ENG)","3":"\"The article analyses the population growth in rural counties of the U.S.A.  for 1970-80 and 1980-86.  The growth rates are examined on different levels of aggregation (individual counties, subregions and regions) and in relation to several possible determinants of growth.  The main objective of the study is to examine whether the growth patterns in the eighties support the hypothesis of a turnaround in the population development of rural areas.... The results reveal a diversity of growth patterns and significant regional differences.  Rural counties within the daily urban system of a metropolitan area have significantly higher growth rates than peripheral rural counties.  The results do not support the notion of a turnaround of long established trends.  The trends in the eighties bear more resemblance to traditional growth patterns of rural areas.\" (SUMMARY IN ENG)","4":"\"An attempt is made in the light of an analysis of population changes occurring in several sub-districts of Greater Santiago in the period between the last population censuses of 1970 and 1982, based on small-area census units (distritos and communas) to draw attention to the effects on the spatial growth of the city resulting from changed conditions in the political and juridical sphere since the change of power in 1973.\"  The effect of changes in government policy concerning the liberalization of the property market and the illegal occupation of land are noted.  (summary in ENG)","5":"Causes of the recent increase in female rural-urban migration in Kenya are investigated.  \"Reasons for this additional migration-wave are to be found in a general weakening of traditional values and authorities, the increasing land shortage and the resulting population pressure in the rural areas, which are factors that do in fact force women to migrate to towns.\"  Comparisons are made with male migration flows.  Regional differences in migration patterns are also noted.  The author concludes that the increase in female migration is not a result of greater emancipation of women but rather a symptom of increasing poverty among Kenya's female population.  (SUMMARY IN ENG)","6":"An analysis of changes in migration patterns since World War II between inner Anatolia and eastern Anatolia in Turkey is presented.  Four periods are distinguished, the exploratory period until 1950, seasonal migration until 1960, mass migration up to the present, and marriage migration from 1975 to the present.  The linkages between previous and potential migrants are noted.
