To report on the feasibility, safety, and outcome of rescue strategies (stenting and\/or angioplasty) in cases of failed MT for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in anterior circulation. It was a retrospective observational study where patients undergoing MT were divided into two groups. The first group (MT-only) was of patients who had undergone only MT with the standard tools (stentriever and\/or aspiration). The second group (MT-plus) consisted of patients who underwent a rescue procedure after failure of the standard MT. The two groups were compared based on the demographics, risk factors, stroke severity, and the extent of infarct on imaging. The angiographic findings, procedural details, periprocedural care, and angiographic and clinical outcome were also compared. Out of 181 cases, 142 were in MT-only while 39 were included in MT-plus group. The two groups had comparable baseline stroke severity, extent of infarct on imaging and door to puncture time. The MT-plus patients had significantly longer time of onset and puncture to recanalization time. The clinical outcome was favorable in both groups with 57.7% and 59% patients achieving mRS 0-2 in MT-only and MT-plus groups, respectively. Successful recanalization was achieved in 80.3% and 89.7% in MT-only and MT-plus groups, respectively. There was no significant increase in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and mortality after rescue procedures. Rescue stenting and\/or angioplasty after failed MT is a safe and effective recanalization method for AIS in anterior circulation without increasing mortality or morbidity.

The frequency of the neurologic manifestations and the risk factors in the development of these symptoms are not clear. We aimed to determine the exact frequency of the neurological symptoms in pediatric patients with confirmed COVID-19 and to identify the risk factors for the development of neurological manifestations. We included pediatric Covid-19 patients admitted to the Children's Hospital of Ankara City Hospital between March 22 and June 1, 2020. Neurological findings were questioned by interviewing the patients and their families and detailed neurologic examinations were performed within protection measures. A total of 312 pediatric patients with the diagnosis of COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. Sixty-six participants (21.15%) showed neurologic symptoms during COVID-19. Headache was the most common neurologic symptom and present in 14% (n: 44) of the cases. The other neurologic symptoms were myalgia (n: 30, 9.6%), anosmia\/hyposmia (n: 6, 1.9%), ageusia (n: 2, 0.6%), and vertigo (n: 1, 0.3%). Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (P = 0.002) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) (P = 0.001) were significantly elevated in patients with neurological symptoms when compared to the patients without the symptoms.

The aim of the study was to describe the clinical, etiological, and imaging characteristics of CVST and its outcome in children. A retrospective chart review of children with CVST in a tertiary hospital from January 2011 to December 2020. Of the 35 patients enrolled, 26 (74.3%) patients were males. The mean age was 5.03 years with a range of 0.17-12 years. The common presenting symptoms were seizures in 18 (51.4%) followed by headache in 17 (48.6%), fever in 16 (45.7%), and vomiting in 15 (42.9%) children. Superior sagittal sinus was the commonest site of thrombus occlusion in 20 (57%), followed by transverse sinus in 18 (51.4%) patients. Multiple sinus involvement was noticed in one-half of the patients. The risk factors associated with CVST were head and neck infections in 15 (42.9%) children, inherited thrombophilia in 4 (11.6%), head trauma, iron deficiency anemia, leukemia with l-asparaginase therapy, acquired thrombophilia in 3 (8.6%) each, dehydration in 2 (5.7%), and dural arteriovenous fistula in one child. Two children (5.7%) died and one-third of the cohort had a poor outcome. Head and neck infections continue to be the common cause of CVST in children.

Only a few anecdotal reports of neurological involvement have come out from India so far. Adverse neurological events following immunization (AEFI) were also reported. We present the neurological symptoms seen either in association with vaccination or COVID-19 infection during the second wave. This was a retrospective study that included consecutive COVID-19 patients' admissions during the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic in two tertiary health care centres in Kerala. Neurological symptoms two weeks prior or thirty days after a positive status of antigen or RTPCR was termed as COVID-19-Associated Neurological Disorders (CAND) and those with neurological symptoms within one month of COVID-19 vaccination was termed as Post-Vaccinal Neurological Disorders (PVND). During the study period, 1270 COVID-19 admissions were reported. We identified neurological symptoms in 42 patients (3.3%), of which 35 were CAND and 7 were PVND. Stroke was the most common (50%), followed by seizures and peripheral nervous system disorders (14.2% each). Encephalitis\/demyelination (11.9%) and COVID-19-associated infections (9.5%) were also seen. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, CAND and PVND have been emerging. Association of some of these may be fortuitous; however it is worth mentioning as pathogenic mechanisms of COVID-19 affecting various organ systems still remain unclear. Moreover, this may be helpful in future studies designing management options. ","28":"Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive muscular dystrophy that affects young boys and is caused by mutation of the dystrophin gene located over X chromosome. In this prospective study, 120 clinically diagnosed DMD patients were tested for exon deletions, duplication or point mutation. Of the 120 clinically suspected DMD patients, the diagnosis of DMD was confirmed by the genetic study or muscle biopsy in 116 patients. The mean age of onset was 3.2 years and the mean age at presentation was 7.2 years. 110\/120 cases were confirmed by genetic testing and six were by absence of staining for dystrophin on muscle biopsy. DMD gene deletion was present in 78.5%, duplication in 5.3% and point mutation in 11.2% cases. 70.3% of patients had deletion located at a distal hot spot region. Single exon deletion was found in 16.5%. Distal hotspot exons 47, 48 and 50 were the commonly deleted exons. In our study, 94.8% cases showed genetic change in the DMD gene. Muscle biopsy was the choice of investigation in earlier days. Detection of DMD by DNA based method eliminates the need to do an invasive procedure for diagnosis. Hence the genetic testing should be the investigation of choice in suspected cases of DMD. The pattern of deletion, obtained in the population of Rajasthan was similar when compared with other ethnic groups of the Indian population. It would be helpful for researchers to develop drugs specific to exons or for ongoing mutation-specific therapies.

This study aims to find the factors affecting medication adherence in patients with PD keeping in mind the cultural, economic, and social diversities so that preventive steps can be taken to fill these gaps. Demographic data, disease parameters, treatment-related factors, family characteristics, educational, and employment status were assessed for relationship with the medication adherence pattern in a cohort of non-demented PD patients. Medication adherence was measured by MMAS-8; depression, and socioeconomic status were assessed by GDS-SF and Kuppuswamy scales respectively. From 134 PD subjects, high adherence was observed in 43.2%, 18.2% had moderate, and 38.6% reported low adherence level to their pharmacotherapy. The sub-optimal level of adherence was significantly correlated to compliance of follow up with the physician (p 0.03), presence of adverse events related to drugs (p 0.03), and depressive symptoms (p &lt; 0.0001). Also, there was significant negative co-relationship between poor adherence and depression on Spearman's rank coefficient (0.702). There was no effect of demographic factors, living conditions, family type, educational qualification, associated comorbid conditions, and socioeconomic status on adherence to dopaminergic treatment in patients with PD. Poor adherence to prescribed medication is a menace that is more than just oversimplification of forgetfulness which should be evaluated at each visit to improve efficacy of the prescribed regimen to achieve better treatment result and thus quality of life of PD patients.

Previous studies observed more intense symptoms among women without a corresponding increase in disease severity and attributed it to reporting bias. In this study, we examined whether women are inherently more vulnerable to work related median nerve dysfunction at wrist and whether reported CTS symptoms among women correspond to the degree of median neuropathy at wrist. A cross-sectional study was designed for outpatients (aged 25-59 years) diagnosed with CTS. Occupational categorisation was done based on the analysis of their individual job tasks. Symptom severity (Boston Symptom Severity Scale - SSS), functional disability (Boston Functional Status Scale - FSS), and clinical (Hi - Ob scale) and neurophysiological severity (NCS grade) were determined, compared among occupational groups and were statistically analysed. A total of 454 patients (348 women and 106 men; F: M ratio 3.28:1) were included. Among them, 191 were housewives. Female manual workers and housewives reported significantly more intense symptoms with a corresponding increase in clinical and electrophysiological severity (p &lt; 0.001) when compared to female non-manual workers. However, no significant difference in symptoms, clinical or neurophysiological severity was found between male non-manual and manual workers. Among manual workers, women were more symptomatic than men, but clinical and neurophysiological severities were significantly higher only in the older age groups. The differential vulnerability of the female population to hand-intensive work predisposes them to severe median nerve dysfunction at wrist with proportionately higher CTS symptoms. Therefore, working women need focussed attention for remedial measures.

Neurological features accompany 20% of scrub typhus infections, and may affect the central or peripheral nervous system, and sometime, may even occur in combination. Of late, its recognition among clinicians has increased with widening detection of its cutaneous hallmark, called eschar. Multiple mechanisms underlie neurological involvement, including direct invasion (meningitis, encephalitis), vasculitis (myositis) or immune-mediated mechanisms (opsoclonus, myoclonus, optic neuritis, Guillain-Barre syndrome). Despite an immunological basis for several neurological manifestations, response to doxycycline is remarkable, although immune therapy may be necessary for severe involvement. Scientific literature on scrub typhus neurology chiefly emanates from case reports, case series and small studies, and a comprehensive review is warranted to aid clinicians in recognising neurological involvement. This review aims at enriching this gap, and summarises clinical features, laboratory findings, and treatment options for various neurological facets of scrub typhus.","44":"","45":"","46":null,"47":"","48":"","49":"","50":"","51":"","52":"","53":"","54":"","55":"","56":"","57":"","58":"Atherosclerosis at the carotid bifurcation in the neck is common and the result of turbulent hemodynamics in the bulb. Carotid bulb plaques cause disabling strokes. Carotid vessel wall imaging characterizes the atherosclerotic plaque, documents disease progression, and assesses lesion severity by plaque morphology in addition to the degree of stenosis. This in turn optimizes treatment selection for the individual patient. The aim of vessel wall imaging in patients of stroke is to distinguish stable plaques that may be conserved with best medical management from unstable or vulnerable plaques that require more aggressive medical treatment, carotid stenting, or carotid endarterectomy. Growing evidence suggests that depending on luminal stenosis measurements alone for management decisions will result in underestimating a number of plaques whose size may be small, but where the plaque morphology is unstable, there is a high likelihood of the patient developing a thromboembolic stroke in the near future. In today's context of aggressive management of even transient ischemic attacks and minor strokes, vessel wall imaging should be particularly performed in cryptogenic strokes without significant luminal narrowing on angiography to identify a subset of patients with nonstenotic but unstable atherosclerotic plaques that may be covert etiologies of stroke. If patients receiving the best medical management have recurrent strokes on the same side as a carotid plaque with \"vulnerable\" plaque features, they may deserve surgical or endovascular intervention even if they do not meet the conventional stenosis thresholds. Improved techniques for stroke imaging and consequent management have a remarkable effect in decreasing individual and public health burdens.","59":"","60":null,"61":"Governments have imposed lockdowns in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hospitals have restricted outpatient clinics and elective services meant for non-COVID illnesses. This has led to patients facing unprecedented challenges and uncertainties. This study was carried out to assess patients' concerns and apprehensions about the effect of the lockdown on their treatments. An ambispective, observational cross-sectional single centre study was conducted. Patients were contacted telephonically and requested to answer a structured questionnaire. Their responses were documented and summarized as frequency and proportions. A total of 727 patients were interviewed. Epilepsy (32%) was the most common neurological illness in our cohort followed by stroke (18%). About half the patients and\/or their caregivers reported health-related concerns during the lockdown. The primary concern was how to connect with their treating neurologist if need arose. Forty-seven patients (6.4%) had drug default. Among patients on immunomodulatory treatments, only eight patients had drug default. High compliance rates were also observed in the stroke and epilepsy cohorts. Of the 71 patients who required emergency care during the lockdown, 24 could reach our hospital emergency. Fourteen patients either had a delay or could not seek emergency care. Two-thirds of our patients found the telemedicine experience satisfactory. The ongoing pandemic will continue to pose challenges to both physicians and patients.

EMLA-induced SSW was visually graded after 90 min of application and correlated with symptom and NCS severities. Forty-two symptomatic hands and 30 asymptomatic hands were enrolled as cases and controls, respectively. The diagnostic efficiency of the extended EMLA test was found to be 83.4% for digit 2 and 87.3% for the lateral 4 digits (mean), whereas the diagnostic efficiency of standard NCS was 88.1%. Boston SSS and NPSI were better correlated with EMLA positivity than NCS positivity. A linear regression analysis showed negative correlation of wrinkling grade with NCS grade. With its improved diagnostic efficiency, the 90-min extended EMLA test can feasibly be used as an alternative to NCS, especially in general practice settings. Its potential clinical utility should be explored in a large population of CTS patients showing varying clinical and electrophysiological severities.

Unlike in the adult population, the clinical presentation of strokes in children may not be stereotyped. Hence, many other differential diagnostic possibilities might have to be considered in the emergency setting. Due to this heterogeneous presentation and the resultant clinical dilemma in the early detection, acute thrombolysis even now remains as a very rarely tried therapeutic option in children. Many case reports over these years have shown consistently good results of acute intravenous thrombolysis in children with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administered within the time frame. There are also some recent reports of endovascular interventions. However, unlike in the adult population, class 1 clinical studies and good Randomized controlled trials (RCT) are yet to emerge in children. The absence of age-appropriate safety and outcome data for the commonly used thrombolytic agents in children is another major roadblock for developing clinical guidelines and recommendations for this age group. The ambitious Thrombolysis in Pediatric Stroke (TIPS) trial had to be terminated prematurely due to poor patient enrolment. This review critically looks at the current status of the acute management of ischemic strokes in children with a specific emphasis on thrombolytic therapy. Until we have better evidence-based guidelines for this age group, it will be prudent to develop robust institutional pathways to provide this important intervention for all eligible children with acute strokes.","70":"","71":"","72":"Levodopa (L-dopa) is the gold standard in the management of Parkinson's disease (PD). It dates back to 1500 to 1000 BC when it was used in the Indian Ayurvedic and Chinese system of medicine. Certain beans such as velvet beans and broad beans contain L-dopa. The plant Mucuna pruriens (Mp) or velvet bean, cultivated in Eastern India and Southern China, contains L-dopa at a concentration of 5% and was used for the management of PD. Later, workers have documented the neuroprotective, neurorestorative, and immunomodulatory properties of Mp. Double-blind studies conducted in the Western world have proved the efficacy of Mp and reported some toxic side effects as well. In the Western world, the credit for isolating L-dopa from the seeds of Vicia faba or broad bean goes to Markus Guggenheim, a biochemist from Sweden in 1913. However, it has been used with success ever since Arvid Carlsson established the reversibility of reserpine-induced akinesia in rabbits in the late 1950s with the use of intravenous dopamine, and Oleh Hornykiewicz demonstrated its deficiency in the striatum in 1960-1961. George Cotzias used it in patients in a low and slow incremental fashion in 1967, and Melvin Yahr and his colleagues performed double-blind study on in-patients with success in 1969. Complications with its long-term use, particularly the on-off phenomenon, and dyskinesias appeared soon, and measures have been undertaken to reduce their incidence.

The cost to life and socioeconomic burden prompted a search for new treatments and vaccines. Several collaborations developed and could deliver state-of-the-art vaccines with acceptable efficacy and safety in record time. Recently, vaccination with Oxford-AstraZeneca and Johnson and Johnson vaccines was halted due to the reported adverse effects of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). Although a detailed risk-benefit analysis led to their reinstitution, physicians across the world are still trying to understand the pathophysiology and mechanisms of these neurological adverse effects in order to better identify, diagnose, and treat them. One of the mechanisms that have been implicated is related to the adenovirus-based vector of these vaccines. COVISHIELD, which is the most widely administered vaccine in India, also shares the same vector. As India enters the next phase of vaccine distribution for younger adults, there are chances that such adverse effects may emerge. In this review, we analyze the temporary suspension of the administration of the vaccines due to VITT\/CVST, summarize the existing guidelines about diagnosis and treatment of these neurological disorders as well as the need for increasing pharmacovigilance and awareness among physicians. Screening for potential risk factors, avoiding aggravating factors like dehydration, and providing choices in vaccinating the high-risk populations could help in avoiding these rare but potentially fatal adverse outcome.","84":"","85":"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder due to ATP7B gene mutation, resulting in defective copper metabolism, with liver and brain being primarily affected. Being a treatable disorder, early diagnosis and proper management of WD may result in near complete recovery. It has received significant attention over the past 50 years, with several Indian contributions. This study collates published Indian studies on WD in Pubmed and Embase databases and puts them in perspective. Several Indian case series suggest that WD may be more prevalent than thought. Commonly detected ATP7B mutation in India is p.C271X. Although initial Indian series reported significant osseomuscular presentation, neuropsychiatric and hepatic manifestations dominated the later reports. A significant male predominance is observed in Indian series. Pure hepatic presentation starts earlier than neurological or osseomuscular WD. A positive family history may be seen in nearly 50% of Indian WD cases with a high rate of consanguinity. Up to two-third of Indian cases may be initially misdiagnosed, with a mean diagnostic delay of up to 2 years. Abnormalities in serum ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urinary copper has been reported in more than four-fifth cases. Brain MRI is abnormal in nearly all neurological WD cases. Copper chelation remains the mainstay of therapy, with D-penicillamine being the most widely used chelator in India. Global Assessment Scale for WD is a comprehensive tool for clinical monitoring.

We also aimed to assess if a dedicated sensitization cum teaching session by a group of interns doctors guided by a neurologist could help improve students' knowledge and awareness towards dementia or not. 82 consenting final year medical students answered questionnaires of Alzheimer Disease Knowledge Scale (ADKS) and Dementia Attitude Scale (DAS) at a baseline level. A sensitization cum teaching session by intern doctors was conducted to enhance students' knowledge about dementia. A post sensitization reassessment of students was done to assess impact of the session. The ADKS score was 57% at baseline which was increased to 71% post sensitization program. The mean DAS score was 3.2 at baseline which was reported to be 3.4 after sensitization program. Students reported significant improvement in their knowledge level but did not show the same improvement in their attitude and comfort level in caring for dementia after the sensitization program. Students were still not comfortable dealing with patients with dementia. Medical students lack significant knowledge and training about dementia. Patient contact and practical training for basic assessment and care of dementia needs to be incorporated in the current academic curriculum.

To establish association between quantified regional cerebral perfusion and gray matter (GM) volumes with cognitive measures in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's Dementia (AD), using three dimensional fast spin echo pseudo-continuous ASL MRI sequences. Hospital-based cross-sectional study. Three age-matched groups, i.e., 21 cognitively normal healthy controls (HC), 20 MCI and 19 early AD patients diagnosed using neuropsychological tests and who consented for multimodality 3T MRI were recruited for the study. Statistical parametric mapping and regions of interest (ROI) multivariate analysis of variance was used to ascertain differences between patients and controls on MRI-volumetry and ASL. Linear regression was used to assess relationship between CBF with GM atrophy and neuropsychological test measures. Compared to HC, patients with MCI and AD had significantly lower quantified perfusion in posterior cingulate and lingual gyri, over hippocampus in MCI, with no differences noted between MCI and AD. Atrophy over the middle temporal gyrus and hippocampus differentiated AD from MCI. No significant positive correlations were noted between perfusion and GM volumes in ROI with the exception of temporal neocortex. Significantly positive coefficient b-value (p &lt; 0.01) were apparent between global cognition with CBF in precuneus, temporal neocortex and precuneus volume, with negative b-values noted between medial temporal CBF for global cognition and recall scores. ROI-based CBF measurements differentiated MCI and AD from HC; volumetry of medial and neocortical temporal GM separates AD from MCI. Correlations between CBF and neuropsychology are variable and require further longitudinal studies to gauge its predictive utility on cognitive trajectory in MCI.

Patient charts were reviewed for clinical features, electrophysiological recordings. The electrodiagnostic results (4 motor nerves and two sensory nerves in upper limbs and lower limbs) were reanalyzed and were classified based on Dutch group; Ho; Hadden; Hughes and Rajabally criteria for GBS. During this study period, of the 205 children with clinical features of GBS, 15 children had incomplete electrophysiological data, and four children were excluded due to missing data. The mean age of onset of the 186 children enrolled was 77 months; the median duration from symptom onset to electrodiagnostic evaluation was seven days; pure motor and motor-sensory form of GBS was seen in 71 and 115 children. Based on the Hadden criteria, a demyelinating pattern was noted in 57 children; axonal in 37; Inexcitable in 84 and Equivocal in 8 children. The sensitivity of the various criteria ranged from 71% to 100% for demyelination, 97% to 100% for axonal. The degree of agreement using Hadden and Rajabally criteria for Equivocal subtypes was 0.93.

Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL), a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique for quantitative noninvasive measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF), can provide a direct measure of variations in cerebral perfusion associated with the epileptogenic zone. 1. To evaluate usefulness of ASL for detecting interictal temporal hypoperfusion to localize the epileptogenic zone in patients of drug resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). 2. Correlation of localization of epileptogenic zone on ASL MR perfusion with structural MRI and EEG. 30 patients with MTLE and10 age and gender matched normal controls were studied. All patients underwent ictal video EEG monitoring non-invasively, MR imaging with epilepsy protocol and pseudocontinuous ASL (PCASL) perfusion study. Relative CBF (rCBF) values in bilateral mesial temporal lobes were measured utilizing quantitative analysis of perfusion images. A perfusion asymmetry index (AI) was calculated for each region. In patients, ipsilateral mesial temporal rCBF was significantly decreased compared with contralateral mesial temporal rCBF (p = 0.021). Mesial temporal blood flow was more asymmetric in patients than in normal control participants (p = 0.000). Clear perfusion asymmetry on PCASL-MRI was identified despite normal structural-MRI in 5 cases, agreeing with EEG laterality. Pseudo-continuous ASL offers a promising approach to detect interictal hypoperfusion in TLE and as a clinical alternative to SPECT and PET due to non-invasiveness and easy accessibility. Incorporation of ASL into routine pre-surgical evaluation protocols can help to localize epileptogenic zone in surgical candidates.

A retrospective analysis of 67 patients with clinically diagnosed MSA was performed. All the subjects underwent 99mTc TRODAT-1 SPECT and 18F-FDG PET\/CT scanning on two separate days. The 99mTc-TRODAT-1 scans were analyzed visually for asymmetry and rostro-caudal gradient. The FDG uptake patterns were recorded, and areas of hypometabolism that were two standard deviations from the mean were considered abnormal. All the subjects had an abnormal pattern of FDG uptake on PET scan, both on a visual inspection and semiquantitative analysis. In MSA-P subjects (n = 29), diffuse predominant hypometabolism of the globus pallidus-putamen complex was noted, with relative sparing of the caudate nuclei. In MSA-C subjects (n = 25), characteristic hypometabolism was noted in the cerebellum and brainstem. In mixed subtypes (n = 13), variable involvement of the basal ganglia, cerebellum, and brainstem was noted with frontoparietal hypometabolism. A statistically significant difference between MSA-P and MSA-C for gradient reduction and asymmetry with gradient reduction was observed. Dopamine transporter imaging with 99mTc TRODAT-1 SPECT not only helps in confirmation of parkinsonian disorders but also demonstrates varying patterns of distribution in different subtypes of MSA. Characteristic patterns of hypometabolism in 18F-FDG PET may help in the differentiation of the subtypes of MSA in the presence of clinically overlapping symptoms.

The asymmetry in the strength of the elicited horizontal positional nystagmus during SRT is explained by the Ewald's second law and is crucial for lateralizing the affected ear. Rarely the elicited horizontal positional nystagmus on the head roll to either side during the SRT is of symmetric strength. In such situations, the signs with secondary lateralizing value are useful in management by the repositioning maneuvers that require the affected side to be precisely known. The submitted article is a case report. A 38-year-old male with two days history of vertigo on rolling to either of the lateral recumbent position was seen in the second week of March 2019. His SRT elicited a lying-down nystagmus (LDN) to the right, while the head roll to either side elicited a geotropic horizontal positional nystagmus of symmetric strength. The symmetrical strength of elicited positional nystagmus on SRT to either side led to ascendance of LDN from a lateralizing sign of secondary importance to one that reliably lateralized the involved horizontal semicircular canal. At two short term follow-ups at 1 hour and 24 hours after the therapeutic Gufoni maneuver, patient neither had vertigo nor any nystagmus elicited on the verifying supine roll test.

The cultures in all of them revealed growth of Staphylococcus aureus with three of them being MRSA isolates. Two subjects tested positive for anti-VGKC antibodies. There was remarkable resolution in neuromyotonia after antibiotics in three subjects. One subject succumbed to fulminant MRSA septicemia. There appears to be a definitive link between staphylococcal infection (MRSA in particular) and development of PNH. The temporal evolution of PNH associated with the infection and resolution following treatment of the infection does support a causal association. The enterotoxins produced by staphylococci act as superantigens and could trigger an inflammatory cascade along with development of cross reacting antibodies against VGKC in peripheral nerves. Future studies with animal models could provide more directions in this regard. ","282":"Histoplasmosis occurs predominantly in immunocompromised hosts and typically presents with mild constitutional symptoms, weight loss, weakness, fatigability, hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy. The diagnosis is generally delayed and is based upon isolating the organism in blood cultures or by identifying intracellular organisms in tissues. Disseminated Histoplasmosis is well described in HIV patients but Histoplasmosis myositis is a rare manifestation and has not been reported in seronegative patients till date. We here address a case of a pharmacologically immunosuppressed patient with extensive Histoplasmosis myositis invading almost all the skeletal muscles of body (including plantar foot muscles) with no evidence of dissemination to other organ-systems. Clinical examination and investigations co-related with infiltrative muscle disease and skeletal muscle biopsy revealed Histoplasma capsulatum. This patient illustrates a distinctive clinical presentation of fungal infection with subtle constitutional symptoms and isolated muscle weakness which added to the diagnostic challenge. Hence, differential diagnosis of fungal infection must always be considered as a cause of myopathy in any pharmacologically immunosuppressed patient.","283":"Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. Neurochemical studies have implicated metals in pathogenesis of PD. To examine the association of serum iron, transferrin, ferritin, transferrin saturation and UIBC in PD patients and to derive the Discrimination Function with scores of these variables to correctly classify PD cases and healthy controls. In the present study, identification of biomarker pool in case-control study involving 79 PD cases and 80 healthy controls were performed. The results of independent t-test analysis showed that PD cases presented significantly higher (P &lt; 0.01) level of transferrin, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), unsaturated iron binding capacity (UIBC) and urea than controls. As only one-third of transferrin is saturated with iron, so the transferrin present in serum has the extra binding capacity (67%), this is called UIBC. Discriminant analysis was performed to determine the factors that best discriminate between the categories of an outcome variables (Disease status = PD and Control) and total of five biochemical independent variables (UIBC, transferrin, iron, transferrin saturation, and copper) were taken into consideration. UIBC has emerged out to be highest discriminating, powerful and independent variable among considered independent variables, which indicates iron deficiency. After development of Discriminant Function (Z) and calculation of discriminant function cut points, a cross-validation analysis of PD cases and controls were conducted. The sensitivity of the developed model was 98.73% and specificity 83.75%. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) was plotted, and the findings of ROC curve corroborated with the results obtained from discriminant function analysis. Prospective validation of Discriminant model in large cohort is warranted in future studies. ","284":"Perinatal stroke encompasses a heterogeneous group of focal neurological injuries early in brain development. In this study, we aimed to compare risk and prognostic factors in preterm and term infants with perinatal hemorrhagic stroke (PHS). The study includes 66 infants with PHS. The infants were evaluated for demographic characteristics, fetal and maternal risk factors, perinatal events, clinical and neuroimaging findings, complications, and sequales. Of 66 infants with PHS, 44 (66.70%) were preterm and 22 (33.30%) were term infants. Primiparity, mucosal bleeding, and multiple lobes involvement were more common in term infants than preterm infants (P &lt; 0.05); however, respiratory insufficiency, neonatal sepsis, perinatal asphyxia, respiratory distress syndrome, use of invasive mechanical ventilation, use of noninvasive mechanical ventilation, and prolonged hospitalization were more common in preterm infants than term infants (P &lt; 0.05). Eight (12.12%) infants died during infancy period. Small for gestational age and mucosal bleeding were more common in infants who are dead than those alive (P &lt; 0.05). Forty-two (63.63%) infants were followed. Cerebral palsy and\/or epilepsy and\/or hydrocephalus were diagnosed in 36 (85.72%) infants during follow-up. Our findings showed that PHS was much more common in preterm infants. Mucosal bleeding and multiple lobes involvement were more common in term infants. PHS has high morbidity and mortality rates. Small for gestational age and mucosal bleeding were more common in infants who are dead. ","285":"The challenges being faced during the lockdown period may worsen motor or non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). This study was undertaken to investigate the impact of lockdown on the disease activity, caregiver perceptions and the quality of life of patients with PD. This cross-sectional study was conducted from June till September 2020. Sixty-four patients with PD and caregivers were interviewed telephonically after obtaining consent. The responses were recorded by means of a structured questionnaire. Non-motor symptoms scale (NMSS) and the Parkinson Disease Questinnaire-8 (PDQ-8) were applied. PDQ-8 severity index (PDQ-8 SI) scores were expressed as percentage of the raw PDQ-8 score of the total score. Data were analsyed by using SPSS version 20.0. Of 64 patients, 39 (60.9%) were men and 25 (39.1%) were women. The overall median age of the patients was 65 (55.25-69.75) years. The median duration was 48 (30-84) months. Twenty-six (40.6%) patients reported symptomatic worsening during the lockdown period. Slowness in activities of daily living and walking worsened in 15 (57.7%) and 14 (53.8%) patients, respectively, while tremors increased in 12 (46.2%) patients. Mood and sleep disturbances were the most common non-motor symptoms to worsen. Increase in non-motor symptoms and the NMSS total score were independent predictors of PDQ-8 scores. Increase in non-motor symptoms during the lockdown was an independent predictor of the highest quartile of PDQ-8 SI scores. Motor and non-motor symptoms have worsened in patients with PD during the lockdown. The increase in non-motor symptoms was independently associated with poorer quality of life among patients with PD during the lockdown. ","286":"Osteoporosis and sarcopenia are important aspects of motor neuron disease (MND). Individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (MND-ALS) have an increased risk of falls and fractures. Currently, the standard of care does not involve a routine assessment of bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition in these patients. We aimed to assess BMD, bone mineral parameters and body composition in men with MND and compared them with healthy controls. Consecutive males between 50 and 80 years of age diagnosed as MND-ALS by revised El Escorial criteria and able to walk unassisted attending Neurology outpatient clinic were recruited into the study. Age, gender and body mass index (BMI) matched healthy controls were recruited from the local community. BMD and body composition were assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Bone mineral parameters and bone turnover markers (BTMs) were also assessed in them. A total of 30 subjects with MND-ALS and 33 controls were recruited. The mean age (years) was 59.2 in cases and 61.2 in controls. The mean BMD (g\/cm2) between the two groups was similar; however, BTMs were significantly higher in the MND group (P &lt; 0.05). Subjects with MND-ALS had significantly lower mean appendicular lean mass (ALM) (19.9 versus 22.4 kg; P = 0.007) and ALM corrected for BMI than the healthy control group (0.858 versus 0.934 kg\/kg\/m2; P = 0.034). Sarcopenic obesity (Percentage fat mass &gt;27% + ALM\/BMI &lt;0.786 kg\/kg\/m2) was more prevalent in MND-ALS compared to controls (44.5% versus 16.7%; P = 0.03). Although BMD was not significantly different between subjects with MND-ALS and healthy controls, BTMs were significantly higher in the MND group indicating a high bone turnover state. Sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity were also more in MND-ALS group than controls. Routine assessment for bone health parameters and body composition indices may be included in management of the patients with MND.

There are very few published studies on NCL from India, especially in children. A retrospective study of confirmed patients of NCL diagnosed over a period of 10 years from January 2019 to December 2019. Fifty children had a definitive diagnosis of NCL based on enzymatic studies or genetic testing using next-generation sequencing. Around 15 children were diagnosed to have CLN-1 (ceroid lipofuscinoses, neuronal-1) based on palmitoyl protein thioesterase-1 deficiency; 24 children were diagnosed with CLN2 (ceroid lipofuscinoses, neuronal-2) based on deficient tripeptidyl-peptidase-1 activity; three patients were diagnosed as CLN6, five patients as CLN7, one case each of CLN8, CLN11, and CLN14 based on genetic testing. Clinical presentation was quite varied and included refractory seizures, developmental delay\/regression, and abnormal movements. Visual failure was not common in the present case series. Neuroimaging patterns in different types of NCL were different. All children had a progressive downhill course resulting in death in many over a period of 5-10 years of disease onset. NCL is not uncommon and diagnosis can be suspected based on clinical investigations and neuroimaging findings. Diagnosis can be confirmed by enzymatic assays or genetic testing.

Studies describing treatment and long-term outcome are limited. We report the clinical profile and emphasize response to treatment and long-term outcome in eight patients with CASPR2-antibody-associated disease. Clinical, radiological, electrophysiological, treatment, follow-up, and outcome data were collected by retrospective chart review. Clinical manifestations included Morvan syndrome (n = 7) and limbic encephalitis (n = 1). None of the patients were positive for LGI1 antibody. Associated features included myasthenia (n = 1), thymoma (n = 1), and dermatological manifestations (n = 4). Patients were treated with intravenous methylprednisolone and plasma exchange during the acute symptomatic phase followed by pulsed intravenous methyl prednisolone to maintain remission. Mean-modified Rankin score at admission (pre-treatment), discharge, and last follow-up were 3.75, 2.5, and 0.42, respectively. One patient with underlying thymoma and myasthenic crisis died. The other seven patients were followed up for a mean duration of 19.71 months. All of them improved completely. Relapse occurred in one patient after 13 months but responded favorably to steroids. CASPR2 antibody-associated disease has favorable response to immunotherapy with complete improvement and good outcome. Underlying malignancy may be a marker for poor prognosis. ","292":"Biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease is a rare, autosomal recessive, treatable, neurometabolic disorder associated with biallelic pathogenic variations in the SLC19A3 gene. The condition may present as an early-childhood encephalopathy, an early-infantile lethal encephalopathy with lactic acidosis, with or without infantile spasms, or a late-onset Wernicke-like encephalopathy. The key radiological features are bilateral, symmetrical lesions in the caudate, putamen, and medial thalamus, with variable extension into the brain stem, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum. Treatment is life long and includes initiation of high dose biotin and thiamine. Genetic testing confirms the diagnosis. The prognosis depends on the time from diagnosis to the time of vitamin supplementation. The genotype-phenotype correlations are not clear yet, but the early infantile phenotype portends a poorer prognosis. We provide a brief overview of the disorder and emphasize the initiation of high-dose biotin and thiamine in infants and children with unexplained encephalopathy and basal ganglia involvement.","293":"Stem cell therapy has emerged as a potential therapy for the treatment of stroke. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published randomized controlled studies using various types of stem cell therapies in patients with ischemic stroke (IS). Literature search was carried out using PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane library, and clinicaltrial.gov to identify studies on stem cell therapy in IS from its inception till January 2020. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers. STATA version 13 was used for carrying out meta- analysis. We included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) if any of the stem cell therapy was used to treat patients with IS in any phase after the index stroke. We included a total of eight randomized controlled studies involving 459 subjects (217 intervention and 242 controls) in the meta-analysis. We did not observe statistically significant reduction in mean NIHSS score in the intervention group (SMD - 0.34, 95% CI - 0.76 to 0.08) in patients with acute or sub-acute stroke. However, a statistically significant reduction (SMD - 1.57, 95% CI -2.22 to -0.92) was observed in patients with chronic ischemic stroke. Statistically non-significant reduction in mean mRS in the intervention group (SMD 0.04, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.28) in patients with acute or sub-acute ischemic stroke was observed, however a statistically significant reduction (SMD - 1.07, 95% CI - 1.94 to -0.19) was noted in patients with chronic stroke. We did not observe statistically significant reduction in mean Barthel index score (SMD 0.24, 95%CI -1.69 to 2.17) in chronic stroke. Statistically non-significant lower mortality rate was observed in intervention group compared to controls (Risk Ratio 0.84, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.66) among acute or sub-acute, as well as in the chronic stroke group (Risk Ratio 0.47, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.09).

Lasmiditan, a non-vasoconstrictive and highly selective 5HT1F receptor agonist is a novel therapeutic discovery for migraine for patients with cardiovascular (CV) risk factors or stable cardiovascular diseases and who fail to respond to the existing treatment. To identify an optimal dosing of Lasmiditan 100 mg versus 200 mg for the treatment of acute migraine attacks in adult patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Systematic searches were run in databases such as Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Scopus, Google scholar, and PUBMED. Out of 83 study records identified, two studies were included for quantitative analysis. There was a significant headache pain freedom at 2 h [Odds Ratio (OR): 0.77; 95% Confidence interval (CI): 0.64-0.92] and sustained pain freedom at 24 h (OR): 0.75; 95% CI: 0.61-0.93] in patients taking Lasmiditan 200 mg compared to those taking Lasmiditan 100 mg. The results were statistically insignificant for parameters like most bothersome symptoms (MBS) free at 2 h, headache relief at 2 h, disability level at 2 h, and global impression of change at 2 h. A combined analysis of these parameters showed a remarkable difference between both the groups favoring Lasmiditan 200 mg [OR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.81-0.95]. An oral dosing of Lasmiditan 200 mg is ideal for the treatment of acute migraine in adult patients with CV risk factors for attaining headache pain freedom at 2 h and sustained pain freedom at 24 compared to Lasmiditan 100 mg. ","295":"Psychogenic non-epileptic seizure (PNES) is a common disorder that imitates epileptic seizures and has its etiological roots in psychological distress. Due to its \"epileptic\" similarity, it is often dealt with not only by mental health professionals but also by physicians, pediatricians and neurologists. There is a growing consensus towards the psychotherapeutic treatment of the disorder, albeit a lack of clarity in choosing a gold-standard approach. This paper seeks to serve as a compendium of different psychotherapeutic approaches and their efficacy in the management of PNES. The paper employed the search strategy by selecting the keywords: \"Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES) and psychosocial management\", \"PNES Treatment approach\", \"PNES and psychotherapy\" in PUBMED, EBSCO host, PsycINFO, and SCOPUS database. Eventually, specific therapies were cross-searched with PNES for an exhaustive review. Several studies were found employing various psychotherapeutic approaches for the treatment of PNES in pilot studies, randomized controlled, or open uncontrolled trials. Cognitive Behavior Therapy was demonstrated as an efficacious treatment for PNES in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Other approaches that were effective in ameliorating the symptoms were psychodynamic therapies or psychoeducation based group therapies. Some therapies like Novel Integrative psychotherapy, Eye Movement Desensitisation Therapy and Mindfulness-based therapies require further exploration in larger clinical trials. The findings demonstrate that psychological intervention for PNES is a promising alternative treatment approach with a need for more RCTs with a larger sample and robust methodology for better generalization.","296":"Vitamin D deficiency is now a well-recognized public health problem affecting almost every second person throughout the world. Recent evidence from many population-based studies has indicated that a poor vitamin D status is a predictor of future strokes. We reviewed recent studies on 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and symptomatic ischemic stroke. A graded increase in the risk of symptomatic ischemic stroke with decreasing levels of plasma 25(OH)D has been found in most of the studies. Vitamin D also has a role in the poststroke period where its deficiency may hinder the rehabilitation process. After reviewing current literature on the subject, we conclude that there are some data to suggest the role of vitamin D in patients with stroke but it cannot be concluded as a risk factor for stroke. Larger population-based studies are needed to confirm the causative role of vitamin D in stroke.

Research in PD is gradually increasing in India due to increased clinical cases, which could double by 2030 worldwide. Although its prevalence is low in India as compared to other countries, the total burden is much higher due to the large population size. PD is progressively debilitating, with pronounced motor and nonmotor symptoms (NMSs) that severely affect the quality of life (QoL) of patients and their caregivers. The progressive nature of the disease lays great emphasis on doctors to focus on the patients' QoL. As a consequence, Health-related QoL (HRQoL) has gradually become one of the main indicators for assessing health-related outcome. There is a growing need to pay attention to the NMSs and a pressing need to look at the QoL of Indian patients with PD through a culture and value specific lens. Research into the holistic QoL assessment with emphasis on psychological domains may allow for the early evaluation and intervention of depressive and cognitive symptoms in PD. This could result into increased productivity, reduced morbidity, and healthcare cost, which would in turn result into better QoL of Indian PD patients.","299":"","300":"","301":"","302":"","303":"","304":"","305":"","306":"","307":"","308":"","309":"","310":"","311":"","312":"","313":"","314":"","315":"","316":"","317":"","318":"","319":"","320":"","321":"Just when the caterpillar thought it has been wound up into a mastaba, it became a butterfly.","322":"","323":"","324":"The mining of manganese ore in India started in the year 1899, in Nagpur district of the Central Provinces.

These patients were also emotionally disturbed and prone to falls and accidents. He concluded that these symptoms were due to chronic manganese toxicity with parkinsonian features and psychiatric manifestations which he published in 1958.[1] This lead to the formation of an Enquiry Committee by the Ministry of Labour and Employment, Government of India which instituted corrective measures in mining of manganese in India. Very few reports of chronic toxicity due to inhalation of manganese have been reported subsequently. This paper highlights the contributions of Dr. T.P.

To categorize patients of PSP into its using the recently proposed movement disorder society criteria (2017) and to determine the prognosis of the PSP subtypes. Demographic and clinical data of patients diagnosed with PSP over a 21 year period were collected by review of medical records and categorized into its subtypes. Subtype prognosis was assessed from the interval between disease onset and attainment of the first of 5 clinical disability milestones namely wheelchair dependency, unintelligible speech, severe dysphagia, severe cognitive impairment, and urinary catheterization. When categorized into subtypes, out of the 334 patients with PSP, PSP-RS predominated (72%), followed by PSP-parkinsonism (PSP-P) (13.5%), PSP-corticobasal syndrome (PSP-CBS) (5.1%), PSP-frontal (PSP-F) (4.2%), PSP-progressive gait freezing (PSP-PGF) (4.2%), PSP-postural instability (PSP-PI) (0.6%), and PSP-speech\/language (PSP-SL) (0.3%).

This was a cross-sectional web-based survey carried out at the department of Neurology at a tertiary care hospital. A questionnaire was designed in the local language using Google Forms to assess basic knowledge regarding epilepsy, coronavirus, effects of COVID-19 and lockdown on epileptic patients and also effects on their mental health. The link to the online survey was distributed via WhatsApp messenger to epilepsy patients. One hundred fifty-six cases were enrolled with 69.1% were below 34 years of age and male: female ratio was 1.2:1. Only 34.3% of the participants were employed and 50% of patients had an income of less than Rs. 3000 per month. Of the patients enrolled, 20.5% reported the \"devil\" and superstitions as a cause of epilepsy and only 10% of patients thought that tantric (holy priest) could treat the disease better than doctors. 53.8% of patients worried about getting COVID-19 and could not stop thoughts about being infected by coronavirus bothering them. 30.3% patients had increased seizure frequency during COVID-19 pandemic, of which the most common reason was that they forgot to take regular antiepileptic drugs (22.7%) or they had faced difficulty in obtaining medicine due to lockdown (12.1%).

Though, neuropsychological testing reveals subtle frontal impairment in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). The aim of this study is to evaluate cognitive dysfunction in patients with JME. We compared 50 JME patients and 50 age and sex matched healthy controls above 12 years of age on various cognitive tests which included Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), Executive Interview (EXIT), PGI Memory Scale (PGIMS), Clock Drawing Test (CDT), Cube copying test (CCT), and Nahor Benson Test (NBT). We correlated the cognitive dysfunction with education level, age of onset, duration of epilepsy, electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities, treatment, and seizure control status. JME patients performed significantly worse on MMSE (P = 0.001), PGI MS (P value = 0.001), FAB (P =.001), EXIT (P =.001), CDT (P =.02), and CCT (P =.001) when compared to the controls. JME patients had impaired attention, verbal fluency, design fluency, verbal memory, visual memory, conceptualization, set shifting, mental flexibility, response inhibition, and visuospatial functions. Cognitive dysfunction correlated with education level, duration of epilepsy and EEG abnormality. No correlation was seen with seizure frequency or type of antiepileptic therapy. JME patients demonstrate both frontal and parietooccipital lobe dysfunction. Hence detailed higher mental function tests supplemented by functional neuroimaging studies should be done in JME patients for their comprehensive management.

It was a steep learning curve, a couple of close shaves, and many more lessons that went into the development of an algorithm that seems to be working well.","336":"Headache represents the most common neurologic disorder in the general population including children and is increasingly being recognized as a major source of morbidity in youth related to missed school days and activities. Electronic screens are becoming increasingly important in the lives of preteens and teens. In this review, we discussed effects of electronic screens on primary headache in childhood to emphasize the importance of electronic screen exposure in children with headache. Using digital and social media can bring some benefits and risks for mental and physical health. Time spent on screen-based activities contributes to the chance of reporting general physical complaints, in particular, headache and backache during early adolescence. We suggest that all children with primary headache should be evaluated for abuse of electronic screens in neurology practice. We also think that restriction of electronic screen should be advised in children with migraine and tension type headache before initiation of pharmacotherapy. As online classes are a reality, use of electronic screen may be allowed for school age children up to 2 h\/day with taking time away from digital media every 20 min for 20 sec. In conclusion, we would like to emphasize that limiting the time spent on the screen is important for the reduction of headache symptoms of children and adolescents.","337":"","338":"","339":"","340":"","341":"","342":"","343":"","344":"","345":"","346":"","347":"","348":"","349":"","350":"","351":"","352":"","353":"","354":"","355":"","356":"","357":"Epilepsy is a common neurological condition with varied etiological causes, with temporal lobe epilepsy being the most common. Among the varied etiologies of temporal lobe epilepsy, mesial temporal sclerosis is an important one and it presents as intractable epilepsy. However, we describe here a case of intractable temporal lobe epilepsy with a rather rare etiology, calcifying pseudo neoplasm of neuraxis (CAPNON) syndrome. CAPNON is a rare benign lesion that can occur anywhere in the central nervous system. The thought process till date is to excise any intracranial space occupying lesion to relieve pressure and for a better prognosis, which is not questionable. However, we feel in case of CAPNON, wait and watch protocol can be used to a better effect with radiological and clinical follow-up. Above all surgical excision was primarily done due to imaging confusion over CAPNON and this article comes up with few key findings to clinch the radiological diagnosis of CAPNON.","358":"Scrub typhus is an acute febrile infectious illness caused by rickettsia species Orientia tsutsugamushi. In recent years, scrub typhus has reemerged as a life-threatening disease in India Scrub typhus has diverse clinical manifestations ranging from a nonspecific febrile illness to severe multiorgan dysfunction, and neurological complications are also common. Spectrum of neurological complications varies from common complications such as aseptic meningitis, meningoencephalitis and cerebellitis to rare complications such as myelitis, cerebral hemorrhage, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), and cerebral infarction. Scrub typhus is not a common cause of acute febrile illness in state like Rajasthan, but has emerged as a life-threatening disease in recent years along with dreaded neurological complications.

VZV is not an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-defining illness, but human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a risk factor for atypical and severe complications of VZV reactivation. Here, we present a 70-year-old male, who presented with left upper-limb weakness, preceded by painful dermatomal vesicular eruption, and was diagnosed to have zoster brachial plexopathy. This severe and atypical manifestation of VZV prompted HIV infection testing, leading to a new diagnosis of HIV infection.","360":"Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) is a group of genetic disorders with a progressive extrapyramidal syndrome and excessive iron deposition in the brain, particularly in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra. Mitochondrial membrane protein-associated neurodegeneration (MPAN), a subtype of NBIA, is caused by mutation in the orphan gene C19orf12. A slowly progressive gait disorder from generalized dystonia and spasticity and cognitive impairment constitute the main features of MPAN. The C19orf12 p.Thr11Met mutation is frequent among Turkish patients with MPAN.

This study aimed to evaluate the real-world experience of nusinersen use for patients with a broad spectrum of SMA. We reviewed consecutive patients with SMA treated with nusinersen from April 2018 to April 2020. Data collected included clinical and diagnostic characteristics, molecular genetics, functional motor outcomes, and adverse events. Seven patients including four with SMA type 1 and three with SMA type 2 were treated with nusinersen. The median disease duration at the time of the first dose and the median follow-up duration were 37 months (range: 0.5-254 months) and 6.1 months (range: 2.1-22.1 months), respectively. Of the 41 lumbar punctures (LPs), seven fluoroscopy-guided LPs were successfully performed for two patients without sedation. All patients showed improvement in motor function even though the current tools for motor assessment seemed unable to detect subtle subjective improvement. All patients maintained a stable respiratory status. No patient has experienced a severe adverse event or discontinued treatment so far. Although the number of patients in this study was small, our results suggest that nusinersen is effective even in patients with a later stage of the disease. Additional long-term prospective studies with more number of patients having a broad spectrum of diseases are needed to identify meaningful improvement in the motor function and quality of life after nusinersen treatment.

Various researches have shown that epilepsy patients have vascular risk factors such as abnormal lipids, insulin, elevated oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and subclinical atherosclerosis. The purpose of the present study was to determine serum prolidase enzyme activity as a biomarker in children taking antiepileptic drug treatment through comparison with control cases. The present study group consists of 61 children (20 females, 41 males) with epilepsy and a control group was formed of 32 healthy individuals (14 females, 18 males). Aspectrophotometric method was used to measure serum prolidase enzyme activity. The epilepsy group demonstrated statistically significantly higher prolidase enzyme activity values when compared with the control group (P = 0.003). It was measured that the serum TOS and OSI values were significantly elevated in patients with epilepsy compared to controls (P &lt; 0.001). However, serum TAS values were significantly lower in the epilepsy group than in the control group (P = 0.032). These results supported that epileptic patients taking the antiepileptic treatment had increased serum prolidase enzyme activity, suggesting that it may show an increased risk of subclinical vascular damage related to both chronic inflammation and fibrotic process associated with degenerated collagen turnover. Therefore, serum prolidase enzyme activity could be considered a useful biomarker for evaluation of the subclinical vascular damage in children with epilepsy on some antiepileptic drugs.

Therefore, we planned to conduct a study to assess the clinical profile of migraine, its triggers, comorbidities, and related disability in rural India. An observational study in which 1,245 men and women suffering from migraine were recruited at a tertiary care hospital and were asked to complete a questionnaire related to migraine, its triggers, comorbidities, and disability. Out of 1245 patients, females constituted 75% (937) of the patient pool and rest 25% were males (308). Fatigability (52.7%), nausea\/vomiting (42.7%), phonophobia (33.57%), numbness (28.2%), and vertiginous sensation (20.8%) were accompanying features. Stress was the most common trigger impacting 44.9% of the patient population, followed by noise in 44.3% of cases. Exertion and sleep disturbance acted as triggers in 36.1%, smells in 20.5%, hormonal factors in 11.5%, and visual stimuli in 5.1% of patients. Anxiety was identified as the most common comorbidity affecting 542 patients (43.5%), followed by depression in 25.7%of patients. Around 103 patients (8.2%) had other psychiatric illnesses such as panic disorder and bipolar mood disorder. The migraine-related disability is high; therefore we conducted a study to understand its triggers and clinical profile. This was the first observational study conducted in a tertiary care hospital on migraine in north India catering to a sizeable rural population however, larger population studies are required to understand migraine more exhaustively.

The current standard of care drug therapy for AD is cholinesterase inhibitors, including donepezil. Bacopa monnieri or brahmi is used in traditional Indian medicine for memory loss. We conducted a phase 2b randomized controlled trial (RCT) to find out the efficacy of brahmi and donepezil in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The study was planned as a 52 week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, phase-2 single-center clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of Bacopa monnieri (brahmi) 300 mg OD and donepezil 10 mg OD for 12 months in 48 patients with AD and MCI-AD including cognitive and quality of life outcomes. The primary outcome was differences in the change from baseline of the neuropsychological tests [Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) and postgraduate institute (PGI) memory scale] at 12 months between the intervention group (brahmi) and active comparison group (donepezil). The study was terminated after 3 years and 9 months, after recruiting 34 patients, because of slow recruitment and a high dropout rate. Intention to treat analysis after adjusting for baseline confounders showed no difference in the rate of change in ADAS-Cog score from baseline at any time point, including the last follow-up. There was no difference in the rate of change in PGI Memory scale (PGIMS) at 3, 6, and 9 months. In the last follow-up, there was a significant difference in the change in total PGIMS score between brahmi and donepezil, while there was no difference in individual scores of the PGI memory scale. This phase-2 RCT on the efficacy of brahmi vs. donepezil showed no significant difference between them after 1 year of treatment. Larger phase-3 trials, preferably multicentric, are required to find the superiority of brahmi over donepezil.

Despite an exponential increase in PD cases, not much attention has been paid to enhancing their quality of life (QoL). Thus, this systematic review aims to summarize the available literature for the role of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) intervention to improve QoL of PD patients. Literature review was carried out using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Scopus databases. The key search words were, \"rTMS AND Parkinson AND QoL\", \"rTMS AND Parkinson AND Quality of Life\". Cochrane Collaboration software Revman 5.3 was used to assess the quality of studies. Over 707 studies were identified out of which 5 studies were included which consisted of 160 subjects, 89 male and 71 female, with mean age of 65.04 years. PD type varied from idiopathic PD, rigid, akinetic, tremor dominant to mixed type. The overall risk of bias across the studies was low and unclear with high risk of bias in incomplete outcome data domain in one study. The efficacy of rTMS as an adjunct intervention to enhance QoL of PD patients is uncertain due to dire lack of research in this area. The findings of the present review would help researchers conduct a well-defined, randomized, controlled trial by overcoming the present limitations associated with rTMS intervention to improve QoL of PD patients. ","369":"Status epilepticus (SE) is a common neurological emergency in childhood associated with high mortality and morbidity. Acute management of seizures along with aggressive evaluation for establishing the underlying cause are crucial determinants of outcome. Neonatal status epilepticus carries the burden of poor neurological outcomes and may lead to global developmental delay as well as persistent seizures. The aetiology and pathophysiological mechanisms of SE in neonates and young infants differ compared to older children and adults. The most common causes of SE in neonates includes hypoxic sequelae, ischemic stroke and intracranial haemorrhage. In infants, febrile status epilepticus and acute symptomatic seizures are more common than remote symptomatic causes. Recent advances in neuroimaging modalities and molecular diagnostic techniques have facilitated better diagnostic precision. There is deplorable lack of evidence evaluating management strategies of SE in this age group. In addition to prompt initiation of antiseizure medications, vitamin supplementation needs to be empirically added. Simultaneously, meticulous evaluation to determine cause must also be conducted. In this review, we discuss challenges and an algorithmic approach to the diagnosis and management of SE in neonates and infants.","370":"","371":"","372":"","373":"","374":"","375":"","376":"","377":"","378":"","379":"","380":"","381":"","382":"","383":"","384":"","385":"","386":"","387":"","388":"","389":"","390":"","391":"","392":"Three prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1) degrades single- and double-stranded DNA with 3'-5' exonuclease activity.

In this review, we discussed the progress of evidence-based treatment of VM, including pharmacotherapy and nonmedical methods. A search of the literature was conducted up to September 2019. In order to control or cure VM, patients should follow three steps. First, patients should comply with diet and behavioral medication; Second, during the attack of VM, patients should take medicine to control the symptoms. These acute attack treatment of VM consists of antiemetic medications (e.g., dimenhydrinate and benzodiazepines), anti-vertigo medicine, and analgesics (e.g. triptans). Third, prophylactic medicine (e.g., propranolol, topiramate, valproic aid, lamotrigine, and flunarizine) can be used to reduce the frequency and severity of VM attack.

Three neurologists and two SLPs collaboratively developed the questionnaire. The aim was to probe the issues which were likely to have a bearing upon optimum service delivery to persons with aphasia by a dyad of neurologist and SLP. The survey was set in \"Google Forms\" and sent by \"WhatsApp\" and email to approximately 500 practicing neurologists in India. We employed a nonprobability sampling design for ease of administration with a combination of \"chunk sampling\" and \"snowball sampling.\" Telephonic reminders were made to almost all. We received 100 responses. The mean age of respondents was 50.64 (SD +\/- 12.60) with a range of 28-78 years. The mean number of years of experience as a neurophysician was 19.88 (SD. +\/- 12.72) with range of 1-47 years. Females were only 8%. Apparently, the proportion of neurologists working in large corporate and large public sector institutions from tier one and tier two cities was higher, who are more likely to have SLP and related rehabilitation facilities in their institutions and hence harbor more conducive attitudes to SLT in aphasia. The ground reality from tier three cities and small private and public sector hospital and solo practitioners may be somewhat worse than this. Many responses were in conformity with facts and in tune with desirable attitudes as per guidelines like aphasia being a detrimental factor in stroke recovery, doing assessment of handedness, paying attention to neuroimaging correlations and associated cognitive functions, not resorting to unnecessary pharmacotherapy, being aware about efficacy of SLT, and fairly good chances of recovery. However, many more answers highlighted a need for emphasis in Continuing Medical Education like not being aware about community burden of aphasia in comparison to a few better known neurological diseases, not paying attention to psychosocial aspects apart from biological ones in assessment and rehabilitation, not using a standardized and validated battery, not confidant about role of SLT in chronic stable aphasia and need for longer and intensive therapy, and being unconcerned for the value of advocacy for aphasia, like the role of Self-Help Groups. The thrust areas, pertaining to gaps in perception and practices identified through this study, can be viewed as \"an in-time input.\" We hope that changes in some of the perceptions and practices can be attained through an emphasis on education and training at multiple levels right from the undergraduate to the practicing physicians. A few more themes and domains will need advocacy actions targeted to different stakeholders. ","423":"The main goals were to determine the effectiveness of two commonly used communication-related Quality of Life (QoCL) measures, and the impact of aphasia-related factors on quality of life (QoL) and QoCL in persons with aphasia (PWAs). Twenty-one PWAs ranging from 47 to 91 years of age with post-onset periods of 2 months to 14 years were tested using standardized and criterion-measure tools to assess their language and cognitive functions, QoL, and QoCL. Additionally, participants completed a demographics questionnaire, which also included information on their stroke and the kinds of therapies they had received. Assessments were conducted over two sessions with randomized order of test administrations to control fatigue and order effects. Correlation-matrix was used to determine the strength of relations between test measures. The impact of QoL related factors (viz., aphasia severity, cognitive functioning, time post-onset, and therapy received) on QoCL was examined using ANOVAs. The ASHA Quality of Communication Life Scale (ASHA-QCL) had more significant correlations with other QoL measures than the ASHA-Functional Assessment of Communication Skills (ASHA-FACS). Aphasia severity, cognitive deficits, and therapy received contributed significantly to QoL and QoCL in PWAs. Evaluating overall QoL may not fully reveal the QoCL in PWAs. Measuring QoCL specifically is crucial in aphasia interventions, and it is equally important to use sensitive tools that can capture the QoCL effectively. ASHA-QCL was more effective than ASHA-FACS in capturing the QoCL. QoCL must be considered even when working with PWAs with severe aphasias and\/or mild cognitive deficits. ","424":"Rules and regularities are embedded in all the language structures. Extracting these helps in speech-language acquisition and processing. Sentence processing relies on transitional probability of the dependencies and its distance which are present within the sentence. To investigate the effect of distance between marker agreement dependencies on sentence comprehension in Persons with Aphasia (PWA) and Neuro- Typical Individuals (NTI). Ten PWA and Ten NTI were recruited for the study. Participants whose native language was Kannada (a South Indian Language) and received formal education of minimum 10th grade were selected. A total of 60 Kannada sentences were used and grouped into three categories i.e., short sentence (had short distance between dependencies) (SSD); Longer sentences (had long distance between dependencies) (LLD) and longer sentences (had short distance between dependencies) (LSD). The agreement markers in the sentence were manipulated w.r.t distance among them and grouped it as adjacent (short distance) and non-adjacent (long distance) type of sentences. The participants were instructed to read the sentence and judge whether it is grammatically correct or not by pressing the key corresponding to 'yes' or 'no' on the keyboard. In addition, modified N-back task was administered. Accuracy and reaction time measures were derived for each sentence types. NTI showed better performance than PWA in sentence judgment task. Both the groups, performed poorly on LSD type of sentence when compared to other sentence types. LSD type was more complex due to the syntactic demands placed by the antecedent preposition, pronoun and adverb placed nearer to the verb and also longer distance between subject agreement to the verb. ","425":"Aphasia is a common consequence of stroke. To optimize recovery, it becomes critical as there are early identification and treatment of language deficits. The rising burden of stroke aphasia and lack of screening tools in the Indian context necessitates the need for a screening tool. We aimed to adapt and validate the Frenchay Aphasia Screening Test (FAST) to the Indian context in two widely spoken Indian languages, Telugu and Kannada, for the literate and illiterate population. A systematic process of adaptation and culturally appropriate modifications of the original FAST were done in 116 healthy controls and 115 patients. The validity of the adapted test was established. The optimum cut-off values for detecting aphasia in our sample ranged from 25 to 25.5 (literate) and 13.5 to 15.5 (illiterate) with high sensitivity and specificity. There was also a significant correlation between aphasia scores for adapted FAST and the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB), establishing good convergent validity. Results of the adaptation and validation of two Indian versions of FAST, suggest that it is an easy-to-use screening measure for detecting stroke-related language disabilities. The psychometric properties of the Indian version of FAST met the standardised requirements for adaptation and validation. The Indian version of FAST was found to be a reliable and valid bedside screening tool for aphasia in stroke patients. We aim that this study will facilitate the use of the test across other Indian languages and a large clinical population in the future. ","426":"A standardized set of picture stimuli for neuro-language disorder has been long overdue. To develop a standardized set of 303 pictures for use in experiments of Intensive Language Action Therapy (ILAT). Several sources with standardized picture stimuli having culturally unbiased features were studied. Among those studies two prime sources (1) Snodgrass &amp; Vanderwart (1980), 127 (89+37) items and (2) Neininger &amp; Pulvermuller (2002), 147 (89+56) items were used extensively. Out of 303 stimuli, 89 items were common to both principle sources. An Indian study by George &amp; Mathuranath (2007) has also been taken as an additional source. Line drawing stimuli were standardized on four variables of central relevance to memory and cognitive processing: name agreement, image agreement, familiarity, and visual complexity. All measures related to 303 concepts i.e. % correct, H statistics, familiarity, image agreement and visual complexity were analysed descriptively. Low mean and positive skew on H statistics and visual complexity show that many concepts had a high name agreement (13 concepts have H values of .0, and 55 have H values of 0.68 or below, where 0.68 represents consensus among all but few of the subjects on a picture's name) and were visually simple line drawings. The intercorrelations among the four measures were low, suggesting that they are indices of different attributes of the pictures. Usage of appropriate items\/stimuli has immense potential to influence aphasia therapy outcome. This set of pictures and its normative variable has enhanced the ILAT outcome. It could be generalised for other aphasia therapy too to understand its efficacy. ","427":"In aphasia research, to improve a study's reliability, the aphasia journals compel their authors to report fidelity. Aphasia researchers are mostly concerned about Type I and Type II errors to maintain the level of confidence. However, the third type (Type III error) can significantly affect the study outcomes and question the research fidelity. This study explains the methodology of how investigators maintained research fidelity in the context of hiring and training remote data collectors and conducted a multi-site data collection. The present study used a descriptive analysis design to explicate the three-step process of remote data collection: (1) remotely selecting and training data collectors, (2) remotely supervising data collection and data management, and (3) optimizing and monitoring screening\/assessment fidelity. At the initial step, investigators interviewed seven candidates and short-listed four of them, who were trained using a standard training protocol and participated in a mock data collection. For the next two steps, data collectors video-recorded each study session and e-shared the data with the investigator, who watched all the video-recordings and provided necessary feedback with a focus on the screening sections. The screenings were a part of the inclusion-exclusion criteria. Two data collectors (both clinical psychologists) with the highest scores were selected and received final training. One-to-one e-supervision by the investigator resulted in significant improvement in data collectors' performance. Only 4% of the total collected sample size was excluded, and 99 participants' data were analyzed. The present study adds information on maintaining research fidelity for remote data collection, where limited studies exist. ","428":"Semantic-based treatment is the salient approach used to remediate word retrieval deficits in persons with aphasia (PWAs). It is deemed to improve semantic attributes around the target word, thus aids in restoring word retrieval abilities. Hence, the present study has developed a semantic-based therapy named semantic cueing of verbs and its thematic role (SCVTr). Also, this therapy uses verbs as a core element accompanied by graded levels of semantic cues. The current study Semantic Cueing of Verbs and its Thematic role (SCVTr) aimed to evaluate the effect of word retrieval abilities in PWAs. Three participants (n = 3) with aphasia were recruited for the study. All the participants in the study received SCVTr therapy, and the responses were analyzed at three distinct time points. That is pre-therapy assessment (before initiation of therapy), mid-therapy assessment (10th session), and post-therapy assessment (20th session). Nouns, verbs, and discourse abilities of PWAs were evaluated using standardized test batteries. The study results have discerned positive gains across trained conditions and discourse genres across all the participants. However, participants exhibited marginal gains with untrained stimuli. In addition, SCVTr therapy aids in modifying the error pattern exhibited by PWAs. Concurrently, researchers noted that all participants showed ameliorated performance on the standardized language test batteries during post-therapy evaluation. SCVTr therapy has found to be effective in remediating word retrieval deficits in PWAs. This study extends the knowledge about strengthening the semantic network associated with the target word and its effect on generalization. ","429":"Aphasia is a major disabling condition after a stroke that profoundly affects the quality of life of stroke survivors (SS) and their caregivers. Comprehensive neuropsychological rehabilitation has emerged as a complementary intervention that helps in improving the associated cognitive and psychological deficits and quality of life following a brain injury. A standardized, simple, and easy to administer intervention that can be delivered as a home-based intervention can assist in faster recovery. To describe the development, validation, and feasibility of a home-based, caregiver-delivered comprehensive neuropsychological and language rehabilitation for SS. A culture-specific picture and task-based 8-week training workbook and manual were developed based on extensive review and focused group discussions. This intervention targeted areas of language (comprehension, fluency, and naming) and cognition (working memory, attention and concentration, executive functioning, and response inhibition). It was standardized on 40 healthy controls (HC) and 15 SS. Before recruitment, written informed consent was obtained from each patient, their primary caregiver, and the HCs. All tasks were found to be effective in discriminating the performance of SS from the HC. The performance of the HC with respect to the errors and the time taken for each task was used for the hierarchical arrangement of the tasks. The developed intervention was later validated on 15 SS where they significantly improved in the pre-post assessment of language functioning (P &lt; 0.001), quality of life (P &lt; 0.001), and depression (P &lt; 0.001). This intervention can be feasible to administer as a home-based intervention and may help to alleviate language and neuropsychological complaints after stroke in low-literate or mixed-cultural populations. Further, large sample size studies are recommended. ","430":"Contemporary neuro-imaging techniques have significantly advanced our understanding of the brain organization of language and the involvement of subcortical areas in aphasia. However, articles on sub-cortical aphasia, particularly in non-western languages, remain to be few and far between. We set out to explore aphasia typology in sub-cortical strokes among Bengali-speaking population with a focus towards providing a longitudinal view over a period of 3 months post-stroke. Bengali version of Western Aphasia Battery (BWAB) was used to assess and classify language dysfunction in our study participants. Conventional brain imaging techniques (CT scan &amp; MRI) were used to detect and localize strokes. Uni-variate analysis for categorical variable (location versus aphasia typology) was performed using Chi square and Fischer's exact test (as applicable). Directional measures were calculated using lambda and Goodman-Kruskal tau (Range of - 1 to + 1). Boot strapping was applied while calculating the directional measures because of inadequate numbers in some sub-sections the sample. Frequency of sub-cortical aphasia was observed to be 29.80% (62\/208) in the index study. Four location of strokes were associated with language dysfunction, of which putamen (53.23%) was the commonest followed by striato-capsular region (33.87%). Thalamus and peri-ventricular white matter (PVWM) strokes (6.45% each) were infrequent in our sample of sub-cortical aphasia. Global aphasia (30\/62, 48.38%) was the most frequent type observed in acute phase while Broca's aphasia (23\/53, 43.39%) dominated among the follow up cases. Aphasia recovery (with follow up AQ of 90.0 or more) was observed in 12 (22.64%) patients of whom majority (8\/12) had striato-capsular strokes. The present paper illustrates the epidemiological aspects as well as longitudinal course aphasia following pure sub-cortical strokes. ","431":"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a safe, portable, and inexpensive form of noninvasive brain stimulation that appears to augment the effects of concurrent therapy. However, several methodological issues in existing studies distance tDCS from current clinical practice. In this study, we offered (and administered) tDCS to individuals seeking typical behavioral aphasia therapy on an outpatient basis. We approached clients (n = 10) planning to receive standard aphasia therapy at a university clinic. Following a brief description of tDCS, we offered to provide stimulation during their therapy. Those interested and without contraindications participated in a double-blind, sham-controlled crossover study of tDCS paired with speech-language therapy provided twice weekly. Participants received active (2 mA) or sham tDCS during two eight-week therapy phases (separated by ten weeks) with the anode over Broca's area and the cathode on the contralateral forehead. Stimulation was provided for the first 20 minutes of each one-hour session. Prior to and following each phase, participants were video recorded telling the Cinderella narrative. Recordings were transcribed and analyzed for correct information units (CIUs). Seven individuals (70%) were interested in and eligible for tDCS. Data from four participants who completed the study indicated a large effect size favoring active over sham tDCS (Cohen's d = 1.32). The participant with the most severe deficits did not benefit from therapy in either condition. There is potential for tDCS to enhance meaningful communication outcomes in standard clinical practice. Further investigation is needed to replicate findings and determine individual characteristics predictive of treatment response. ","432":"The services provided and the financial support for research into a health condition is influenced by public awareness of a health condition. There has been a wide range of surveys of the public's and health professional's awareness of aphasia throughout the world to gauge levels of awareness. Findings confirm that awareness of aphasia is universally lower than comparable conditions. To provide a review of international public and health workers' awareness and knowledge of aphasia. A narrative review examining known telephone, internet and face-to-face surveys of aphasia to determine international levels of awareness, knowledge and attempts to raise the awareness of aphasia. Awareness is internationally low and actual knowledge is even lower: 1%-66% for awareness and 5%-17% for actual knowledge. While higher than the public, levels of awareness and knowledge are also low among health professionals. A range of demographic variables, like age, sex and socio-economic status, are significantly associated with levels of awareness. People who have some awareness or knowledge of aphasia have gained it from the media or personal and professional contact with aphasia. Awareness and knowledge of aphasia are low when compared to other communication disorders and comparable neurological conditions, for example, Parkinson's disease. The implications of results for service provision, research funding and awareness-raising programmes are reviewed and further suggestions for awareness-raising are discussed. ","433":null,"434":"The field of language research has seen tremendous progress in the last two decades. Advances in neuro-imaging and stimulation mapping have changed the way we conceive the neural basis of speech and language processing. In the past, the Wernicke-Lichtheim model was the most influential model explaining the neuro-anatomical basis of language. More recently, the concept of dual stream language processing has emerged, wherein separate dorsal and ventral networks are synergistically involved in phonological (sound to articulation) and semantic (sound to meaning) processing respectively. In this review article, we highlight new insights and approaches to the neurobiology of language, across different aspects of language processing like perception, comprehension, production, hemisphere lateralization, role of subcortical structures and effect of damage to language networks.","435":"Dementias with predominant language involvement, called primary progressive aphasias provide us with unique insight into systematic breakdown of language in neurodegenerative diseases and the structures and networks involved. Clinical and neuroimaging models quite distinct from those seen in stroke aphasias have evolved. In this short overview, we will discuss the cognitive processes involved in expressive and receptive verbal communication and how these processes are affected in the different variants of primary progressive aphasia producing distinctive clinical patterns. We will also discuss the brain's language network and how different components of the network break down in each of the primary progressive aphasia variants.","436":"The study of aphasia and the range of allied disorders, that accompany it has provided a rich source of clinical information providing insights in to the complexities of the human brain and how it affects the functioning of the individual, as well as how it influences his experiencing of the world; subsequently verified by more rigorous scientific research. An attempt is made here to document similar clinical insights in to the experiences of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), now known to have atypical neuro development; on the basis of clinical observations and self-reports of these children, vetted by the author's long standing experience of working with those with neurogenic communication disorders, both adult and child. As with the aphasias, these clinical documentations and insights could lead to more carefully controlled research, paving the way for better understanding and interventional support for those with ASD.","437":"To provide a brief review of research literature relating to the current state of knowledge regarding speech and language therapy for people with aphasia and place these research findings within the context of outcome data of non-selected patients receiving usual therapy in the UK. Part 1 presents a literature search aimed at exploring up-to-date information related to the nature and evolution of aphasia, the impact of therapy and the changing nature of therapy. This provides the context of what may be achieved in rehabilitation. Part 2 examines of the impact of speech and language therapy on 1664 prospective patients receiving therapy for aphasia after stroke by 3 different types of service provision was collected and statistically analysed. The Therapy Outcome Measure was used to identify change in impairment, activity, participation and well-being at the beginning and end of therapy. The findings from the non-selected group of patients supports the conclusions of the reported randomised control trials in that speech and language therapy for post stroke aphasia is associated with gains in one or more of the domains of the International Classification of Functioning. ","438":"The use of the randomised controlled trial (RCT) design to evaluate the effectiveness of new interventions in aphasia has increased in recent years in response to calls for high quality evidence of the effectiveness of interventions for this population. This view-point article highlights some of the important considerations when designing a trial for an aphasia intervention, illustrated with decisions made when designing the Big CACTUS RCT for self-managed computer-based word finding therapy in aphasia. Considerations outlined include whether an RCT is needed, readiness for conducting an RCT, choice of comparators, randomisation options, blinding\/masking, selection of outcome measures, pragmatic versus explanatory approaches, and fidelity measurement.","439":"","440":"","441":"","442":"","443":"","444":"","445":"","446":"","447":"","448":"","449":"","450":"","451":"","452":"","453":"","454":"","455":"","456":"We present the case of a 5-year-old girl who had six episodes of meningitis.

We present a case of a 22-year-old male who presented with dysarthria and cerebellar symptoms starting, after 3 months of heroin inhalation. Diagnosis was confirmed to be HSLE after extensive diagnostic testing. HSLE is a rare complication of which the pathogenesis is poorly understood. Clinical history and characteristic findings on magnetic resonance imaging (diffuse, symmetric T2-hyperintensity, and diffusion restriction in frontal, parietal, occipital lobs, basal ganglia, and superior cerebellum) are diagnostic; however, care should be taken to exclude other etiologies. Treatment is primarily supportive; however, there is anecdotal evidence that coenzyme Q10 may be of benefit. The growing number of victims of the opioid crisis requires that physicians be aware of and counsel patients on the devastating neurological complications that can occur with abuse of these drugs.","458":"A 24-year-old female presented with wasting and weakness of both hands and fasciculations over the chin since 12 years, followed by imbalance while walking and speech changes since 10 years. Her 12-year-old sister also had a similar clinical presentation. There were fasciculations over the chin, tongue, hands, back, thighs with wasting and weakness in tongue, and C7, C8, T1 segments in both upper limbs along with bipyramidal signs. There was limb and gait ataxia. Magnetic resonance imaging brain showed pancerebellar atrophy, and electromyography was suggestive of anterior horn cell involvement in bulbar, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar segments. Next-generation sequencing identified a novel likely pathogenic deletion mutation: chr6:152527389_152527399del, c.22711_22721del, and p.Ala7571ArgfsTer4 in exon 125 of synaptic nuclear envelope protein 1 (SYNE1) gene. This mutation leads to frameshift and premature termination of the protein 'Nesprin 1'. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-like presentation followed by cerebellar ataxia have been described with SYNE1 ataxia. This unique phenotype and novel deletion mutation of SYNE1 gene is the first case reported from India.","459":"Normal-sized ventricles and absence of papilledema do not rule out shunt failure and raised intracranial pressure (ICP). Raised ICP can present with false localizing signs which may be cranial nerve palsies or extensive polyradiculopathy. Our patient with a history of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt presented with rapidly progressive vision loss without papilledema, as well as multiple cranial nerve palsies and radiculopathy. Imaging did not reveal hydrocephalus, however, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) manometry revealed high CSF opening pressure. After lumbar thecoperitoneal shunting, vision did not improve, but the rest of cranial nerve palsies and radiculopathy improved. In a patient in whom VP shunt is in situ, headache and vomiting should prompt evaluation for raised ICP though there is no ventriculomegaly of papilledema. Vision can be saved if raised ICP is suspected, CSF opening pressure measured at presentation and prompt surgery is performed.","460":"Neurosarcoidosis (NS) is a chronic disease with a diverse clinical spectrum, therapeutic response, and outcome. There is scarce literature from our country regarding the same. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical spectrum, therapeutic responses, and outcomes of NS in an Indian cohort. In a cross-sectional study, we included all patients with NS treated at a quaternary care teaching hospital in India from January 2007 to October 2019. Patients older than 18 years of age fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for NS from the Neurosarcoidosis Consortium Consensus Group were included in the study. The therapeutic response and the degree of disability at last follow-up were assessed. We identified 48 patients, among them 3 were categorized as having definite NS, 30 probable NS, and 15 possible NS. Cranial neuropathy was the most common presentation (47.9%), followed by myelopathy (25%). Systemic involvement was identified in 95.83% and mediastinal lymph nodes were the most common site. Clinical improvement was seen in 65.8% and disease stabilized in 28.9%, while 5.26% deteriorated. Fifty percent recovered without any residual disability, while 26.3% had minor and 23.7% had major residual sequelae. NS is a diverse illness, with a heterogeneous spectrum of clinical presentation, treatment response, and outcome. Cranial neuropathy is the most common presenting feature and has a good prognosis while myelopathy has an unfavorable prognosis. Meningeal and brain parenchymal disease is difficult to diagnose accurately unless systemic involvement is present. The diagnosis of NS should be clinically suspected in the appropriate clinical setting, the presence of systemic involvement should be investigated, and histologic confirmation should be attempted.

We wanted to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological status, quality of life (QoL) and quality of sleep (QoS) of myasthenia gravis (MG) patients. Data on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of MG were collected. We used a self-designed questionnaire (consisting of 12 questions), a revised 15-item Myasthenia Gravis Quality of Life Questionnaire (MGQOL15r), a 36-item health survey of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF36), Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), Hamilton scales for the assessment of anxiety (HAM-A), and depression (HAMD) were used. We reassessed patients who were tested three years ago using the same questionnaires. The study included 64 MG patients.

MGQOL15r, SF36, and PSQI scores correlate with severe clinical manifestation, high scores on HAM-A and HAM-D (P &lt; 0.01). Higher scores on HAM-D and fear that MG symptoms will be worse if the patient gets an upper respiratory infection were independent predictors of the lower SF36 scores. Regarding MGQOL15r-independent predictors of the higher score were higher scores on HAM-D.

The aim of this study is to find out the possible association of APOE polymorphism in stroke patients in ethnic Bengali population. A prospective case-control study was undertaken in the Department of Neurology, Burdwan Medical College, Burdwan, West Bengal, India, over a period of 3 years. We collected 10 ml venous blood samples from 148 clinically and radiologically diagnosed acute stroke patients (80 of ischemic stroke and 68 of intracerebral hemorrhage) and consecutive 108 ethnic age- and sex-matched controls, in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid vials after informed written consent. Genomic DNA was prepared at S.N. Pradhan Centre of Neurosciences, University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India. Exotic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs429358, rs 7412) were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism for genotype of APOE. The frequencies of different APOE allele among 80 ischemic stroke patients were 5.6% (n = 9) for E2, 75.68% (n = 121) for E3, and 18.7% (n = 30) for E4. The E3 allele is significantly over-represented (P = 0.004) in controls compared to the patients (88% in controls vs 75.6% ischemic stroke patients and 80% hemorrhagic patients). A significantly high frequency of APOE4 allele was observed in ischemic (18.7%) and hemorrhagic patients (11%) compared to controls (8%). The E4 allele plays a major risk for developing ischemic stroke [odds ratio (OR) = 2.744; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.43-5.10] and E3 plays a protective role for hemorrhagic stroke (OR = 0.53; 95% CI: 0.29-0.96), while E4 allele plays a nonsignificant (P = 0.31) increase in trend in hemorrhage stroke (OR = 1.4).

Generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) was used to screen the best interaction combination among four SNPs within MTHFR gene and smoking or alcohol drinking. The frequency of the rs4846049-A allele was 28.6% in IS patients and 19.1% in normal controls, in addition, the frequency of the rs3737967-T allele was 27.9% in IS patients and 20.3% in normal controls, which was also indicating a statistically significant difference. The rs4846049-A and rs3737967-T were associated with an increased risk of IS risk; adjusted odds ratios (ORs) (95% confidence interval [CI]) were 1.76 (1.28-2.13) and 1.51 (1.13-1.97), respectively. GMDR model found significant gene-alcohol drinking interaction combination, but no significant gene-tobacco smoking interaction combinations. In order to obtain the odds ratios and 95% CI for the joint effects of gene-alcohol drinking on IS, we conducted stratified analysis for interaction effect using logistic regression. We found that alcohol drinkers with rs4846049-CA\/AA genotype also have the highest IS risk, compared with never drinkers with rs4846049-CC genotype, OR (95% CI) = 3.12 (1.83-4.45), after adjustment for age, smoke, and smoking status. The rs4846049-A and rs3737967-T, gene-environment interaction between rs1764391 and rs918592, gene-environment interaction between rs4846049 and alcohol drinking were all associated with increased IS risk.

In this study, we describe the clinical profile, diagnosis, and management of patients with CVT secondary to an infectious aetiology. This retrospective study included all adult patients over 15 years (1 January 2002 to 1 January 2017). Adult patients with a diagnosis of infective CVT secondary to bacterial infections were included in the study. Totally, 22 patients were identified with CVT complicating bacterial infections. The focus of infection in 12 (54.54%) patients was pyogenic meningitis, 9 (40.9%) patients had a parameningeal focus and one patient developed CVT secondary to bacterial sepsis from a remote focus. Fever was the most common symptom seen in 77.3% followed by headache and depressed sensorium in 72.7% and 63.6%, respectively. The most common organism in the meningitis group was Streptococcus species, and in the parameningeal group was Staphylococcus aureus. At presentation MRI identified CVT in all 7 patients as compared to CT brain with contrast in 2\/3 (66.6%). Transverse sinus was the most commonly involved sinus in meningitis. All patients were treated with appropriate antibiotics and anticoagulation was used in 50% of the patients. The in hospital, mortaility was 9%. Septic CVT, though rare can be a complication of bacterial meningitis and facial infections. Clinical symptoms that suggest a co-existing CVT should be identified and diagnosed at the earliest. The mainstay of treatment is antibiotics; the role of anticoagulation is controversial. ","470":"The COVID-19 pandemic is raging across the world, affecting 212 Countries and Territories around the world. It has infected more than 3.7 million people with a mortality rate of around 7%. Although the causative virus, the SARS-CoV-2 is primarily a respiratory pathogen, recent observational studies have documented a high rate of neurological complications associated with COVID-19. We searched PubMed databases from December 01, 2019 to June 9, 2020 for articles published on \"COVID 19\" OR \"coronavirus\" with targeted search words. We also search preprint servers for neurological complications of COVID-19. Neurological manifestations are seen in around 36%-45% of patients with COVID-19 and can involve almost every part of the central nervous system (CNS) from the hemispheres, cranial or peripheral nerves, spinal cord, and muscle. The mechanisms vary from direct viral invasion of the CNS, to a dysregulated host immune response to molecular mimicry to multiorgan dysfunction. In many patients, neurological manifestations preceded other systemic features or the diagnosis of COVID-19. Sick patients with COVID-19 will require ICU care and many patients may present first to the neurocritical care ICU and receive a diagnosis of COVID-19 later. Hence, it is important for all healthcare personnel to be aware of the myriad neurological manifestations of this infection, so as to initiate appropriate infection control practices and refine investigation and treatment protocols.","471":"Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders that cause muscle weakness and also have extramuscular manifestations involving various organ systems; namely the lung, skin, heart, and joints. Previously classified broadly as dermatomyositis (DM) and polymyositis now the spectrum of the disease has evolved into more clinical subtypes. There are now five clinicoserological subtypes recognized worldwide DM, antisynthetase syndrome (AS), overlap myositis (OM), immune mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), and inclusion body myositis. Each of these subtypes has a unique phenotype and specific antibodies associated. With the evolving treatment options from the use of immunosuppressive medications to the use of targeted therapy with biologic agents, and further understanding of the pathogenesis of inflammatory myositis, we may have more effective treatment options. We discuss in this review, various myositis-associated antibodies associated with each clinicoserological subtype of IIM and their role. We also describe the evolving therapies and the evidence for the newer biologic therapies in the treatment of IIMs.","472":"Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal, often repetitive movements, postures, or both. Dystonic movements are typically patterned, associated with twisting of body parts, and may have tremulousness. Dystonia is usually initiated or worsened by voluntary action and associated with overflow muscle activation. Cervical dystonia (CD) is the most prevalent form of dystonia. CD is a condition characterized by cranial muscle overactivity leading to abnormal intermittent or continuous posturing of the head. Non-motor symptoms are comorbidity of dystonia, which significantly hampers the quality of life among these patients. The symptoms can be as a result of the dystonia itself. However, studies have highlighted the involvement of cortical-striatal-thalamocortical circuits in primary dystonia that could be the pathophysiological basis for the non-motor symptoms. The non-motor symptoms that are commonly associated with dystonia are anxiety, depression, restless leg syndrome, excessive daytime sleepiness, cognitive disturbances, and poor sleep. This review attempts to summarize the literature on non-motor symptoms in patients with CD.","473":"Spinal tuberculosis is the most common form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. It is of great importance to neurologists because of the potentially devastating complication of paraplegia, which may set in during active disease or the healed phase. Due to the deep-seated nature of the disease, definitive diagnosis is often challenging. There is no clear consensus on the appropriate duration of therapy for spinal tuberculosis, with various guidelines recommending treatment from as short as 6 months to up to 18 months. In this article, we present a critical appraisal of the evidence on the same. In our opinion, the duration of antitubercular therapy needs to be individualized and the decision to terminate therapy should be multifactorial (clinical, radiological, pathological\/microbiological where possible) rather than being enmeshed within any particular guideline.","474":"COVID-19 has a wide-ranging and multimodal neurological impact. First, several neurological symptoms and complications are commonly observed in patients with COVID-19. Second, medications and vaccinations used to counter the disease can have secondary neurological effects. Third, patients with pre-existing neurological disorders bear an increased health-risk due to COVID-19. And finally, the pandemic has disrupted the delivery of neurological and vaccination services, and associated educational and research programs. In this article we review the various channels through which the pandemic is known or projected to effect individual patients or the practice of neurology. We also provide recommendations to manage its immediate effects and prepare for the longer-term fall-out.","475":"Medical training programs are witnessing immense disruptions worldwide due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Keeping in mind the trainees' future prospects, it is important to provide continuity of teaching and timely certification assessments. Overcoming the obstacles to routine functioning presented by SARS-CoV-2 spread, we recently conducted the DM Neurology exit examination in a hybrid virtual format. We created a curated case repository with history and clinical examination findings followed by structured questions that could be built upon for case discussions. The external examiners assessed the candidates virtually through a video conferencing platform. The end results were well accepted by all key stake holders.

We report three patients from two unrelated families, diagnosed with GAMT deficiency on next-generation sequencing. All the probands had happy predisposition as a predominant manifestation in addition to the reported features of global developmental delay, seizures, and microcephaly. This further expands the phenotype of CCDS. The workup for creatine deficiency disorder should be included in the diagnostic algorithm for children with nonsyndromic intellectual disability, especially in those with a happy demeanor. These cases exemplify the utility of magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the brain in the workup of nonsyndromic intellectual disability to diagnose a potentially treatable disorder. In addition, documentation of low serum creatinine may be supportive. Early diagnosis and treatment is essential for better prognosis.","519":"Onabotulinum toxin A (botulinum A toxin) is utilized to extend flexed extremities in spastic hemiparesis. Injection points are important to obtain a better effect. Injecting botulinum A toxin into the forearm muscles is a standard method for flexed wrist and fingers; however, we developed new injection points in the intrinsic muscles of the hand to acquire more reliable effect. The authors injected botulinum A toxin into the palmar side of the proximal and middle phalanx of each finger and thenar muscles. Eight patients with poststroke flexed wrist and fingers were treated by this method. In all patients, the spasticity improved to 0 or 1 from 3 or 4 in Modified Modified Ashworth Scale 1 month after the treatment. They were satisfied with our treatment because they could keep their affected fingers hygienic by washing fingers cleanly after the treatment. Our botulinum A toxin injection points for finger spastic paralysis are accurate spots producing great effect to flexed fingers.

It is diagnosed in the presence of fever with cardiovascular, central nervous system, and gastrointestinal complications. Only a few reports of acute flaccid quadriplegic thyrotoxic myopathy (TM) with TS have been reported. However, muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in TM have not been yet been reported. Our patient underwent muscle MRI and showed some unusual features. These are discussed in this article.","521":"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second-most common neurodegenerative disorder known primarily by its motor symptomatology. These motor manifestations are also hypothesised to affect the respiratory muscular function of PD patients contributing to restrictive pattern of ventilatory dysfunction. Previous reports attempting to detect these abnormalities through spirometric assessments have been inconclusive. Attempts at reversal of the restrictive abnormalities by levodopa therapy too, have yielded conflicting results. This study aims to classify spirometric abnormalities in asymptomatic PD patients after levopopa withdrawal and document changes after levodopa replacement. Thirty-six non-smoker PD patients without pre-existing respiratory abnormalities were enrolled. Their standard spirometric values- FEV1, FVC and FEV1\/FVC, were noted before and after their morning levodopa dose. Nineteen patients had abnormal PFT values at baseline - 14 restrictive and 5 obstructive defects. Fourteen patients showed improvement in their pulmonary performances after dopamine administration with 6 showing complete reversibility. Statistically significant improvement in the post-levodopa FVC values was seen in patients with restrictive disorder (P value=0.04) but not for obstructive disorders. This pilot study characterised that 39% of PD patients had restrictive ventilatory defects prior to morning dopamine administration. Of these, 40% showed improvement after levodopa administration. Restrictive defects are common in PD patients which are evident on routine spirometric screening. These defects are reversible on levodopa administration. ","522":"Movement disorders are one of the important neurological manifestations of inherited metabolic disorders. Important clues to the presence of an underlying inborn error of metabolism are early onset, presence of neuroregression or degeneration, parental consanguinity, sibling affection, paroxysmal events, waxing and waning course, skin or hair changes, absence of a perinatal insult or any structural cause, and presence of identifiable triggers. It is particularly important to recognize this class of movement disorders as several of them are eminently treatable and may often need disease-specific therapy besides symptomatic treatment. The current review focusses on the movement disorders associated with inherited metabolic defects in children, with emphasis on treatable disorders.","523":"Movement disorders in childhood comprise a heterogeneous group of conditions that lead to impairment of voluntary movement, abnormal postures, or inserted involuntary movements. Movement disorders in children are frequently caused by metabolic disorders, both inherited and acquired. Many of these respond to vitamin supplementation. Examples include infantile tremor syndrome, biotinidase deficiency, biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease, pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, aromatic amino acid decarboxylase deficiency, ataxia with vitamin E deficiency, abetalipoproteinemia, cerebral folate deficiency, and cobalamin metabolism defects. Recognition of these disorders by pediatricians and neurologists is imperative as they are easily treated by vitamin supplementation. In this review, we discuss vitamin-responsive movement disorders in children.","524":"Stroke is a serious neurological comorbidity observed during the ongoing COVID-19 (coronavirus associated disease 2019) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome, corona virus 2) and includes ischemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage and cerebral venous thrombosis. We reviewed factors that could potentially contribute to the occurrence of stroke among patients with COVID-19. There could be an interaction between the conventional risk factors of stroke, infection, systemic inflammatory response and plaque destabilisation. Inflammatory markers, D-dimer elevation and increased cytokine activity have been observed in patients with COVID-19. Other probable contributing factors include cardiac injury leading to embolism, a prothrombotic state and a possibility of direct neuroinvasive potential causing vasculopathy. Data from stroke patients gathered in large multicentric cohorts could help shed more light on the occurrence, behaviour, aetiology, pathophysiology, biomarkers and outcomes of stroke occurring during the ongoing pandemic.","525":"Palliative care is an important area of intervention in neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this study is to understand the relationship between Palliative Care Needs and Caregiver Burden among persons diagnosed with neurodegenerative diseases. A cross-sectional study design was adopted to explore the research problem. A prospective sample of 120 participants (60 Patient Caregiver dyads) of Motor Neurone Disease (MND) and Parkinson's disease (PD) were recruited for the study based on inclusion and exclusion criteria from a quaternary referral care centre for neurology in south India. Patients seeking care were recruited for the study consecutively. Palliative care outcome scale and Zarit Burden Interview scale were administered to understand the relationship. It was found that Palliative care outcomes score was positively correlated with caregiver burden (r = 0.597), showing that there is a bi-directional relationship between palliative care needs and caregiver burden. Irrespective of the differences in illness characteristics, the study found that palliative care needs are high among chronic neurological conditions which requires a noncategorical psychosocial approach in ensuring care. ","526":"To study the effect of dual tasking and deep brain stimulation frequency parameters on gait in advanced Parkinson's disease. This is an open label interventional study evaluating 40 post STN-DBS patients with gait disturbances. All patients were diagnosed as PD by a movement disorder specialist using the United Kingdom Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank (UKPDSBB) criteria. Patients underwent bilateral subthalamic deep brain stimulation by a qualified neurosurgeon. Patients were managed on a combination of dopamine replacement therapy as well as deep brain stimulation. Patients were assessed by stand walk sit (SWS) test for a 5 meter distance and FOG scoring during medication 'ON' state and device \"ON\" state, at four frequencies 180, 130, 90, 60 HZ and device \"OFF\" state. Out of 40 patients, 38 patients showed a significant improvement in gait at a single frequency (best response frequency) which is different for each patient. The mean FOG score showed significant improvement at all stimulation frequencies when compared to OFF stimulation (P &lt; 0.05). The mean number of steps was 18.9 at best response frequency and 21.48 at 130 Hz (P &lt; 0.0001). Number of freezing episodes also were significantly less with best frequency when compared to 130 Hz stimulation (0.28 and 0.65 respectively, (P &lt; 0.0001). The mean FOG score was 6.45 at best frequency and 9.48 at 130 Hz (P &lt; 0.0001). Mean Dual tasking score was 3.53 at best frequency and 5.15 at 130 Hz (P &lt; 0.0002). Optimization of frequency setting for each patient can improve gait and that each patient may have a different optimal frequency. ","527":"Brain abscess is a serious and dreadful disease presenting at tertiary centre. The objective of this study was to look into the clinical profile, predisposing conditions, microbiology and outcome of children suffering from brain abscess. 30 children up to 18 years with clinical and imaging evidence of brain abscess were taken for study. Patients were stabilized as per unit protocol. Necessary investigations were carried out. Neuroimaging (CT or MRI) was used to confirm the diagnosis. All parameters (clinical, investigation, outcome) were recorded in predesigned performa. Neurosurgery consultation was sought in patients with multiple abscesses, posterior fossa abscesses, abscess with air-fluid level and causing midline shift. There were 16 males with 13 patients in age group (5-10 years). Mean duration of stay in hospital was 14.8 days. Most common predisposing factor was chronic suppurative otitis media (n-15). Typically, patients presented with fever, headache and seizures. On examination, motor deficits were the most common followed by signs of meningitis. Computerized tomography confirmed the diagnosis in most cases. Temporal lobe (n-11) was the commonest intracranial site for the abscess. Methicillin resistant staphylococcus and proteus mirabilis were the common pathogen isolated from blood and pus. Blood culture positivity rate was 16.7% and pus culture positivity rate was 25%. All cases were managed with intravenous antibiotics and aspiration (n-10) and excision (n-6). There were 5 deaths. There was complete immediate recovery in 13 cases with residual motor deficit in 12 cases. Brain abscess is a rare but serious entity in children. Late diagnosis and improper management leads to poor outcome. Early surgical intervention is helpful. Threshold for diagnosis should be low in children with chronic ear infection and congenital heart diseases.

Generally, it presents at adulthood with dementia, motor impairment, extrapyramidal abnormalities, and epilepsy. Definitive diagnosis is made by brain biopsy. Neuroimaging studies have revealed confluent white matter lesions predominantly in the frontal lobes, corpus callosum, and corticospinal tracts on conventional magnetic resonance imaging. Only a few reports showed diffusion restriction in the cerebral white matter; furthermore, rarer reports emphasized persistent foci of diffusion restriction as a diagnostic imaging marker. Herein, we have aimed to illustrate the first biopsy-proven Turkish HDLS pedigree consisting of 18 persons in 3 generations which contained 4 affected individuals. Four individuals in the pedigree of HDLS [two affected patients (patient III-1 and patient III-2) and two unaffected individuals (patient II-4 and patient III-5)] were investigated with conventional MRI and Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) using 1.5 Tesla (T) scanner. All four individuals were evaluated via neurological examinations and Mini-Mental State Examination. Brain biopsy study was performed on patient III-2. Finally, an extensive literature review involving pathology investigations and neuroimaging studies of HDLS patients was conducted. DWIs of two investigated patients showed deep white matter lesions with persistent diffusion restriction. Computed tomography imaging showed punctate mineralization in the lesions. Biopsy specimens of patient III-2 demonstrated axonal spheroids which were typical for HDLS. Via the presentation of our pedigree and literature review, we suggest HDSL as a first-line differential diagnosis in patients with undiagnosed adult-onset familial leukoencephalopathy, in particular, those with MRI lesions of frontal white matter and centrum semiovale associated with foci of diffusion restriction and mineralization. Finally, we think that the persistence of the diffusion restriction in deep white matter lesions should be kept in mind as a crucial neuroimaging sign for HDLS.

Non-motor symptoms (NMS) are also seen in PD, which inevitably emerge through the disease progression and are often under-recognized and untargeted. We studied the prevalence of NMS in PD and their impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). A cross-sectional observational study from January 2017 to July 2017 of PD patients (n = 100) was done. NMS and HRQoL are measured using NMS scoring scale; PD questionnaire-39 and Hoehn and Yahr scale, respectively. Motor symptoms were assessed using scales for outcome in Parkinson's disease (SCoPA) - motor scoring scale. Descriptive statistics calculated for NMS' prevalence. Continuous variables were assessed by two-tailed t-test and discrete and categorical variables by chi-square test. Multiple linear regression analysis was done among scoring scales to identify the influence on 39-item Parkinson's disease questionnaire (PDQ-39) scoring scale. All statistical data collected are analyzed with SSPS software version- 20 for windows. In 100 study population, 66 were males and 34 females. The mean age was 68.35 years and median onset of duration of PD was 3.49 with 64.6% on treatment. Fatigue, pain, and lightheadedness were more prevalent NMS with 78%, 75%, and 69%, respectively. With regression analysis, strongest predictor was NMSS score (P = 0.000), with each unit increase, it is associated with nearly 0.65 increase in PDQ-39 score. Though motor symptoms define the disease, NMS have a larger impact on HRQoL in PD and on caregiver's life. Understanding the pattern and effect of NMS is needed for targeted treatment strategies.

We compared risk factors, treatments, and outcomes among consecutive patients with symptomatic ICAD from India with a mixed-ethnic cohort from Chicago, Illinois. Consecutive patients with symptomatic ICAD were enrolled at 2 academic medical centers in Kerala, India and Chicago, United States. Data on demographics, risk factors, initial stroke severity (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score [NIHSS]), recurrent stroke, and 3-month functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS]) were prospectively collected. Recurrent stroke was defined as symptomatic recurrence of focal neurologic deficits associated with radiographic evidence of new cerebral infarction within 3 months of index admission. 329 patients (117 from Kerala, 212 from Chicago) were included. Indian patients were younger (61 vs. 68, P &lt; 0.001), less frequently had prior stroke history (15.4 vs. 32.5%, P = 0.001) and coronary artery disease (11.1 vs. 22.2%, P = 0.013) but had higher initial NIHSS score (median 6 vs. 3, P &lt; 0.001). Both groups received reperfusion therapy in similar proportions (8.5 vs. 7.1%, P = 0.630) but at discharge, 90.6% of Indian patients compared to 59.0% of Chicago patients were treated with dual antiplatelet therapy. More recurrent strokes occurred in Chicago patients (21.7 vs. 1.9%, P &lt; 0.001) but functional outcome did not differ significantly. Compared to patients in US with symptomatic ICAD, Indian patients were younger and had more severe strokes. However, Indian patients had lower rates of recurrent stroke, perhaps due to greater use of dual antiplatelet therapy.

There have been reports linking haemorrhagic strokes to SARS-CoV-2 infection during this pandemic, which lead us to evaluate if SARS-CoV-2 infection could be associated with increased risk of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). A retrospective observational study evaluating all stroke cases admitted in our centre in the past one month. More than half (56%) had ICH, compared to 22% last year. Two patients with ICH were SARS-CoV-2 positive and they had no or mild respiratory symptoms and had higher occurrence of renal dysfunction.

Radial amplitude ratio was calculated. Stata 12.1 statistical program was used. Lower limit of SRAR was obtained (mean-2SD of transformed data). ANOVA defined the intergroup variability, and linear regression and Pearson's correlation assessed the statistical significance. The lower limit of normal SRAR, for each age group is as follows: a: 0.30, b: 0.23, c: 0.20, d: 0.17, e: 0.17, and f: 0.08. SRAR of groups a, b, c was significantly different from groups e and f. Similarly, SRAR was significantly different between groups d and f but not between groups d and e or a, b, c, d. This study provides age-stratified reference data for SRAR.

We review the bearing of the 2019 NCoV infection on neurological practice. Neurological manifestations are less common than respiratory manifestations, yet conspicuous, affecting nearly over a third of hospitalized individuals. These may be classified in to early - headache, dizziness, hyposmia and hypogeusia and late - encephalopathy. Rarely but surely, a very small proportion of infected individuals might present with stroke. Certain neurological conditions, including cerebrovascular disease in both China and Italy and dementia in Italy predispose to infection and more severe manifestations, requiring intensive care unit admission. There is no convincing evidence that the manifestations, course and outcome of various neurological disorders is impacted by 2019 nCoV infection. Concerns of an increased risk of febrile seizures offset by a reduced frequency of infection in the paediatric age group. Individuals with multiple sclerosis might potentially experience both true and pseudorelapses. Besides a direct effect, 2019 nCoV has tremendously affected neurological care by disrupting the continuity of care and the availability of neurological medicines worldwide. Neurologists should respond to this challenge by developing and sustaining innovative methods of providing care as well as alerting the society at large to adopt measures to contain the spread of 2019 nCoV.","547":"The 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV) pandemic is rapidly developing across the globe and new information is emerging expeditiously and constantly, particularly in relation to neurological illnesses.

Varying degrees of olfactory disturbances may pre-empt the diagnosis of COVID-19. Although no direct effect of 2019 nCoV has been reported yet on Parkinson's disease, there are enormous possible indirect effects and implications. We examine the potential effects and challenges posed by this pandemic to individuals with Parkinson's disease, particularly in the Indian context where telecommunication access or support group access may be lacking for these patients.

Striational antibodies have been associated with myasthenia gravis but a mixed movement disorder has been rarely reported with this antibody. We report a 90-year-old female who presented with generalized chorea, blepharospasm, and parkinsonism. Extensive evaluation was done which showed an elevation in striational antibody and there was no evidence of malignancy. The patient responded dramatically to intravenous steroids. We suggest that striational antibody should be routinely tested as a part of the work-up for autoimmune or paraneo lastic movement disorder. The presence of chorea in a very elderly patient should not be dismissed as \"senile chorea\" and a search for treatabl etiology should always be performed.","558":"For the first time, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated vacuolar myelopathy (VM) was detailed in an autopsy-based study of 89 cases in 1985. This condition is the most common cause for spinal cord lesions in HIV patients. VM's pathogenic mechanism remains unclear; however, it is assumed that the disease can be related to both, the direct neurotoxic impact of the HIV and HIV-induced activation of immunopathological processes in the central nervous system (CNS). Reviewed in this paper is a case where the VM presentation deteriorated drastically when treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy, and almost completely regressed after the patient received the intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment. The considered case demonstrates the viability of IVIg treatment in patients with HIV-associated CNS pathology, particularly when autoimmune reactions are suspected. The results of placebo-controlled studies of IVIg in patients with HIV-associated myelopathy may give a reliable evaluation of IVIg use in this context.","559":null,"560":"Chorea is one of the disabling movement disorders, and the number of drugs which can treat this disorder effectively is limited. Tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine are the two drugs approved by the US-FDA for the treatment of chorea associated with HD. Levodopa can improve chorea in some disorders, and this review aims to provide information on the use of levodopa in chorea. A literature search was performed in February 2019 using the following terms \"levodopa chorea,\" \"levodopa TITF-1,\" levodopa brain-lung-thyroid syndrome,\" and \"levodopa Huntington's Disease.\" The information regarding the etiology, outcome, and dose of levodopa was collected. We found a total of 18 cases in the literature where the benefit was reported with levodopa. Majority of the cases were brain-thyroid-lung (BTL) syndrome (50%). Another 5 cases were HD (Huntington's Disease), one with PCH type 2 (Pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 2), one with meningovascular syphilis, and two patients with Sydenham chorea. The patients with BTL syndrome responded to a very low dose of levodopa. This review suggests that levodopa has the potential to improve chorea in BTL syndrome while its use in chorea due to other disorders requires further study. BTL syndrome due to NKX2-1 mutation responded to levodopa while we did not find any case of chorea due to ADCY-5 mutation responding to levodopa.

The clinical manifestations are heterogeneous and the main features include early onset seizure, generalized or focal seizures sensitive to fever, and brief seizures occurring in clusters. The disorders exhibit a unique and unusual X-linked pattern of expression. We aimed to investigate PCDH19 mutations\/deletions in patients with epilepsy and describe the clinical\/molecular features. PCDH19 gene was analyzed in 35 Turkish female patients from 34 families with early-onset epilepsy via direct sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis. Additionally, array comparative genomic hybridization analysis was performed in patients with whole gene deletion. We identified 2 different heterozygous mutations in 2 unrelated probands (5. 7%) which were located in exon 1. Additionally, whole gene deletions were detected in dizygotic twin girls (5. 7%), who had distinct clinical features and the deletion was inherited from the unaffected father. The second twin suffered more severe clinical manifestations including autistic features, behavioral problems, mild-moderate mental retardation and seizures, which were under control with multidrug regimen when compared with the first twin. PCDH19 is a major causative gene in patients with epilepsy and further data is required to gain a better understanding of phenotype-genotype correlation. In addition to gene sequencing, deletion\/duplication analysis will improve the molecular diagnosis in patients with clinical findings.

The aim is to study the recurrence and role of steroid-sparing agents in THS. All cases of THS treated at a tertiary-level teaching hospital during a 10-year period were studied. Clinical and radiological profile, response to treatment and recurrences were noted. A total of 44 cases were studied. The mean age was 49.5 years, Males constituted 23\/44 (52%). The first symptom was pain in 90%. Ptosis with ophthalmoplegia was the most common deficit 29\/44 (66%). Lesions confined to cavernous sinus 27\/44 (61%) was the most frequent magnetic resonance imaging finding. All patients received steroids as the initial treatment and 15\/44 (34%) received steroid-sparing agents. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 120 months (Mean 39 months). Two patients had alternative diagnosis of leptomeningeal malignancy and hypertrophic pachymeningitis on follow-up. Recurrences occurred in 18\/37 (48.6%). Time for recurrence varied from 8 months to 7 years. (Mean 18 months). No clinical or radiological predictors for recurrence were identified. Patients who received steroid-sparing agents had a significantly lower recurrence 3\/15 (20%) versus 14\/26 (53.8%)P &lt; 0.034. Around 50% of patients with THS can have recurrence. Steroid-sparing agents appear to prevent recurrence.

This cross sectional study selected patients of HD after genetic confirmation of expanded CAG repeats in Huntingtin (HTT) gene. We performed detail clinical evaluation including cognitive and neuropsychological assessment, and imaging of brain. This study included 75 patients (male: 57.3%; female: 42.7%). Mean age at onset was 37.12 (range 16-62) years; juvenile variety (onset below 20 years) was detected in 5.3%. Paternal transmission was commoner. Manifestations at onset were motor in 81.3% patients, behavioral in 10.7% and cognitive impairment in 8%. After chorea, next common movement disorder was dystonia. Frontal lobe dysfunction was found in 77.3% patients. Behavioral disturbances were observed in 77.3% patients and commonly manifested as depression, irritable behavior and anxiety. Among the three onset groups (motor\/behavioral\/cognitive), there was no significant difference regarding age at onset, gender distribution, pattern of inheritance (paternal\/maternal), and at the time of evaluation, all groups had essentially similar pattern of clinical features. Mean CAG repeat of the patients was 48.25 (range 40-79). Our study showed some differing clinical characteristics compared to previous studies from the Indian subcontinent. Clinical features in our study showed differences from previous studies from the Indian subcontinent. We had more cognitive-onset patients. However, behavioral onset was lower in our study.

Single, nationwide National Exit Test (NEXT) is an essential provision under this act, which will be implemented during the next three years. It aims to bring about uniformity in the minimum standard of final MBBS examination, quality control in the licentiate examination and elimination of multiple entrance examinations for admission in postgraduate courses. Since the NEXT has multiple and varied objectives, we suggest a three-step scheme for the conduct of NEXT. Step I (Part A and B) will be equivalent to present-day first and second professional MBBS examinations and step II will act as the final professional MBBS and licentiate examination. Step III will form the basis for admission to the different PG courses. The written exam of Step I and II will consist of structured long, short and multiple choice type questions, whereas practical or clinical examination will consist of structured instruments with lesser inter-rater variability (viz., OSCE, OSPE, OSLER, etc.). This opinion piece is a result of in-depth discussions among major stakeholders such as MBBS students, resident doctors, and faculty of AIIMS, New Delhi. The suggested three-step plan is probably the most feasible way to ensure that the three modalities (final year MBBS, licentiate examination, and PG entrance competitive) are assessed in a valid, reliable, and acceptable manner.

Children with SSADH deficiency usually manifest with developmental delay, behavioral symptoms, language dysfunction, seizures, hypotonia, extrapyramidal symptoms, and ataxia. Diagnosis of SSADH deficiency is established by an abnormal urine organic acid pattern, including increased excretion of 4-hydroxybutyric acid and the identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in aldehyde dehydrogenase 5 family, member A 1 (ALDH5A1) gene. Here, we describe a 15-month-old girl with SSADH deficiency presenting with developmental delay, language deficits, and acute-onset right hemiparesis, following recovery from a diarrheal illness. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed hyperintense signal changes involving the left globus pallidus in T2-weighted images with restriction of diffusion in the diffusion-weighted images. Increased excretion of 4-hydroxybutyric acid, threo-4,5-dihydroxyhexanoic acid lactone and erythro-4,5-dihydroxyhexanoic acid lactone was detected by urine organic acid analysis and a diagnosis of SSADH deficiency was confirmed by the identification of homozygous pathogenic variant in ALDH5A1. Stroke mimic is a novel presentation in our patient with SSADH deficiency. She was initiated on treatment with vigabatrin and has shown developmental gains with the recovery of right hemiparesis. Follow-up neuroimaging shows near complete resolution of signal changes in the left globus pallidus, while there was subtle hyperintensity in the right globus pallidus.

Immunosuppressed patients are more often affected, and a high suspicion is needed for prompt identification. Treatment should be individualized taking into account the comorbidities, lesion size and location, bacterial resistance, and clinical and radiological response.

Now, microRNAs are considered and classified as master regulators of gene expression as they regulate a wide range of processes - gene regulation, splicing, translation and posttranscriptional modifications. Besides, dysregulated microRNAs have been related to many diseases, including Parkinson's and related disorders. Several studies proposed that differentially expressed microRNAs as a potential biomarker. So far, there is no accepted clinical diagnostic test for Parkinson's disease based on biochemical analysis of biological fluids. However, circulating microRNAs possess many vital features typical of reliable biomarkers and discriminates Parkinson's patients from healthy control with much higher sensitivity and specificity. Though they show tremendous promise as a putative biomarker, translating these research findings to clinical application is often met with many obstacles. Most of the candidate microRNAs reported as a diagnostic biomarker is not organ-specific, and their overlap is low between studies.

Although DBS was approved in advanced PD, it is being done in early PD as well. It was mainly developed to help the patients of PD to overcome the adverse motor effects associated with treatment and treatment failure. The objective is to study the efficacy of subthalamic nucleus (STN)-DBS procedure in patients with PD. This was a prospective, single-center, follow-up observational study using a direct, structured interview of 40 selected PD patients. Preoperative assessment using Unified PD Rating Scale-III (UPDRS-III), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), and Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 were done. All the patients underwent DBS. Postoperatively, similar assessment was done during follow-up period of 6 months. The results were analyzed using Student's t-test. The total score of UPDRS-III was reduced by 35% after STN-DBS intervention which was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05). STN-DBS intervention was successful in significantly reducing all UPDRS-III subscores but failed to reduce the scores in case of postural stability. MOCA scores of the patients were not found to be affected by STN-DBS intervention (P = 0.1466). Similar findings were also observed for MOCA subscores, but there was significant improvement of verbal fluency in all patients. Quality of life(QoL) improved significantly in all patients after STN-DBS intervention in all areas. Lower baseline UPDRS-III scores were found to enhance the QoL both in \"off\" and \"on\" state. However, prolonged disease duration and older age at PD onset were found to be hampering factors in the improvement of QoL.

The aim of the study is to assess the prevalence of Vitamin B12 deficiency, hyperhomocysteinemia in Indian PD patients, and their association with PN. Clinical details were collected in 93 patients over a period of 2 years. Seventy controls were included in the study. Serum B12, homocysteine, folate, electroneurography, and autonomic function tests were done. The prevalence of B12 deficiency and hyperhomocysteinemia in PD patients and controls was assessed. The association of B12 and homocysteine levels with patients' age, disease duration, levodopa equivalent daily dose, cumulative levodopa dose, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-III off score, modified Hoehn and Yahr score, and presence or absence of PN was studied. Serum B12, homocysteine levels, prevalence of B12 deficiency, and hyperhomocysteinemia were no different between cases and controls. Seven of 93 (9.68%) PD patients had PN. The median values of serum B12, folate, and homocysteine levels across patients with or without PN could not be compared as only seven of our patients had PN. The prevalence of B12 deficiency, hyperhomocysteinemia, and incidence of PN among our patients is very less when compared to the Western population. The conjecture that PN in PD patients may be secondary to B12 deficiency\/hyperhomocysteinemia stands as a speculation. ","597":"Levodopa has a superior antiparkinsonian effect than dopamine agonists making it the standard of care for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). During the initial stages, PD patients show a steady response to levodopa. Response fluctuations and levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID) develop subsequently. The timing and onset of dyskinesias vary among individuals, and there are very few studies identifying the predictors of dyskinesia in India. We aimed to study the clinical profile, disability, and predictors of LID in a patient with PD. This was a cross-sectional observational study of consecutive patients with PD attending our movement disorder clinic. Patients on levodopa treatment with a minimum follow-up of 6 months were included in the study. All patients were observed before and after administration of levodopa to assess onset, duration of action, and timing of dyskinesias. Dyskinesias were video recorded and classified. Bivariate analysis was performed using Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test and multivariate analysis using binary logistic regression. This study recruited 110 patients with PD on levodopa therapy. Thirty-one (28.1%) out of 110 had LID. Of these, 25 patients (80.6%) had on-time dyskinesia, 19 patients (61.3%) had off-time dystonia, and 13 patients (41.9%) had diphasic dyskinesia. Majority had only mild-to-moderate dyskinesia. Incapacitating dyskinesias were during off time, primarily affecting the foot. Age, disease duration, disease severity, duration of treatment, and total dose of levodopa were found to be predictors of LID. Multivariate regression analysis showed younger age and longer duration of levodopa treatment to be independent predictors for LID. LID is fairly common in PD though not severely disabling. Patients with younger age of onset, longer disease duration, and severe disease were more likely to get early LID. We observed the lower prevalence of LID when initiating at lower doses and slow titration of levodopa. ","598":"Stroke results in significant caregiver burden and strain. The main objectives of this study is to assess the burden and its consequences in caregivers of stroke patients and to determine the associated factors to caregivers' burden.

The modified rankin scale and Barthel index were administered to the patient, whereas Caregiver strain index, Caregiver burden scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and Kuppuswami scale were administered to the patient's caregiver. Descriptive statistics were used to portray demographic and clinical profiles. Correlation coefficients were used to assess the association between different scales, and t-test was applied to assess association of caregivers' burden with different categorical variables. The mean age was 60 years for patients and 47 years for caregivers. Nearly 72.8% of patients were male, whereas 57% of caregivers were female. The mean caregiver burden scale score was 28.26. Caregivers' burden decreased with increase in stroke duration (P = 0.01), increase in education level (P = 0.054), and upper socioeconomic status (P = 0.02). Caregivers' burden increased with caring for male gender (P = 0.18), being a female caregiver (P = 0.31), longer caregiver hours (r = 0.51), and increased patient disability (P &lt; 0.01). A strong correlation existed between caregivers' burden and depression (0.72); anxiety and depression (0.84); caregivers' burden and caregiver strain index (0.72).

BP was recorded hourly for the first 24 hours of admission and base line factors were collected along with measurement of stroke severity. BPV was measured by index of average real-time variability (ARV) while discharge outcome was measured by Barthel Index. 36.5% of patients had poor outcome at discharge. A significant association was found between 24-hr ARV of systolic BP and poor outcome (P = 0.002, 95% CI = 2.22-23.5). Five factors were found to be independent outcome predictors on multiple logistic regression (OR, 95% CI): age (1.07, 1.03-1.10), NIHSS score (1.12, 1.04-1.27), on admission SBP (5.12, 4.01-16.23), on admission RBS (2.23, 1.92-6.49) and 24 Hr ARV-SBP (9.65, 3.02-20.1). The PAR of 24 hr ARV-SBP was 23.6%, second only to NIHSS score (26.4%). Reduction in BP variability might have a beneficial impact on the outcome of patients with acute ischemic stroke.

Isolated HC in adults is a rare presenting feature of hypoparathyroidism with bilateral basal ganglia calcification and is treatable with correction of the underlying metabolic abnormality. In all cases with a movement disorder and brain calcification, hypoparathyroidism should be actively sought as this treatable condition must not be missed.","636":"Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism that is an often missed but treatable cause of hereditary ataxia. We report a case of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) that was diagnosed only after the development of cognitive decline and adult onset ataxia in a 35-year-old man. He had poor scholastic performance in childhood followed by gradually progressive cognitive decline. He presented to us with severe cerebellar ataxia and oculomotor apraxia. The key features that led to the diagnosis of CTX were the history of cataracts in childhood and Achilles tendon xanthoma. His brain magnetic resonance imaging showed characteristic features of CTX, and the diagnosis was confirmed by demonstrating the mutation in exon 2 of the CYP27A1 gene. The recognition of CTX earlier could have prevented his significant disabilities. The definitive treatment is oral chenodeoxycholic acid, which will prevent the accumulation of the cholestanol, which is thought to be responsible for the neurotoxicity.","637":"Cerebral disorders are known to be associated with myoclonus, but spinal pathologies have received little attention as a causative factor in movement disorders. Propriospinal myoclonus (PSM) is a rare hyperkinetic movement disorder caused by activity of a spinal pattern generator localized in a few segments of the spinal cord, spreading to other intraspinal segments via propriospinal pathways. Majority of cases of PSM are reported as functional movement disorders. Structural lesions were found in only a small number of reported cases. We present this rare case report of a patient who developed PSM 2 years following spinal surgery, done 5 years ago for D6-D7 vertebral body collapse. To the best of our knowledge, only few cases of PSM have been reported after spinal surgery and none from India.","638":"","639":"","640":"The epidemiological data of Indian patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC), specifically vegetative state and minimally conscious state, have not been investigated. The present study sought to explore the current state of the art in India for patients with DOC promoting a pilot survey. An ad hoc questionnaire was sent to a total of 400 Indian professionals who are affiliated to various centers; 59 professionals completed the questionnaire and 52 of them declared that their centers hospitalized patients with DOC in the last year for rehabilitation\/medical treatments. The majority of the professionals were from Maharashtra region. The main preliminary findings showed that the prevalence rates of traumatic and nontraumatic etiologies were equally distributed, that the rate of use of the coma recovery scale-revised was low, and that the rehospitalization was always or frequently possible in neurological and rehabilitation units. The extrapolated estimated rate of patients with DOC hospitalized in the centers involved in 2017 was equal to 4 per million of population in Maharashtra region. More than 50% of the professionals declared that there were neither sufficient nor adequate services for caregivers' support. Even if the present pilot survey has some limitations, the present article offers the first preliminary data on patients with DOC in Indian country.","641":"Although muscle ultrasound (MUS) is known to facilitate the diagnosis and evaluation of the severity of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the number of fasciculation has been scarcely examined as a predictive marker of the prognosis in ALS. The objective of this study was to examine the predictive value of fasciculation number for the prognosis of ALS. We examined fasciculation count (FasC), defined as the number of fasciculation per unit of time and area in MUS, of 11 patients with clinically probable or definite ALS. Thereafter, they were observed for maximally 2 years, unless they reached the endpoint of decease or receiving tracheostomy. Six patients, who thereafter reached the endpoint within 2 years, had significantly higher FasC (223 [49.3] vs. 34 [13], P = 0.0043) and shorter disease duration (7 [2.3] vs. 33 [17], P = 0.0022) at MUS than the remaining five patients without reaching the endpoint. Our study suggested that high FasC in MUS can predict rapid progression in ALS. Due to the limitations such as small sample size, suboptimal length of the observational period, and confounding factor of disease duration, further investigations are required.

One affected member presented with a presenile dementia, a protracted clinical course and characateristic MRI features. Genetic analysis revealed a D178N mutation in the 2 affected individuals and 7 unaffected members.

Between 2000 and 2004, 558 persons were admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit of SCTIMST who fulfilled the selection criteria. Their survival status as on December 31, 2013, was ascertained by clinic attendance record and by mail or telephone contact. Five hundred and fifty-eight persons with epilepsy (males 319, 6408 person-years) were included in this study. There had been 20 deaths till December 31, 2013, and 5 additional deaths were reported when followed up till May 2016. The standardized mortality ratio was 5.35 and higher for males (6.25) than for females (3.52). Those with generalized seizures (tonic and myoclonic seizures), electroencephalography (EEG) showing multifocal and generalized interictal discharges, and polypharmacy had a higher risk of mortality. SUDEP accounted for 5 deaths. People with refractory epilepsy who had undergone presurgical video EEG monitoring had higher mortality risk. Generalized or myoclonic seizures, multifocal or generalized interictal discharges, and polypharmacy independently increased their risk of mortality. SUDEP is an important cause of death. ","649":"Parkinson's disease (PD) patients are at a higher risk of malnutrition with the overall prevalence estimated to be 3%-60%, but there are limited data in India regarding nutritional assessment of PD. This study aims to assess nutritional status of PD patients and correlate the disease factors and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) symptoms with nutritional status. The PD cohort was assessed for demographic factors, nutritional assessment was done by Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA) Scale, and GI symptoms were assessed by validated scales. Age- and gender-matched cohort controls were randomly selected to correlate the GIT symptoms influencing nutritional status. The study population was divided into two groups according to the MNA score; Group I malnourished\/at risk of malnutrition (score &lt;23.5) or Group II normal nutrition (&gt;23.5). The two subgroups were then compared. We assessed 75 patients of PD and 35 age- and gender-matched controls. According to anthropometric criteria, 23% of the PD population was underweight, and according to biochemical assessment, 17.3% had hypoalbuminemia along with anemia. According to MNA scale, 12% were malnourished and 45.3% were at risk of malnutrition. Hence, a total of 57.3% patients in Group I (with abnormal nutrition) as compared to 14% of the controls were at risk of malnutrition while none was found to be malnourished. In our study, GIT symptoms, such as sialorrhea and dysphagia was reported by 29.3% each and constipation by 41.3% patients. While comparing GI symptoms within the two MNA groups, there was statistically significant relationship of all GI manifestations, sialorrhea (P = 0.041), dysphagia (P = 0.00081), and constipation (P = 0.0042) with malnutrition. There was no statistical significant difference between groups for age (P = 0.54), gender (P = 0.903), and duration of disease (P = 0.743). The data suggest that about 45% of PD patients are at risk of malnourishment. MNA Score is a validated nutritional assessment tool and anthropometric or biochemical measures alone cannot identify all the malnourished population. PD patients at risk of malnutrition or malnourished do have symptoms of dysphagia, sialorrhea, and constipation as compared to PD patients with normal nutrition. ","650":"Narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnolence (IHS) are rare disorders. In Western populations, the reported prevalence of narcolepsy is 0.02%-0.05%. In Indian subcontinent, there are few reports on narcolepsy and none on IHS so far. Here, we compared the clinical and polysomnographic profile of narcolepsy\/IHS among the pediatric and adult groups. The patients presenting with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) attending sleep clinic from January 2010 to December 2015 were included. Patients were diagnosed with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1), narcolepsy type 2 (NT2), and IHS based on the International Classification for Sleep Disorders criteria. Patients with secondary causes of EDS were excluded from the study. A total of 56 patients were included in the study (29 males and 27 females). The mean age of symptom onset was 29 years (males - 34 years and females - 24 years). Twelve (21%) patients had NT1, five (9%) patients had NT2, whereas 38 (68%) patients had IHS compared to narcolepsy, the IHS had an older mean age at presentation. The average time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 71 months. Classical tetrad of narcolepsy was rarely found in pediatric cohort, but they had more behavioral problems and weight gain. Pediatric cohort of IHS also reported behavioral problems. The mean sleep-onset latency was 3.1 min, while the mean rapid eye movement latency was 7.2 min. The pediatric narcolepsy patients tend to have less classical symptoms and more behavioral\/eating problems as compared to adult cohort. There is significant delay in diagnosing narcolepsy, indicating the need to increase awareness among the physicians about this rare treatable disorder. ","651":"The main objective is to compare efficacy and safety of pregabalin and amitriptyline monotherapy with their low-dose combination in patients of neuropathic pain (NeuP). In this parallel-group, open-label interventional study at the Neurology Outpatient Department of Bankura Sammilani Medical College, a total of 147 patients were randomly allocated into three groups and were prescribed the following drugs - Group P (n = 42) pregabalin 150 mg once daily, Group A (n = 34), amitriptyline 25 mg once daily, and Group Z (n = 37) = pregabalin (75 mg) + amitriptyline (10 mg) as combination once daily. They were followed up after 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Efficacy was assessed by NeuP symptom inventory score (NPSI) and safety was assessed by treatment-emergent adverse events. Final assessment was done on 92 patients (P = 31, A = 31, Z = 30). Males were predominant (71.7%). NPSI score significantly decreased in every group from baseline (P &lt; 0.0001). There was no difference of NPSI score between groups at any level of follow-up. Percentage of adverse drug reactions were maximum (44.9%) in amitriptyline monotherapy group and lowest in combined group. However, amitriptyline monotherapy was the cheapest treatment option among these three. Combining pregabalin and amitriptyline at low doses proved to be equally effective but more tolerable compared to individual higher dosage monotherapy. However, if tolerability is good, amitriptyline monotherapy can be an attractive choice in economically challenged group of patients. ","652":"The objective of this study is to observe urinary symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and advice bladder dysfunction management based on urodynamic study (UDS) findings. Twenty-two patients (12 males) with PD and PSP (15 and 7, respectively) with urinary symptoms were included in this study. All patients except one were on levodopa and carbidopa medication. UDS was performed, and bladder management determined. Mean age was 60.4 years (range 41-73 years, standard deviation [SD] 8.4). Mean illness duration was 31.9 months (range 9-146 months, SD 31.0) and mean duration of urinary symptoms was 14.8 months (range 1-61 months, SD 15.8). Eighteen patients reported nocturia and 16 patients had urgency with or without urge incontinence. Three patients had retention and straining to void and 3 had mixed urinary complaints. Twelve out of 22 patients had absence of voluntary anal contraction on per-rectal examination. UDS was suggestive of 12 patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity with or without sphincter dyssynergy. Six patients had normal detrusor pressure, and four patients were found to have contractile detrusor. Ten patients had significant postvoid residual. Bladder management included pharmacotherapy, supportive, and behavioral management as appropriate. Patients with PD\/PSP are known to develop urinary symptoms during illness. Clinical complaints and UDS findings do not necessarily match. UDS is required to manage urinary symptoms. Most of the patients respond to oral antimuscarinic medications along with behavioral and supportive therapy. ","653":"The occurrence of impulse control disorders (ICDs) in Parkinson's disease (PD) is frequently attributed to dopamine replacement therapy. However, not all patients who receive medication develop ICDs. Recent imaging studies have suggested specific neuroanatomical abnormalities in patients with PD and ICD. This study aims to identify changes in volumes of subcortical structures and cortical thickness specific to patients with PD and ICDs. A total of 11 patients with PD and ICD (PDICD(+)), 15 patients with PD without ICD (PDICD(-)), and 15 healthy controls were analyzed in this study. ICDs were diagnosed and quantified using the Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in PD-Rating Scale (QUIP-RS). Structural imaging was performed on a 3T scanner; volumes of subcortical structures and cortical thickness were obtained using first in FSL and FreeSurfer. Significant volume loss of the nucleus accumbens was observed in the PDICD(+) group. Several areas of significant cortical thinning were observed in the PDICD(+) group in comparison PDICD(-) group. Thinning of the left middle temporal gyrus, transverse temporal gyrus, and bilateral temporal poles was observed in the PDICD(+) group. No correlations were observed between QUIP-RS scores and areas of cortical thinning. The PDICD(+) group has specific neuroanatomical variations in the nucleus accumbens and temporal lobes, which may contribute to the development of ICD and perhaps predispose a patient to ICDs on exposure to dopamine replacement therapy. ","654":"Even though epilepsy is the most common neurological disorder in adolescence; studies of adolescents with epilepsy are scarce. To evaluate whether adolescents with epilepsy are more likely to develop anxiety and depressive symptoms than their healthy peers and to determine the relationship of depression and anxiety scores to epilepsy-related variables. Cross-sectional observational study. Ninety adolescents with epilepsy aged 13-19 years were compared with healthy controls using the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI II) and the Stait Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) for assessment of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Within the study group, epilepsy-related variables were also determined using the stated measures. The independent sample t-test, One-Way ANOVA, Pearson's correlation coefficient. 23.3% of the study group and 8.3% of the control group had mild to moderate depression. The mean BDI II score was significantly higher in the group of adolescents with epilepsy. Comparing the STAI scores, results on both STAI scales were higher in the study group. Regarding the epilepsy-related variables, a high frequency of seizures, symptomatic etiology and polytherapy showed strong associations with high depression and anxiety scores. Symptoms of depression and anxiety are not uncommon among adolescents with epilepsy. BDI II and STAI may be used as screening tools to provide useful information to clinicians when assessing adolescents' mental status. ","655":"Patients with intracerebral hemorrhages (ICHs) have higher incidence of seizures. Previous studies have suggested that location and size of hemorrhage may increase epileptogenicity. We aim to evaluate seizure development risk factors from clinical examination, imaging, and continuous electroencephalography (cEEG) in critically ill patients with ICH. We reviewed 57 consecutive patients with ICH admitted to a neurocritical intensive care unit over a 24-month period who were monitored on cEEG. Their demographic and examination data, ICH score, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), location of bleed, cEEG patterns, and discharge status were analyzed. Sixteen (28%) patients from our study cohort had seizures at a mean duration of 7.46 h from cEEG hookup. Fifteen (93%) of those patients had only electrographic seizures. The finding of lateralized periodic discharges (LPDs) was significantly (P = 0.019) associated with seizures. Other variables, such as ICH score, size and location of hemorrhage, GCS, mental status, and other cEEG patterns, were not significantly associated with seizures. We found that LPDs were predictive of seizures in ICH patients. cEEG for longer than 24 h is preferred for detection of seizures as they occurred at a mean later than 7 h and most were without clinical signs. ","656":"Stress, anxiety, and depression are known to be associated with the development of neurodegenerative disorders through interactions with the underlying pathophysiology. We hypothesized that the presence of these symptoms contributes to cognitive disturbances and dementia in Parkinson's disease (PD). The present study aimed to investigate the levels of stress, anxiety, and depression in PD patients relative to healthy individuals. Anxiety, stress, and depression levels were assessed using standardized questionnaires in PD without dementia (PDND, n = 30), PD with dementia (PDD, n = 28), and healthy controls (HC, n = 26). Arithmetic subtraction task was used as a stressor. Galvanic skin response, heart rate and salivary cortisol, and alpha-amylase were measured during baseline and after induced stress (arithmetic task). Acute anxiety, acute stress, and depression levels were significantly higher in PDND compared to HC, whereas both acute and chronic anxiety, stress, and depression levels were significantly higher in PDD compared to PDND and HC. Cortisol and alpha-amylase levels were significantly higher in PDND compared to HC during both baseline and postarithmetic task. Posttask levels of cortisol were lower in PDD compared to PDND. This study concludes that higher levels of salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase at baseline and poststress task with normal levels of chronic stress and anxiety were associated with no dementia in PD. Presence of higher levels of acute, chronic anxiety, and stress along with depression with lower cortisol reactivity to stressor suggests onset of dementia in Parkinson's patients. ","657":"Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is an emerging cause of non-infective encephalitis, presentations of which vary widely. Traditionally the diagnosis of AE is based on detection of antibodies in a patient with clinical picture suggestive of AE. To evaluate the clinical characteristics and response to immunotherapy in patients with antibody negative autoimmune encephalitis and to compare them with definite cases. A prospective follow-up study was done in patients presenting with presumptive symptoms of AE from January 2017 to January 2019. The study was done in a tertiary care institute of Northern India. Demographic and clinical parameters were noted and relevant investigations for management were done according to well-defined protocol. The patients were treated with immunomodulatory therapy in the form of steroids and\/or intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg). They were followed up for treatment response and relapse at 2 monthly intervals. The data was expressed as either proportions or mean\/median. Chi-square test\/Independent T test was used to compare antibody positive and antibody negative group. Out of 31 patients with presumptive AE, 16 patients tested positive for autoimmune antibodies (definite AE). Incidences of seizure, behavioral abnormalities, dementia and altered sensorium were similar between the 2 groups (p &gt; 0.05). Complete or partial response was seen in all treated patients in both groups with no significant difference (p 0.716). CSF protein concentration and cellularity were higher in the definite group although only high protein concentration could reach statistical significance (p 0.002). Malignancy could be confirmed after extensive search in 2 out of 16 patients with definite AE and in 1 out of 15 antibody negative AE patients. Clinical presentation of antibody negative cases does not differ significantly from definite ones. Since treatment response is also similar in both the groups, starting immunotherapy in a patient presenting with presumptive symptoms of AE, while ruling out other common mimickers, seems to be the need of the hour in the management of this evolving entity. ","658":"The objective of this study is to explore risk factors for stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP) and their impact on prognosis. The data collected from a retrospective review of 257 patients with acute cerebral infarction between January 2014 and December 2016 were included in this study. Data were collected for clinical, demographic, and coexisting parameters. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. Elderly age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.096, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.023-1.174), dysphagia (OR: 2.805, 95% CI: 1.614-4.875), and long-term bedridden status (OR: 120.425, 95% CI: 29.689-488.466) were significantly associated with SAP. Among these risk factors, long-term bedridden status had the highest prognostic value (area under the curve = 0.908) for developing SAP. Furthermore, pneumonia, in turn, strongly predicted poor prognosis at discharge and after 3 years. Pneumonia seems to be a major complication in stroke patients. A better understanding of its risk factors is important for prevention and early recognition. Further studies are needed to clarify the optimal preventive treatment for SAP patients. ","659":"Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a demyelinating disorder of central nervous system with deleterious effects. At present Intravenous corticosteroids are used for the relapse as the first line of treatment, but with only a class evidence III-IV. Having an underlying humoral immune mechanism in the pathogenesis of NMOSD and as it is rightly said that \"Time is Cord and Eyes\", delaying the time to start plasma exchange (PLEX) awaiting favorable outcome in response to corticosteroids is detrimental for the patient. Hence, PLEX may be a promising first line therapeutic approach in the management of severe attacks of NMOSD. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of PLEX as the first line of treatment for the acute attacks in patients with NMOSD that is being largely used as an add-on therapy for more than 10 years, and also to define the time opportunity window for the starting of PLEX. The study analysed the therapeutic efficacy and safety profile of PLEX as a first line therapy in 30 patients diagnosed with NMOSD over a period of 30 months. PLEX was performed using a Hemonetics Mobile Collection System plus machine with due written consent including the risks and benefits of the treatment that is being proposed to the patient\/relative in their own language. A total of 30 patients were analysed, out of which 16 were females and rest males. 85% of the patients were in the age group of 25-35 years. All the patients had severe Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores at the baseline, and 73.33% showed significant improvement following PLEX. The only predictor of good outcome was the time to PLEX i.e shorter delay betters the outcome. The study ascertained the importance of early PLEX as a therapeutic intervention in severe attacks of NMOSD irrespective of their Anti-Aquaporin 4 (AQP4) antibody status.

Previous studies prescribed MIE including dysarthria, cerebellar ataxia, and confusion after long-term use of metronidazole. Malignancy has been proposed one of the predisposing conditions for MIE. However, the occurrence of MIE in cancer patients remains unknown. We investigated the occurrence of MIE and analyzed retrospectively by hospital-based data of 4160 cancer patients from January 2014 to December 2016. Findings in 793 cancer patients who underwent metronidazole therapy for anaerobic infection revealed two cases of MIE. One had renal cell carcinoma and the other had bladder urothelial carcinoma. Both of their initial presentation were cerebellar dysfunction. The occurrence of MIE was 8.6% for cases who received &gt;30 g of cumulative dose. Hypertension was the most common comorbidity, followed by chronic renal disease and diabetes mellitus. In cancer patients, MIE should be monitored in those with genitourinary cancer, especially with renal dysfunction. Longer duration with more cumulative dose also has a greater risk of MIE. Early consideration of MIE with prompt cessation of metronidazole may result in better outcome.

With the advancement in genetics, more than 78 types of HSP have been identified, with increasing identification of HSP in children. However, there is scant literature on this from India. Retrospective chart review of patients with HSP diagnosed in the last 6 years was done. The data were extracted and analyzed. A total of 11 patients had a diagnosis of HSP (genetically confirmed), with mean age of presentation at 21.7 months. The main symptom at the time of presentation was delayed walking and\/or abnormal gait in the form of tip-toeing and scissoring of limbs. The mean delay in diagnosis was 5.2 years after initial presentation. MRI of the presented children showed mainly thinning of corpus callosum and white-matter changes. All of them had gradual worsening spasticity, despite physiotherapy and drugs. Except one, all children had recessive form of spastic paraplegia. Child with autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia had heterozygous mutation in SPAST gene, which is known to present in the first 2 years of life. HSP is probably not uncommon.

An 8-year-old boy from rural central India developed an atypical presentation of rabies following a street dog bite in spite of receiving postexposure prophylaxis and proper care of Category III wounds. A diagnosis of rabies was made on the basis of clinical background, neuroimaging finding, excess antibody titer, detection of rabies viral antigen in serum, and exclusion of other etiologies. He had slow but significant recovery with intensive critical care support. The poor outcome in the described case highlights the lack of awareness, especially in rural population, and the importance of timely, adequate, and appropriate postexposure prophylaxis, which remains the only effective intervention for human rabies.","685":"Acute arterial ischemic stroke after minor head trauma has been reported in the past, mostly in infants.

This study was done to study the effect of triamcinolone acetonide on drug refractory MP. This study was a retrospective case file review. Eight patients were treated with local injections of triamcinolone. The patients were followed up for a period of 4 months to 54 months. There was significant symptomatic improvement with six patients having complete improvement and all patients reporting &gt;50% improvement. Patients who had recurrence of symptoms on follow up received up to four injections as per their requirement and repeated injections also produced &gt;50% symptom relief.

The objective of this study is to describe the clinical profile and analyze outcomes and prognostic predictors in a cohort of children with OMS. This was a retrospective study of children with OMS between 2007 and 2017. Twenty-two children were included in the study. The mean age at onset of symptom was 20.9 months (standard deviation [SD]: 7.5). The mean duration of delay in diagnosis was 8.4 months (SD 1.26) with acute cerebellitis being the most common misdiagnosis. Eleven children (50%) were diagnosed with tumor during evaluation and follow-up and 11 children (50%) belonged to idiopathic\/postinfectious group. Magnetic resonance imaging brain was normal in all children except for one revealing cerebellar atrophy on follow-up. One child in the paraneoplastic group (neuroblastoma) had a positive PNMA2\/Ta onconeural antibody. Children in the tumor group had an earlier age of onset (mean 15.5 vs. 26.3 months), shorter time to onset of opsoclonus from initial symptom (2.54 vs. 7.27 weeks), and higher severity score at presentation (13.7 vs. 11.3) compared to the nontumor group. Children in the nontumor group attained their first remission with treatment earlier (10.9 weeks, SD: 4.5) than the children with tumor (18.72 weeks, SD: 5.8). There was no significant difference in the outcome between the groups. Children with multiple relapses (&gt;3) and late surgical intervention for tumor (&gt;6 months after symptom onset) had a poor outcome. A high index of suspicion coupled with early diagnosis and periodic tumor surveillance (even in the initially negative cases) along with aggressive combined multimechanistic immunotherapies is the key in improving outcomes. A high index of suspicion in appropriate clinical circumstances and early aggressive immunomodulation might lead to a better outcome.

The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of these symptoms in migraine and to compare the clinical characteristics of patients with and without these symptoms. Frequency of the patients that exposed to the additional investigations was searched. In this prospective study between February 2016 and March 2017, 170 pediatric patients who were referred to our tertiary teaching hospital with migraine were enrolled. A total of 170 children, 61 male (35.9%) and 109 female (64.1%) were included in the study. CASs were present in 68 patients (40%), single symptom in 31 (45.6%), and multiple symptoms in 37 (54.4%) patients. Of 68 patients with CAS, 24 (35%) patients were referred to allergists and all were tested for inhaler specific IgE and skin tests. Seventy (32.9%) patients had neck pain\/stiffness in which 28 (40%) were exposed to radiation. CAS and neck pain were more frequent in patients with frequent attacks (P = 0.04 and P = 0.032, respectively). Neck pain was more frequent in patients with CAS (P = 0.029). It is important for pediatricians and primary care physicians to be aware of the common nature of CASs and neck pain\/stiffness in children with migraine to prevent unnecessary procedures.

Here, we report a rare patient of scrub typhus, who developed meningoencephalitis followed by long-segment myelitis and axonal polyneuropathy, with hepatic, renal, hematological, and pulmonary involvement, following acute febrile illness with associated neurocysticercosis. He gained consciousness with a resolution of almost all of his complaints, with the exception of muscular power, which showed partial improvement following treatment with doxycycline, azithromycin, and steroids.

The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and Hoehn-Yahr staging of the patients have been conducted at the time of admission. Retinal nerve fiber layer analysis and ganglion cell thickness (ganglion cell complexes [GCCs]) were evaluated through optical coherence tomography (OCT). And at the same time, we aimed to compare the stage of the disease, the UPDRS score and the duration of the disease with OCT and cognitive functions by mini-mental test. Mini-mental test total score value (P = 0.025) and language value (P = 0.021) were lower in the patient group compared to the control group.

Acute ICH patients within 24 h of symptom onset were recruited. Baseline neuroimaging study (Computerized tomography, CT scan of brain) was performed to assess the pure hematoma volume by AXBXC\/2 method. Baseline TCD parameters were obtained from both the middle cerebral arteries (MCAs; affected and unaffected hemisphere): Peak Systolic velocity, End Diastolic velocity, Mean Flow velocity, Resistance Index, and Pulsatility Index. Follow up (24 h) assessment of hematoma volume and TCD were carried out. Each of the TCD variables were compared in hematoma expansion (&gt;33% increase in hematoma volume on the follow-up CT) and non-expansion group. On univariate analysis, the Student's t-test and contingency tables with the X2 test were used. A forward stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis with hematoma expansion at 24 h as the dependent variable and ROC analysis was carried out, using SPSS software version 16 (Chicago, IL).

The histological features were further evaluated and classified according to the Peripheral Nerve Society Guidelines. Of the 126 cases, there were 65 nonsystemic vasculitis, 45 secondary systemic vasculitis, and 16 primary systemic vasculitis. Definite vasculitis was more common in the systemic vasculitis group. The epineurial vessels were predominantly involved with chronic axonal changes. The sensitivity of definite vasculitis on nerve biopsy was 54.76%.

A structured questionnaire was used to assess recognition (use of honorifics) and naming defect of close relatives. AD was diagnosed in 42 patients. Prosopagnosia was found in 14 and anomia in 6 patients. Four patients exhibited problem during conversation with close relatives. They assigned name and relation of one generation earlier to close relatives with proper recognitions. We got predictive error of name and relation assignment of close relatives by one generation back with normal recognition. It can be explained by two memory traces in connection of face-visual and name (with\/without relation) representation, earlier being hierarchically older and more resistant to wearing.

Early confirmation of clinically suspected patients of CTS was done by performing electrodiagnostic tests of median and ulnar nerves. Motor and sensory conduction velocities, distal motor and sensory latencies, and F-wave latencies were performed in the recruited volunteers. The values for mean wrist ratio in control groups were 0.694, 0.703 respectively, and in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome, it was 0.704 and 0.719 respectively in moderate and severe type. The mean wrist to palm ratio (WPR) in control group was 0.371, while in patients with CTS, it was 0.374, 0.382, 0.387, and 0.401 based on progression of severity. Both were statistically significant for the last two groups (wrist to index finger [WIF] &gt;4.4 m\/s, moderate, and WIF nonrecordable, severe).

Based on etiology for hospital admission, they were divided into two groups - related to PD (further divided into direct or indirect) or not associated with PD at all. Etiology for hospitalization was determined from history and investigational data. The primary outcome was death or discharge from the hospital. Factors contributing to ICU admission were analyzed by comparing these patients with a cohort of 50 PD patients admitted to the neurology ward during the same study period. All values were expressed as mean (standard deviation) and percentages using SPSS version 16.0. Fifty-three (36%) out of a total of 146 patients required ICU admission.

Therapeutic agents used and the response to therapy were assessed. There were six cases with IgG4-related neurological disease which were all hypertrophic pachymeningitis. The age ranged from 35 to 64 (mean = 46) years. The clinical presentation was acute in one, subacute in two, and chronic in three patients. The most common presenting symptom was headache (4), followed by gait and\/or urinary disturbances (2), paraparesis (1), and diplopia (1). IgG4 levels were elevated in 50% of them. Pseudotumor-like mass and sinovenous thrombosis, not described previously, were seen in one patient. All the patients were treated with oral or intravenous steroid. Rituximab was given in three patients; azathioprine was the steroid-sparing agent in one patient. Those with acute\/subacute onset of presentation had an excellent response to steroids. All the patients with a chronic duration of their symptoms received empirical anti-tuberculous therapy before a definitive diagnosis of Ig G4-RD was made. The characterization of patients with IgG4-related neurological disease based on the understanding of the clinical spectrum increases the confidence in the clinician to resort to early immunosuppression, thereby having prognostic implications. ","750":"Differentiating between neurocysticercosis (NCC) and neurotuberculosis has serious therapeutic implications and this distinction relies heavily on neuroimaging. Few case reports discuss the conglomeration of ring-enhancing lesions (RELs) in patients with solitary NCC. The aim of our study is to describe the imaging findings of conglomerate RELs in a cohort of patients with solitary NCC, emphasizing the frequency of conglomeration. This retrospective study included 100 patients with solitary NCC. Two neuroradiologists analyzed contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) images regarding morphology, enhancement pattern, location, number of lesions, and degree of perilesional edema. The solitary lesions were classified as solitary discrete RELs (SD-RELs) when a well-defined lesion was seen and solitary conglomerate RELs (SC-RELs) when two or more ring lesions or ring\/rings plus disc lesions were present contiguously. Follow-up CT scans were evaluated for the resolution of lesions and surrounding edema. Out of 100 patients, 42 were SD-RELs and 58 were SC-RELs. No statistically significant difference was found between both groups in terms of age of presentation, clinical presentation, lesion size and location, and degree of perilesional edema. Larger lesions (&gt;10 mm) were more likely to show scolex and were associated with greater degree of edema in both subgroups. During follow-up, 13 patients had new lesions (SD-RELs-5, SC-RELs-8). In SD-RELs, follow-up lesions were in the same location in four patients and new location in one; and in SC-RELs, lesions were in the same location in seven and in new location in one case. Conglomeration of RELs is a common finding in patients with solitary NCC.

We prospectively recruited 45 consecutive adult patients (&gt;18 years) fulfilling the Hunter's criteria for SS. All patients were subjected to a detailed clinical history and examinations. Patients were subjected to appropriate investigations to find out the other causes. The causation of SS to serotonergic drugs was assessed according to Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale. The mean age was 37.3 years (range: 18-59 years). Sixty-two percent of patients were male. There were 15 different underlying clinical syndromes for which serotonergic drugs were started. Psychiatry conditions (36%) and cough\/respiratory tract infection (16%) were the two most common clinical conditions for starting serotonergic drugs. We noted 49 different symptoms and physical signs. Overall, tremor (78%) and dizziness (47%) were the two most common symptoms. Headache (16%) and dizziness (16%) were the two most common initial (or first) symptoms. However, gait difficulty and febrile encephalopathy were the two most common reasons to visit the hospital. We noted 18 different drugs causing SS. Thirty-eight percent of patients received single serotonergic agent antidepressants, pain medicines and cough syrups were other important drugs causing SS. This study represents the largest clinic-based study on SS. SS is not rare in clinical practice. However, various aspects of this syndrome are still to be determined. All patients on serotonergic drugs should be physically examined for the presence of SS on the development of any new symptom.

We did a prospective study on patients who fulfilled the revised diagnostic criteria for Primary pseudotumor cerebri syndrome in adults and children, proposed by Friedman et al in 2013. All patients were examined for BMI, papilloedema, extraocular muscle movement, opening CSF pressure and underwent MRI, MR venography of brain and perimetry. Patients were followed up for a minimum period of 6 months, upto 2 years, with the outcomes monitored being visual acuity, visual field, headache, diplopia and optic disc changes. We evaluated 33 patients (31 female and 2 male). 25 patients had BMI less than 25. Commonest clinical presentation was headache. 7 patients showed normal CSF opening pressure. The most common MRI finding was flattening of posterior aspect of globe and was found in 90.90% (30). 25 patients showed either unilateral or bilateral transverse sinus stenosis. Most common finding in perimetry was enlarged blind spot. 4 patients recovered spontaneously and rests were treated with acetazolamide (1gm\/day). All showed favorable outcome when followed up. Obesity may not be a dominant risk factor for development of IIH in the Indian subcontinent. Non obese IIH have better prognosis and tend to have a good response to medical management alone. ","754":"Tubercular meningitis (TBM) is a common cause of chronic meningitis in India; however, there is a paucity of literature on optimum duration and choice of drug therapy. This was an ambispective cohort study. Two hundred and forty-four patients of central nervous system tuberculosis (CNS TB) who were seronegative for HIV were studied of whom 198 had TBM and 46 patients had tuberculoma without meningitis. Before completion of treatment, 84% of TBM patients underwent imaging. There was no difference in disability or mortality in patients, who were treated with various drug regimens in terms of duration of therapy or number of drugs at initiation of treatment. However when patients developed new complications, adding more drugs improved survival. Prolonging corticosteroid administration in patients with nonsatisfactory improvement at 8 weeks was not associated with prevention of disability. CNS TB is treated by neurologists and physicians in India, as per their experience due to different recommendations in various guidelines. There is a tendency to decide when to stop treatment based on neuroimaging given the fear of poor outcomes associated with recurrence of the disease. The duration of treatment or choice of drugs at the start of treatment did not affect disability. ","755":null,"756":"Antiepileptic drugs are the main therapy for epilepsy. However, the incidence of adverse effects (AEs) results in treatment discontinuation. The aim of this study is evaluating the factors involved in discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs.

Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Chi-square test. This study showed the rate of discontinuation due to adverse reactions as follows: TPM (7.10%), OXC (4.5%), ZNS (1.8%), and LEV (1.6%) (Chi-square analysis, P &lt; 0.0001). Our study also showed that 1.35% of the patients did not continue the therapy because of subjective experiences of the AEs. Furthermore, neurologic complications in TPM, skin rashes in OXC, and patients' subjective experiences in LEV prescription were the main reasons for nonadherence due to a AEs. AEs in newer antiepileptic drugs are extremely prevalent. Our observation revealed that skin rashes and paresthesia were the most probable causes of treatment discontinuation because of AEs. ","757":"Propranolol is a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist that was developed by the British scientist Sir James Black primarily for the treatment of angina pectoris, more than 50 years ago. It was not long before several other cardiovascular as well as noncardiovascular therapeutic uses of propranolol were discovered. Propranolol soon became a powerful tool for physicians in the treatment of numerous conditions such as hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, migraine, portal hypertension, anxiety, essential tremors, hyperthyroidism, and pheochromocytoma. Owing to its action at multiple receptor sites, propranolol exerts several central and peripheral effects and is therefore useful in various conditions. Right from reduction in postmyocardial mortality to control of anxiety in performers, propranolol plays an important role in a plethora of medical conditions. Interestingly, even today, newer indications of this age-old drug are being discovered. Moreover, propranolol treatment has been found to be cost-effective when compared to other corresponding treatment options for individual indications. In this article, we attempt to recount the journey of propranolol right from its inception to the present day.","758":"\"Vascular parkinsonism (VP)\" is a condition which presents with the clinical features of parkinsonism that are presumably caused by cerebrovascular disease. It is classically described as symmetrical lower-body parkinsonism with gait unsteadiness and absence of tremors and is usually associated with pyramidal signs. Treatment for VP remains challenging as available data on the efficacy of current treatment options are contentious. VP is generally considered to be poorly responsive to levodopa, the most effective of the current treatment modalities for parkinsonism. However, there is evidence that some patients benefit from therapy with levodopa.

The aim of this study is to investigate the reliability and validity of Marathi version of SSQOL in patients with stroke. Translation of SSQOL in Marathi language was performed in accordance with the published guidelines. Validation of Marathi version of SSQOL was carried out by 130 patients with stroke with minimum 1 year of duration of stroke. Reliability was measured with the help of 36 volunteers diagnosed with stroke. There were no major changes in the translated version, except in three items. Reliability was found to be 0.82 and validity was found to be 0.93. Floor and ceiling effects were found to be 11.3% and 6.3%, respectively.

In cerebral palsy (CP) learning of any new task is an extremely slow process due to damage in sensory and motor areas of brain affecting the cognitive ability of the child and putting constraints in achieving timely developmental milestones. For such patients the electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the most cost effective diagnostic tools used that minimizes hospital stay. Its analysis helps to identify various neurological disorders determining the role of brain waves outlining the present status of mind. This study evaluated the EEG power spectrum density (PSD) of CP children both pre and post rTMS intervention to identify significance changes in signal patterns arising from different brain regions. thirty CP children participated in this study.

PSD was extracted employing fast fourier transform post acquisition of artifact free signal to undermine changes in signal pattern. The results revealed that rTMS improves learning ability in CP children and it shows higher power peak at frequency of 50 Hz and lower power peak frequency at 100 Hz. The power intensity in gamma wave region shows significant reduction post-rTMS therapy between 38-24 power peak frequency and 7-4 range in 100 Hz power peak frequency.

A door-to-door screening survey was carried out in the rural community using a validated questionnaire for epilepsy by trained field workers, which was finally confirmed by trained neurologists. The risk factors for epilepsy and for predisposing infections were also enquired. The results were compared with an equal number of age- and sex-matched healthy controls enrolled from the same community. Serologic evaluation was carried out to detect antibodies against T. canis. A total of 41,973 persons from the rural community in 49 villages were enrolled in the study. Two hundred and eleven persons were confirmed to be suffering from active epilepsy, resulting in a crude prevalence of 5 per 1000 population. More than 50% of people with epilepsy were in the second or third decade of life. The prevalence of antibodies to T. canis was similar in people with epilepsy (13.7%; 29 of 211 individuals) and controls (9.95%; 21 of 211 individuals). Of the 151 persons with epilepsy, who underwent CT scan, 34 people (22.3%) had evidence of inflammatory granuloma, thereby confirming high incidence of this infestation in rural Northern India.

FOG (+) patients were subdivided by a median split of time from motor onset to development of FOG (median: 6 years) into early onset FOG (EOFOG [n = 24]) and late onset FOG (n = 26). The FOG (+) group had a significantly longer duration of motor symptoms, a higher Hoehn and Yahr stage, and greater severity of disease. Festination, falls, and wearing off were more prevalent in the FOG (+) group. Several nonmotor symptoms (NMS) such as constipation, psychosis, fatigue, weight loss, drooling, excessive sweating, depression, and postural giddiness were significantly higher in the FOG (+) group. The EOFOG group had a later age at onset of motor symptoms. There were no significant differences observed in the NMS, with the exception of fatigue in EOFOG. FOG is associated with longer disease duration and higher severity of disease. FOG (+) patients have distinct NMS which are contributory to disease morbidity. EOFOG might be associated with an accelerated disease progression and is linked with older patients and shorter disease duration.

The present study was aimed at identifying genetic types of T. gondii in fatal cases of cerebral toxoplasmosis (CT) associated with HIV, from India. Archived tissues of CT were obtained postmortem from 25 acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients between 2000 and 2014. Direct amplification of eight different loci, namely, SAG1, 5'-3'SAG2, Alt. SAG2, SAG3, BTUB, GRA6, C22-8, and L358 followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism was used to genotype the parasite. The canonical Types I, II, or III were not found in our study. More than 96% of the cases harbored atypical genotypes-likely recombinants of the canonical types; one case closely corresponded to Type II genotype. Thus, a majority of T. gondii causing CT in South India belonged to a noncanonical lineage. These nonarchetypal genotypes differed from the conventional Types I, II, and III and caused devastating severity in patients with CT in the background of HIV.

Given the projected increase in the number of people with PD over the coming decades, interventions aimed at minimizing morbidity and improve quality of life are crucial. There is currently no fully proven pharmacological therapy that can modify or slow the disease progression. Physical activity (PA) can complement pharmacological therapy to manage the inherent decline associated with the disease. The evidence indicates that upregulation of neurotrophins and nerve growth factors are potentially critical mediators of the beneficial effects associated with PA. Accumulating evidence suggests that patients with PD might benefit from PA in a number of ways, from general improvements in health to disease-specific effects and potentially, disease-modifying effects. Various forms of PA that have shown beneficial effects in PD include - aerobic exercises, treadmill training, dancing, traditional Chinese exercise, yoga, and resistance training. In this review, we explored available research that addresses the impact of exercise and PA on PD. The original articles with randomized control trials, prospective cohort studies, longitudinal studies, meta-analysis, and relevant review articles from 2005 to 2017 were selected for the present review. Many gaps remain in our understanding of the most effective exercise intervention for PD symptoms, the mechanisms underlying exercise-induced changes and the best way to monitor response to therapy. However, available research suggests that exercise is a promising, cost-effective, and low-risk intervention to improve both motor and nonmotor symptoms in patients with PD.

Here, we report a case of EPC following NKH, showing an unusual magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) finding of concurrent hypointensity on susceptibility-weighted image (SWI) and T2-weighted image (T2WI) with leptomeningeal and cortical enhancement, which have never been reported. A 68-year-old woman presented to our emergency department with a 3-day history of involuntary repeated contraction of the right side of the face and upper limb. Laboratory data revealed NKH of diabetes mellitus. Electroencephalography (EEG) was unremarkable. Brain MRI revealed focal cortical and leptomeningeal enhancement together with subcortical T2 shortening and SWI hypointensity of the left frontal operculum. She responded well for hyperglycemia and antiepileptic drug therapy. Follow-up brain MRI performed 1 week later showed complete resolution of the abnormal signal and enhancement in the same region. Although EPC caused by NKH occurs rarely, it may result in an MRI abnormality of subcortical hypointensity on SWI and T2WI with leptomeningeal and cortical enhancement, which may be misinterpreted as other brain pathologies.

The most common ischemic stroke subtype was large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) comprising 37.6% (n = 779), followed by small vessel occlusion comprising 19.9% (n = 413) and cardioembolism 11% (n = 228). Stroke of other determined etiologies constituted 4.2% (n = 86) and stroke of undetermined etiology was observed in 27.3%. Among patients with LAA, 610 (78.3%) patients had intracranial and 169 (21.7%) had extracranial disease as the underlying mechanism. Risk factor profile demonstrated that hyperlipidemia was significantly associated with LAA and ischemic heart disease with cardioembolic strokes. The study reveals a distinct pattern of ischemic stroke subtypes in the Indian context that has overlapping features of registries from West and East Asian countries. Both large artery and small vessel diseases are substantially represented with a predominance of intracranial atherosclerosis. The study results have significant implications for developing preventive and management strategies for stroke care and research in India. ","798":null,"799":"It is important to know whether or not the stroke risk factors and etiologies of patients with multiple acute infarcts are different to those of patients with a single acute infarct. The frequency of multiple acute infarct was investigated in ischemic stroke patients and a comparison was made of the characteristics of stroke patients with and without multiple acute infarct. We reviewed the clinical records of 988 ischemic stroke patients who were admitted within 1 week of the onset of stroke and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was performed on first presentation. The clinical characteristics, laboratory, and imaging results were noted from the patient records. According to the DWI findings, the patients were separated into three groups as those with a single acute infarct in a single vascular territory (SI group), those with multiple acute infarcts in a single vascular territory (SMI group) and those with multiple acute infarcts in multiple vascular (MMI group) territories. The frequency of multiple acute infarcts was investigated, and a comparison was made of the characteristics of stroke patients with and without multiple acute infarcts. The SMI group included 119 (12%) patients and the MMI group 126 (12.8%). The most common mechanisms of multiple acute infarcts are large artery atherosclerosis and cardiac origin emboli. Moreover, the risk factors most determined were hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia in the MMI group. No difference was determined between the groups in respect of stroke etiology and risk factors. ","800":"Intracranial atherosclerosis is a common cause of stroke in India. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) provides a noninvasive way to study basal intracranial blood vessels. The Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project (OCSP) classification is a simple clinical stroke classification system that has prognostic significance and has been associated with size and location of the infarct. This study was undertaken to identify patterns of TCD abnormalities in our stroke population particularly in relation to the OCSP classification. A cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary care center in South India. Recent nondisabling ischemic stroke patients were studied. TCD was used to insonate bilateral middle cerebral, bilateral anterior cerebral, bilateral vertebral, and basilar arteries. Mean flow velocity was used to define normal or abnormal flow as per standard criteria. Association between abnormal flow velocities and OCSP classification was studied using Chi-square tests. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to determine factors associated with abnormal flow velocities. Of the 59 participants studied, 42 (71%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 57.3-84.7%) had abnormal flow velocities in one or more vessels and this was significantly associated with smoking (odds ratio = 5; 95% CI: 1.2-21.8). All abnormal flow velocities were blunted flow velocities. Anterior circulation flow velocity abnormalities were seen among all OCSP stroke subtypes, but posterior circulation flow abnormalities were associated with posterior circulation infarcts (P = 0.03). Intracranial flow velocity abnormalities are frequent among Indian stroke population. Further studies are needed to characterize these abnormalities fully.

Medication is the common treatment but it has adverse effects. Hence, there is a need to find out effective treatments with or without minimal side effects for gross motor recovery of the patient. Cranial electrical stimulation (CES) and rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT) are used as treatment approaches for depression, anxiety, stress, and irrational beliefs in the general population. In the present study, the efficacy of two psycho-therapeutic modalities (CES and REBT) along with conventional physiotherapy management was evaluated on psychological illness, motor recovery, and quality of life among chronic stroke (CS) survivors. A total of 18 patients with CS who scored &gt;10 on Beck Depression Inventory Scale, scored &gt;23 on Mini-Mental state examination scale, and having stroke of duration &gt;6 months-2 years were included in the study. They were divided into two groups, A and B. Group A received CES while Group B received REBT. Both the interventions were given 5 days in a week for 4 weeks. Conventional physiotherapy for 30 min was added to both groups as common intervention. Depression, Anxiety, Stress scale (DASS-42), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Shortened General Attitude and Belief Scale (SGABS) were used for measuring depression, anxiety, and stress, sleep, attitude and beliefs, respectively, 4 weeks postintervention. Patients with CS in Group A demonstrated significant improvement, P &lt; 0.05, in Depression, Anxiety, Stress scale-24, PSQI, and MSSI when compared to those of Group B. CES has the potential to improve psychological illness such as depression, anxiety, stress, attitudes, belief, and thereby quality of life among CS survivors than REBT.

Studies of stroke in young can lead to therapeutical results affecting both short- and long-term outcomes. This paper is based on a hospital-based retrospective study, of stroke in young, for a duration of 1 year. The study revealed stroke in young in 31.38% of all strokes, with cerebral infarction in 50.66%, followed by intracerebral hemorrhage in 41.33%, subarachnoid hemorrhage in 4.66%, and cerebral venous thrombosis in 3.33%. The most common presenting symptom was hemiparesis. The most prevalent risk factor for stroke in young was alcohol consumption, followed by traditional risk factors such as hypertension and smoking. Diabetes was detected less in our study. Although traditional risk factors are associated with stroke in young, unfavorable behavioral pattern such as alcohol abuse may cause and promote development stroke in young.

Previous clinical and histologic studies suggest that the neurodegenerative process, which affects the brain, may also affect the retina of PD patients. The objective of this study was to determine the thickness changes of retina nerve fibers and macular volume with optical coherence tomography (OCT) in PD patients. The spectral domain OCT was used to assess the thickness of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and macular volume from 34 PD patients and 50 healthy age-matched controls. Compared with healthy age-matched controls, the RNFL thickness of PD patients was much thinner (P &lt; 0.05) in all retinal quadrants, with temporal thinning being more than nasal thinning. Macular volumes were diminished in both perifoveal and outer macular regions in all sectors (P &lt; 0.05) with preserved foveal volume.

Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) appears to be effective in patients with central nervous system inflammatory demyelinating disease who do not respond to first-line corticosteroid treatment. We represent a retrospective review of the use of TPE in the treatment of an acute attack of NMO in five patients who failed to respond to initial immunomodulatory treatment. We evaluated the effect of TPE on the degree of recovery from NMO. It was performed using a single volume plasma exchange with intermittent cell separator (Hemonetics Mobile Collection System plus) by femoral or central line access and scheduled preferably on alternate-day intervals from 8 to 10 days. Both subjective and objective clinical response to TPE was estimated, and final assessment of response was made at the time of the last TPE in the series. All patients were severely disabled before the initiation of TPE and they were female; with the mean age of these patients was 52.5 years (range = 36-69 years), the median age of NMO diagnosis was 49.4 years (range = 35-65 years), and the median duration of disease was 2.6 years (range = 0-5 years). Out of five patients, three had a history of bilateral optic neuritis, and all patients were anti-against protein aquaporin-4antibody positive. Totally 24 TPE procedures were performed on five patients, the mean time of start of TPE in the acute attack was 18.6 days. Patients were severely disabled at the initiation of TPE (range = expanded disability status scale 6.5-9), and improvement was observed early in the course of TPE treatment in most patients. The present study provides clinical support for the importance of TPE in refractory acute attack in NMO. However, with new diagnostic technologies and increasing clinical awareness, we may see a more improved ways of TPE in these patients in the future; hence, TPE is more effective modality of treatment as it also removed the antibodies.

The present study aimed to test the utility of a logistic regression-derived classifier, combining specific quantitative multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data for the early objective phenotyping of MCI in the clinic, over structural MRI data. Thirty-three participants with cognitively stable amnestic MCI; 15 MCI converters to early Alzheimer's disease (AD; diseased controls) and 20 healthy controls underwent high-resolution T1-weighted volumetric MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MR spectroscopy). The regional volumes were obtained from T1-weighted MRI. The fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity maps were derived from DTI over multiple white matter regions. The 1H MRS voxels were placed over posterior cingulate gyri, and N-acetyl aspartate (NAA)\/creatine (Cr), choline (Cho)\/Cr, myoinositol (mI\/Cr), and NAA\/mI ratios were obtained. A multimodal classifier comprising MR volumetry, DTI, and MRS was prepared. A cutoff point was arrived based on receiver operator characteristics analysis. Results were considered significant, if P &lt; 0.05. The most sensitive individual marker to discriminate MCI from controls was DTI (90.9%), with a specificity of 50%. For classifying MCI from AD, the best individual modality was DTI (72.7%), with a high specificity of 87.9%. The multimodal classifier approach for MCI control classification achieved an area under curve (AUC) (AUC = 0.89; P &lt; 0.001), with 93.9% sensitivity and 70% specificity.

DM type 1 (DM1) is a commonly inherited adult muscle disorder. In 1909, its characteristics were first described by Hans Steinert (1875-1911), a German neurologist. Born in Dresden, Germany, Steinert studied philosophy and medicine at the Universities of Leipzig, Berlin, Freiberg, and Kiel. There, under the supervision of Heinrich Curschmann, he accomplished his own works on aphthongia, cerebral muscular atrophy, and cerebral hemiplegia. In 1909, he published his study on six patients exhibiting characteristic myotonia. With autopsy findings of muscular fibrosis, Steinert identified this independent symptom complex as \"Dystrophien Myotoniker\" (DM). Overall, Steinert's accurate clinical characterization, coupled with the first ever autopsy finding of this condition, laid the foundations of our current understanding about DM1. This review serves as a tribute to the achievements of Hans Steinert and provides an opportunity to understand the historical perspective of DM1. Information for this analysis was gathered from PubMed and libraries at University of Southern California and University of California, Los Angeles.

This article encapsulates the gaps and challenges in the management of patients with MS and presents suggestions and recommendations of the members of advisory boards held to discuss these challenges. The advisory board members suggested that an early diagnosis of MS and an early initiation of treatment are essential to achieve better results for tackling MS-related challenges. In addition, awareness and education about MS among people, regular training to physicians, emphasis on the use of revised 2010 McDonald criteria, and utilization of advanced diagnostic modalities in magnetic resonance imaging would help to achieve desirable as well as effective therapeutic outcomes. Further, access to an easy-to-use therapy delivery system could also be beneficial in attaining an adequate treatment adherence and related health benefits.","821":"Neuroimaging in dementia has advanced several folds in the past decade. It has evolved from diagnosing secondary causes of dementia to the current use in identifying primary dementia and aid in clinically perplexing situations.

The neuroimaging in dementia is classified into structural, functional, and molecular imaging. Structural imaging includes voxel-based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging. Functional imaging includes 18F-fluorodeoxy glucose positron emission tomography imaging, 99mTc hexamethylpropyleneamineoxime single photon emission computed tomography imaging, and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. Molecular imaging includes amyloid imaging, tau imaging, and translocated protein imaging.

The posterior hypothalamus was the structure most consistently depicted with functional imaging in different states of disease with and without pain. Network-oriented imaging techniques such as resting-state functional resonance imaging were able to show a broader involvement of human trigeminal pain processing in the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of the different TACs, highlighting similarities between this distinct group of primary headache disorders, while also demonstrating the differences in brain activation across these disorders. The most important clinical assignment for neuroimaging research from the treating physician remains the objective and reliable distinction of each individual TAC syndrome from one another, to make the correct clinical diagnosis as the foundation for proper treatment. More research will be necessary to fulfill this unmet need.","825":"The term \"Trigeminal Autonomic Cephalalgia (TAC)\" was first coined by Goadsby and Lipton[1] to include a group of relatively rare primary headache disorders characterized by moderate to severe, short-lived head pain in the trigeminal distribution with unilateral cranial parasympathetic autonomic features, such as lacrimation, rhinorrhea, conjunctival injection, eyelid edema, and ptosis. In the current International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3 beta),[2] the TAC group includes cluster headache (CH), paroxysmal hemicrania (PH), short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks (SUNHAs) and their 2 subforms - SUNHAs with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT), SUNHAs with cranial autonomic symptoms (SUNA). Hemicrania Continua (HC) is also now included in the TAC group. Although the entities included under TACs seem broadly similar, they differ in attack duration, frequency and their response to different treatments. At one end of the spectrum lies CH, the prototypic TAC where the duration of attacks is the longest and at the other end is the SUNCT syndrome where the duration is shortest. There is some overlap across the entities; they are not difficult to recognize and subclassify. The umbrella term \"TAC\" for the short-lasting headaches with autonomic features was for the first time introduced in The ICHD, 2nd edition (ICHD-2) published in 2004.[3] The beta version of the 3rd edition of The ICHD[2] was published in 2013. Headache classification being an evolving process, there have been some changes within the TAC group between ICHD-2 and ICHD-3 beta.[45] Diagnostic criteria have been revised to reflect pathophysiological and clinical observations. Neuroimaging has provided insights into the pathophysiology of TACs. Functional neuroimaging has helped to elucidate key structures activated during attacks of TACs. Correct diagnosis remains the key to correct management of the TACs because treatment options vary. The aim of this article will be to highlight the changes in ICHD-3 beta to this group and to emphasize the clinical implications of these changes. Description of individual entities included under TACs are included elsewhere and will therefore not be detailed here.","826":"The term trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs) encompasses four primary headache disorders - cluster headache, paroxysmal hemicrania (PH), hemicrania continua (HC), short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT)\/short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with cranial autonomic symptoms (SUNA). All of these except HC are characterized by short-lasting headaches. HC is characterized by a continuous unilateral headache that waxes and wanes in its intensity without complete resolution. It is included in the TACs group given the overlap in the activation of the posterior hypothalamic grey, and the shared clinical feature of unilateral head pain with ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms. The present review gives an overview of the nosologic evolution, diagnosis, and management of TACs.","827":"Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks (SUNHA) is characterized by strictly unilateral trigeminal distribution pain that occurs in association with ipsilateral cranial autonomic features. There are two subtypes: short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT) and short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with cranial autonomic symptoms (SUNA). These disorders are rare but highly disabling. The management of SUNHA can be challenging. The abortive therapies are not generally useful as the attacks are relatively short-lasting. A myriad of pharmacological preventive treatments has been tried in single case reports or small series in an open-label fashion. Lamotrigine, as an oral preventive treatment, and lidocaine, as an intravenous transitional treatment, seems to be the most effective therapies. For medically intractable SUNHA, several surgical approaches have been tried. These include ablative procedures involving the trigeminal nerve or the Gasserian ganglion, microvascular decompression (MVD) of the trigeminal nerve, and neurostimulation techniques. MVD, occipital nerve stimulation, and ventral tegmental area deep brain stimulation have all been found to be effective in open-label series with relatively high-response rates. There is a considerable clinical, therapeutic, and radiological overlap between SUNCT, SUNA, and trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Despite being considered distinct conditions, the emerging evidence suggests a broader nosological concept of SUNCT, SUNA, and TN; these conditions may constitute a continuum of the same disorder, rather than separate clinical entities. Consideration needs to be given to classifying SUNHA with TN as a cranial neuralgia rather than as a trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia.","828":"Hemicrania continua (HC) is an indomethacin responsive primary chronic headache disorder which is currently classified as a subtype of trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs). It is not very uncommon. There are &gt;1000 cases of HC in the literature, and it constitutes 1.7% of total headache in the clinic settings. Misdiagnosis for HC is very common at all clinical settings. A diagnosis of HC is missed even by neurologists and headache specialists. It is characterized by a continuous strictly unilateral headache with superimposed exacerbations. Just like other TACs, exacerbations are associated with cranial autonomic symptoms and restlessness. A large number of patients may have migrainous features (nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia) during exacerbations phase. The \"key\" feature of HC is persistent featureless background headaches. However, patients and physicians may focus only on the exacerbation part. As durations, frequency and associated symptoms of exacerbations are highly variables; it may mimic a large number of primary and secondary headache disorders. Migraine and cluster headache are two most common misdiagnosed conditions. Another specific feature of HC is remarkable repose to indomethacin. A \"complete\" response to indomethacin is as \"sine qua non\" for HC. However, a few other medications may also be effective in a subset of HC patients. Various surgical procedures have been tried with mixed results in patients who were intolerant to indomethacin or other drugs.","829":"Paroxysmal hemicrania (PH) is a primary headache disorder belonging to the group of trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias(TACs). Patients typically experience intense lateralzsed headaches with pain primarily in the ophthalmic trigeminal distribution (V1) associated with superimposed ipsilateral cranial autonomic features. PH is distinguished from other TACs by an exquisite responsiveness to therapeutic doses of indomethacin. Patients may need to be maintained on indomethacin for several months before trials of reduction can be attempted. The disorder does have a tendency toward chronicity. PH is uncommon, but early recognition will prompt initiation of effective treatment to avoid unsuccessful trials of drugs effective in other primary headaches. As with other TACs, hypothalamic and trigeminovascular mechanisms are implicated in the pathophysiologic mechanism of PH. Neuroimaging findings in PH demonstrate a posterior hypothalamic activation similar to that observed in the other TACs. This review will address the epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathophysiology, evaluation, and treatment of PH.","830":"Cluster headache (CH) is a debilitating primary headache disorder. Although uncommon, affecting only 0.1% of population, it is one of the most painful conditions known to humankind. Three strategies are employed for effective treatment of CH, namely, abortive therapy, transitional therapy, and preventive therapy. Being an uncommon condition, there is a paucity of large-scale controlled trials and evidence of various therapies are based on smaller studies. This review primarily focuses on therapies with highest quality of evidence and also on the emerging therapies for CH.","831":"Cluster headache is a primary headache disorder affecting up to 0.1% of the population. Patients suffer from cluster headache attacks lasting from 15 to 180 min up to 8 times a day. The attacks are characterized by the severe unilateral pain mainly in the first division of the trigeminal nerve, with associated prominent unilateral cranial autonomic symptoms and a sense of agitation and restlessness during the attacks. The male-to-female ratio is approximately 2.5:1. Experimental, clinical, and neuroimaging studies have advanced our understanding of the pathogenesis of cluster headache. The pathophysiology involves activation of the trigeminovascular complex and the trigeminal-autonomic reflex and accounts for the unilateral severe headache, the prominent ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms. In addition, the circadian and circannual rhythmicity unique to this condition is postulated to involve the hypothalamus and suprachiasmatic nucleus. Although the clinical features are distinct, it may be misdiagnosed, with patients often presenting to the otolaryngologist or dentist with symptoms. The prognosis of cluster headache remains difficult to predict. Patients with episodic cluster headache can shift to chronic cluster headache and vice versa.

The objectives of this study are to describe the clinicopathologic features in muscle biopsy-proven cases of NAM. To emphasize the role of laboratory parameters such as CPK levels and myositis profile in the diagnosis of NAM. This is a retrospective study including 15 patients of NAM diagnosed on muscle biopsy over a period of 2 years. The slides of the biopsies were reviewed, and clinical data, electromyography findings, and CPK levels were obtained. Myositis profile was done. Necrotizing myopathy accounted for 13.63% (15 cases) of total inflammatory myopathies (110 cases) in the study. These were grouped into CTD-associated NAM, statin-associated NAM, paraneoplastic NAM and idiopathic NAM which was the common type. All cases presented with progressive proximal muscle weakness and had markedly elevated CPK levels. Anti-3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase and antisignal recognition particle antibodies were seen to be positive in six patients. Muscle biopsies showed predominant fiber necrosis with significant fiber degeneration and regeneration in the absence of inflammation. All patients received immunotherapy with significant improvement was seen in six patients with two mortalities. Necrotizing myopathy is a new addition to the spectrum of IIM.

In this study, we present 32 patients of mercury toxicity following unauthorized Siddha medicine intake who mimicked neuromyotonia clinically. We analyzed the clinical features of these patients, the role of autoimmunity in etiopathology, and compared it with acquired neuromyotonia. This is a retrospective study to analyze inpatients in a tertiary care center, admitted with mercury toxicity following Siddha medicine intake from August 2012 to October 2016. We analyzed the clinical features, laboratory data including mercury, arsenic and lead levels in blood, and serum voltage-gated potassium channels (VGKC)-CASPR2 Ab in selected patients. Thirty-two patients who had high blood mercury levels following Siddha medicine intake were included in the study. All patients (100%) had severe intractable neuropathic pain predominantly involving lower limbs. Twenty-six (81.25%) patients had fasciculations and myokymia. Fifteen patients (46.86%) had autonomic dysfunction (postural hypotension and resting tachycardia). Nine (28.12%) patients had encephalopathic features such as dullness, apathy, drowsiness, or delirium. Anti-VGKC Ab was positive in 12 patients with myokymia. All the patients in the study consumed Siddha medicines obtained from unauthorized dealers. Mercury toxicity following Siddha medicine intake closely mimics acquired neuromyotonia; severe intolerable neuropathic pain is the hallmark feature; Positive VGKC-CASPR2 antibody in some patients must be due to triggered autoimmunity secondary to mercury toxicity due to Siddha medicine intake.

We sought to investigate the value of motor nerve conductions studies (MNCS) in the diagnosis of clinically suspected iTTS. Twenty-six (52 limbs) adult patients of clinically suspected iTTS were subjected to motor nerve conductions of posterior tibial nerve, and its branches and motor conduction parameters were compared with those of 45 healthy controls. Symptoms were bilateral in 70% (P = 0.02), with heel pain in 95% of symptomatic limbs. MNCS was abnormal in 32 (80%) of symptomatic limbs and 8 (66.6%) of asymptomatic limbs (P = 0.004). Out of electrophysiologically abnormal nerves (n = 67), the pathological process could be identified in all the nerves with abnormal MNCS (P = 0.02). Probable demyelination was seen in 58.2% of the electrophysiologically abnormal nerves. The present study shows that iTTS are gender and Body Mass Index neutral with bilateral symptoms being common. Tinel's sign was inconsistent. Heel pain did not correlate with abnormal inferior calcaneal nerve conductions. Motor nerve conduction study was abnormal in a significant number of symptomatic limbs. \"Probable demyelination\" was more frequent in symptomatic limbs. MNCS is significantly abnormal in symptomatic limbs of subjects with iTTS. Demyelination is slightly more common than axonopathy in iTTS. With a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 33.3%, MNCS seems to be useful as a screening tool in clinically suspected iTTS.

Neurophobia syndrome, a global phenomenon, fundamentally stems from pedagogical deficiencies during the undergraduate curriculum, the lack of vertical integration between basic neurosciences and clinical bedside neurology, the lack of clinical reasoning exercises, cognitive heuristics, and clinical problem-solving, errors in diagnostic competence, and hyposkilia. This ultimately results in poor clinical competence and proficiency in clinical neurology and causes attrition in nurturing a passion for learning the neurology discipline. This article explores plausible factors that contribute to the genesis of neurophobia and multifaceted strategies to nurture interest in neurosciences and provide possible solutions to demystify neurology education, especially the need for evidence-based educational interventions. Remodeling neurology education through effective pedagogical strategies and remedial measures, and using the Miller's pyramid, would provide a framework for assessing clinical competence in clinical bedside neurology. Technology-enhanced education and digital classrooms would undoubtedly stamp out neurophobia in medical students of the 21st century. It will not frighten off another generation of nonneurologist physicians to empower them to hone expertise in order to tackle the increasing burden of neurological disorders in India. Furthermore, promoting neurophilia would facilitate the next generation of medical students in pursuing career options in neurology which would be quintessential not only in closing India's looming neurologist workforce gap but also in fostering interest in research imperatives in the next generation of medical students.","852":"Genetic neuromuscular diseases are caused by defective expression of nuclear or mitochondrial genes. Mutant genes may reduce expression of wild-type proteins, and strategies to activate expression of the wild-type proteins might provide therapeutic benefits. Also, a toxic mutant protein may cause cell death, and strategies that reduce mutant gene expression may provide therapeutic benefit. Synthetic antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) can recognize cellular RNA and control gene expression. In recent years, advances in ASO chemistry, creation of designer ASO molecules to enhance their safety and target delivery, and scientific controlled clinical trials to ascertain their therapeutic safety and efficacy have led to an era of plausible application of ASO technology to treat currently incurable neuromuscular diseases. Over the past 1 year, for the first time, the United States Food and Drug Administration has approved two ASO therapies in genetic neuromuscular diseases. This overview summarizes the recent advances in ASO technology, evolution and use of synthetic ASOs as a therapeutic platform, and the mechanism of ASO action by exon-skipping in Duchenne muscular dystrophy and exon-inclusion in spinal muscular atrophy, with comments on their advantages and limitations.","853":"","854":"","855":"","856":"","857":"","858":"","859":"","860":"","861":"","862":"Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is clinically and genetically heterogeneous.

HRV is influenced by the cardiac autonomic nervous system (ANS), although it is unclear which arm of the ANS (sympathetic or parasympathetic) needs to be perturbed to increase the complexity of HRV. In this case-control study, we have analyzed the relation between modulation of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and changes in complexity of HRV as a function of states of vigilance. We hypothesize that VNS - being a preferential activator of the parasympathetic system - will decrease the heart rate (HR) and increase the complexity of HRV maximum during sleep. The electrocardiogram (EKG) obtained from a 37-year-old, right-handed male with known intractable partial epilepsy and left therapeutic VNS was analyzed during wakefulness and sleep with VNS ON and OFF states. Age-matched control EKG was obtained from five participants (three with intractable epilepsy and two without epilepsy) that had no VNS implant. The study demonstrated the following: (1) VNS increased the complexity of HRV during sleep and decreased it during wakefulness. (2) An increase in parasympathetic tone is associated with increased complexity of HRV even in the presence of decreased HR. These results need to be replicated in a larger cohort before developing patterned stimulation using VNS to stabilize cardiac dysautonomia and prevent fatal arrhythmias.","869":"By definition, a brain abscess is an intraparenchymal collection of pus.

After systematic retrieval, 13 researches with two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 11 prospective open-label single-arm clinical trials were included in the study. For the primary outcome of two RCTs, one RCT which was followed up for 1 year showed a positive effect and the other RCT which was associated with treatment duration of 28 weeks showed a negative result. For the secondary outcome, meta-analyses of other 11 trials showed a benefit effect, overall. For the quantitative MG (QMG) score, there were significant differences with high heterogeneity (SMD: 2.93; 95% CI: 1.14-4.73; I2 = 86%). In contrast, for MG activities of daily living (MGADL) score, it was reduced by tacrolimus with significant SMD and less heterogeneity (SMD: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.33-0.85; I2 = 7%). Adverse effects were mentioned as mild. The opposite results of two RCTs showed that tacrolimus with enough treatment duration might have positive steroid-sparing effect. The most possible cause of heterogeneity in the outcome of QMG score between trials was the baseline severity of MG.

Out of the 125 patients screened by NGS, 96 were confirmed with two dysferlin variants, of which 84 were homozygous. Single dysferlin pathogenic variants were seen in 4 patients, whereas 25 showed no variants in the dysferlin gene. In this study, 98.2% of patients with absence of the dysferlin protein showed one or more variants in the dysferlin gene and hence has a high predictive significance in diagnosing dysferlinopathies. However, collection of blood samples from all over India for protein analysis is expensive. Our analysis shows that the use of the \"ALDA tool\" could be a cost-effective alternative method.

A retrospective chart review of all patients treated for CVT in a large quaternary teaching hospital was done, and cases with visual impairment due to CVT were identified. The various mechanisms causing visual impairment in CVT were (1) raised intracranial pressure (ICP) caused by venous thrombosis without venous infarcts resulting in a benign intracranial hypertension-like presentation of CVT, (2) venous infarcts involving the occipital cortex, (3) raised ICP following the development of a secondary dural arteriovenous (AV) fistula, and (4) arterial occipital infarcts due to posterior cerebral artery compression secondary to herniation in large venous infarcts. Apart from using systemic anticoagulants to attempt recanalization and drugs with carbonic anhydrase inhibitor activity to reduce the ICPs, treatment modalities employed to save vision were (1) recanalization by local thrombolysis, stenting, or mechanical devices; (2) cerebrospinal fluid diversion procedures such as theco-periotoneal shunting; (3) optic nerve sheath fenestration; and (4) specific treatment for conditions such as dural AV fistula occurring as a late complication. CVT can cause visual impairment through different pathophysiological mechanisms. Depending on the mechanism, treatment strategies need to be tailored. Furthermore, very close monitoring is needed both in the acute and in the follow-up period, as new pathophysiological mechanisms can arise, compromising the vision.

The clinical variables for evaluating the degree of raised ICP were the GCS and pupil size. Other systemic parameters such as mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate were also considered and these results were further correlated with TCCD findings. The groups were divided into three groups based on GCS, pupillary reactivity, and imaging. Imaging was done to indicate the etiology for ICP changes and also to look for signs of raised ICP. Ten distinct types of waveform patterns were noted, and these waveforms correlated with various physiological parameters suggestive of raised ICP. The sequential evolution of distinct patterns of Doppler waveform with increasing degree of raise in ICP has been described and can act as a quick screening tool in NICU and helps stratify patients for treatment and prognostication. ","900":"Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a sustained decrease in systolic blood pressure of 20 mm Hg or a decrease in diastolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg within three minutes of standing compared with blood pressure from the sitting or supine position or by head-up tilt-table testing (1). When sustained blood pressure (BP) drop is after three minutes of upright posture it is called delayed orthostatic hypotension (delayed OH) (2). To detect the incidence of delayed orthostatic hypotension in patients referred to our autonomic lab. BP was measured noninvasively at 1-minute intervals with an automated cuff sphygmomanometer over the right brachial artery for 45 minutes. The onset and duration of falls in blood pressure either systolic or diastolic or both were documented, and any associated symptoms were recorded. Only patients with sustained falls in BP were included. Drugs causing OH was stopped 48 hours before testing as per protocol followed in lab. We also looked into other autonomic function test abnormalities in patients with delayed OH. Patients above age of 18 years referred for evaluation of autonomic function tests. Patients with severe cardiac failure and cardiac arrhythmias were excluded and patients with rapid fall in BP and bradycardia (Neurally mediated syncope) were excluded. Total 170 patients underwent tilt table testing. Orthostatic hypotension was seen within 3 minutes in seventy patients, fifty patients had delayed OH (BP fall after 3 minutes). There were twenty seven males and twenty three females in this group. Twenty nine of the 50 patients with delayed orthostatic hypotension, had symptoms during the tilt table procedure. Asymptomatic OH was more common in patients who developed OH after 10 minutes. This is a pilot study, first in India where we looked into the incidence of delayed orthostatic hypotension in patients undergoing tilt table testing in our autonomic lab. We found that fifty patients had delayed orthostatic hypotension which could have been missed on clinical evaluation. High clinical suspicion is needed to detect this disorder and tilt table testing should be done in suspicious cases since orthostatic hypotension is cause of high morbidity.

Aggressive immunosuppression is essential to prevent clinical relapses and permanent disability. Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody to CD20, has been found effective in several reports and small uncontrolled studies. There is a paucity of data regarding its use in Indian patients. The aim of this study was to report the results of rituximab treatment in NMO spectrum disorders (NMOSDs) in the Indian scenario. This study is a retrospective, observational study including 13 NMOSD patients treated with rituximab. After initial therapy in the acute episode with IV methylprednisolone and if needed plasma exchange, therapy was initiated as a cycle of intravenous rituximab, two doses 2 weeks apart of 1 g each. Subsequent cycles were advised at intervals of every 6 months. The primary outcome measure was annualized relapse rate (ARR), defined as a number of clinical attacks per year. Clinical adverse events were recorded throughout the study. In the study, mean ARR reduced from 2.61 to 0.09 after therapy (P = 0.000685). Of 13 patients, 8 (61.54%) were completely relapse free after starting treatment with rituximab. Treatment was well tolerated and no serious adverse events were noted. The treatment of NMOSDs with rituximab in Indian patients reduces the frequency of relapses and is well tolerated.

For effective management of aphasia (i.e., impaired language) in such persons, assessment of all languages is essential. The most widely used test for this purpose - the Bilingual Aphasia Test (BAT) - is cumbersome and requires a considerable amount of time for administration. To overcome this limitation, a short version of the BAT has been recommended. The objective of this study was to derive a short version of BAT for Malayalam-English bilingual persons with aphasia and to establish the test-retest reliability as well as the content and construct validities of this version. Following the recommendations of the test developers, we used seven subtests from the draft of an adapted full version of Malayalam BAT. These subtests in Malayalam and their counterparts in English were administered on a group of 22 Malayalam-English bilingual participants with aphasia. The scores obtained from these two languages were used to establish content and construct validities of the short version of the BAT in Malayalam. Further, we readministered the short version of BAT in a group of ten participants with aphasia to examine the test-retest reliability within 14 days from the date of first administration. The short version of BAT in Malayalam revealed high test-retest reliability as well as content and construct validities. The administration time ranged between 30 and 45 min. Thus, the short version of the BAT in Malayalam can be considered a valid and reliable language test that can be quickly administered in Malayalam-English bilingual persons with aphasia.

This side effect is usually encountered after long duration of treatment, but occasionally, this may be seen even after few days or months of treatment. LID is broadly classified as peak-dose dyskinesia, wearing-off or off-period dyskinesia, and diphasic dyskinesia. Pathogenesis of LID is complex, and different neurotransmitters such as dopamine, glutamine, adenosine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid play important role altering the normal physiology of direct and indirect pathway of cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic loop responsible for fine motor control. Treatment of LID requires careful history taking and clinical examination to find the type of dyskinesia as different approach is required for different types. Changes in dopaminergic medication including continuous dopaminergic stimulation are very helpful in the management of peak-dose dyskinesia. Different types of surgical approaches including unilateral pallidotomy and deep brain stimulation have given very good result in patients, who cannot be managed by medications alone.

In epidemiological studies from India from various regions the overall prevalence of PN varied from 5 to 2400 per 10,000 population in various community studies. India is composed of a multiethnic, multicultural population who are exposed to different adverse environmental factors such as arsenic and lead. Use of different chemotherapeutic agents with propensity to affect peripheral nerves, increasing methods of diagnosis of connective tissue disorders and use of immunomodulating drugs, growing aging population is expected to change the spectrum and burden of peripheral neuropathy in the community. The other important aspect of peripheral neuropathies is in terms of the geographical and occupational distribution especially of toxic neuropathies like arsenic which is common in eastern belt; lead, mercury and organo-phosphorous compounds where occupational exposures are major sources. Inflammatory neuropathies either due to vasculitis or G B Syndrome, chronic inflammatory polyradiculopathies are another major group of neuropathies which is increasing due to increase longevity of Indian subjects and immunological impairment, also adds to morbidity of the patients and are potentially treatable. Leprous neuropathy is common in India and although its frequency is significantly decreasing because of national control program yet pure neuritic form still remains a cause of concern and similar is the case with another infective cause like diptheric neurpathy.

For ages, it was thought that the stretch reflex was of short latency and it was synonymous with the tendon reflex, subserving the same spinal reflex arc. However, disparities in the status of the two reflexes in certain clinical situations led Marsden and his collaborators to carry out a series of experiments that helped to establish that the two reflexes had different pathways. That the two reflexes are dissociated has been proved by the fact that the stretch reflex and the tendon reflex, elicited by stimulation of the same muscle, have different latencies, that of the stretch reflex being considerably longer. They hypothesized that the stretch reflex had a transcortical course before it reached the spinal motor neurons for final firing. Additionally, the phenomenon of stimulus-sensitive cortical myoclonus lent further evidence to the presence of the transcortical loop where the EEG correlate preceded the EMG discharge. This concept has been worked out by later neurologists in great detail, and the general consensus is that indeed, the stretch reflex is endowed with a conspicuous transcortical component.","959":"[This corrects the article on p. 367 in vol. 19, PMID: 27570390.].","960":"","961":"","962":"","963":"","964":"","965":"","966":"","967":"The modified Atkins diet (MAD) has been used predominantly in older children, adolescents, and adults.

The aim of this study was to investigate electroclinical presentation in patients with late-onset LGS. In addition, we evaluated structural abnormalities of the brain, which may give some clue about the common pathogenic pathway in LGS. We enrolled the patients with late-onset LGS. We collected electroclinical characteristics of the patients and evaluated structural abnormalities using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis. The three subjects were diagnosed with late-onset LGS. The patients have no mental retardation and normal background activities on electroencephalography (EEG), and they had generalized paroxysmal fast activities on EEG, especially during sleep. The TBSS analysis revealed that fractional anisotropy values in the patients were significantly reduced in the white matter of brainstem compared with normal controls. However, VBM analysis did not show any significant difference between the patients and normal controls. Patients with late-onset LGS have different clinical and EEG characteristics from those with early-onset LGS.

To identify and characterize seropositive patients for anti-aquaporin-4 antibody (anti-AQP4+) and anti-MOG+ in South India. We included 125 consecutive patients (15 children) who were serologically characterized using live transfected cells to human M23-AQP4 or full-length MOG. Among a total of 125 patients, 30.4% of patients were anti-AQP4+, 20% were anti-MOG+, and 49.6% were seronegative. No patient was positive for both. Anti-MOG+ patients represented 28.7% (25\/87) of seronegative NMOSD. In comparison to anti-AQP4+ patients, anti-MOG+ patients were commonly male, had less frequent attacks and milder disability on expanded disability status score scale. Seronegative patients were also predominantly male, 36% (9\/25) had monophasic longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis and disability was comparable with anti-AQP4+ patients. Lumbar cord involvement was common in anti-MOG+ and seronegatives, whereas anti-AQP4+ patients had more cervical lesions. Anti-AQP4+\/anti-MOG + patients accounted for nearly half of the patients suspected of having NMOSD in South India, indicating that antibody testing may be useful on the management of subgroups with different prognosis.

In addition, data collected by us indicated that a majority of rural and urban Indians regularly spend time in prayer\/spiritual activity. The main purpose of this study was to develop a cross-cultural adaptation of the ESS for a North Indian population, in Hindi language (ESS-I). The study also provides evidence of reliability and validity of the modified version. The subjects included were normal volunteers aged 18-75 years (Group 1) (n = 70), compared with patients with complaints of excessive daytime sleepiness, who had undergone polysomnography (Group 2) (n = 22) and patients who had undergone multiple sleep latency test (Group 3) (n = 10). The study was carried out in four phases: Translation and retranslation of the original scale with modification of item 8 (mainly addition of option of question on \"while offering prayers or in spiritual activity\"); reliability (test-retest) (n = 30); internal consistency (using Cronbach's alpha index) (n = 102); and sensitivity to change (n = 8). Group 1 showed spiritual activity as a significantly more commonly practiced activity than driving. The Cronbach's alpha for the modified version was 0.892 (excellent), and this was not improved by removing the modified item. The alpha value for Group 1 versus Groups 2 and 3 was 0.667 and 0.892, respectively. The scale was reliable over time (test-retest), and it was sensitive to sleepiness change in patients with obstructive sleep apnea during treatment. The ESS-I, is comparable to the original scale. It is reliable, valid, and change-sensitive. It is proposed that the modified version can be very useful for detecting sleepiness among Indian population, especially those who do not drive their own vehicles.

For each patient, baseline characteristics, neuropsychological tests, cerebrovascular risk factors, medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTLA), and severity of small vessel disease (SVD) according to the existence of MBs were evaluated. The prevalence of MBs in patients with AD was 33%. The percentage of male gender, the severity of SVD and MTLA were significantly increased in MB(+) group. The MB(+) group showed more severe MTLA and SVD than MB(-) group. These results suggested that MBs might reflect the burden of amyloid and ischemic vascular pathology.

Clinical findings and conventional laboratory assessments are not sufficiently distinct for specific etiologic diagnosis. Identification of pathogens is a key to appropriate therapy. In this retrospective observational study, we evaluated the efficacy and clinical utility of syndrome evaluation system (SES) for diagnosing clinically suspected CNS infections. This retrospective analysis included inpatients in our tertiary level neurointensive care unit (NICU) and ward from February 2010 to December 2013. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of 70 patients, clinically suspected of having CNS infections, were subjected to routine laboratory tests, culture, imaging, and SES. We analyzed the efficacy of SES in the diagnosis of CNS infections and its utility in therapeutic decision-making. SES had a clinical sensitivity of 57.4% and clinical specificity of 95.6%. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the top two bacterial pathogens, whereas Herpes simplex virus (HSV) was the most common viral pathogen. Polymicrobial infections were detected in 32.14% of SES-positive cases. SES elicited a change in the management in 30% of the patients from initial empiric therapy. At discharge, 51 patients recovered fully while 11 patients had partial recovery. Three-month follow-up showed only six patients to have neurological deficits. In a tertiary care center, etiological microbial diagnosis is central to appropriate therapy and outcomes. Sensitive and accurate multiplex molecular diagnostics play a critical role in not only identifying the causative pathogen but also in helping clinicians to institute appropriate therapy, reduce overuse of antimicrobials, and ensure superior clinical outcomes.

This retrospective study included AIS patients admitted to our center between January 2009 and August 2010 who underwent GRE-weighted MRI within 48 h of admission. Demographic and clinical data including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, prior intake of antiplatelets\/anticoagulants\/statins, and presence of CMBs at admission were collected and compared between patients who developed HT and those who did not. We did a multivariate analysis using logistic regression to assess the effect of CMBs and prior use of antithrombotic agents on the risk of development for early HT in ischemic stroke.

CMBs were found in only 9 of 81 patients (11%) with HT and in 40 out of remaining 448 patients (9%) who did not develop HT. The presence of CMBs was not associated with increased risk of HT (P = 0.53). However, prior use of antiplatelets (33% vs. 47% in the patients without HT, P = 0.02) was associated with decreased risk of HT in ischemic stroke.

It is defined as a rhythmic, involuntary oscillatory movement of a body part around one or more joints. In the majority of the population, tremor tends to be mild. They have varying etiology; hence, classifying them appropriately helps in identifying the underlying cause. Clinically, tremor is classified as occurring at rest or action. They can also be classified based on their frequency, amplitude, and body part involved. Parkinsonian tremor is the most common cause of rest tremor. Essential tremor (ET) and enhanced physiological tremor are the most common causes of action tremor. Isolated head tremor is more likely to be dystonic rather than ET. Isolated voice tremor could be considered to be a spectrum of ET. Psychogenic tremor is not a diagnosis of exclusion; rather, demonstration of various clinical signs is needed to establish the diagnosis. Severity of tremor and response to treatment can be assessed using clinical rating scales as well as using electrophysiological measurements. The treatment of tremor is symptomatic. Medications are effective in half the cases of essential hand tremor and in refractory patients; deep brain stimulation is an alternative therapy. Midline tremors benefit from botulinum toxin injections.

India with its large population has a huge burden of AIS. Hence, neurologists need to gear up to the new challenge of providing interventional care to huge populations of AIS in the country. The best way to cover this unprecedented unmet need is to encourage neurologists to take up interventional subspecialty interests through new but sound training pathways.","988":"End-of-life care is an integral part of neurology practice, and neuropalliative medicine is an emerging neurology subspeciality. This begins with serious illness communication as a protocol-based process that depends on an evaluation of patient autonomy and accurate prognostication. Communication needs vary between chronic, life-limiting neurologic illnesses and acute brain injury. In an ideal situation, the patient's wishes are spelled out in advance care plans and living wills, and surrogates have only limited choices for implementation. Palliative care prepares for decline and death as an expected outcome and focuses on improving the quality of life for both the patients and their caregivers. In the Intensive Care Unit, this may require clarity on withholding and withdrawal of treatment. In all locations of care, the emphasis is on symptom control. Neurologists are the quintessential physicians, and our \"dharma\" is best served by empathetically bringing our technical knowledge and communication skills into easing this final transition for our patients and their families to the best of our ability.","989":"Capacity to make one's own decisions is fundamental to the autonomy of the individual. Capacity is a functional assessment made by a clinician to determine if a patient is capable of making a specific decision. Competency is a global assessment and legal determination made by a judge in court. Capacity evaluation for a patient with dementia is used to determine whether the patient is capable of giving informed consent, participate in research, manage their finances, live independently, make a will, and have ability to drive. Patients with dementia cannot be assumed to have impaired capacity. Even a patient with moderate or severe dementia, with obviously impaired capacity may still be able to indicate a choice and show some understanding. Four key components of decision-making in a capacity evaluation include understanding, communicating a choice, appreciation, and reasoning. Assessment of capacity requires a direct interview with the patient using open-ended questions and may include both informal and formal approaches depending on the situation and the context. A baseline cognitive evaluation with a simple test to assess executive function is often useful in capacity evaluation. All capacity evaluations are situation specific, relating to the particular decision under consideration, and are not global in scope. The clinician needs to spend adequate time with the patient and the family allaying their anxieties and also consider the sociocultural context. The area of capacity has considerable overlap with law and the clinician treating patients with dementia should understand the complexities of assessment and the implications of impaired capacity. It is also essential that the clinician be well informed and keep meticulous records. It is crucial to strike a balance between respecting the patient autonomy and acting in his\/her best interest.","990":"India ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) in 2007. This is a welcome step toward realizing the rights of the persons with disability. The UNCRPD proclaims that disability results from interaction of impairments with attitudinal and environmental barriers, which hinders full and active participation in society on an equal basis with others. Further, the convention also mandates the signatory governments to make suitable changes in the existing laws of the country, to identify and eliminate obstacles and barriers, and to comply with the terms of the UNCRPD in order to protect the rights of the person with disabilities, hence the amendments of the national laws. Hence, the Government of India drafted the Right of Persons with Disabilities Bill (RPWD Bill), 2014. It is evident that neurological disorders are emerging as priority health problems worldwide. They not only contribute to mortality but also contribute to huge morbidity. Further, shortage of neurologists, huge treatment gap, and stigma add to the burden. The situation becomes worse with regard to providing quality care, comprehensive rehabilitation, and social welfare measures to persons with neurological disability. There is no doubt that persons with neurological disability do not get adequate representation, stigmatized and discriminated across the civil societies, which hinders full and active participation in society. Hence, this article is a critique of the RPWD Bill, 2014 from the perspective of persons with neurological and neurosurgical disability. Further, this article also discusses challenges in quantifying and certifying disability in neurological disability.","991":"In a recent judgment on medical negligence, the Supreme Court awarded compensation amounting to Rs. 11 crore to a victim, which was to be paid by the doctors and the private hospital deemed responsible for the wrongful death of a patient. This landmark decision was by far the largest compensation award in the history of Indian medical negligence litigation. Hence, the process of calculating compensation for medical negligence has received great attention and debate, largely due to the impact that it is going to have on the practice of medicine within the country, in the near future. However, the method of calculation of compensation is unpredictable as it varies hugely across different cases, courts and tribunals resulting, in a loss of faith in the system, protracted litigation, and frequent appeals. With over 80% of India's healthcare being provided by the private sector, predictability and uniformity in the regulation of compensation in medical negligence would benefit the victims and the doctors concerned. A basic knowledge of how medical negligence compensation is calculated and adjudicated in the judicial courts of India will aid a doctor in planning his\/her professional indemnity insurance, as well as in practicing his\/her profession without undue worry about facing litigation for alleged medical negligence. This article addresses the merits and demerits of large compensation awards, and also discusses whether the system is broken, needs a quick fix, or a massive overhaul.","992":"The medical profession is considered to be one of the noblest professions in the world. The practice of medicine is capable of rendering noble service to humanity provided due care, sincerity, efficiency, and professional skill is observed by the doctors. However, today, the patient-doctor relationship has almost diminished its fiduciary character and has become more formal and structured. Doctors are no longer regarded as infallible and beyond questioning. Corporatization of health care has made it like any other business, and the medical profession is increasingly being guided by the profit motive rather than that of service. On the other hand, a well-publicized malpractice case can ruin the doctor's career and practice. The law, like medicine, is an inexact science. One cannot predict with certainty an outcome of cases many a time. It depends on the particular facts and circumstances of the case, and also the personal notions of the judge concerned who is hearing the case. The axiom \"you learn from your mistakes\" is too little honored in healthcare. The best way to handle medico-legal issues is by preventing them, and this article tries to enumerate the preventive measures in safeguarding the doctor against negligence suit.","993":"A basic knowledge of how judicial forums deal with the cases relating to medical negligence is of absolute necessity for doctors. The need for such knowledge is more now than before in light of higher premium being placed by the Indian forums on the value of human life and suffering, and perhaps rightly so. Judicial forums, while seeking to identify delinquents and delinquency in the cases of medical negligence, actually aim at striking a careful balance between the autonomy of a doctor to make judgments and the rights of a patient to be dealt with fairly. In the process of adjudication, the judicial forums tend to give sufficient leeway to doctors and expressly recognize the complexity of the human body, inexactness of medical science, the inherent subjectivity of the process, genuine scope for error of judgment, and the importance of the autonomy of the doctors. The law does not prescribe the limits of high standards that can be adopted but only the minimum standard below which the patients cannot be dealt with. Judicial forums have also signaled an increased need of the doctors to engage with the patients during treatment, especially when the line of treatment is contested, has serious side effects and alternative treatments exist.","994":"Clinical neuroscience has made tremendous advances over the last century. Neurology as a discipline is still considered challenging and at times risky due to the natural history and progressive course of few of the neurological diseases. Encouragingly, the patient and their caregivers are now increasingly willing to be actively involved in making decisions. The patients' relationship with the doctor is a reflection of the society. A society that is orienting itself toward \"rating\" and \"feedback\" has made this doctor-patient relationship, a consumer-service provider relationship. This perhaps is due to commercialization of health that usually accompanies globalization. Moreover, a rapid influx of information from potential erroneous sources such as the Internet has also made patient and caregivers not being hesitant to taking legal course in the case of adverse events during treatment or simply because of dissatisfaction. The purpose of the legal process initiated by patients with neurological ailments is more often to compensate for the income lost, physical and psychological anguish that accompanies disease and its treatment, and to fund treatment or rehabilitation requirements. However, it is not clearly established if monetary benefits acquired lead to better opportunities for recovery of the patient. The consumer protection act and commercialization of medical services may well have an adverse effect on the doctor and patient relationship. Hence, there is a great need for all medical professionals to mutually complement and update each other. This review examines legal (litigation) processes with special interest on medicolegal system in patients with neurological ailments and the challenges faced by the neurologist during day-to-day clinical practice.","995":"","996":"","997":"","998":"","999":"","1000":"","1001":"","1002":"","1003":"","1004":"","1005":"","1006":"This study was planned to determine the usefulness of anti-cysticercus IgG antibody detection in saliva for neurocysticercosis (NCC) diagnosis, along with serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level to serve as a surrogate marker.

Mutations in the tRNA splicing endonuclease complex (TSEN) 54 gene can be responsible for PCH type 2, 4 and 5. The more common and less severe PCH 2 phenotype is caused by homozygosity for the common missense mutation A307S, while the severe phenotype seen in type 4 and 5 is caused by compound heterozygosity of the A307S mutation along with a nonsense or splice site mutation.

However, SCA6 has not been addressed adequately from India though it is common in the eastern Asian countries like, Japan, Korea and Thailand. The present study was undertaken to identify the prevalence of SCA6 in the city of Kolkata and the eastern part of India. 83 consecutive patients were recruited for the study of possible SCAs and their clinical features and genotype were investigated. 6 of the 83 subjects turned out positive for SCA6, constituting therefore, 13.33% of the patient pool. SCA6 is prevalent in the eastern part of India, though not as frequent as the other common varieties. Further community based studies are required in order to understand the magnitude of SCA6 in the eastern part, as well as in other regions of India.

Even among those who do, not all receive thrombolytic therapy. The objectives of this study were to determine the proportion of early arrival ischemic strokes (within 6 h of stroke onset) in our hospital and to evaluate the causes of nonadministration of intravenous and\/or intraarterial thrombolysis in them. Data of all early arrival acute stroke patients between January 2010 and January 2015 were included. Factors determining nonadministration of intravenous and\/or intraarterial thrombolysis in early arrival strokes were analyzed. Out of 2,593 stroke patients, only 145 (5.6%) patients presented within 6 h of stroke onset and among them 118 (81.4%) patients had ischemic stroke and 27 (18.6%) patients had hemorrhagic stroke. A total of 89\/118 (75.4%) patients were thrombolyzed. The reasons for nonadministration of thrombolysis in the remaining 29 patients were analyzed, which included unavoidable factors in 8\/29 patients [massive infarct (N = 4), hemorrhagic infarct (N = 1), gastrointestinal bleed (N = 1), oral anticoagulant usage with prolonged international normalized ratio (INR) (N = 1), and recent cataract surgery (N = 1)]. Avoidable factors were found for 21\/29 patients, include nonaffordability (N = 7), fear of bleed (N = 4), rapidly improving symptoms (N = 4), mild stroke (N = 2), delayed neurologist referral within the hospital (N = 2), and logistic difficulty in organizing endovascular treatment (N = 2). One-fourth of early ischemic stroke patients in our study were not thrombolyzed even though they arrived within the window period. The majority of the reasons for nonadministration of thrombolysis were potentially preventable, such as nonaffordability, intrahospital delay, and nonavailability of newer endovascular interventions.

We aimed to evaluate the effects of memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptor noncompetitive antagonist, on improving cognition and memory functions in epileptic patients with cognitive and memory impairment, who received anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). We did a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group trial, in SRM Medical College Hospital and Research Centre, Kattankulathur, Kancheepuram, Tamil Nadu, India between April 2013 and September 2013. Fifty-nine epileptic patients taking AEDs with subjective memory complaints were recruited and randomized to either Group 1 to receive 16 weeks of once-daily memantine, (5 mg for first 8 weeks, followed by memantine 10 mg for next 8 weeks) or Group 2 to receive once daily placebo. This trial is registered with Clinical Trial Registry of India CTRI\/2013\/04\/003573. Of 59 randomized patients, 55 patients completed the study (26 memantine and 29 placebo). Memantine group showed statistically significant improvement in total mini mental state examination score from baseline (P = 0.765) to 16(th) week (P &lt; 0.001) in comparison with the placebo. The Weshler's Memory Scale total score in memantine group improved significantly after 8 weeks (P = 0.002) compared with baseline (P = 0.873) and highly significant at the end of 16(th) week (P &lt; 0.001). The self-rated quality of life and memory in memantine group also significantly improved at the study end.

One hundred patients admitted in the NNICU of a tertiary care hospital for more than 24 h were included in the study. After detailed history, blood samples were collected from catheter hub and peripheral vein of all patients for culture, followed by identification and antibiotic sensitivity testing of the isolates. Out of 100 patients, laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infection (LCBI) was detected in 16 patients. Five patients had secondary BSI, while 11 had central venous catheter (CVC)-related primary BSI. Gram-positive organisms constituted 64% of the isolates, especially coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus. Increased duration of CVC was a significant risk factor for catheter-related BSI (CR-BSI).

An essential to label an acute headache as \"TCH\" and differentiate it from other \"sudden onset, severe headaches\" is the arbitrary time frame of 1 min from onset to peak intensity for \"TCH.\" What happens in practice, however, is that even those \"sudden onset, severe headaches\" that do not strictly fulfill the definition criteria are also labeled as \"TCH\" and investigated with the same speed and in the same sequence and managed based on the underlying cause. This article begins by questioning the validity and usefulness of this \"one minute\" arbitrary time frame to define \"TCH,\" particularly since this time frame is very difficult to assess in practice and is usually done on a presumptive subjective basis. The article concludes with suggestions for modification of the current investigation protocol for this emergency headache scenario. This proposal for \"a change in practice methodology\" is essentially based on (1) the fact that in the last two decades, we now have evidence for many more entities other than just subarachnoid hemorrhage that can present as \"TCH\" or \"sudden onset, severe headache\" and (2) the evidence from literature which shows that advances in imaging technology using higher magnet strength, better contrast, and newer acquisition sequences will result in a better diagnostic yield.

Among infective causes, chikungunya virus has been shown to produce a syndrome similar to myeloneuropathy. Vacuolar myelopathy seen in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is clinically very similar to subacute combined degeneration.

These peptides lead to a cascade of inflammatory tissue responses including arteriolar vasodilation, plasma protein extravasation, and degranulation of mast cells in their peripheral target tissue. Neurogenic inflammatory processes have long been implicated as a possible mechanism involved in the pathophysiology of various human diseases of the nervous system, respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract, urogenital tract, and skin. The recent development of several innovative experimental migraine models has provided evidence suggestive of the involvement of neuropeptides (SP, neurokinin A, and CGRP) in migraine headache. Antidromic stimulation of nociceptive fibers of the trigeminal nerve resulted in a neurogenic inflammatory response with marked increase in plasma protein extravasation from dural blood vessels by the release of various sensory neuropeptides. Several clinically effective abortive antimigraine medications, such as ergots and triptans, have been shown to attenuate the release of neuropeptide and neurogenic plasma protein extravasation. These findings provide support for the validity of using animal models to investigate mechanisms of neurogenic inflammation in migraine. These also further strengthen the notion of migraine being a neuroinflammatory disease.

Improved understanding of the molecular biology, pharmacology, and pathophysiology of neurogenic inflammation may provide the practitioner the context-specific feedback to identify the novel and most effective therapeutic approach to treatment. With this objective, the present review summarizes the evidence supporting the involvement of neurogenic inflammation and neuropeptides in the pathophysiology and pharmacology of migraine headache as well as its potential significance in better tailoring therapeutic interventions in migraine or other neurological disorders.

However, patients with TTH do not go for consultation. Even the prevalence of new daily persistent headache (NDPH) is 12 times higher at the headache clinic than that of chronic TTH (CTTH). These points hint that TTH patients probably do not want to visit the clinic. The author believes that it could be because of the stigma attached to \"tension.\" Herein, the author has noted the first responses given by 50 consecutive patients with TTH when they were told that they had been suffering from TTH. The first answer of 64% of patients with TTH was \"I do not have any tension\/stress.\" This denial is similar to the denial declared by patients with depression.

To evaluate EMG abnormalities and late progressive symptoms in limbs thought to be nonaffected by polio survivors, in order to determine the prevalence of subclinical motor neuron involvement in those fulfilling criteria for PPS comparing to those without such symptoms. Clinical and EMG findings of 464 limbs in 116 polio survivors who had been admitted to our clinic were analyzed. Affection of the limbs by polio was classified based on the patient's self-report on remote weakness during the acute phase of poliomyelitis, muscle strength measured by manual muscle testing, and four-limb needle EMG. Seventy-six of the patients (65.5%) met the criteria of PPS. Needle EMG studies revealed subclinical involvement in 122 out of 293 (42%) limbs with no history of remote weakness during the acute phase of poliomyelitis. Prevalence of subclinical involvement was found 47% in polio survivors who met the criteria of PPS compared to 33% in those without PPS (P = 0.013). Among the limbs that had developed new weakness in PPS patients, 33.5% had subclinical involvement. Subclinical involvement is common in limbs thought to be nonaffected by polio survivors, and this is especially present in those fulfilling criteria for PPS.

The diagnosis of these disorders is based on the detection of autoantibodies and characteristic clinical profiles. We aimed to study the antibody profile in encephalitis patients with suspected autoimmune etiology presenting to a tertiary care center. The subjects were selected by screening all patients with clinical profile suggesting autoimmune encephalitis admitted in the neuromedical intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary care center in South India. Patients who fulfilled modified Zuliani et al.'s, criteria for autoimmune encephalitis were identified during the period December 2009-June 2013. Blood samples from these subjects were screened for six neuronal antibodies. Chi-square test was applied to compare the antibody positive and negative patients. Out of 1,227 patients screened, 39 subjects (14 males: 25 females) were identified with a mean age of 15.95 years and 19 cases were assessed in the acute and 20 in the convalescent phase of the illness. Seizure (87.8 %) was the most common presenting symptom; status epilepticus occurred in 23 (60.5%) patients during the course of the illness. Fourteen (35.9%) patients were N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antibody-positive and all were negative for the other antibodies tested. One-third of patients presenting with acute noninfective encephalitis would be positive for NMDAR antibodies with the remaining two-thirds with clinically suspected autoimmune encephalitis being antibody-negative.

However, due to their limited availability, histopathological interpretation of muscle biopsies still remains an important component of diagnostic approach to muscle diseases. A systematic methodology is required in the evaluation and interpretation of muscle biopsies. This study was undertaken to analyze the histopathological spectrum of 164 muscle biopsies and to assess the diagnostic yield of basic histopathological procedures in the work up of muscle biopsy. Retrospective analysis was done for 164 cases of muscle biopsies. Step-wise approach was adopted to assess the efficacy of routine stains, enzyme histochemistry, and immunohistochemistry. Based on hematoxylin and rosin (H and E) appearance, biopsies were broadly categorized into destructive, nondestructive but myopathic, and inflammatory morphology. Role of special stains, enzyme, and immunohistochemical stains in each category was then evaluated. On the basis of histopathological features, 164 muscle biopsies were broadly categorized into biopsies with abnormal histopathological features (115) and biopsies with normal histopathology (49). Abnormal muscle biopsies were further categorized into destructive morphology (56.5%), nondestructive but myopathic morphology (30.5%), and inflammatory pathology (13%). A near definitive diagnosis could be made in 115 cases out of 164 muscle biopsies on the basis of routine histopathology, enzyme histochemistry, and immunohistochemistry. Though advanced techniques like electron microscopy, western blotting, and molecular genetics are essential for confirmatory diagnosis, a substantive diagnostic yield can be offered with the basic armamentarium of routine (frozen) stains, enzyme histochemistry, and immunohistochemistry.

An incomplete anterior and posterior CW was found in 66 (22%) The remaining 184 (61.3%) subjects had partially complete CW configuration. The most common type of CW in a single subject was anterior variant type A and posterior type variant E. We observed wide variation in CW configuration in our patients. The prevalence of complete configuration of the circle is 16.6%; slightly higher in females and younger subjects. Complete anterior circle was present in 77.3%. Most common anterior variant is type A (normal anterior configuration) with a prevalence of 66%. The most common posterior circle variant is type E (hypoplasia or absence of both PcomA) with 32.6%.

This review (second of the two part series) was carried out to understand the social impact and economic burden to develop comprehensive program for control and prevention of epilepsy. Epilepsy is known to have adverse effect on education, employment, marriage, and other essential social opportunities. Economic burden associated with epilepsy is very high with treatment and travel costs emerging as an important contributing factor. A vicious cycle between economic burden and poor disease outcome is clear. There is no significant change in the perception, stigma, and discrimination of epilepsy across the country despite improvement in educational and social parameters over the time. The huge treatment gap and poor quality of life is further worsened by the associated comorbidities and conditions. Thus, a multidisciplinary response is needed to address the burden and impact of epilepsy which calls for an integrated and multipronged approach for epilepsy care, prevention, and rehabilitation.

For relapse prevention, immunosuppressive agents that have been found to be effective are azathioprine, rituximab, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, and mitoxantrone; although none of which have been validated in randomized, controlled trial. Some patients do relapse with monotherapy, and switching to more effective agent or use of combination therapy is beneficial in such situation.

Enzyme inducing AEDs such as phenobarbitone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and oxcarbazepine increase the metabolism of orally administered estrogen (and progesterone to a lesser extent). Estrogen can increase the metabolism of certain AEDs, such as lamotrigine, leading to cyclical variation in its blood level with resultant adverse effect profile or seizure dyscontrol.

Thirty patients with acute bacterial meningitis with no prior treatment were evaluated. Cortisol levels were compared with 20 patients with aseptic (viral) meningitis and 25 control subjects. Mean CSF cortisol level was 13.85, 3.47, and 1.05 in bacterial meningitis, aseptic meningitis, and controls, respectively. Mean CSF cortisol level in bacterial meningitis was significantly higher as compared to controls (P &lt; 0.001). There was significant difference in CSFcortisol levels in bacterial and aseptic meningitis (P &lt; 0.001). Cortisol levels in CSF are highly elevated in patients with acute bacterial meningitis.

Early recognition and accurate classification of MCI-PD could offer opportunities for novel therapeutic interventions to improve the natural pathologic course. To investigate the clinical phenotype of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and in patients with PD and MCI (MCI-PD). Seventy-three patients with aMCI and in 38 patients with MCI-PD were enrolled. They all underwent Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE), the Rey auditory-verbal learning test and the immediate visual memory (IVM) item of the Mental Deterioration Battery, the Rey auditory-verbal learning test included the Rey-immediate (Rey-I), and the delayed recall of the word list (Rey test deferred, Rey-D). The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was used for mood assessment. The results of the Rey-I and Rey-D and of the IVM item showed statistically significant differences between the aMCI and the MCI-PD group. The mean Rey-I and Rey-D score was significantly lower as well as the IVM score was higher in patients with aMCI than in those with MCI-PD, aMCI patients showed greater impairment in long-term memory, whereas more aMCI than MCI-PD patients had preserved attention, computation, praxis, and conceptualization.

Patients with neurological abnormalities on history and examination were further assessed by a neurologist to determine the type of disorder present. The frequency of auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder was 1.12%. Sixty percent were found to have neurological involvement. This included cerebral palsy in children, peripheral neuropathy (PN), spinocerebellar ataxia, hereditary motor-sensory neuropathy, spastic paresis, and ponto-bulbar palsy. Neurological lesions did not present simultaneously with hearing loss in most patients. Sixty-six percent of patients with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder were born of consanguineous marriages. There is a high prevalence of neurological lesions in auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder which has to be kept in mind while evaluating such patients.

The mechanism of protein aggregation involves conformation switch of the native protein, oligomer formation leading to protofibrils and finally mature fibrils. Mature fibrils have long been considered as the cause of disease pathogenesis; however, recent evidences suggest oligomeric intermediates formed during fibrillization to be toxic. In this review, we have tried to address the ongoing debate for these toxic amyloid species. We did an extensive literature search and collated information from Pubmed (http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and Google search using various permutations and combinations of the following keywords: Neurodegeneration, amyloid disorders, protein aggregation, fibrils, oligomers, toxicity, Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease. We describe different instances showing the toxicity of mature fibrils as well as oligomers in Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease. Distinct structural framework and morphology of amyloid oligomers suggests difference in toxic effect between oligomers and fibrils. We highlight the difference in structure and proposed toxicity pathways for fibrils and oligomers. We also highlight the evidences indicating that intermediary oligomeric species can act as potential diagnostic biomarker. Since the formation of these toxic species follow a common structural switch among various amyloid disorders, the protein aggregation events can be targeted for developing broad-range therapeutics. The therapeutic trials based on the understanding of different protein conformers (monomers, oligomers, protofibrils and fibrils) in amyloid cascade are also described.

This systematic review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Major databases were searched to examine the neuropsychological studies of adults with MG. Weighted effect sizes were pooled by cognitive domain. Eight studies representing 300 subjects were included. Eight cognitive domain categories were identified: (i) Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), (ii) language, (iii) processing speed, (iv) verbal learning and memory, (v) visual learning and memory, (vi) attention span, (vii) response fluency, and (viii) motor performance. Nine (cognitive domain categories, MMSE, language, processing speed, verbal learning and memory (except for delayed recall memory), and motor performance) of 16 cognitive tasks revealed significant moderate effect sizes. Verbal logical-delayed memory, finger tapping with the preferred hand, and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test showed a greater magnitude relationship to cognitive function than did other specific cognitive domains. Verbal learning and memory seems to be the most significant affected according to cognitive domain categories. For MG, the ability of attention, response fluency, visual learning, and memory seems to be reserved. The MG patients seem to perform significantly worse than the non-MG controls in a range of cognitive domains.

T2-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging showed extensive hyperintensity of the bilateral periventricular and subcortical white matter and the globus pallidus. Brain single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with technetium-99 ethylene cysteine dimer showed inhomogeneous perfusion in the cerebral cortex, with decreased uptake in bilateral frontal regions. Delayed encephalopathy after acute CO intoxication was diagnosed, and the symptoms gradually improved after hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). This case report demonstrates that generalized chorea may be one of the initial presenting symptoms of delayed encephalopathy after acute CO intoxication.

Selection of the patient for thrombolysis depends on the careful assessment for the risk of post thrombolysis symptomatic haemorrhage (6.2-8.9%) which may be fatal. Atrial myxomas which are the commonest tumors of the heart are associated with stroke due to tumor\/clot embolism. There are very few case reports of IVT and its outcome in patients with atrial myxoma with stroke. Some have reported successful thrombolysis, while others have reported intracerebral bleeding.

These were initially diagnosed as seizures and he was started on multiple antiepileptics which did not show any response. After a normal video electroencephalogram (VEEG) was documented, possibility of dyskinesia was kept. However, when he did not respond to symptomatic therapy, Sandifer syndrome was thought of and GER scan was done, which revealed severe GER. After his symptoms got reduced to some extent, a detailed clinical examination revealed abnormal facies with flaccid quadriparesis. Muscle biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of a specific congenital myopathy. On antireflux measures, those episodic paroxysms reduced to some extent. Partial response to therapy in GER should prompt search for an underlying secondary etiology.

There is little knowledge on detection of disorders of lipid metabolism by acylcarnitine profile (ACP) analysis by tandem mass spectrometry outside the neonatal period particularly in cases with recurrent rhabdomyolysis first presenting in adolescence and adulthood. Two adolescent female cases presented with episodes of rhabdomyolysis and muscle weakness. A 13-year-old patient had five episodes of rhabdomyolysis triggered by infections. Tandem mass spectrometry was normal. A 16-year-old female patient was hospitalized eight times due to recurrent rhabdomyolysis. Increased levels of C14:2, C14:1, and C14 were determined in tandem mass spectrometry. Final diagnoses were carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT II) deficiency and very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency.

A cohort of 23 patients with a-MCI aged between 55-80 years diagnosed as per current criteria and 23 group matched cognitively normal healthy controls (CNHC) were studied. The measures of acquisition and delayed recall were the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) and Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS)-III (verbal and visual subsets) and Delayed Matching-to-sample Test (DMS)-48. Test scores of M-ACE registration and recall scores were included. To examine the differences in test performances between the groups, we compared the number of subjects with test scores less than 1.5 standard deviation (SD) of the control scores. Comparisons between a-MCI and controls were drawn using Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney U tests. M-ACE registration component ascertained on a 24-point scale failed to demonstrate any differences between a-MCI and controls (P = 0.665) as opposed to recall judged on a cumulative 10-point scale (P = 0.001). Significant differences were noted in RAVLT list learning (P &lt; 0.001) and list recall (P = 0.003), WMS-III paragraph learning (P &lt;0.001) and recall (P = 0.007), visual learning (P = 0.004) and recall (P = 0.001). M-ACE recall scores are an effective screening tool to identify patients with suspected a-MCI. Both word list and paragraph learning and recall components have been found to be sensitive to concretely identify a-MCI and impairment on at least 2 tests should be considered in the diagnostic criteria of MCI rather than rely on a single screening battery.

","1284":"Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most prevalent form of complex partial seizures with temporal lobe origin of electrical abnormality. Studies have shown that recurrent seizures affect all aspects of cognitive functioning, including memory, language, praxis, executive functions, and social judgment, among several others. In this article, we will review these cognitive impairments along with their neuropathological correlates in a comprehensive manner. We will see that neuropsychological deficits are prevalent in TLE. Much of the effort has been laid on memory due to the notion that temporal lobe brain structures involved in TLE play a central role in consolidating information into memory. It seems that damage to the mesial structure of the temporal lobe, particularly the amygdale and hippocampus, has the main role in these memory difficulties and the neurobiological plausibility of the role of the temporal lobe in different aspects of memory. Here, we will cover the sub-domains of working memory and episodic memory deficits. This is we will further proceed to evaluate the evidences of executive function deficits in TLE and will see that set-shifting among other EFs is specifically affected in TLE as is social cognition. Finally, critical components of language related deficits are also found in the form of word-finding difficulties. To conclude, TLE affects several of cognitive function domains, but the etiopathogenesis of all these dysfunctions remain elusive.

Subjects with MCI formed one-third (113\/371) of this memory clinic sample from a private hospital. MCI could be effectively diagnosed and subtyped using a brief cognitive scale (Concise Cognitive Test (CONCOG)). The amnestic MCI (single and multiple domains) subtype comprised the majority of cases with MCI. In a subsample of 33 patients, lacunar infarcts were more common than white matter lesions and hippocampal atrophy and were inversely associated with verbal fluency.

A total of 91 patients were included. 62 patients who had normal routine and LTEEG entered the final phase of the study were followed-up regularly for 1 year or until seizure recurrence whichever was earlier. A total number of 91 patients were enrolled for the first phase of the study. Of these, 13 (14.29%) patients had an abnormal routine EEG. Of the remaining patients, another 16 (17.58%) had abnormal LTEEG. The remaining 62 patients with normal routine and long-term EEG entered the final phase of the study. Of these, 17 patients (27.41%) had seizure recurrence during the follow-up while 45 (72.58%) remained seizure free until the end of the 1 year follow-up. The significant variables associated with a higher risk of seizure relapse were a positive past history of seizure recurrence on prior drug withdrawal (relative risk: 2.19, confidence interval: 1.01-4.74, P &lt; 0.05) and the duration of epilepsy until seizure control was achieved (P &lt; 0.009). The recurrence rate of seizure in patients with a normal LTEEG is 27.41%. A positive past history of seizure recurrence and a longer time to achieve seizure freedom with AED increased the risk of seizure recurrence.

Quantitative analysis of the hippocampus using volumetry is commonly being used in the diagnosis of MTS and is being used as a marker in prognostication of seizure control. Although normative data for hippocampal volume (HV) is available for the western population, no such data is available for the Indian population. The aim of the study was to establish normative data for HV for the Indian population, which can aid in the accurate diagnosis of MTS. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 200 healthy volunteers were acquired using a 3 Tesla (3T) MRI scanner. Manual segmentation and volumetry was done using Siemens Syngo software. The data was analyzed using two tailed t-test to detect associations between HV and age, gender, and education. The data so obtained was also correlated with the data available from the rest of the world. A mean HV of 2.411 cm(3) (standard deviation -0.299) was found in the study, which was significantly smaller when compared to the data from the western population. The right hippocampus was larger than the left, with a mean volume of 2.424 cm(3) and 2.398 cm(3), respectively. HV was detected to be significantly higher in males. No association was found between HV and age and education. The values obtained in this study may be adopted as a standard in the evaluation of patients with intractable epilepsy. ","1310":"Pregnancy in women with epilepsy (WWE) who are on anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) has two- to three-fold increased risk of fetal malformations. AEDs are mostly metabolized by Cyp2C9, Cyp2C19 and Cyp3A4 and transported by ABCB1. Patients on AED therapy can have folate deficiency. We hypothesize that the polymorphisms in ABCB1, Cyp2C9, Cyp2C19 and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) might result in differential expression resulting in differential drug transport, drug metabolism and folate metabolism, which in turn may contribute to the teratogenic impact of AEDs. The ABCB1, Cyp2C9, Cyp2C19 and MTHFR polymorphisms were genotyped for their role in teratogenic potential and the nature of teratogenecity in response to AED treatment in WWE. The allelic, genotypic associations were tested in 266 WWE comprising of 143 WWE who had given birth to babies with WWE-malformation (WWE-M) and 123 WWE who had normal offsprings (WWE-N). In WWE-M, CC genotype of Ex07 + 139C\/T was overrepresented (P = 0.0032) whereas the poor metabolizer allele *2 and *2 *2 genotype of CYP2C219 was significantly higher in comparison to WWE-N group (P = 0.007 and P = 0.005, respectively). All these observations were independent of the nature of malformation (cardiac vs. non cardiac malformations). Our study indicates the possibility that ABCB1 and Cyp2C19 may play a pivotal role in the AED induced teratogenesis, which is independent of nature of malformation. This is one of the first reports indicating the pharmacogenetic role of Cyp2C19 and ABCB1 in teratogenesis of AED in pregnant WWE.

However, several diagnostic dilemmas persist regarding the nosological status of this condition. Teasing out these individual diagnostic problems is important not only for administering appropriate therapy, but also for preventing them from the unnecessary diagnostic assessments towards the other diagnoses. Thus, it is important to have a detailed knowledge of the cognitive or neuropsychological deficits in this condition. In this review, we start by addressing the important issue of diagnostic confusion between dementia and pseudo-dementia. Subsequently, we proceed by reviewing the present scientific literature on the cognitive deficits found in this clinical condition. For the sake of convenience, we will divide the cognitive deficits into: Memory deficitsExecutive function deficits andDeficits in speech and language domains. Finally, we will look at the progression of this condition to see the components of this condition, which can be actually called \"Pseudo\". ","1342":"In pre-surgical evaluation of epilepsy, there has been an increased interest in the study of electroencephalogram (EEG) activity outside the 1-70 Hz band of conventional frequency activity (CFA). Research over the last couple of decades has shown that EEG activity in the 70-600 Hz range, termed high frequency oscillations (HFOs), can be recorded intracranially from all brain regions both interictally and at seizure onset. In patients with epilepsy, HFOs are now considered as pathologic regardless of their frequency band although it may be difficult to distinguish them from the physiologic HFOs, which occur in a similar frequency range. Interictal HFOs are likely to be confined mostly to the seizure onset zone, thus providing a new measure for localizing it. More importantly, several studies have linked HFOs to underlying epileptogenicity, suggesting that HFOs can serve as potential biomarkers for the illness. Along with HFOs, analysis of ictal baseline shifts (IBS; or direct current shifts) and infraslow activity (ISA) (ISA: &lt;0.1 Hz) has also attracted attention. Studies have shown that: IBSs can be recorded using the routine AC amplifiers with long time constants; IBSs occur at the time of conventional EEG onset, but in a restricted spatial distribution compared with conventional frequencies; and inclusion of IBS contacts in the resection can be associated with favorable seizure outcome. Only a handful of studies have evaluated all the EEG frequencies together in the same patient group. The latter studies suggest that the seizure onset is best localized by the ictal HFOs, the IBSs tend to provide a broader localization and the conventional frequencies could be non-localizing. However, small number of patients included in these studies precludes definitive conclusions regarding post-operative seizure outcome based on selective or combined resection of HFO, IBS and CFA contacts. Large, preferably prospective, studies are needed to further evaluate the implications of different EEG frequencies in epilepsy.

The biological basis of stimulation of anterior thalamic nucleus and epileptogenic focus is presented. Results from two large randomized controlled trials Stimulation of Anterior Nucleus of Thalamus for Epilepsy (SANTE) and Neuropace pivotal trial are discussed. Neuromodulation provides effective treatment for a select group of refractory epilepsy patients. Future investigations into the mechanism underlying 'response' to brain stimulation are desired. ","1344":"Electroencephalography (EEG) remains a \"gold standard\" for defining seizures; hence identification of epileptogenic zone for surgical treatment of epilepsy requires precise electrographic localization of the seizures. Routine scalp EEG recording is not sufficient in many instances, such as extratemporal lobe epilepsy or non-lesional temporal lobe epilepsy. In these individuals EEG recording from proximity of the seizure focus is necessary, which can be achieved by placing electrodes on the surface or in the substance of the brain. As this process requires invasive procedures (usually necessitating surgical intervention) EEG obtained via these electrodes is defined as invasive electroencephalography (iEEG). As only limited areas of the brain can be covered by these electrodes in an individual, precise targeting of the presumed seizure onset location is crucial. The presurgical planning includes where to place electrodes, which type of the electrodes to choose and planned duration of the intracranial recording. Though there are general principles that guide such endeavor, each center does it slightly differently depending upon the various technologies available to them and expertise and preferences of the epilepsy surgery team. Here we describe our approach to iEEG recording. We briefly describe the background, types of iEEG recording and rationale for each, various electrode types, and scenarios where iEEG might be useful. We also describe planning of iEEG recording once the need has been established as well as our decision making process of deciding about location of electrode placement, type of electrodes to use, length of recording, choice of arrays, mapping of eloquent cortex and finally surgical planning and decisions. ","1345":"A structural brain lesion in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) greatly increases the likelihood of identification of the seizure focus and ultimately seizure-free outcome following resective epilepsy surgery. In contrast, surgical outcomes of true non-lesional DRE are less favorable. Therefore, discovery of an underlying lesion is paramount in the pre-surgical work-up of patients with DRE. Over the years, the surgical treatment of pharmacoresistant epilepsy has evolved from straightforward lesional cases to include cases with hippocampal sclerosis. With the advent of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), most cases of mesial temporal sclerosis became more easily identifiable on pre-operative neuroimaging. With the widespread use of high-resolution MRI with epilepsy protocols over the last two decades, our ability to visualize subtle structural changes has been greatly enhanced. However, there are some cases of lesional epilepsy, which remain unidentified on these routine MRIs. In such \"non-lesional\" refractory epilepsies, further investigation with advanced neuroimaging techniques, including metabolic imaging, as well as electrophysiological studies may help to identify the previously non-visualized focal brain abnormalities. In this review, we outline the current status for evaluation of MRI-negative DRE. ","1346":"Approximately 60% of all patients with epilepsy suffer from focal epilepsy syndromes. In about 15% of these patients, the seizures are not adequately controlled with antiepileptic drugs; such patients are potential candidates for surgical treatment and the major proportion is in the pediatric group (18 years old or less). Epilepsy surgery in children who have been carefully chosen can result in either seizure freedom or a marked (&gt;90%) reduction in seizures in approximately two-thirds of children with intractable seizures. Advances in structural and functional neuroimaging, neurosurgery, and neuroanaesthesia have improved the outcomes of surgery for children with intractable epilepsy. Early surgery improves the quality of life and cognitive and developmental outcome and allows the child to lead a normal life. Surgically remediable epilepsies should be identified early and include temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis, lesional temporal and extratemporal epilepsy, hemispherical epilepsy, and gelastic epilepsy with hypothalamic hamartoma. These syndromes have both acquired and congenital etiologies and can be treated by resective or disconnective surgery. Palliative procedures are performed in children with diffuse and multifocal epilepsies who are not candidates for resective surgery. The palliative procedures include corpus callosotomy and vagal nerve stimulation while deep brain stimulation in epilepsy is still under evaluation. For children with \"surgically remediable epilepsy,\" surgery should be offered as a procedure of choice rather than as a treatment of last resort. ","1347":"The association between neurocysticercosis (NCC) and epilepsy is well known and NCC is an important risk factor for epileptic seizures in many Taenia solium-endemic regions of the world. However, while the relationship between NCC and epilepsy is well known, the association between NCC and medically refractory (or surgically remediable epilepsy) has received little attention in the past. Our experience and review of the sparse literature available suggests that NCC is causally related to surgically remediable epilepsy albeit uncommonly so and that association derives its underpinnings from several different scenarios: (1) Medically refractory lesional epilepsy, in which seizures arise from the vicinity of the calcified neurocysticercus lesion (CNL), (2) Medically refractory epilepsy with dual pathology type of relationship between the hippocampal sclerosis (HS) and CNL in which both have been unequivocally demonstrated to give rise to independent seizures and (3) Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy due to HS with a distantly-located CNL, which is in itself not epileptogenic. A major point of controversy revolves around whether or not there exists a causal association between the CNL and HS. We believe that an association exists between NCC and HS and the most important factor influencing this association is the location of the CNL. Furthermore, NCC is a risk factor for medically-refractory epilepsy and that this might account for a considerable proportion of the intractable epilepsy population in endemic regions; the association has been largely ignored owing to the lack of availability of presurgical work-up facilities in these regions. Finally, from a clinical standpoint of presurgical evaluation, patients with CNL and HS should be evaluated on a case by case basis owing to disparate settings underlying the association. ","1348":"Functional neuro-imaging techniques are helpful in the pre-surgical evaluation of epilepsy for localization of the epileptogenic zone as ancillary tools to electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or when other localization techniques are normal, non-concordant or discordant. Positron emission tomography (PET) and ictal single photon emission computed tomography (ictal SPECT) imaging are traditional tests that have been reported to have good sensitivity and specificity although the results are better with more expertise as is true for any technique. More recently magnetoencephalogram\/magnetic source imaging (MEG\/MSI), diffusion tensor imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have been used in localization and functional mapping during the pre-surgical work-up of epilepsy. Newer techniques such as fMRI-EEG, functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging and near infra-red spectroscopy, magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magneto nanoparticles hold promise for further development that could then be applied in the work-up of epilepsy surgery.

It is also the substrate of refractory epilepsy that gives the most gratifying results in any epilepsy surgery program, with a minimum use of resources. Correlation of clinical behavior and the ictal patterns during ictal behavior is mandatory for success at epilepsy surgery. Video electroencephalogram (EEG) telemetry achieves this goal and hence plays a pivotal role in pre-surgical assessment. The role of telemetry is continuously evolving with the advent of digital EEG technology, of high-resolution volumetric magnetic resonance imaging and other functional imaging techniques. Most of surgical selection in patients with TLE can be done with a scalp video EEG monitoring. However, the limitations of the scalp EEG technique demand invasive recordings in a selected group of TLE patients. This subset of the patients can be a challenge to the epileptologist. ","1351":"Successful epilepsy surgery depends on the localization of the seizure onset zone in an area of the brain that can be safely resected. Defining these zones uses multiple diagnostic approaches, which include different types of electroencephalography (EEG) and imaging, and the results are best when all of the tests point to the same region. Although EEG obtained with scalp recordings is often sufficient for the purposes of localization, there are times when intracranial recordings directly from the brain are needed; but the planning, use, value, and interpretation of the these recordings are not standardized, in part because the questions that are to be answered vary considerably across many patients and their heterogenous types of epilepsy that are investigated. Furthermore, there is a desire to use the opportunity of direct brain recordings to understand the pathophysiology of epilepsy, as these recordings are viewed as an opportunity to answer questions that cannot be otherwise answered. In this review, we examine the situations that may require intracranial electrodes and discuss the broad issues that this powerful diagnostic tool can help address, for identifying the seizure focus and for understanding the large scale circuits of the seizures. ","1352":"The success of an epilepsy surgery program depends upon the early identification of potential surgical candidates and selecting from them, ideal candidates for surgery, who are destined to have a post-operative seizure-free outcome without any unacceptable neurological deficits. Since epilepsy surgery centers in resource-poor countries will lack the full range of state-of-the-art technologies usually available in resource-rich countries to perform pre-surgical evaluation, cost-effectively utilization of the locally available investigative facilities to select the surgical candidates becomes challenging. In the present era of rapid electronic communications and telemedicine, it has become possible for epilepsy surgery centers to pool their technological and human resources and to partner with centers nationally and internationally in implementing pre-surgical evaluation strategies.

There is a lack of consensus upon its semantic definition of whether it is status epilepticus that continues despite treatment with benzodiazepine and one antiepileptic medication (AED), i.e., Lorazepam + phenytoin. Others regard refractory status epilepticus as failure of benzodiazepine and 2 antiepileptic medications, i.e., Lorazepam + phenytoin + phenobarb. Up to 30% patients in SE fail to respond to two antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and 15% continue to have seizure activity despite use of three drugs. Mechanisms that have made the treatment even more challenging are GABA-R that is internalized during status epilepticus and upregulation of multidrug transporter proteins. All patients of refractory status epilepticus require continuous EEG monitoring. There are three main agents used in the treatment of RSE. These include pentobarbital or thiopental, midazolam and propofol.

Many people with active epilepsy do not receive appropriate treatment for their condition, leading to large treatment gap.

Infectious diseases play an important role in seizures and long-term burden causing both new-onset epilepsy and status epilepticus. Proper education and appropriate health care services can make tremendous change in a country like India. There have been many original researches in various aspects of epilepsy across India. Some of the geographically specific epilepsies occur only in certain regions of our country which have been highlighted by authors.

","1355":"Status epilepticus (SE) is an emergency neurological problem, more common in the developing countries due to high incidence of infection, stroke and head injury. The protocol for management of SE is intravenous benzodiazepine, followed by phenytoin, valproate (VPA) and phenobarbitone and if uncontrolled general anesthesia (GA). World Federation of Neurology recommends special guidelines for resource poor countries. Use of GA results in hypotension and respiratory depression needing intensive care management. There is a paucity of intensive care facilities hence the recommended antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) which have inherent toxicity of hypotension and respiratory failure cannot be given safely. Under these situations AEDs such as VPA, levetiracetam and lacosamide may be evaluated in SE because of cardiovascular and respiratory safety profile. In this review, the limitations of existing guidelines in the developing countries have been discussed and a way forward has been suggested. ","1356":"The elderly are generally defined as those over 60 or 65 years old, but they are a heterogeneous group and may be subdivided into categories based on age and health status. The incidence of epilepsy is highest in the elderly. With a progressive increase in life expectancy, this is the fastest growing segment of patients with epilepsy. Older patients most often have focal seizures, with less prominent auras and automatisms, and longer duration of postictal confusion compared to younger patients. Status epilepticus is common and has a high mortality. The most common specific etiology is cerebrovascular disease, but the cause remains unknown in many patients. Diagnosis can be challenging because of several patient-related, physician-related and investigation-related factors. Over-diagnosis and under-diagnosis are common. Treatment is complicated by the presence of physiological changes related to aging, co-morbidities and cognitive problems as well as concerns regarding drug interactions and medication adherence. Seizures can be controlled in most patients with low doses of a single anti-epileptic drug (AED). Tolerability is an important factor in selection of an AED, as elderly patients tend to be highly sensitive to side effects. Drug-resistant epilepsy is uncommon. Epilepsy surgery, especially temporal lobectomy, can be performed in older patients with good results. More studies addressing the pathophysiological mechanisms of epilepsy in this age group, and greater inclusion of the elderly in clinical trials, as well as development of comprehensive care models are needed to provide optimal care to these patients. ","1357":"A multidisciplinary approach is required to understand the complex intricacies of drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). A challenge that neurosurgeons across the world face is accurate localization of epileptogenic zone. A significant number of patients who have undergone resective brain surgery for epilepsy still continue to have seizures. The reason behind this therapy resistance still eludes us. Thus to develop a cure for the difficult to treat epilepsy, we need to comprehensively study epileptogenesis. Till date, most of the studies on DRE is focused on undermining the abnormal functioning of receptors involved in synaptic transmission and reduced levels of antiepileptic drugs around there targets. But recent advances in imaging and electrophysiological techniques have suggested the role epileptogenic networks in the process of epileptogenesis. According to this hypothesis, the local neurons recruit distant neurons through complex oscillatory circuits, which further recruit more distant neurons, thereby generating a hypersynchronus neuronal activity. The epileptogenic networks may be confined to the lesion or could propagate to distant focus. The success of surgery depends on the precision by which the epileptogenic network is determined while planning a surgical intervention. Here, we summarize various modalities of electrophysiological and imaging techniques to determine the functionally active epileptogenic networks. We also review evidence pertaining to the proposed role of epileptogenic network in abnormal synaptic transmission which is one of the major causes of epileptiform activity. Elucidation of current concepts in regulation of synaptic transmission by networks will help develop therapies for epilepsy cases that cannot be managed pharmacologically. ","1358":"While there are over one million people with drug-resistant epilepsy in India, today, there are only a handful of centers equipped to undertake presurgical evaluation and epilepsy surgery. The only solution to overcome this large surgical treatment gap is to establish comprehensive epilepsy care centers across the country that are capable of evaluating and selecting the patients for epilepsy surgery with the locally available technology and in a cost-effective manner. The National Epilepsy Surgery Support Activity (NESSA) aims to provide proper guidance and support in establishing epilepsy surgery programs across India and in neighboring resource-poor countries, and in sustaining them.

This pictorial essay with the illustrative case examples provides an overview of the various surgical techniques for the management of drug-resistant focal epilepsy. ","1360":"Surgical decision-making is a complex process. First, a medical decision is made to determine if surgery is necessary. Second, another medical decision is made to determine the type of surgery. Third, a corporate decision is made if such a surgery is financially feasible. Finally, a legal decision is made to proceed or refuse the chosen surgery. This paper examines these issues in the case of surgery for medically intractable epilepsy and proposes a method of decision analysis to guide epilepsy surgery. A stochastic game of imperfect information using techniques of game theory and decision analysis is introduced as an analytical tool for surgical decision-making. Surgery for appropriately chosen patients suffering from medically intractable epilepsy may not only be feasible, but may be the best medical option and the best financial option for the patient, families, society and the healthcare system. Such a situation would then make it legally or ethically difficult to reject or postpone surgery for these patients. A process to collect data to quantify the parameters used in the decision analysis is hereby proposed. ","1361":"Epilepsy is one of the most common serious neurological conditions, and 30 to 40% of people with epilepsy have seizures that are not controlled by medication. Patients are considered to have refractory epilepsy if disabling seizures continue despite appropriate trials of two antiseizure drugs, either alone or in combination. At this point, patients should be referred to multidisciplinary epilepsy centers that perform specialized diagnostic testing to first determine whether they are, in fact, pharmacoresistant, and then, if so, offer alternative treatments. Apparent pharmacoresistance can result from a variety of situations, including noncompliance, seizures that are not epileptic, misdiagnosis of the seizure type or epilepsy syndrome, inappropriate use of medication, and lifestyle issues. For patients who are pharmacoresistant, surgical treatment offers the best opportunity for complete freedom from seizures. Surgically remediable epilepsy syndromes have been identified, but patients with more complicated epilepsy can also benefit from surgical treatment and require more specialized evaluation, including intracranial EEG monitoring. For patients who are not surgical candidates, or who are unwilling to consider surgery, a variety of other alternative treatments can be considered, including peripheral or central neurostimulation, ketogenic diet, and complementary and alternative approaches. When such alternative treatments are not appropriate or effective, quality of life can still be greatly improved by the psychological and social support services offered by multidisciplinary epilepsy centers. A major obstacle remains the fact that only a small proportion of patients with refractory epilepsy are referred for expert evaluation and treatment. ","1362":"Magnetoencephalography (MEG) non-invasively measures the magnetic field generated due to the excitatory postsynaptic electrical activity of the apical dendritic pyramidal cells. Such a tiny magnetic field is measured with the help of the biomagnetometer sensors coupled with the Super Conducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) inside the magnetically shielded room (MSR). The subjects are usually screened for the presence of ferromagnetic materials, and then the head position indicator coils, electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes (if measured simultaneously), and fiducials are digitized using a 3D digitizer, which aids in movement correction and also in transferring the MEG data from the head coordinates to the device and voxel coordinates, thereby enabling more accurate co-registration and localization. MEG data pre-processing involves filtering the data for environmental and subject interferences, artefact identification, and rejection. Magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI) is processed for correction and identifying fiducials. After choosing and computing for the appropriate head models (spherical or realistic; boundary\/finite element model), the interictal\/ictal epileptiform discharges are selected and modeled by an appropriate source modeling technique (clinically and commonly used - single equivalent current dipole - ECD model). The equivalent current dipole (ECD) source localization of the modeled interictal epileptiform discharge (IED) is considered physiologically valid or acceptable based on waveform morphology, isofield pattern, and dipole parameters (localization, dipole moment, confidence volume, goodness of fit). Thus, MEG source localization can aid clinicians in sublobar localization, lateralization, and grid placement, by evoking the irritative\/seizure onset zone. It also accurately localizes the eloquent cortex-like visual, language areas. MEG also aids in diagnosing and delineating multiple novel findings in other neuropsychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinsonism, Traumatic brain injury, autistic disorders, and so oon. ","1363":"Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is the measurement of the magnetic field generated by the electrical activity of neurons. It is usually combined with a magnetic resonance imaging to get what is called magnetic source imaging. The technology that has helped record these minute magnetic fields is super-conducting quantum interference detector which is like a highly sensitive magnetic field meter. To attenuate the external magnetic noise the MEG is housed inside a magnetically shielded room. The actual sensors recording magnetic fields are magnetometers and\/or gradiometers. MEG fields pass through the head without any distortion. This is a significant advantage of MEG over electroencephalography. MEG provides a high spatial and temporal resolution. The recording and identification information should be according to the American Clinical Magnetoencephalography Society guidelines published in 2011. MEG currently has two approved indications in the United States, one is for pre-operative brain mapping and the other is for use in epilepsy surgery.

Here we report a patient with NMO in whom refractory vomiting and hiccups were the sole manifestation of the first attack. Diagnosis can be missed at this stage leading to delay in treatment and further complications. This case demonstrates the importance of considering NMO in any patient presenting with refractory vomiting and hiccups and with local and metabolic causes ruled out and linear medullary lesion on magnetic resonance imaging may indicate the diagnosis even when the classical clinical criteria are not met.

The sample consisted of 48 healthy older adults and 29 people with dementia, who were evaluated in an Outpatient Care Unit in a University Reference Center in Rio de Janeiro. Regression analyses indicated that the best predictors for activities of daily living were performance in immediate verbal memory in the case of controls and in a categorical fluency task in the patient group. The educational level itself was not a significant predictor of functional ability in either sample, but showed moderate correlation with the predictors.

Fifty-one consecutive patients were evaluated 1 month before, and 12 months after bilateral STN DBS. All patients were rated using Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life (PDQL) Scale, Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination and Beck Depression Inventory. Pre-operative characteristics did not differ between the genders except for lower doses of drugs (P = 0.03), worse emotional scores in PDQL (P = 0.01) and worse depression (P = 0.03) in women. There was no gender difference in the surgical outcome, except a lesser reduction of dopaminergic drugs in women. Depression and quality of life (QOL) improved equally well in women and men. Bilateral STN DBS is equally efficacious in both genders as a treatment for motor complications of PD and for improving QOL. Women are likely to be undertreated because of more severe dyskinesia and may experience less emotional well-being, and could therefore potentially benefit from earlier surgical treatment.

To evaluate the swallowing ability of the PD patients and to correlate it with the indicators of disease progression. A total of 100 PD patients (70 males and 30 females) aged between 50 years and 70 years with varying stage, duration, and severity were enrolled in a cross-sectional study carried out between January and May 2012. A simple bedside water swallowing test was performed using standard 150 ml of water. Swallowing process was assessed under three categories-swallowing speeds (ml\/s), swallowing volume (ml\/swallow) and swallowing duration (s\/swallow). Equal number of age and sex matched controls were also evaluated. All of them completed the task of swallowing. A mean swallowing speed (27.48 ml\/s), swallowing volume (28.5 ml\/s), and swallowing duration (1.05 s\/swallow) was established by the control group. The PD patients showed decreased swallowing speed (7.15 ml\/s in males and 6.61 ml\/s in females), decreased swallowing volume (14.59 ml\/swallow and 14 ml\/swallow in females), and increased swallowing duration (2.37 s\/swallow and 2.42 s\/swallow) which are statistically significant. There was a significant positive correlation between the severity, duration, and staging of the disease with the swallowing performance and a poor correlation between the subjective reports of dysphagia and the objective performance on water swallow test.

CSWS was found in 38 patients with ischemic stroke and 77 patients with hemorrhagic stroke. Statistical analysis revealed that hyponatremia significantly affects the outcome of stroke especially when it is due to CSWS rather than SIADH. Incidence of hyponatremia in our study population was 35%. In patients of hyponatremia 67% were having SIADH and 33% were having CSWS. Overall hyponatremia affected the outcome of stroke especially when caused by CSWS.

He was considered as masterly diagnostician, relying considerably less on neuropathological reports. Babinski's first attention to the reflex of the toes occurred during a chance observation of the contrasting responses between two female patients, one a hysteric and the other a hemiplegic.

","1404":"Stroke is a major health problem world-wide and its burden has been rising in last few decades. Until now tissue plasminogen activator is only approved treatment for stroke. Angiogenesis plays a vital role for striatal neurogenesis after stroke. Administration of various growth factors in an early post ischemic phase, stimulate both angiogenesis and neurogenesis and lead to improved functional recovery after stroke. However vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) is the most potent angiogenic factor for neurovascularization and neurogenesis in ischemic injury can be modulated in different ways and thus can be used as therapy in stroke. In response to the ischemic injury VEGF is released by endothelial cells through natural mechanism and leads to angiogenesis and vascularization. This release can also be up regulated by exogenous administration of Mesenchymal stem cells, by various physical therapy regimes and electroacupuncture, which further potentiate the efficacy of VEGF as therapy in post stroke recovery. Recent published literature was searched using PubMed and Google for the article reporting on methods of up regulation of VEGF and therapeutic potential of growth factors in stroke.

The subjects were divided into two groups according to serum 25(OH) D levels as normal (&gt;20 ng\/ml) or vitamin D deficient (&lt;20 ng\/ml). We identified 71 such patients. Fifty-two patients (73%) had low serum 25(OH) D (&lt;20 ng\/dl). Eighty-three percent patients reported musculoskeletal pain. Fifty-two percent patients fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology criteria for chronic widespread pain. About 50% patients fulfilled the criteria for biochemical osteomalacia. Low serum 25(OH) D level (&lt;20 ng\/dl) was significantly associated with headache, musculoskeletal pain, and osteomalacia. These suggest that both chronic musculoskeletal pain and chronic headache may be related to vitamin D deficiency. Musculoskeletal pain associated with vitamin D deficiency is usually explained by osteomalacia of bones. Therefore, we speculate a possibility of osteomalacia of the skull for the generation of headache (osteomalacic cephalalgia?). It further suggests that both musculoskeletal pain and headaches may be the part of the same disease spectrum in a subset of patients with vitamin D deficiency (or osteomalacia), and vitamin D deficiency may be an important cause of secondary CTTH.

A comparison in the prevalence of dementia across populations may provide an insight into its risk factors. Keeping this in view, a study was planned to evaluate the prevalence of dementia in tribal elderly population. A cross-sectional comprehensive two-phase survey of all residents aged 60 years and older was conducted. Phase one involved screening of all individuals aged 60 and above with the help of a cognitive screen specifically developed for the tribal population. Phase two involved clinical examination of individuals who were suspected of dementia as per the developed cognitive screening test. The results revealed that no individual above 60 years of age in the studied population was diagnosed as a case of dementia. Thereby, pointing out at some unknown factors, which are responsible for prevention of dementia. The differences between the prevalence rate in this study and other studies in India appear to be a function of a valid regional difference. Environmental, phenotypic and genetic factors may contribute to regional and racial variations in dementia. Societies living in isolated hilly and tribal areas seem less predisposed to dementia, particularly age related neurodegenerative and vascular dementia, which are the most common causes for dementia in elderly. This may be because some environmental risk factors are much less prevalent in these settings.

We conducted a retrospective review of medical records of pregnant patients with epilepsy, who obtained medical care (from 2006 to 2011) at one of the general hospitals in the North-Eastern State of Malaysia. Data were collected for seizure frequency before and during the pregnancy, concurrent medications, pregnancy complications, and neonatal outcomes. We reviewed records of 25 patients with a total of 33 different pregnancies. All patients were treated with antiepileptic medications during their pregnancies, with 42% monotherapy and 58% polytherapy. Seizure frequency decreased in 5 (15.2%), increased in 18 (54.5%) and unchanged in 10 (30.3%) cases of pregnancies. Pregnancy complications were anemia, gestational diabetes mellitus, gestational hypertension, intrauterine growth retardation, premature rupture of membrane, and vaginal bleeding. Preterm deliveries were recorded in 11 (33.3%) infants. In our setting, many patients were being on polytherapy during their pregnancies. This underscores the need for planned pregnancies so that antiepileptic medications can be optimized prior to pregnancy. ","1466":"The aim of this study is to characterize the clinical profile of patients with alcohol related seizures (ARS) and to identify the prevalence of idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) in the same. 100 consecutive male patients presenting to a tertiary care center in South India with new onset ARS were analyzed with alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT) score. All underwent 19 channel digital scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and at least computed tomography (CT) scan. A total of 27 patients (27%) who had cortical atrophy on CT had a mean duration of alcohol intake of 23.62 years compared with 14.55 years in patients with no cortical atrophy (P &lt; 0.001). Twenty-two patients (22%) had clustering in the current episode of whom 18 had cortical atrophy. Nearly, 88% patients had generalized tonic clonic seizures while 12% who had partial seizures underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which identified frontal focal cortical dysplasia in one. Mean lifetime duration of alcohol intake in patients presenting with seizures within 6 hours (6H-gp) of intake of alcohol was significantly lower (P = 0.029). One patient in the 6H-gp with no withdrawal symptoms had EEG evidence for IGE and had a lower AUDIT score compared with the rest. CT evidence of cortical atrophy is related to the duration of alcohol intake and portends an increased risk for clustering. Partial seizures can be a presenting feature of ARS and those patients may benefit from MRI to identify underlying symptomatic localization related epilepsy (8.3% of partial seizures). IGE is more likely in patients presenting with ARS within first 6 hours especially if they do not have alcohol withdrawal symptoms and scalp EEG is helpful to identify this small subgroup (~1%) who may require long-term anti-epileptic medication. ","1467":"Hemorrhagic type of moyamoya disease (MMD) is extremely rare in children. Ischemia following hemorrhage is very rare in MMD. There are only 11 reports of mixed-type of MMD, with the patient having both hemorrhage and ischemia in the same hemisphere at the time of presentation, or at different time periods. The ischemia is usually secondary to a precipitating cause. However, there are no reports of a child presenting with both ischemia and hemorrhage in different hemispheres. We present a previously unreported phenomenon of MMD, presenting as hemorrhage and ischemia in opposite hemispheres and review the relevant literature. ","1468":"Complete long segment carotid occlusion presents a treatment challenge. These patients cannot be managed adequately by endarterectomy or stenting. Despite best medical management, many continue to develop recurrent strokes. In this select group of patients, there may be role for flow augmentation techniques like superficial temporal-middle cerebral artery bypass. We report a patient who was thus successfully treated and remains asymptomatic. The relevant literature is reviewed. ","1469":"Data is scarce on prevalence of extracranial carotid atherosclerosis (ECA) in strokes &lt;50 years and its association with lifestyle factors. Study role of (a) ECA in non-cardio-embolic anterior circulation young strokes, and (b) smoking and alcohol in ECA. Cardiovascular risk factors and evidence of ECA on carotid doppler ultrasound (CDUS) was evaluated in an one-year preliminary cross-sectional study of consecutive strokes between 20 years and 49 years. Females were excluded. There were 46 male strokes (mean age 38.26 yrs), 17.39% had hypertension, 2.23% had coronary artery disease; none was diabetic. Tobacco users and alcohol consumers were 24\/46 (52.17%) cases each. ECA was found in 14\/46 (30.44%) cases. Seven of these 14 (50%) i.e., 7\/46 cases (15.21%) had carotid occlusion, four had &lt;50%, three had &gt;70% stenosis. 'Smoking and smokeless tobacco use' was found in 71.42% (10\/14) symptomatic carotid lesions compared to 43.75% (14\/32) strokes without carotid lesions. Prevalence odds ratio for tobacco use and ECA was 3.21 (95% CI: 0.83-12.44) while that of alcohol and ECA was 1.33 (95% CI: 0.38-4.72). Prevalence of ECA in strokes &lt;50 years was high due to lifestyle factors which predispose to atherosclerosis at younger age. ","1470":"Life-threatening, space occupying, infarction develops in 10-15% of patients after middle cerebral artery infarction (MCAI). Though decompressive craniectomy (DC) is now standard of care in patients with non-dominant stroke, its role in dominant MCAI (DMCAI) is largely undefined. This may reflect the ethical dilemma of saving life of a patient who may then remain hemiplegic and dysphasic. This study specifically addresses this issue. This retrospective analysis studied patients with DMCAI undergoing DC. Patient records, operation notes, radiology, and out-patient files were scrutinized to collate data. Glasgow outcome scale (GOS), Barthel index (BI) and improvement in language and motor function were evaluated to determine functional outcome. Eighteen patients between 22 years and 72 years of age were included. 6 week, 3 month, 6 month and overall survival rates were 66.6% (12\/18), 64% (11\/17), 62.5% (10\/16) and 62.5% (10\/16) respectively. Amongst ten surviving patients with long-term follow-up, 60% showed improvement in GOS, 70% achieved BI score &gt;60 while 30% achieved full functional independence. In this group, motor power and language function improved in 9 and 8 patients respectively. At last follow-up, 8 of 10 surviving patients were ambulatory with (3\/8) or without (5\/8) support. Age &lt;50 years corresponded with better functional outcome amongst survivors (P value -0.0068). Language and motor outcomes after DC in patients with DMCAI are not as dismal as commonly perceived. Perhaps young patients (&lt;50 years) with DMCAI should be treated with the same aggressiveness that non-DMCAI is currently dealt with. ","1471":"The use of biomarkers to predict stroke prognosis is gaining particular attention nowadays. Neuron specific enolase (NSE), which is a dimeric isoenzyme of the glycolytic enzyme enolase and is found mainly in the neurons is one such biomarker. This study was carried out on patients of acute ischemic stroke with the aims to determine the correlation between NSE levels on the day of admission with infarct volume, stroke severity, and functional neurological outcome on day 30. Seventy five patients of acute ischemic stroke admitted in the Department of Medicine were included in the study. Levels of NSE were determined on day 1 using the human NSE ELISA kit (Alpha Diagnostic International Texas 78244, USA). Volume of infarct was measured by computed tomography (CT) scan using the preinstalled software Syngo (version A40A) of Siemen's medical solutions (Forchheim, Germany). Stroke severity at admission was assessed using Glasgow coma scale (GCS) and functional neurological outcome was assessed using modified Rankin scale (mRS) on day 30. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS software for windows version 15.0 (SPSS). A positive correlation was found between concentration of NSE on day 1 and infarct volume determined by CT scan (r = 0.955, P &lt; 0.001). A strong negative correlation was found between GCS at presentation and concentration of NSE on day 1 (r = -0.806, P &lt; 0.001). There was a positive correlation between NSE levels at day 1 and functional neurological outcome assessed by mRS at day 30 (r = 0.744, P &lt; 0.001). Serum levels of NSE in first few days of ischemic stroke can serve as a useful marker to predict stroke severity and early functional outcome. However, larger studies with serial estimation of NSE are needed to establish these observations more firmly.

We present a review of recent studies on the histopathologic analysis of thrombi, studies of MRI, and CT imaging correlation with thrombus histology, and detailed structural analysis of thromboemboli retrieved by thrombectomy devices during an acute ischemic stroke. ","1474":"Rising stroke and higher mortality among Indian population needs focused attention for prevention and early management of stroke. In India, very few studies have been carried out to determine the causes of deficiencies in knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of stroke among Indians. Study on KAP is essential to improve the awareness about stroke, early diagnosis and institution of appropriate management. In this article, we have reviewed the existing literature on this issue and tried to compare it with those of developed countries and suggested the measures we need to adopt in India to improve awareness and knowledge base. ","1475":"Clinicians during their training period and practice are often called upon to conduct studies to explore the association between certain exposures and disease states or interventions and outcomes. More often they need to interpret the results of research data published in the medical literature. Case-control studies are one of the most frequently used study designs for these purposes. This paper explains basic features of case control studies, rationality behind applying case control design with appropriate examples and limitations of this design. Analysis of sensitivity and specificity along with template to calculate various ratios are explained with user friendly tables and calculations in this article. The interpretation of some of the laboratory results requires sound knowledge of the various risk ratios and positive or negative predictive values for correct identification for unbiased analysis. A major advantage of case-control study is that they are small and retrospective and so they are economical than cohort studies and randomized controlled trials. ","1476":"In the context of inadequacy of neurology workforce in India, it is important to understand factors that post-graduate medical students consider for and against choosing neurology as their career option. Understanding these factors will help in planning strategies to encourage students to pursue a career in neurology. At present, there is a paucity of studies addressing this issue in India. (1) To analyze factors, which post-graduate students consider for and against choosing neurology as a career specialty. (2) To access the level and quality of neurology exposure in the current MBBS and MD curricula. Statewide questionnaire based study was conducted in the state of Maharashtra for students eligible to take DM neurology entrance examination (MD Medicine and MD Pediatrics). In this survey, 243 students were enrolled. Factors bringing students to neurology were - intellectual challenge and logical reasoning (72%), inspired by role model teachers (63%), better quality-of-life (51%) and scope for independent practice without expensive infrastructure (48%). Factors preventing students from taking neurology were - perception that most neurological diseases are degenerative (78%), neurology is mainly an academic specialty (40%), neurophobia (43%) and lack of procedures (57%). Inadequate exposure and resultant lack of self-confidence were common (31%, 70-80%). 84% of the students felt the need for a short term certification course in neurology after MD. To attract more students to neurology, \"role model\" teachers of neurology could interact and teach students extensively. Neurologists' efforts to shed their diagnostician's image and to shift their focus to therapeutics will help change the image of neurology. Out-patient neurology clinics should be incorporated early in the student's career. Procedures attract students; hence, they should be made conversant with procedures and interventions. Increasing the level of neurological exposure in our current MBBS and MD curriculum is necessary. A case could be made for consideration of short certification course in neurology for physicians. ","1477":"To chronicle the history of medicine and neurology in India with a focus on its establishment and evolution. THE HISTORY OF NEUROLOGY IN INDIA IS DIVIDED INTO TWO PERIODS: ancient and modern. The ancient period dates back to the mid-second millennium Before Christ (B.C.) during the creation of the Ayurvedic Indian system of Medicine, which detailed descriptions of neurological disorders called Vata Vyadhi. The early 20(th) century witnessed the birth of modern Indian medicine with the onset of formal physician training at the nation's first allopathic medical colleges located in Madras (1835), Calcutta (1835) and Mumbai (1848). Prior to India's independence from Britain in 1947, only 25 medical schools existed in the entire country. Today, there are over 355. In 1951, physicians across the field of neurology and neurosurgery united to create the Neurological Society of India (NSI). Four decades later in 1991, neurologists branched out to establish a separate organization called the Indian Academy of Neurology (IAN). Information was gathered through literature review using PubMed, MD Consult, OVID, primary texts and research at various academic institutions in India. Neurological disorders were first described in ancient India under Ayurveda. The transition to modern medicine occurred more recently through formal training at medical schools beginning in the 1930's. Early pioneers and founders of the NSI (1951) include Dr. Jacob Chandy, Dr. B Ramamurthi, Dr. S. T. Narasimhan and Dr. Baldev Singh. Later, Dr. J. S. Chopra, a prominent neurologist and visionary, recognized the need for primary centers of collaboration and subsequently established the IAN (1991). The future of Neurology in India is growing rapidly. Currently, there are 1100 practicing neurologists and more than 150 post-graduate trainees who join the ranks every year. As the number of neurologists rises across India, there is an increase in the amount of basic, clinical and epidemiological research being conducted across the country every day. The history of neurology in India roots back to its rich culture and tradition. Over time, there has been great structural and organizational evolution and the future of neurology in India appears to be bright. However, the number of neurologists and research in neurology needs to experience a significant growth in the future to ensure the best patient care.

Steroids have been traditionally held to be the treatment for this condition, but long-term side effects associated with it limits its use. Although multiple drugs have been tried, yet there exists no data for their long-term efficacy in maintaining remission. No radiological findings have been consistently associated with this condition. We report the use of azathioprine in maintaining long-term remission in one such patient with Hashimoto encephalopathy and the presence of lactate peak in magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the patient, which showed dramatic regression with institution of immunosuppression. ","1496":"Lumbar puncture in the presence of an intracranial tumor with raised intracranial pressure is known to have catastrophic consequences due to herniation of intracranial contents through the tentorial hiatus or foramen magnum. There are relatively few case reports about the same sequence of events when lumbar puncture is performed below the level of a complete spinal block. The mechanism of such deterioration is also subject to conjecture as the spinal cord (unlike the uncus or cerebellar tonsils) is tethered by the dentate ligament and roots on either side, and is hence less mobile.

Though the incidence of stroke mimics being thrombolysed is less than 3%, it is essential to diagnose them so as to avoid wrong thrombolytic treatment which carries potential complications of bleeding. We describe the case of a 17 year old girl with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, who developed stroke like episodes on two consecutive challenges with a chemotherapeutic regime which included intravenous and intrathecal methotrexate.

We aimed to assess the diagnostic validity of the fusion of the neuropsychological test and visual rating scale (VRS) of MTA in AD. A total of fifty subjects (25 AD, 25 controls) were included. The neuropsychological tests used were the K-MMSE and the K-ACE. T1 axial imaging visual rating scale (VRS) was applied for assessing the grade of MTA. We calculated the fusion score with the difference of neuropsychological test and VRS of MTA. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was used to determine optimal cut-off score, sensitivity and specificity of the fusion scores in screening AD. No significant differences in age, gender and education were found between AD and control group.

Participants were 130 children (males = 56%) aged 12-35 months (mean age = 1.81 years, SD = 0.58), from an urban center in north India. The language quotient (LQ) of the child was measured by the Clinical Linguistic Auditory Milestone Scale (CLAMS). Children with an LQ score of less than 70 were considered language delayed. Overall, 6.2% of the children were language delayed with a higher prevalence found for girls (7%) than for boys (5.5%), although the difference was not statistically significant. Several significant correlations between socio-economic and demographic variables and the LQ of the child were found. Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that 31.4% of the variance in the LQ scores of girls was accounted for by income (F = 23.80, P = 0.000) and 18.1% of the variance in the LQ scores of boys was accounted for by education of the mother and income (F = 15.67, P = 0.000). Developmental problems in early years are often precursors of problems in later life and early intervention can facilitate favorable outcomes among children with multiple risks.

A community based study was conducted on all epilepsy patients in an urban slum in Northern India to study their pathways to care. A list of persons suffering from epilepsy was generated by house to house visits, snowballing, and key informant contacts. In-depth interview and Medical Record Review were used to document their pathway to care. Thirteen of the twenty two patients had contacted a health-care provider for their first episode. The most common first link of care for the patients was secondary level Government hospitals.

Children with partial epilepsy, whose predominant seizure type was focal motor seizures, were included in the study. CT scan of brain was done in all children aged between 1 month and 12 years with partial seizures of unknown etiology prospectively. The clinical findings of these children were noted along with the CT findings. Between August 2001 and July 2002, of the 200 children with seizure disorder 50 children who satisfied the inclusion criteria were included in the study. CT scan of brain was normal in 16 children (32%) and was abnormal in 34 children (68%). Twenty children (~60% of abnormal scan) had potentially correctable lesions: Tuberculoma (n = 13), neurocysticercosis (n = 3), and brain abscess (n = 4). Five children had changes representing static pathology that did not influence patient management. The clinical features correlated with CT findings in 78% children. Children with partial motor seizures have high probability of having abnormal findings on CT scan of brain, especially, neuro-infections which are potentially treatable.

Refractory seizures were present in 2.7% cases. Monotherapy was the most commonly followed treatment regimen and phenytoin was the most popular anti-epileptic drug (AED) used. Non-compliance with AEDs was seen in 18.1% cases and was more among patients on polytherapy (P = 0.032). Seizure manifestations and treatment compliance vary widely in the studied population. In depth analysis of each seizure type will give more information about the factors associated with it. ","1523":"Oral motor dysfunction is a common issue in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Drooling, difficulties with sucking, swallowing, and chewing are some of the problems often seen. In this study, we aimed to research the effect of oral motor therapy on pediatric CP patients with feeding problems. Included in this single centered, randomized, prospective study were 81 children aged 12-42 months who had been diagnosed with CP, had oral motor dysfunction and were observed at the Pediatric Neurology outpatient clinic of the Children's Health and Diseases Department, Istanbul Medical Faculty, Istanbul University. Patients were randomized into two groups: The training group and the control group. One patient from the training group dropped out of the study because of not participating regularly. Following initial evaluation of all patients by a blinded physiotherapist and pedagogue, patients in the training group participated in 1 h oral motor training sessions with a different physiotherapist once a week for 6 months. All patients kept on routine physiotherapy by their own physiotherapists. Oral motor assessment form, functional feeding assessment (FFA) subscale of the multidisciplinary feeding profile (MFP) and the Bayley scales of infant development (BSID-II) were used to evaluate oral motor function, swallowing, chewing, the gag reflex, the asymmetrical tonic neck reflex, tongue, jaw, and mouth function, severity of drooling, aspiration, choking, independent feeding and tolerated food texture during the initial examination and 6 months later. When the initial and post-therapy FFA and BSID-II scores received by patients in the training and the study group were compared, the training group showed a statistically significant improvement (P &lt; 0.05). Oral motor therapy has a beneficial effect on feeding problems in children with CP. ","1524":"Congenital myasthenia syndrome (CMS) is a rare, heterogeneous group of genetically determined, disorder of neuromuscular transmission. They have a varied presentation and progression and very few studies have addressed the natural history. Aim of the present study is to describe the clinical profile and natural history of patients with CMS. Study includes patients with CMS who attended comprehensive-neuromuscular-clinic (CNMC) during the period January, 2000-2008 with a minimum follow-up of 2 years, with inclusion criteria: (1) Onset in infancy or childhood with fluctuating ocular, bulbar, respiratory or limb muscle weakness (2) Acetylcholine receptor antibody negative (3) normal computed tomography (CT) thymus (4) Abnormal repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) testing (5) Exclusion of other autoimmune disorders. Out of 314 patients with myasthenia who attended the CNMC during study period, 15 (4.8%) were with CMS (8 boys, 7 girls). Patients were divided as infantile and childhood onset. The mean age of onset and diagnosis in infantile and childhood onset groups were 5.5 months\/3.1 years and 3.6 years\/6.5 years respectively. Eleven patients had ptosis and 4 had generalized presentation. Most common site of decremental response was over facial nerve in 12 (75%) patients. All patients showed good response to treatment with acetyl cholinesterase inhibitor with stable course on follow-up without exacerbations. Mean dose for neostigmine was 28 mg\/day and for pyridostigmine was 153 mg\/day. Ptosis is most common symptom at onset in CMS, emphasing importance of RNS of the facial nerve, in the absence of molecular diagnosis of CMS. Our CMS cohort had relatively stable course without intermittent exacerbations with fair response to acetyl cholinesterase inhibitor. ","1525":"Several population based studies have demonstrated an association between hypo-or hyperthyroidism and dementia in last two decades. As a consequence, thyroid stimulating hormone has become part of the screening laboratory test for dementia. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between thyroid function and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) and to determine the risk of AD and VaD in clinically euthyroid patients. A cross-sectional hospital based study was carried out in subjects diagnosed with AD\/VaD and were assessed for thyroid status as routine screening test. Free T3, free T4 and TSH were studied in 114 AD patients (mean age: 65 years), 35 VaD patients (mean age: 62 years) and 105 control subjects (mean age: 62 years). In AD group, TSH levels were significantly lower than controls (P = 0.00) and for each unit increase in TSH level, the odds of having dementia decreased by 37.1%. No such relation was seen in VaD. The results suggest a consistent association of subclinical hyperthyroidism and AD. ","1526":"This cross-sectional case control study included subjects aged between 18 and 65 years with diagnosis of myasthenia gravis (MG) in Osserman's Stage I and Stage IIa and those in remission with positive and negative acetylcholine receptor antibody (AChRAb). They were evaluated for heart rate variability (HRV) and other conventional autonomic functions. Patients with co-morbidities that can affect autonomic nervous system were excluded. Repetitive nerve stimulation test (RNST), nerve conduction test, AChRAb assay, and computerized tomography (CT) of chest were done in all the patients. All patients of MG who fulfilled the inclusion criteria had a minimum drug-free period of 6 h which was followed by HRV and other conventional tests. Thirty subjects fulfilling study criteria and an equal number of age and gender-matched healthy subjects were enrolled as controls. Autonomic function tests revealed significant changes in HRV (both time and frequency domain) parameters suggestive of parasympathetic deficiency as well as shifting of sympathovagal balance towards raised sympathetic tone. With regards to conventional autonomic function tests, there was statistically significant decrease in values of heart rate-based tests as well as blood pressure-based test (isometric handgrip test) in study group compared with controls, again indicative of significant parasympathetic deficiency and minimal sympathetic deficiency. We conclude that in MG, cholinergic transmission is affected more diffusely than previously thought. ","1527":"The reported prevalence of cognitive deficits within the first month of stroke ranges widely from 10% to 82%, depending primarily on the criteria used to define cognitive impairment and on the selected patient population. These cognitive defects progress toward impairment over a course of time if left untreated. Among the most common cognitive deficits are the attentional, the visuoperceptual, the memory and executive function deficits. As these impairments are being increasingly recognized in the scientific communities, more and more studies are being devoted to the outcomes of various therapies for these disorders. In this review, we focus on the outcomes of various therapies for these cognitive disorders over time. We reviewed all the possible medical databases using key words for individual cognitive deficit treatment outcomes. All the possible studies including randomized controlled trials, pre-post design studies, case series and single case reports were included in this study. On the basis of present literature review, we conclude that the evidence is definitively positive only for outcomes of attentional and visuoperceptive skill deficits. On the other hand, there have been very few studies to conclude for effectiveness of various therapies for memory and executive function outcomes. ","1528":"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is associated with an increased risk of developing dementia. This is clinically relevant overt dementia can be prevented if treatment strategies are devised for MCI. Neuropsychological deficits in this condition are very common and are important clinically for treatment and outcomes. We aimed to review various neuropsychological deficits in MCI. Further, we have presented the current evidence for nosological status, neuroanatomical basis, and clinical outcome of this heterogeneous construct. All published papers on the topic of neuropsychological deficits in MCI on Medline and other databases were reviewed. A wide range of memory and executive function deficits are common in MCI patients. However, several studies are limited by either improper designs or inadequate sample sizes. Several neuropsychological impairments like memory function and executive functions can be diagnosed in MCI. The evidence base for the exact neuroanatomical basis of MCI is not robust yet. However, given the wide range of outcomes, controversies and debates exist regarding the nosological significance of the deficits. Hence, more studies are needed to specifically locate the impairments and further delineate the construct of MCI. ","1529":"The cornerstone of diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still the clinical criteria for probable and possible AD established by the NINCDS-ADRDA Work Group in 1984, which had survived for over 27 years. However, with the increase in people's knowledge of clinical manifestations and biology of AD, this standard is gradually proving to be insufficient; the early diagnosis of AD is thus particularly important. Therefore, in 2011, the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association revised the criteria and integrated biomarker evidence into it. Biomarker evidence is expected to enhance the pathophysiological specificity of the diagnosis of AD. According to Consensus Report of the Working Group on Molecular and Biochemical Markers of Alzheimer's Disease, a qualified biomarker for AD should have the following abilities: It should detect a fundamental feature of neuropathology and be validated in neuropathologically confirmed cases, reliably with an sensitivity &gt;80% for detecting AD and a specificity &gt;80% for distinguishing other dementias; be reproducible and non-invasive; and be simple to perform and inexpensive. Alzheimer-associated neuronal thread protein (AD7c-NTP) is a member of \"neuronal thread proteins\" (NTPs); it can be detected in increased concentration in cortical neurons, brain-tissue extracts, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine in the early course of AD neurodegeneration, and it level is proportional to the degree of dementia, which makes it a promising biomarker for AD. In this review, we have evaluated the feasibility of developing AD7c-NTP as a biomarker for AD.

Some investigators consider it as a variant of essential tremor (ET) and the two conditions often co-exist. The disease is usually non-familial. Two brothers presented with tremor in the lower limbs on standing and on the outstretched hands without any family history. Subsequently, they were proved to be suffering from OT and ET by clinical examination and surface EMG.

The common features observed were pre-ictal headache, ictal eye closure, jaw clenching, resistant behavior, ictal weeping, ictal vocalization, and unresponsiveness during episodes. Comorbid anxiety and depressive disorders was seen in 62.3% and 90.16% patients, respectively. Short-term (6-12 months) outcome of 45 patients was good (seizure freedom in 46.66% and &gt;50% improvement in 24.44% cases). PNES is common, but frequently misdiagnosed and treated as epileptic seizures. A high index of suspicion is required for an early diagnosis. Proper disclosure of diagnosis and management of the psychiatric comorbidities can improve their outcome. Limited sample size and change in seizures frequency as the only parameter for the assessment of the outcome are the two major limitations of our study. ","1567":"Central sleep apnea is a period of at least 10 s without airflow, during which no ventilatory effort is present. Most of the central apneas occur in Non-Rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Central apnea occuring in Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is extremely rare. We present our patient who had a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in another sleep center since 2003. His Auto Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machine was disrupted so he admitted to our center to renew his machine and for daytime sleepiness while using his machine. The polysomnography revealed central apneas ending with respiratory arousals and periodic leg movements in rapid eye movement (REM) stage. We found no cause for central apneas. The patient benefited from servo ventilator therapy. We present this case as an unusual form of central apnea with the review of the literatures. Even the patients diagnosed as obstructive sleep apnea should be analyzed carefully. The diagnosis and the therapeutic approach may change in the favor of the patient. ","1568":"Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) syndrome is an established and modifiable but under recognized risk factor for common disorders like stroke and hypertension. To assess awareness level of health care practitioners and medical students about OSA as a risk factor for stroke and hypertension. Questionnaire based survey with multiple response type and fill in the blanks type questions. The data was compiled and analyzed using SPSS version 19. 180 participants completed the survey questionnaire. Only 24 (13.3%) identified OSA as a reversible risk factor for ischemic stroke. 11 (6%) participants only could answer OSA as an identified risk factor for hypertension as per Seventh Joint National Committee report. This study reveals dismal level of awareness, among health professionals and medical students, about OSA being an established and modifiable risk factor for hypertension and ischemic stroke. ","1569":"There is an increasing awareness for recognition of sleep disorders in India; however, there is still a huge gap in the number of people suffering from various sleep disorders, in the community versus those visiting hospital clinics for the same. Ours is a neurology services-based sleep disorders clinic, which has evolved successfully over the last decade. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the changes in referral patterns and distribution of various sleep disorders in the patients presenting to the clinic. This is a retrospective chart review-based study on all patients seen over an 8-year period, divided into 2 groups comprising of patients seen during the first 4 years versus those seen over the next 4 years. Only those patients who had the sleep disorder as their presenting manifestation and those who had been formally interviewed with a pre-structured questionnaire detailing about the main features of the common sleep disorders according to the ICSD-R were included. Patients, in whom the sleep disorder could be clearly attributable to another neurological or systemic disorder, were excluded. Statistical analysis was carried out to identify the differences between the two groups as regards the distribution of various sleep disorders and other clinical data. Among 710 patients registered in the clinic, 469 were included for analysis and 222 patients formed group 1 while 247 formed group 2. The main differences observed were in the form of a clear increase in the percentage of patients with sleep-related breathing disorders, sleep-related movement disorder, and the hypersomnias on comparison of distribution over the first 4 years versus the last 4 years; while a clear decline was seen in the number of patients with insomnia and parasomnias. A 3-fold increase was observed in the number of patients in whom polysomnography was obtained. The distribution of various sleep disorders as seen in a neurology service-based sleep clinic is demonstrated in this study. Increasing referrals for sleep-disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome, and fewer referrals for insomnia and parasomnias might reflect on changing physician and patient awareness in our community.

Therefore, vascular imaging constitutes an important component of the diagnostic workup. Cervical duplex ultrasonography of carotid and vertebral arteries is employed to evaluate the extracranial vasculature while transcranial Doppler provides important information about intracranial hemodynamic changes in cerebrovascular ischemia. These two components of cerebrovascular ultrasonography are fast and reproducible, and can be performed at the bedside. They provide real-time information about the status of cervico-cranial arterial patency and various hemodynamic alterations, including collateral flow. The information obtained from cerebrovascular ultrasonography is useful for diagnostic as well as prognostic purposes. Furthermore, it can be used to monitor cerebral blood flow for extended periods and aid in decision making for various interventions. The hemodynamic information obtained from cerebrovascular ultrasonography helps in determining the underlying mechanisms of brain ischemia, and is complementary to the clinical examination and other imaging modalities.We describe the technique of performing cervical duplex sonography, diagnostic criteria for arterial stenosis, characterizing plaque morphology, measuring intima-media thickness and various pitfalls while performing the test.","1577":"Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is a rare, sporadic neurocutaneous syndrome characterized by a classical triad of facial port wine nevus, ipsilateral leptomeningeal angiomatosis (LAM) and glaucoma. The incidence of SWS is 1\/50,000 live births, although it is more often underreported. The incidence of SWS without facial nevus is not known, although very few patients without facial nevus have been reported. In these patients, the diagnosis of SWS is made by the findings of computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and histopathology. Here, we report three patients with SWS from our cohort of 28 patients with SWS without facial nevus and discuss their clinical profile and outcome.","1578":"Optic nerve tuberculomas are rarely reported and their natural history, prognosis, and duration of required treatment remain unclear. A 40-year-old immunocompetent male presented with complete loss of vision in his right eye, which had evolved over 6 weeks. He had optic atrophy on examination. Initial imaging showed right optic nerve swelling and thickening suggesting an infiltrative inflammatory optic neuropathy (infectious or noninfectious). Serial imaging revealed appearance of ring enhancement with a necrotic centre. Biopsy and culture of the coexistent parietal lobe lesion revealed Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Persistent optic nerve granuloma with evidence of radiological improvement was noted at 18 months follow-up with antituberculous therapy (ATT). Visual recovery could not be achieved. The salient features in this case include the clinical presentation initially mimicking an infiltrative or compressive optic neuropathy, rapidradiological evolution into a tuberculoma, subtle paradoxical radiological worsening after initiation of ATT and persistence of granuloma on follow up scan. The challenges involved in early diagnosis and during the treatment course will be discussed.","1579":"We report about a young male who presented with generalized muscle stiffness, involving the limb, facial, and paraspinal muscles. The stiffness was severe enough to restrict all his daily activities, progressively increased with movements and also produced recurrent falls. This clinical picture resembled one of stiff person syndrome. As he had hypertrophy of calf muscles and generalized muscle tautness he was evaluated for other disorders which can resemble stiff person syndrome. Investigations revealed severe hypothyroidism with thyroid antibodies being elevated. This case is reported to highlight the fact that myopathy as a presenting manifestation of hypothyroidism can simulate stiff person syndrome. It is essential to identify the condition early as it recovers fully with treatment. Our patient responded well to thyroid replacement therapy and was able to lead a normal life.","1580":"Osmotic demyelination syndrome resulting from postpartum hypernatremia is a recently described entity wherein young women present with hypernatremic encephalopathy and white matter hyperintensities along with quadriparesis from rhabdomyolysis. It is an acute monophasic condition with acute hypernatremia occurring during puerperium with good recovery in majority of the patients with treatment. To the best of our knowledge, recurrent postpartum hypernatremia with encephalopathy, osmotic demyelination, and rhabdomyolysis has not been described. We present a young lady who had two episodes of reversible postpartum hypernatremic encephalopathy with rhabdomyolysis. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before treatment revealed osmotic demyelination on both occasions. During first admission MRI revealed hyperintensities in internal capsule and corpus callosum, and at second admission revealed more extensive white matter hyperintensity, which simulated the 'wine glass' appearance.","1581":"Perioperative stroke can occur following 0.2-0.3% of general surgical and orthopedic procedures. We are reporting a patient who developed multiple strokes in the immediate postoperative period following total knee replacement, where etiological workup revealed multiple pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae (PAVF). The significance of PAVF with paradoxical embolism in perioperative settings has rarely been reported in the literature.","1582":"Acute ischemic stroke may be the first clinical manifestation of the underlying cardioembolic source. We are reporting a 28-year-old man presenting with acute posterior circulation infarct due to underlying bicuspid aortic valve disease with vegetation detected by transesophageal echocardiography in the absence of clinical features of heart disease and infective endocarditis. The case report highlights the importance of routine evaluation of cardioembolic sources in all cases of ischemic stroke.","1583":"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) usually manifests as cerebral hemorrhage, especially as nontraumatic hemorrhages in normotensive elderly patients. Other manifestations are subarachnoid (SAH), subdural, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and superficial hemosiderosis. A 52-year-old hypertensive woman presented with recurrent neurological deficits over a period of 2 years. Her serial brain magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scans showed recurrent SAH hemorrhage, and also intracerebral, IVH and spinal hemorrhage, with superficial siderosis. Cerebral angiograms were normal. Right frontal lobe biopsy showed features of CAA. CAA can present with unexplained recurrent SAH hemorrhage, and may be the initial and prominent finding in the course of disease in addition to superficial cortical siderosis and intracerebal and spinal hemorrhages.","1584":"The aim of this study is to report a case of spontaneous intracranial hypotension complicated by bilateral subdural hemorrhage that resolved with conservative management. A young male presented with severe orthostatic headache associated with dizziness, neck pain and diplopia. Brain imaging revealed characteristic pachymeningeal enhancement and bilateral subdural hemorrhage. Radionuclide cisternography confirmed the Cerebrospinal fluid leak at the cervical 5 and cervical 6 vertebral level. He had clinical and radiological resolution with bed rest, hydration and analgesics and has remained symptom free since then. Spontaneous intracranial hypotension may be complicated by bilateral subdural hemorrhage. A conservative treatment approach is a viable option, as it may help improve the clinical and radiological outcome, especially when interventional facilities are not available.","1585":"Etiologic diagnosis of seizure requires proper consideration of apparently unrelated clinical features of the patient. Here, we report the case of a patient of status epilepticus with moderate-to-severe bilateral sensorineural deafness. Investigations showed extensive intracranial calcification, hypoparathyroidism and unilateral renal agenesis. The features were consistent with Barakat syndrome, a rare developmental disorder associated with mutations in the GATA3 gene. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of Barakat syndrome from India.","1586":"Racemose cysticercosis is a less frequent presentation of neurocysticercosis (NCC). It's presentation and management is quite different from cerebral parenchymal NCC. Diagnosis of racemose cysticercosis is based on the combination of clinical, epidemiologic, radiographic, and immunologic information. Compared with cysticercus cellulose, which most commonly presents as seizures, racemose NCC due to its extraaxial location presents with raised intracranial pressure and meningitis, and frequently requires neurosurgical intervention. Dementia as a sole presenting feature of NCC is rare. We report a case of racemose NCC with dementia as the presenting manifestation. The outcome of dementia patients with NCC seems favorable in most cases therefore a high index of suspicion for NCC should be kept especially in endemic areas.","1587":"Headache is the most common symptom of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT); however, the detailed underlying mechanisms and characteristics of headache in CVT have not been well described. Here, we report two cases of CVT whose primary and lasting presentation was orthostatic headache, suggestive of decreased intracranial pressure. Contrary to our expectations, the headaches were associated with elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure. Magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance venography showed characteristic voiding defects consistent with CVT. We suggest that orthostatic headache can be developed in a condition of decreased intracranial CSF volume in both intracranial hypotensive and intracranial hypertensive states. In these cases, orthostatic headache in CVT might be caused by decreased intracranial CSF volume that leads to the inferior displacement of the brain and traction on pain-sensitive intracranial vessels, despite increased CSF pressure on measurement. CVT should be considered in the differential diagnosis when a patient complains of orthostatic headache.","1588":"Effectiveness of intermittent short course chemotherapy for tuberculous meningitis (TBM) has not been well studied. There are scarce reported studies on this issue in the world literature. Neurologists all over India are reluctant to accept Directly Observed Treatment Short course (DOTS) for TBM since its introduction in India. We did a prospective study to assess effectiveness of Revised National TB Control Program (RNTCP-DOTS) regimes among TBM patients. In this study we include the TBM patients admitted from September 2008 to March 2011. All were referred to RNTCP for treatment. Diagnostic Algorithm as per RNTCP guidelines was strictly followed and treatment outcome and follow-up status were recorded. We exclude HIV and pediatric age group. A total of 42 cases registered for DOTS regimen were included in the study, of which 35 completed the treatment (83%). All the patients were started with DOTS but finally 78% received actual DOTS. All patients were given 9 months intermitted regimen as per RNTCP guidelines. Seven patients died during the treatment (16%). We found intermitted short course chemotherapy was effective in TBM. ","1589":"Near death experiences (NDE) are receiving increasing attention by the scientific community because not only do they provide a glimpse of the complexity of the mind-brain interactions in 'near-death' circumstances but also because they have significant and long lasting effects on various psychological aspects of the survivors. The over-all incidence-reports of NDEs in literature have varied widely from a modest Figure of 10% to around 35%, even up to an incredible Figure of 72% in persons who have faced close brush with death. Somewhat similar to this range of difference in incidences are the differences prevalent in the opinions that theorists and researchers harbor around the world for explaining this phenomena. None the less, objective evidences have supported physiological theories the most. A wide range of physiological processes have been targeted for explaining NDEs. These include cerebral anoxia, chemical alterations like hypercapnia, presence of endorphins, ketamine, and serotonin, or abnormal activity of the temporal lobe or the limbic system. In spite of the fact that the physiological theories of NDEs have revolved around the derangements in brain, no study till date has taken up the task of evaluating the experiences of near-death in patients where specific injury has been to brain. Most of them have evaluated NDEs in cardiac-arrest patients. Post-traumatic coma is one such state regarding which the literature seriously lacks any information related to NDEs. Patients recollecting any memory of their post-traumatic coma are valuable assets for NDE researchers and needs special attention. Our present study was aimed at collecting this valuable information from survivors of severe head injury after a prolonged coma. The study was conducted in the head injury department of Guangdong 999 Brain hospital, Guangzhou, China. Patients included in the study were the ones Recovered from the posttraumatic coma following a severe head injury. A total of 86 patients were chosen. Near death experience scale (NDES) score of 7 or more was used as the criteria of screening NDE experiences. After identifying such individuals, the Prakash-modification of the Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) was used to interview and record the data for qualitative analysis. We found that contrary to earlier incidence reports, NDEs in post head injury patients were markedly low. Only 3 out of 86 of the patients recruited had a clear and confident experience of NDE. We conducted a qualitative study to explore further into these experiences. IPA of these 3 patients revealed four master themes: 1. Unique light visions 2. Intense feelings of astonishment, pleasure, and fear 3. The sense of helplessness 4. Supernatural but rationality of experience. NDE is uncommon in head-injury cases as compared to other near-death conditions. But the persons experiencing it have immense impacts on their belief systems and emotions. This experience should be further explored by studies of larger samples. ","1590":"Alzheimer's disease is a common kind of dementia. This disorder can be detected in all countries around the world. This neurological disorder affects millions of population and becomes an important concern in modern neurology. There are many researches on the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Although it has been determined for a long time, there is no clear-cut that this is a case with genetic disorder or not. A physiological genomics is a new application that is useful for track function to genes within the human genome and can be applied for answering the problem of underlying pathobiology of complex diseases. The physiogenomics can be helpful for study of systemic approach on the pathophysiology, and genomics might provide useful information to better understand the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The present advent in genomics technique makes it possible to trace for the underlying genomics of disease. In this work, physiological genomics analysis for Alzheimer's disease was performed. The standard published technique is used for assessment. According to this work, there are 20 identified physiogenomics relationship on several chromosomes. Considering the results, the HADH2 gene on chromosome X, APBA1 gene on chromosome 9, AGER gene on chromosome 6, GSK3B gene on chromosome 3, CDKHR1 gene on chromosome 17, APPBP1 gene on chromosome 16, APBA2 gene on chromosome 15, GAL gene on chromosome 11, and APLP2 gene on chromosome 11 have the highest physiogenomics score (9.26) while the CASP3 gene on chromosome 4 and the SNCA gene on chromosome 4 have the lowest physiogenomics score (7.44). The results from this study confirm that Alzheimer's disease has a polygenomic origin.","1591":"Electrocardiographic (ECG) changes are reported frequently after acute strokes. It seems that cardiovascular effects of strokes are modulated by concomitant or pre-existent cardiac diseases, and are also related to the type of cerebrovascular disease and its localization. We aimed to determine the pattern of ECG changes associated with pathophysiologic categories of acute stroke among patients with\/without cardiovascular disease and to determine if specific ECG changes are related to the location of the lesion. The electrocardiographic records of 361 patients with acute stroke were studied to assess the relative frequencies of ECG abnormalities among the pathophysiologic categories of stroke. In the present study, the most common ECG abnormalities associated with stroke were T-wave abnormalities, prolonged QTc interval and arrhythmias, which were respectively found in 39.9%, 32.4%, and 27.1% of the stroke patients and 28.9%, 30.7%, and 16.2 of the patients with no primary cardiac disease. We observed that other ECG changes comprising pathologic Q- wave, ST-segment depression, ST-segment elevation, and prominent U wave may also occur in selected or non-selected stroke patients; thereby simulate an acute myocardial injury. We observed an increased number of patients with abnormal T-wave and posterior fossa bleedings and more rhythm disturbances for ischemic lesions, localized in the anterior fossa. Ischemia-like ECG changes and arrhythmias are frequently seen in stroke patients, even in those with no history or signs of primary heart disease, which support a central nervous system origin of these ECG abnormalities. Further study is necessary to better define the brain-heart interaction.

The purpose of our study was to determine the frequency of SMN and NAIP deletions in Tunisian SMA patients. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) combined with restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was used to detect the deletion of exon 7 and exon 8 of SMN1 gene, as well as multiplex PCR for exon 5 and 13 of NAIP gene. Fifteen (45.4%) out of 33 SMA patients were homozygously deleted for exons 7 and\/or 8 of SMN1. Homozygous deletion of NAIP gene was observed in 20% (3 \/ 15) of patients. The molecular diagnosis system based on PCR-RFLP analysis can conveniently be applied in the clinical testing, genetic counseling, prenatal diagnosis, and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis of SMA. ","1594":"Lesions of the brain, recognized as unidentified bright objects (UBOs), are commonly observed as areas of increased T2-weighted signal intensity on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Identification of these lesions is not currently encompassed in the National Institute of Health (NIH) diagnostic criteria for NF1. We aimed to determine the prevalence of UBOs in children with NF1 and identify areas of the brain that are commonly affected by these lesions, allowing us to evaluate whether UBOs should be included in the diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of NF1. We reviewed the cranial MRI scans of 22 children who had been diagnosed with sporadic or familial NF1 in accordance with the criteria established by NIH. UBOs were present in 81% of the children with NF1. These lesions have a predilection for specific areas of the brain, including the globus pallidus (72%), cerebellum (66%), brainstem (27%) and cerebral hemispheres (16%). The prevalence of UBOs identified varied significantly with age and sex; they were infrequent in children less than 4 years of age but were common in those aged between 4 and 12 years of age. UBOs were more commonly seen in males (66.6%) compared with females (33.3%). Repeat MRI scan on a subset of these patients with UBOs did not show any significant changes despite a worsening in clinical symptoms. We have shown that UBOs are a common finding in children with NF1, and are most prevalent between the ages of 4 and 12 years. Many sites of the brain are affected by these lesions, most notably the globus pallidus and the cerebellum. Further research must be conducted to elucidate the significance of UBOs in patients with NF1 and whether these lesions have any utility in the clinical detection of NF1.

The clinical and electrophysiological findings in myasthenia gravis, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), congenital myasthenic syndromes, and botulinum intoxication are discussed. Single fiber electromyography (SFEMG) helps to explain the basis of testing neuromuscular junction function by repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS). SFEMG requires skill and patience and its availability is limited to a few centers. For RNS supramaximal stimulation is essential and so is display of the whole waveform of each muscle response at maximum amplitude. The amplitudes of the negative phase of the first and fourth responses are measured from baseline to negative peak, and the percent change of the fourth response compared with the first represents the decrement or increment. A decrement greater than 10% is accepted as abnormal and smooth progression of response amplitude train and reproducibility form the crux. In suspected LEMS the effect of fast rates of stimulation should be determined after RNS response to slow rates of stimulation. Caution is required to avoid misinterpretation of potentiation and pseudofacilitation.","1598":"Adult post traumatic Brachial plexus injury is unfortunately a rather common injury in young adults.

Exact incidence figures are not available but of the injuries presenting to us about 90% invole the above combination This article reviews peer-reviewed publications including clinical papers, review articles and Meta analysis of the subject. In addition, the authors' experience of several hundred cases over the last 15 years has been added and has influenced the ultimate text. Results have been discussed and analysed to get an idea of factors influencing final recovery. It appears that time from injury and number of roots involved are most crucial.","1599":"Electrodiagnosis (EDX) is a useful test to accurately localize the site, determine the extent, identify the predominant pathophysiology, and objectively quantify the severity of brachial plexopathies. It can also be used to examine muscles not easily assessed clinically and recognize minimal defects. Post-operatively and on follow up studies, it is important for early detection of re-innervation. It can be used intra-operatively to assess conduction across a neuroma, which would help the surgeon to decide further course of action. Localization of the site of the lesion can be very challenging as there may be multiple sites of involvement and hence the electroneuromyographic evaluation must be adequate. The unaffected limb also needs to be examined for comparison. The final impression must be co-related with the type and severity of injury.","1600":"Brachial plexus injury can occur as a result of trauma, inflammation or malignancies, and associated complications. The current topic is concerned with various forms of brachial plexopathy, its clinical features, pathophysiology, imaging findings, and management. Idiopathic brachial neuritis (IBN), often preceded with antecedent events such as infection, commonly present with abruptonset painful asymmetric upper limb weakness with associated wasting around the shoulder girdle and arm muscles. Idiopathic hypertrophic brachial neuritis, a rare condition, is usually painless to begin with, unlike IBN. Hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by repeated episodes of paralysis and sensory disturbances in an affected limb, which is preceded by severe pain. While the frequency of the episodes tends to decrease with age, affected individuals suffer from residual deficits. Neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome affects the lower trunk of the brachial plexus. It is diagnosed on the basis of electrophysiology and is amenable to surgical intervention. Cancer-related brachial plexopathy may occur secondary to metastatic infiltration or radiation therapy. Traumatic brachial plexus injury is commonly encountered in neurology, orthopedic, and plastic surgery set-ups. Trauma may be a direct blow or traction or stretch injury. The prognosis depends on the extent and site of injury as well as the surgical expertise.","1601":"We report a case of alien hand sign in a male with stroke and briefly discuss the pathogenesis of this rare condition symptom.","1602":"Glossopharyngeal neuralgia is a relatively rare condition characterized by severe, paroxysmal episodes of pain localized to the external ear canal, the base of the tongue, the tonsil or the area beneath the angle of the jaw.

For this reason, FDG PET or PET\/CT has great advantage in understanding of underlying pathology in assessment of FUO (Fever of unknown origin). However, till today, there are limited studies about the role of FDG PET or PET\/CT in evaluation of FUO. Conventional diagnostic methods are still not adequate to reveal underlying reason in approximately 50% of patients with FUO especially in cases presenting with diagnostic challenges i.e. involvement of two or more organ systems with seemingly no correlation. We report a case of two years old Indian female child who presented with fever of one month duration, CT and MRI reported nonspecific findings. She underwent Whole body 18 FDG PET\/CT for further evaluation, which revealed FDG avid rim lesion with central photopenic defect suspicious of pyogenic abscess in high parietal cortex along with bilateral lung nodules. This confirmed the diagnosis of a brain abscess secondary to pulmonary infection. We emphasize the utility of 18 FDG PET\/CT as imaging modality, highlight the diagnostic difficulties using current serological and radiological measures, and propose managing FUO with 18 FDG PET\/CT in cases empirically prior to more invasive measures.","1612":"Disorders of lipid metabolism can cause variable clinical presentations, often involving skeletal muscle, alone or together with other tissues. A 19-year-old boy presented with a 2-year history of muscle pain, cramps, exercise intolerance and progressive weakness of proximal lower limbs. Examination revealed skeletal markers of Marfan syndrome in the form of increased arm span compared with height, Kyphoscoliois, moderate pectus excavatum, high arched palate and wrist sign. He also had mild neck flexor weakness and proximal lower limb weakness with areflexia. Pathologic findings revealed lipid-laden fine vacuoles in the muscle fibers. Possibility of carnitine deficiency myopathy was considered and the patient was started on carnitine and Co Q. The patient made remarkable clinical improvement over the next 2 months. This case is reported for rarity of the association of clinical markers of Marfan syndrome and lipid storage myopathy and sparse literature on lipid storage myopathy in the Indian context.","1613":"Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is chronic encephalitis occurring after infection with measles virus. An 8-year-old boy presented with progressive behavioral changes, cognitive decline and myoclonic jerks, progressing to a bed bound state over 2 months. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain showed T2-weighted hyperintensities in the subcortical areas of the left occipital lobe and brachium of the inferior colliculus on both sides. EEG showed bilateral, synchronous periodic discharges. Serum\/cerebrospinal fluid measles IgG titer was significantly positive. The overall features were suggestive of SSPE. MRI finding of bilateral inferior colliculus changes on MRI without significant involvement of other commonly involved areas suggests an uncommon\/rare imaging pattern of SSPE.","1614":"Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVT) is a rare cerebrovascular disease with variable presentation. CVT rarely causes hydrocephalus. Communicating hydrocephalus due to CVT is extremely rare. We describe a patient of CVT presenting with chronic headache and communicating hydrocephalus. The patient was successfully treated with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt. A 40 year old man presented with moderate to severe headache since six months and progressive visual loss since two months. Head Computed tomogram showed mild hydrocephalus without obstruction. Lumbar puncture (LP) demonstrated elevated pressure but was otherwise normal. Magnetic resonance venogram showed extensive CVT. Repeated CSF drainage and thecoperitoneal shunt did not relieve the severe headache hence a VP shunt was placed. Post shunt headache subsided with resolution of hydrocephalus. CVT can present as communicating hydrocephalus. Gradual reduction of intra-ventricular pressure by repeated LPs followed by VP shunt can safely treat hydrocephalus due to CVT.","1615":"We report an adolescent girl who had left-sided neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) due to impingement of the scalenus anterior muscle with bilateral changes on nerve conduction studies and responded well to surgical decompression. A 13-year-old Caucasian girl presented with intermittent pain, swelling, erythema, tingling and numbness of the palmar aspect of her left hand. Nerve conduction studies revealed bilateral ulnar sensory and motor conduction abnormalities, suggesting early compressive neuropathy in the asymptomatic arm as well. She underwent surgical exploration when it was noted that the scalenus anterior itself was impinging on the brachial plexus. She had a good clinical response to scalenectomy. The diagnosis of neurogenic TOS remains difficult as no single test has been accepted as a gold standard. But, once diagnosed using clinical symptoms, nerve conduction studies, electromyography and radiological investigations, it is a treatable condition with good prognosis.","1616":"A 32 year old Asian female on 300 mg per day of phenytoin following meningioma excision developed a fever with a diffuse maculopapular rash, lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly after12 days. A diagnosis of DRESS (Drug Rash Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) syndrome was made. Patient was started on prednisolone at a dose of 1 mg\/kg but since there was further deterioration in her condition, intravenous immunoglobulin was started. Clinical and blood parameters began to improve by the next day with liver functions returning to normal by the third week. DRESS syndrome is a drug hypersensitivity syndrome which can be fatal and therefore needs to be recognized early for the appropriate treatment to be started. The use of Intravenous immunoglobulins is anecdotal and the dramatic improvement noted in this case indicates that it is another treatment choice.

The anticonvulsant, lamotrigine (LMG), reduces interictal epileptiform discharges and is effective in seizures in patients with both primary and partial epilepsy syndromes. The effect of LMG on neuroleptic-induced EEG abnormalities has not been previously reported. We describe the case of a 13-year-old male with paroxysmal nonepileptic spells who underwent diagnostic video-EEG telemetry, whose abnormal OLZ-induced EEG findings were strikingly affected by LTG withdrawal and reintroduction. The effect of LTG in normalizing EEG changes in suspected epilepsy caused by atypical neuroleptics is discussed.","1620":"A 12-year-old female child with motor developmental delay presented with persistent vomiting, recurrent falls and unsteadiness in dark since 2 years of age. There was decline in scholastic performance, bulbar symptoms and aggravation of symptoms during intercurrent illness. Clinically, she had frontal and parietal lobar dysfunction, dysarthria, optic atrophy and LMN VII, IX, X, XII cranial nerve involvement. There was generalized hypotonia, distal muscle wasting, weakness, cerebellar signs and impaired vibration\/position sense in distal extremities. Biochemical investigations revealed elevated serum\/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lactate and CSF lactate pyruvate ratio. Neuroimaging demonstrated bilateral symmetrical T2 hyperintensities in basal ganglia, subcortical white matter, cerebellar hemispheres and posterior aspect of spinal cord. As certain atypical features like bilateral symmetrical T2 hyperintensities in subcortical white matter were also seen, metachromatic leukodystrophy was considered in differential diagnosis but ruled out by nerve biopsy. This case is reported for the presence of atypical neuroimaging features that are rarely found in Leigh's disease.","1621":"Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a small vessel vasculitis that is rare in adults. Here, we present a case of a woman who presented with palpable purpura, abdominal pain, arthritis and ischemic stroke. The patient met the diagnostic criteria of HSP. However, cerebrovascular disease is reported as an uncommon, yet fatal, complication of HSP. The patient responded to aggressive immunosuppression with pulses of corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide. In the absence of an established protocol of treatment of such neurologic emergency in HSP patients, this report demonstrates a successful outcome.","1622":"Chronic active Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infection causes a wide spectrum of manifestation, due to meningeal, parenchymal and vascular involvement. An 11-year-old boy presented with chronic headache, fever and seizures of 18 months duration. His magnetic resonance imaging Brain showed fusiform aneurysmal dilatations of arteries of both the anterior and posterior cerebral circulation. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed persistent lymphocytic pleocytosis, raised proteins and low sugar with positive polymerase chain reaction for EBV. He later developed pancytopenia due to bone marrow aplasia, with secondary infection and expired. From clinical, imaging and CSF findings, he had chronic lymphocytic meningitis with vasculopathy, which was isolated to the central nervous system. He later had marrow aplasia probably due to X-linked lymphoproliferative disorder related to EBV infection. Vasculopathy, especially diffuse fusiform aneurysmal dilatation associated with chronic EBV infection, is rare, but has been described, similar to our case report.","1623":"Although it is a sporadic disease, few studies have reported cases of Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS) in families which postulate a genetic susceptibility. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing is an area of discussion in GBS though none of them are considered definitive. In recent years, more studies have evaluated HLA typing in sporadic cases while rarely it has been assessed in familial ones. We report a woman and her daughter experiencing GBS and their HLA typing in a 2-year interval.","1624":"Jean-Martin Charcot is known as father of modern neurology. Before him, neurology was only limited to select disorders like chorea. His contributions were not limited to neurology only, as he was instrumental in many new developments in the field of pathology, psychiatry, and internal medicine. Even after 100 years, Charcot`s clinical methods remain the pillar of modern neurology.","1625":null,"1626":"The present study evaluated the direct costs of active epilepsy and looked at the pattern of drug prescription and utilization in epileptic patients visiting the neuroscience centre of a national hospital of India. A total of 134 epileptic patients were studied over a period of 4 months. Patients demography, commonly prescribed antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), socioeconomic status, direct costs, response ratio (RR) for newer drugs, and quality of life (QOLIE-10) was evaluated. We found a higher percentage of male patients (67.9%) as compared with females. Most of the patients were in the age group 11-30 years and majority of them (39.6%) belonged to lower middle group. A higher percentage (68.7) of drugs was prescribed as polytherapy. Higher monthly cost was observed for some of the newer AEDs including the lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and lacosamide as compared with older drugs. Among the newer drugs, clobazam had the lowest cost. RR was calculated for 12 patients out of which 8 had a RR &lt; -0.50. The QOL domains, following conventional or newer drugs, were not much affected. The study indicates an increasing trend toward clinical usage of newer AEDs, increasing trend of poly-therapy with significant escalations in the cost of therapy.

To compare the oxidative stress of women with epilepsy (WWE) and unfavorable pregnancy outcome (fetal malformation or spontaneous abortion - group EM) with that of WWE with normal pregnancy outcome (group ENM) and healthy women with normal pregnancy outcome (group C). We identified WWE under group EM (n = 43) and group ENM (n = 22) from the Kerala Registry of Epilepsy and Pregnancy (KREP). Group C was constituted of healthy volunteers (N = 20). Oxidative stress was assessed by estimating serum levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and isoprostane (ISP). The antioxidant profile was evaluated as activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR), catalase (CAT), total antioxidant status (TAO), and glutathione (GSH) content. The MDA and ISP levels for group EM (3.46 + 0.82 and 17.77 + 3.0) were higher than that of group ENM (3.07 + 1.02 and 14.0 + 5.3), and both were significantly higher than that of group C (2.42 + 0.51 and 10.77 + 4.1). Their levels of SOD (146.82 + 42.64 vs. 175.81 + 42.61) and GSH (0.98 + 0.98 vs. 1.55 + 1.3) were significantly lower than those of controls. No significant changes were seen in TAO and GR. WWE on polytherapy showed significant increase in MDA when compared to monotherapy group. WWE (group EM and ENM) had higher oxidative stress and reduced antioxidant activity. The subgroup of WWE with unfavorable pregnancy outcome (group EM) had higher oxidative stress. Excess oxidative stress can be a final common pathway, by which AEDs exert teratogenic effects.

A hospital-based descriptive study from South Indian eastern coastal town of Puducherry; 60 consecutive subjects aged &gt; 12 years, predominantly of inbred Tamil population, with head CT evidence of intracerebral hemorrhage not associated with trauma and brain tumors, were recruited. Outcome at three months was measured using Glasgow Outcome scale, NIHSS and mortality. SPSS v 19 was used for statistical analysis. Commonest etiological factor was hypertension, followed by bleeding diathesis, thrombolysis for myocardial infarction, and cortical vein thrombosis. Most frequent locations of hematoma were basal ganglia, thalamus, internal capsule, and cerebral and cerebellar parenchyma. Hematoma volume correlated significantly with systolic and mean arterial pressure but not with diastolic blood pressure. Poor outcome was correlated to size (P &lt; 0.05) and intraventricular extension of hematoma (P &lt; 0.05), and to systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure, but not to age, gender, smoking, alcoholism, ischemic heart disease, and blood sugar level. Among diabetic patients with ICH, the size of hematoma (P = 0.04) and severity of coma (P = 0.01) at admission were significantly worse compared to the non-diabetic, but not the outcome at three months [Glasgow outcome scale or mortality (P = 0.94 and 0.14)]. The location of hemorrhage and correlation with outcome agreed with the patterns described for the non-white races in prior reports.

Since the World Health Organization officially began promoting yoga in developing countries in 1978, yoga has been cited for its therapeutic potential and has been widely recognized in Western culture. However, as an increasing number of people practice yoga for remedial purposes, researchers raise two important questions: 1) Is yoga a valid complementary management and rehabilitation treatment modality? 2) What conditions show promise of treatment with this intervention?. This review article uses comprehensive scientific, evidence-based studies to analyze the efficacy of various basic and applied aspects of yoga in disease prevention and health promotion. It specifically intends to expose the effects of yoga in neurological disorders, particularly epilepsy, stroke, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, peripheral nervous system disease, and fibromyalgia. Information was gathered from various resources including PubMed, Ovid, MD-Consult, USC, and U.C.L.A. libraries. Studies were selected and reviewed on the basis of sample size, control, randomization, double-blinding, and statistical analysis of results. The pratice of yoga and meditation demonstrates statistically encouraging physiological and psychological improvements in the aforementioned neurological disorders. However, there were certain flaws and inadequacies in the study designs employed to evaluate the same. A critical analysis of these studies is presented. With the aim to focus attention on this widespread yet largely unexamined treatment modality, this paper seeks to provide direction and support for further research necessary to validate yoga as an integrative, alternative, and complementary therapy.

It is a plastic and vulnerable structure that gets damaged by a variety of stimuli. Studies have shown that it also gets affected in a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. In last decade or so, lot has been learnt about conditions that affect hippocampus and produce changes ranging from molecules to morphology.

Also, we explored the association of headache symptoms with indoor environmental parameters of the work place. Sick building syndrome (SBS), which includes headache, is a common global phenomenon, but the underlying environmental cause is uncertain. We used data from the 1994-1998 US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Building Assessment and Survey Evaluation, a cross-sectional study of workers employed in 100 public and private office buildings across 25 states. The study used a self-administered questionnaire to assess headache frequency and prevalence of self-reported physician-diagnosed (SRPD) migraine. Indoor environmental parameters (IEP) were collected per EPA protocol from each building over a 1-week period and included carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, temperature, relative humidity, particulate matter, volatile organic compound, illuminance, and sound level. The standards of American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers were used to categorize IEP as either within- or out-of-comfort range for human dwelling. These limits delineate whether a parameter value is safe for human dwelling. Out-of-comfort range IEPs are associated with SBS and other human diseases. SRPD migraine and headache frequency were the primary outcome measures of the study. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were employed for the purpose of assessing the association between the outcome variable and IEPs. Of the 4326 participants, 66% were females and 60% were between 30 and 49 years. Headache frequency during the last 4 weeks was as follows: None in 31%, 1-3 days in 38%, 1-3 days per week in 18%, and every or almost every workday in 8%. Females had higher SRPD migraine prevalence compared to males (27% vs. 11%, P&lt;0.001) and were more likely to report any headache in the last month compared to males (75% vs. 53%, P&lt;0.001). Odds of SRPD migraine were higher (P&lt;0.05) for those exposed to IEP out-of-comfort range, and odds of exposure to out-of-comfort range IEPs were higher in groups who reported higher headache frequencies. Migraine diagnosis and elevated headache frequency are associated with an uncomfortable indoor environment. Periodic assessments and adjustments of IEP may have a beneficial impact on employees who are vulnerable to SBS. ","1637":"We aim to establish the role that perceived physician empathy plays in determining migraineurs' outcomes and compliance with migraine management plans. We checked for associations between perceived physician empathy and clinical outcomes as well as compliance with management plans. 63 migraineurs were enrolled between July and September 2011. Questionnaire administered at the time of inclusion into the study included self-assessment of disability due to migraine (Migraine Disability Assessment Test) followed by migraineurs' assessment of physician empathy (Consultation and Relational Empathy Measure). Three months later, a telephonic questionnaire ascertained changes in disability due to migraine and compliance with migraine treatment. Data was entered in Microsoft Excel 2010 and analyzed using SPSS 17. Pearson's correlation was employed to analyze the significance of relationship between variables. P-value of less than 0.05 has been considered statistically significant. Statistically significant positive Pearson's correlations are seen between perceived empathy and decrease in migraine disability and symptoms over three months (P &lt; 0.05). Significant positive relationships are also seen between perceived empathy and compliance with diet\/meal timings, exercising, de-stressing\/sleep pattern modification and medications (P &lt; 0.05). Self-reported compliance is significantly correlated with improved patient outcomes (P &lt; 0.05). Substantial positive associations are found between perceived physician empathy and migraineurs' outcomes and compliance with management plans. This emphasizes the importance of empathy in migraineur-physician communication. ","1638":"Tension type headaches are common in clinical practice. Earlier known by various names, the diagnosis has had psychological connotations. Recent evidence has helped clarify the neurobiological basis and the disorder is increasingly considered more in the preview of neurologists. The classification, clinical features, differential diagnosis and treatment of tension type headache are discussed in this paper.","1639":"It is important to recognise that migraine is a 'biological' and not a 'psychological' entity. However, psychological factors can be involved in migraine in 4 different ways:- 1) Migraines can be triggered by psychological stressors; 2) Severe migraine can itself be a cause of significant psychological stress which can, in turn, exacerbate the problem; 3) Even if psychological stress is not significantly involved in the genesis of the headache, pain management techniques can help people cope with their pain more effectively; 4) Longitudinal data demonstrate a complex bidirectional association between mood disorders and migraine. Treatment of a co-existing mood disorder, for example with cognitive behavioural techniques, may therefore reduce the impact of migraine. It would thus appear logical to view medical and psychological approaches as potentially synergistic rather than mutually exclusive. Functional imaging indicates that cognition, emotions, and pain experiences change the way the brain processes pain inputs. This may provide a physiological rationale for psychological interventions in pain management. As most studies of psychological management of migraine have been relatively small and the approach often varies between clinicians, the magnitude of benefit, optimum method of delivery, and the length of intervention are uncertain.","1640":"Evidence is emerging that migraine is not solely a headache disorder. Observations that ischemic stroke could occur in the setting of a migraine attack, and that migraine headaches could be precipitated by cerebral ischemia, initially highlighted a possibly association between migraine and cerebrovascular disease. More recently, large population-based studies that have demonstrated that migraineurs are at increased risk of stroke outside the setting of a migraine attack have prompted the concept that migraine and cerebrovascular disease are comorbid conditions. Explanations for this association are numerous and widely debated, particularly as the comorbid association does not appear to be confined to the cerebral circulation as cardiovascular and peripheral vascular disease also appear to be comorbid with migraine. A growing body of evidence has also suggested that migraineurs are more likely to be obese, hypertensive, hyperlipidemic and have impaired insulin sensitivity, all features of the metabolic syndrome. The comorbid association between migraine and cerebrovascular disease may consequently be explained by migraineurs having the metabolic syndrome and consequently being at increased risk of cerebrovascular disease. This review will summarise the salient evidence suggesting a comorbid association between migraine, cerebrovascular disease and the metabolic syndrome.","1641":"Headache is a common complaint that makes up for approximately 25% of any neurologists outpatient practice. Yet, it is often underdiagnosed and undertreated. Ninety percent of headaches seen in practice are due to a primary headache disorder where there are no confirmatory tests, and neuroimaging studies, if done, are normal. In this situation, a good headache history allows the physician to recognize a pattern that in turn leads to the correct diagnosis. A comprehensive history needs time, interest, focus and establishment of rapport with the patient. When to ask what question to elicit which information, is an art that is acquired by practice and improves with experience. This review discusses the art of history-taking in headache patients across different settings. The nuances of headache history-taking are discussed in detail, particularly the questions related to the time, severity, location and frequency of the headache syndrome in general and the episode in particular. An emphasis is made on the recognition of red flags that help in the identification of secondary headaches.","1642":"The 'Other Primary Headaches' include eight recognised benign headache disorders. Primary stabbing headache is a generally benign disorder which often co-exists with other primary headache disorders such as migraine and cluster headache. Primary cough headache is headache precipitated by valsalva; secondary cough has been reported particularly in association with posterior fossa pathology. Primary exertional headache can occur with sudden or gradual onset during, or immediately after, exercise. Similarly headache associated with sexual activity can occur with gradual evolution or sudden onset. Secondary headache is more likely with both exertional and sexual headache of sudden onset. Sudden onset headache, with maximum intensity reached within a minute, is termed thunderclap headache. A benign form of thunderclap headache exists. However, isolated primary and secondary thunderclap headache cannot be clinically differentiated. Therefore all headache of thunderclap onset should be investigated. The primary forms of the aforementioned paroxysmal headaches appear to be Indomethacin sensitive disorders. Hypnic headache is a rare disorder which is termed 'alarm clock headache', exclusively waking patients from sleep. The disorder can be Indomethacin responsive, but can also respond to Lithium and caffeine. New daily persistent headache is a rare and often intractable headache which starts one day and persists daily thereafter for at least 3 months. The clinical syndrome more often has migrainous features or is otherwise has a chronic tension-type headache phenotype. Management is that of the clinical syndrome. Hemicrania continua straddles the disorders of migraine and the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias and is not dealt with in this review.","1643":"New daily persistent headache (NDPH) is a chronic headache developing in a person who does not have a past history of headaches. The headache begins acutely and reaches its peak within 3 days. It is important to exclude secondary causes, particularly headaches due to alterations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure and volume. A significant proportion of NDPH sufferers may have intractable headaches that are refractory to treatment. The condition is best viewed as a syndrome rather than a diagnosis. The headache can mimic chronic migraine and chronic tension-type headache, and it is also important to exclude secondary causes, particularly headaches due to alterations in CSF pressure and volume. A large proportion of NDPH sufferers have migrainous features to their headache and should be managed with treatments used for treating migraine. A small group of NDPH sufferers may have intractable headaches that are refractory to treatment.","1644":"The trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs) are a group of primary headache disorders that are characterized by strictly unilateral trigeminal distribution pain occurring in association with ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms. This group includes cluster headache, paroxysmal hemicrania and short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing. These disorders are very painful, often considered to be some of the most painful conditions known to mankind, and consequently are highly disabling. They are distinguished by the frequency of attacks of pain, the length of the attacks and very characteristic responses to medical therapy, such that the diagnosis can usually be made clinically, which is important because it dictates therapy. The management of TACs can be very rewarding for physicians and highly beneficial to patients.","1645":"Chronic Daily Headache is a descriptive term that includes disorders with headaches on more days than not and affects 4% of the general population. The condition has a debilitating effect on individuals and society through direct cost to healthcare and indirectly to the economy in general. To successfully manage chronic daily headache syndromes it is important to exclude secondary causes with comprehensive history and relevant investigations; identify risk factors that predict its development and recognise its sub-types to appropriately manage the condition. Chronic migraine, chronic tension-type headache, new daily persistent headache and medication overuse headache accounts for the vast majority of chronic daily headaches. The scope of this article is to review the primary headache disorders. Secondary headaches are not discussed except medication overuse headache that often accompanies primary headache disorders. The article critically reviews the literature on the current understanding of daily headache disorders focusing in particular on recent developments in the treatment of frequent headaches.","1646":null,"1647":"Headache is very common. In the United Kingdom, it accounts for 4.4% of primary care consultations, 30% of referrals to neurology services and 0.5-0.8% of alert patients presenting to emergency departments.

Warning features (red flags) in the history and on examination help target those who need investigation and what investigations are required. This article summarizes the typical presentations of the common secondary headaches and what neuroimaging and other investigations are appropriate for each headache type.","1648":"The nosology, classification and pathophysiology of ophthalmoplegic migraine (OM) remains complex and debatable. A recently proposed classification of OM leaves several caveats. A critical analysis of all reported cases of OM (1993-2010) has been made incorporating the authors' own experience to arrive at a simple, unambiguous and easy to use diagnostic criteria and classification of OM. Between 2005 and 2010, 18 adult cases of OM had been seen whose clinical details are summarized. Most had sixth nerve palsies associated with migraine-like headaches lasting more than 4 days. Other possibilities were carefully excluded. All subjects responded to corticosteroids favorably. We prefer using the term ophthalmoplegia with migraine-like headache (OMLH) rather than OM. We classify OMLH as a migraine subtype (1.7) and into two groups-childhood-onset type (where third nerve palsies and nerve enhancement are common) and adult-onset type (where sixth nerve palsies are more common and nerve enhancement unusual). This clinico-radiological classification does not in any way hint at any difference in pathophysiology between the two groups.","1649":"Migraine is a common disabling brain disorder whose pathophysiology is now being better understood. The study of anatomy and physiology of pain producing structures in the cranium and the central nervous system modulation of the input have led to the conclusion that migraine involves alterations in the sub-cortical aminergic sensory modulatory systems that influence the brain widely.","1650":null,"1651":"A prospective prevalence study of primary headache disorders in school going children (8-18 years) in Srinagar district of Kashmir valley was conducted.

We present a 11 year old girl with 15 days history of painless diplopia. There was no history of fluctuation of symptoms, drooping of eye lids or diminished vision. She had near total restricted extra-ocular movements and mild proptosis of the right eye. There was no conjunctival injection, chemosis, or bulb pain. There was no eyelid retraction or lid lag. Rest of the neurological examination was unremarkable.Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was raised with eosinophilia. Antinuclear antibodies were positive. Liver, renal and thyroid functions were normal. Antithyroid, double stranded deoxyribonucleic acid and acetylcholine receptor antibodies were negative. Repetitive nerve stimulation was negative. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbit was typical of orbital myositis. The patient responded to oral steroids. Orbital myositis can present as painless diplopia. MRI of orbit is diagnostic in orbital myositis.","1662":"We report a case of rabies viral encephalitis in a 48-year-old male with an unusually long incubation period, historically suspected to be more than 20 years. The case was referred for histological diagnosis following alleged medical negligence to the forensic department. The histology and immunocytochemical demonstration of rabies viral antigen established the diagnosis unequivocally. The case manifested initially with hydrophobia and aggressive behavior, although he suddenly went to the bathroom and drank a small amount of water. History of dog bite 25 years back was elicited retrospectively following clinical suspicion. There was no subsequent history to suggest nonbite exposure to a rabid dog to consider recent event causing the disease, although this cannot be totally excluded.","1663":"Opportunistic infections usually occur in patients with an immunocompromised state, and can be severe. Cryptoccocal meningitis is a fatal condition if left untreated, and is usually found in such patients. We report the case of an adult patient with cryptoccocal meningitis secondary to intestinal lymphangiectasia. A 30 year old female was admitted to our hospital for meningitis. Biochemical and radiological investigations were performed. A cerebrospinal fluid latex agglutination test showed positive cryptoccocal antigen. In addition, there were features of humoral and cell mediated immunity deficiency (lymphopenia, hypoalbuminemia, hypogammaglobulinemia), with a negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and polymerase chain reaction. An upper gastroduodenoscopy was performed, which showed multiple lymphangiectasias, and a biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of primary intestinal lymphangiectasia (PIL). The patient was treated with intravenous amphotericin B and oral flucytosine, and the meningitis resolved. PIL should be suspected in patients with cryptoccocal meningitis, combined with humoral and cell mediated immunity with a negative HIV test. The management issues, in addition to antifungal therapy, include nutritional supplements for the protein losing enteropathy.","1664":"Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC) is a rare neurodegenerative disease seen mainly in the Aggarwal community in India. It is characterized by early-onset macrocephaly with mild motor developmental delay, gradual onset ataxia, spasticity, seizures and usually late onset mild cognitive deterioration. Very few familial cases of MLC have been reported in the world literature, and to the best of our knowledge, there is no published study of all three siblings affected with MLC in a same family. Here, we are reporting three siblings belonging to a non-Aggarwal Hindu family, affected with MLC, who presented with early-onset macrocephaly and gradual onset ataxia.","1665":"Some orthopedic complications have been reported in the hereditary neuropathies. However, the association of the hip dysplasia with this category of neuropathy is rarely recognized. We present a 13-year-old boy with the progressive weakness of the lower extremities, difficulty in walking, climbing stairs, and rising from floor; a wide-based, hyper-extended and waddling gait similar to a myopathic process. Hip radiography showed dysplastic acetabulae with hip subluxation, broken Shenton's lines, and valgus femoral necks. In electrodiagnosis, there was a significant neuropathic process (absent all evoked sensory potentials, abnormal evoked motor responses, and neurogenic electeromyography) which eventually was found to be a hereditary mixed axonal and demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy with concomitant hip dysplasia confirmed with thorough physical examination and the electrodiagnostic study. In patients with gait difficulties such as waddling gait mimicking a myopathic process, hereditary polyneuropathy complicated with hip dysplasia should be considered as well.","1666":"Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a clinical and radiologic entity with typical symptoms including headache, seizures, visual disturbance, altered mental status, vomiting, nausea and focal neurologic signs. In this article, we report recurrent and atypical PRES in a child with hypertension due to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was on a peritoneal dialysis program for 6 months. After the second hypertension attack, PRES findings did not recover and persisted as encephalomalacia. As far as we know, this case is the first child with ESRD who developed encephalomalacia after recurrent episodes of PRES. When a patient with a history of PRES presented with new clinical and neuroradiological findings, recurrent PRES should be considered.","1667":"Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD) is a rare disorder presenting typically with acute or subacute severe cerebellar ataxia. PCD is most commonly associated with small cell lung cancer followed by adenocarcinoma of breast and ovary, and Hogdkin's lymphoma. We report a case of a 54-year-old male with acute-onset pancerebellar syndrome with underlying Hodgkin's lymphoma. A high index of suspicion of PCD resulted in arriving at an early diagnosis of underlying Hodgkin's disease. The patient was managed with six cycles of chemotherapy, which resulted in clinical stabilization and reversal of magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities. Antitumor therapy appears to have a significant impact on reversing PCD and hence early diagnosis and intervention for the primary remains the corner stone in stabilizing the neurological condition.","1668":"Neuropathic arthropathy of the shoulder is a relatively rare disorder characterized by destruction of joint secondary to loss of sensory innervation. Bilateral Charcot arthropathy is an even rarer disorder, with very few cases reported in the English literature.

Radiological finding on one side was of resorptive type and resorptive mixed with productive on the other side.","1669":"","1670":"The main object of the present study is to assess neuromotor development of high-risk infants by using three tests, and to determine inter-test concordance and the feasibility of these tests. One-hundred and nine patients aged between 0 and 6 months and identified as \"high-risk infant\" according to the Kliegman's criteria were enrolled to the study. Three different tests were used to assess neuromotor development of the patients: Bayley scales of infant development-II (BSID-II), Alberta infant motor scale (AIMS), and Milani Comparetti Motor Development Screening Test (MCMDST). Correlation analysis was performed between pure scores of BSID-II motor scale and total scores of AIMS. These two tests were highly correlated (r:0.92). Moderate concordance was found between BSID-II and AIMS (k:0.35). Slight concordance was found between BSID-II and MCMDST; and the concordance was slight again for AIMS and MCMDST (k:0.11 and k:0.16, respectively) too. AIMS has a high correlation and consistency with BSID-II and can be used with routine neurological examination as it is based on observations, has few items, and requires less time to complete. ","1671":"To determine the utility of the Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale as a stroke recognition tool among Chinese patients in the prehospital setting. Compared with the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale (CPSS), emergency physicians prospectively used the ROSIER as a stroke recognition tool on suspected patients in the prehospital setting. And, the final discharge diagnosis of stroke or transient ischemic attack made by neurologists, after assessment and review of clinical symptomatology and brain imaging findings, was used as the reference standard for diagnosis in the study. Then, the ROSIER and the CPSS like sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), related coefficient (r) and Kappa value were calculated. In this study, 540 of 582 suspected stroke patients met the study criteria. The CPSS showed a diagnostic Se of 88.77% (95% confidence intervals [CI] 86.11-91.43%), Sp of 68.79% (95% CI 64.88-72.70%), PPV of 87.40% (95% CI 85.97-88.83%), NPV of 71.52% (95% CI 67.71-75.33%) and r of 0.503. Relatively, the ROSIER showed a diagnostic Se of 89.97% (95% CI 87.44-92.64%), Sp of 83.23% (95% CI 80.08-86.38%), PPV of 92.66% (95% CI 90.46-94.86%), NPV of 77.91% (95% CI 74.41-81.41%) and r of 0.584. According to the final discharge diagnosis, both the ROSIER and the CPSS were associated with the final discharge diagnosis (P &lt; 0.05).The Kappa statistic value of the ROSIER and the CPSS were 0.718 and 0.582, respectively. However, there was no statistical significance of the positive rate between the ROSIER and the CPSS in this study (P &gt; 0.05). The ROSIER is a sensitive and specific stroke recognition tool for health providers' use among Chinese patients in the prehospital setting. However, it cannot be used to confidently rule out or identify stroke as a diagnosis. Comprehensive clinical assessment and further examination on potential stroke patients are still important and cannot be replaced. When it is difficult to objectively complete the ROSIER for patients, the CPSS could replace it in the prehospital setting.

Sixty consecutive cases of acute ischemic stroke hospitalised within 24 h of an episode of stroke were taken as subjects. All subjects underwent a computed tomography head, and those found to have evidence of bleed\/space-occupying lesions were excluded from the study. The subjects taken up for the study were divided into two groups of 30 subjects each. Both the groups received the standard protocol management for acute ischemic stroke. Subjects of Group 1 additionally received intravenous magnesium sulfate as initial 4 g bolus dose over 15 min followed by 16 g as slow infusion over the next 24 h. In all the subjects of the two study groups, serum magnesium levels were estimated at the time of admission (Day 0), Day 1 and Day 2 of hospitalization using an atomic absorption spectrometer. Scandinavian stroke scores were calculated on Day 3, day of discharge and Day 28. Paired t-test was employed for comparison of stroke scores on Day 3, day of discharge and Day 28 within the same group and the unpaired t-test was used for the intergroup comparison, i.e. comparison of stroke scores of control group with corresponding stroke scores of magnesium group. Comparison of stroke scores on Day 3 and day of discharge, on the day of discharge and Day 28 and on Day 3 and Day 28 in the magnesium group produced a t-value of 5.000 and P &lt;0.001, which was highly significant. However, the comparison of the mean stroke scores between the magnesium and the control groups on Day 3, day of discharge and Day 28 yielded a P-value of &gt;0.05, which was not significant. The study failed to document a statistical significant stroke recovery in spite of achieving a significant rise in serum magnesium level, more than that necessary for neuroprotection, with an intravenous magnesium sulfate regime.

We analyzed the publishing trends and the research productivity of neurology-related articles in the Journal of the Association of Physicians of India (JAPI). We carried the bibliometric analysis of articles related to neurology specialty from JAPI published between 2000 and 2011. Data were derived from the journal's website and the articles were analyzed for type (original article, case reports, etc.), disease (infection, vascular, etc.), place, and timelines for publication. Out of total 2977 articles published, 256 articles belong to neurology. Neurology contributed to 7--20% of the published articles per year in JAPI. Case reports (52%) constitute the majority type of articles followed by Original Articles (20%), Correspondence and Images (15% each). Infections (27%), structural disorders (19%), cerebrovascular and peripheral nervous system disorders (16% each) contribute the majority of research articles in Neurology. Mumbai (15%), Delhi (13%), and Chennai (9%) are the top three contributors followed by Lucknow and Varanasi. All types of articles took about 9--10 months for acceptance and another 4--5 months for publication. Letters to the Editor were published faster when compared to other articles (P=0.0035). Neurology specialty contributes an average 14% of articles per annum in JAPI.

It is mainly seen as occupational hazards in farmers, tree dwellers and honey collectors. Common clinical presentation includes minor localized reactions in form of swelling and redness sometimes anaphylactic reaction. Infrequent major complications reported from different studies include rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure (ARF), acute pulmonary edema, intravascular coagulation, encephalopathy and very rarely cerebral haemorrhage. Stroke due to multiple intra- cerebral infarcts along with rhabdomyolysis in patient of honey-bee bite is rare neurological complication. We report a case of 70 year man with honey-bee bite and multiple intracerebral infarcts presented as stroke, and rhabdomyolysis and ARF. When a patient presented with honey-bee bite, one should suspect serious complications. Despite advances in the understanding of pathophysiology its complications remains enigmatic and in some instances may be multifactorial.

It has been reported in various clinical conditions apart from patients with epilepsy. We describe 4 patients with different etiologies presenting with signal changes in the splenium of corpus callosum. They were diagnosed as having progressive myoclonic epilepsy (case 1), localization-related epilepsy (case 2), hemicrania continua (case 3), and postinfectious parkinsonism (case 4). While three patients had complete involvement of the splenium on diffusion-weighted image (\"boomerang sign\"), the patient having hemicrania continua showed semilunar involvement (\"mini-boomerang\") on T2-weighted and FLAIR image. All the cases had noncontiguous involvement of the splenium. We herein, discuss these cases with transient splenial involvement and stress that such patients do not need aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. An attempt has been made to review the literature regarding the pathophysiology, etiology, and outcome of such lesions.","1682":"In patients with central nervous system disease, life-threatening hyponatremia can result from either the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone or cerebral salt wasting. Clinical manifestations of the two conditions may be similar, but their pathogeneses and management protocols are different. Cerebral salt wasting syndrome is a disorder in which excessive natriuresis and hyponatremia occurs in patients with intracranial diseases. We report a 6-month-old girl with CSWS associated with tuberculous meningoencephalitis. She was diagnosed as having CSWS on the basis of hypovolemia, polyuria, natriuresis, and the relatively high level of fractional excretion of uric acid. Aggressive replacement of urine salt and water losses using 0.9% or 3% sodium chloride was done.

Many complications such as psychosis, arterial hypertension, angina pectoris, and myocardial infarction have been reported in connection to khat abuse. We present a case of a young man who presented with acute onset left-sided weakness. He was a known khat addict for over three decades. A diagnosis of left hemiplegia due to right middle cerebral artery infarction was established. Detailed evaluation revealed no significant underlying cause for stroke. Since the main central nervous system effects of khat are comparable with those of amphetamines and there are established reports of stroke in amphetamine abuse, the former was assumed to be the etiological factor. The patient was discontinued from taking khat and was managed conservatively. The subject showed significant recovery with no further complications or similar episodes during follow-up. To the best of our knowledge, this is the second case of stroke associated with khat. Since the management is essentially conservative, a vigilant history eliciting of khat abuse in prevalent countries would cut down unnecessary healthcare costs.","1686":"Neurological complications following honey bee sting are rare.

Here, we report a case of an 11-year-old immunocompetent child who developed temporal lobe abscess and subdural empyema following chronic otitis media. A right temporal craniotomy was performed and the abscess was excised. The Ziehl Nielsen staining of the aspirated pus from the temporal lobe abscess yielded acid fast bacilli. Prompt administration of antituberculous treatment resulted in complete recovery of the child. Even though the subdural abscess was not drained, we presume that to be of tubercular aetiology. Ours is probably the first case of brain abscess and subdural empyema due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis reported in the same child. This case is being reported because of its rarity and to stress the importance of routine staining for tubercle bacilli in all cases of brain abscess, especially in endemic areas, as it is difficult to differentiate tuberculous from pyogenic abscess clinically as well as histopathologically.","1689":"The number of implanted vagal nerve stimulators is growing and the need for removal or revision of the devices will become even more frequent. A significant concern about Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) therapy is the presence of the spiral stimulating electrodes, wrapped around the nerve, once treatment is considered ineffective or is no longer desired. Our purpose is to demonstrate the feasibility of complete removal and replacement of the vagal nerve stimulator electrodes using microsurgical technique even after a long period, without damaging the nerve. We attempted removal and replacement of spiral stimulating electrodes from a patient who received a 10-year long VNS therapy for drug-resistant epilepsy. Our results indicate that the spiral electrodes may be safely removed from the vagus nerve, even after several years. The reversibility of lead implantation may enhance the attractiveness of VNS therapy. Furthermore, with a correct microsurgical technique, it is possible to respect the normal anatomy and functionality of vagal nerve and to reimplant a new VNS system with all its components, maintaining the same therapeutic efficacy after many years.","1690":"There is a lack of knowledge about epilepsy among the students and the population in general, with consequent prejudice and discrimination toward epileptic patients. Knowledge, behavior, attitude and myth toward epilepsy among urban school children in Bareilly district was studied. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among students of 10 randomly selected secondary schools of the urban areas in Bareilly district. A structured, pretested questionnaire was used to collect data regarding sociodemographic characteristics and assess the subject's knowledge, behavior, attitude and myth toward epilepsy. Of the 798 students (533 boys and 265 girls) studied, around 98.6% had heard of epilepsy. About 63.7% correctly thought that epilepsy is a brain disorder while 81.8% believed it to be a psychiatric disorder. Other prevalent misconceptions were that epilepsy is an inherited disorder (71.55%) and that the disease is transmitted by eating a nonvegetarian diet (49%). Most of them thought that epilepsy can be cured (69.3) and that an epileptic patient needs lifelong treatment (77.2). On witnessing a seizure, about 51.5% of the students would take the person to the hospital. Majority (72.31%) of the students thought that children with epilepsy should study in a special school. Although majority of the students had reasonable knowledge of epilepsy, myths and superstitions about the condition still prevail in a significant proportion of the urban school children.

Their Anthropometric data is recorded. They are interviewed and investigated for PCOS and thyroid dysfunction. Twenty healthy women in the reproductive age group served as controls. BMI&gt;25 is taken as cut-off for Obesity. PCOS is defined as menstrual irregularity and\/or clinical \/biochemical hyperandrogenism with ultrasound evidence of PCO as per the Rotterdam criteria. TSH &lt;0.1 and &gt;4 is taken as evidence of thyroid dysfunction. Women are grouped according to the anticonvulsant drug received and the data analyzed in each group. The mean BMI among VAL and CBZ users is significantly higher than among DPH users (23.3 &amp; 23.4 vs 20.4). There is no significant difference in incidence of PCOS among WWE using either DPH or VAL or CBZ. Elevated TSH&gt;4 is seen more often in WWE on VAL (9\/20) compared to CBZ (6\/20) and DPH (3\/20). WWE on CBZ, VAL and DPH did not differ in mean BMI, Obesity, PCOS compared to healthy controls. As compared to healthy controls, more WWE on drug therapy had significantly elevated TSH (1\/20 vs20\/60). WWE on VAL and CBZ had significant weight gain compared to DPH users.

Syncope and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures are major differential diagnoses and must be carefully excluded in therapy-resistant cases. Individual episodes can have up to seven phases in secondarily generalized GTCs. The distinction between primary and secondary GTCs depends mainly on history and EEG, and yield can be improved with sleep deprivation or overnight recording. Epilepsies with primary or unclassified GTCs can respond to any one of the five broad-spectrum antiepileptic drugs (AEDs): valproate, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, topiramate and zonisamide.

The ventromedial prefrontal lobe (VMPFL) is supposed to be involved in creative cognition and the dorsolateral prefrontal lobe (DLPFL) in creative output. The conceptual ventral and dorsal visual system pathways likely represent the inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculi. During artistic production, conceptualization is conceived in the VMPFL and the executive part is operated through the DLFPL. The latter transfers the concept to the visual brain through the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), relaying on its path to the parietal cortex. The conceptualization at VMPFL is influenced by activity from the anterior temporal lobe through the uncinate fasciculus and limbic system pathways. The final visual image formed in the visual brain is subsequently transferred back to the DLPFL through the SLF and then handed over to the motor cortex for execution. During art appreciation, the image at the visual brain is transferred to the frontal lobe through the SLF and there it is matched with emotional and memory inputs from the anterior temporal lobe transmitted through the uncinate fasiculus. Beauty is perceived at the VMPFL and transferred through the uncinate fasciculus to the hippocampo-amygdaloid complex in the anterior temporal lobe. The limbic system (Papez circuit) is activated and emotion of appreciation is evoked. It is postulated that in practice the entire circuitry is activated simultaneously.","1701":"","1702":"","1703":"","1704":"Moyamoya disease is a clinical entity characterized by progressive cerebrovascular occlusion with spontaneous development of a collateral vascular network called Moyamoya vessels.

The clinical presentation, laboratory parameters and biopsy findings of the patients were analyzed and compared with other studies from India done over the last decade. A total of 15 patients were diagnosed with temporal arteritis. The male:female ratio was 1.5:1. The mean age of onset was 67.58 years. Mean time for detection after onset of symptoms was 2.56 months. Typical manifestations included headache (100%), temporal artery tenderness (100%), jaw claudication (20%), polymyalgia rheumatica (53%) and visual manifestations (20%). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated in all patients. Biopsy was done in 13 patients, with 11 of them being positive. All patients responded to steroids well, with most patients being symptom-free within the first 48 h of treatment. Temporal arteritis seems to be underdiagnosed in India, with all patients previously misdiagnosed, and with a mean time from symptom onset to diagnosis of 2.5 months.

Low cholesterol was defined by the sex-specific lowest quintile of the population. The proportion of ICH patients with low cholesterol was significantly higher than the controls (68% vs. 43%). Mean total cholesterol was also signficantly low in ICH patients compared with controls (177 mg\/dL vs. 200 mg\/dl; P-value = 0.0006). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and triglycerides were also significantly low in ICH patients compared with controls. Mean LDL-C in the ICH patient group was 114 mg\/dL, whereas it was 128.5 mg\/dL in the control group (P-value = 0.016). There was no significant difference in the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels in both groups. In a subgroup analysis, both men and women in the ICH group had a significantly low mean cholesterol compared with the control group. Although lower mean cholesterol was seen in both young and older individuals in the ICH group than in controls, the difference was significant only in the older group (age &gt;45 years). In multivariate analysis, presence of low cholesterol remained a significant predictor of hemorrhage. The odds ratio of low cholesterol in the hemorrhage cases was 2.75 (95% CI = 1.44-5.49) unadjusted and 2.15 (1.13-4.70) adjusted for age and hypertension. This study confirms an increased risk of primary ICH associated with low cholesterol both in men and women, especially in older individuals.

They are usually autoimmune in nature. Often, PNS precedes the manifestations of cancer. Onconeural antibodies are important in the diagnosis and management of these disorders. These antibodies are specific for the malignancy rather than for a particular neurological syndrome. Often, there are different antibodies associated with the same syndrome. Multiple antibodies are also known to coexist in a given patient with malignancy. While investigating a patient for suspected PNS, the entire gamut of onconeural antibodies should be investigated so as not to miss the diagnosis. In 30-40% of the cases, PNS can occur without antibodies. Investigations for identifying the underlying cancer can be directed by the antibody panel. If conventional screening for cancer is negative, a positron emission scanning\/computed tomography scan can be useful. Patients need follow-up surveillance for cancer if not detected in the first instance. Cancer detection and treatment, immunotherapy and supportive care are important components of treatment of PNS. Immunotherapy is very effective in PNS associated with cell membrane-associated antibodies like voltage-gated potassium channel complex, NMDA receptor antibodies and voltage-gated calcium channel antibodies. Immunotherapy includes steroids, IVIgG, plasmaphereis, cytotoxic medications and rituximab. Supportive therapy includes symptomatic treatment with antiepileptic and analgesic medications, physiotherapy, speech therapy and occupational therapy. PNS can mimic any neurologic syndrome. A high index of clinical suspicion is important for early diagnosis and prompt management and better outcome.","1719":"","1720":"","1721":"","1722":"Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an immune-mediated disease that compromises the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction. Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is considered an immune-mediated cholestatic liver disease. Both MG and PSC include an autoimmune pathogenesis, so there is some evidence that patients with MG or PSC have a higher risk of developing autoantibodies and other immune disorders than normal controls, but the coexistence of these two disorders has never been documented. We report a 40-year-old woman who presented with MG when she was 20 years old and developed PSC 20 years after a thymectomy. Liver biochemistry revealed cholestasis. Magnetic resonance imaging showed multifocal strictures and beads involving the intrahepatic bile ducts. A liver biopsy confirmed sclerosing cholangitis. Serological analysis demonstrated positive autoantibodies (Anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-smooth muscle antibodies). Repetitive stimulation had a decremental response, and antibodies to acetylcholine receptors were detectable. To our knowledge, this is the first case of PSC in a patient with MG. The main characteristics of both MG and PSC combination are discussed.","1723":"Neurological syndromes are not an uncommon presentation with insulinomas. Recurrent hypoglycemia associated with it can present with a variety of neurological symptoms that may include disturbances of consciousness, seizures, stroke-like presentation, movement disorder, dementia and chronic neuropathy. The myriad of presentations, resemblance with other neurological conditions and episodic nature often lead to misdiagnosis and a delay in definitive treatment. Rare cases of insulinoma presenting as combination of abnormal movements have been described. We report a patient who presented with both hypoglycemia induced symptomatic seizures and paroxysmal non-kinesiogenic dystonic choreoathetosis. Insulinoma is a potentially treatable disorder and early definitive intervention can prevent long term neurological disability in patients.","1724":"Triad of leukoencephalopathy, cerebral calcifications and cysts (LCC) is a recently reported rare disease named 'Labrune syndrome' after the first case was reported in 1996 by Labrune et al. Herein, we report a case of a 36-year-old man with mild right-sided weakness and seizures for 5 years. CT of brain revealed extensive calcification involving bilateral basal ganglia, right thalamus and bilateral deep cerebellar nuclei. A supratentorial cystic lesion with blood fluid level was seen in left occipitotemporal region. MRI examination revealed diffuse symmetric white matter hyperintensity suggesting leukoencephalopathy. On follow-up, patient reported improvement in the weakness and no further seizure episodes. However, follow-up of MRI revealed persistence of lesions. Differential diagnosis considered were parasitic infections (hydatid, cysticercosis), Coat's plus disease and causes of diffuse cerebral calcification like Fahr's disease and post-radiotherapy\/chemotherapy. Serology for parasitic infections was negative. No history of radiotherapy or chemotherapy in the past could be elicited in the history. Another close differential is Coat's plus disease which can mimic LCC pathologically.","1725":"Myotonia congenita is a genetic muscle disorder characterized by clinical and electrical myotonia, muscle hypertrophy, and stiffness. It is inherited as either autosomal-dominant or -recessive, known as Thomsen and Becker diseases, respectively. These diseases are distinguished by the severity of their symptoms and their patterns of inheritance. Becker disease usually appears later in childhood than Thomsen disease and causes more severe muscle stiffness and pain. Mutations in the muscular voltage-dependent chloride channel gene (CLCN1), located at 7q35, have been found in both types. We report here the case of a Moroccan consanguineous family with a myotonic autosomal-recessive condition in two children. The molecular studies showed that the patients reported here are homozygous for mutation p.Gly482Arg in the CLCN1 gene. The parents were heterozygote carriers for mutation p.Gly482Arg. This diagnosis allowed us to provide an appropriate management to the patients and to make a genetic counselling to their family.","1726":"Takayasu's arteritis is a chronic, idiopathic, medium and large vessel vasculitis involving aorta and its main branches. Frequent neurological manifestations include postural syncope, seizures, and blindness. Stroke, as presenting feature of Takayasu's arteritis, is unusual. CT angiography reveals characteristic involvement of aortic arch and its branches. Involvement of intracranial vasculature is rather unusual. We are describing an unusual patient of Takayasu's arteritis who presented with recurrent disabling syncopal attacks and had extensive involvement of intracranial vasculature. CT angiography revealed severe involvement of aortic arch. There was near complete occlusion at origins of both subclavian arteries, distal flow was maintained by collateral vessels along the chest wall. There was near total occlusion (at origin) of right common carotid with normal flow in distal part. The left common carotid was more severely involved showing greater than 80% narrowing in proximal half of the vessel. CT angiography also revealed involvement of left internal carotid artery, narrowing of left middle cerebral artery and involvement of cortical vessels. Patient was treated with oral corticosteroids. She improved remarkably after two and half months of follow up.","1727":"Ischemic stroke following viper bite is rare. We report a case of posterior circulation ischemic infarction following viper bite in a previously healthy woman. Soon after being bitten by the snake on the left leg, she developed local redness, echymosis and one hour later became drowsy. On examination she had skew deviation of eyes and down gaze preference, generalized hypotonia. A CT scan of brain showed infarcts in cerebellar hemispheres and occipital lobes on both sides and that was confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging of brain. Her coagulation profile was deranged. Most common and serious central nervous system complication following snake bite is intracranial hemorrhage. Ischemic stroke commonly involves anterior circulation. Bilateral cerebellar and occipital infraction is not yet reported in literature. Exact cause for the development of infarction is not clear. The possible mechanisms of infarction in this scenario are discussed. Patient was treated with anti-snake venom and showed a good recovery. Early imaging and early treatment with anti-snake venom is important for a favorable outcome.","1728":"Transient cortical blindness (TCB) is a well known but rare complication of administration of contrast agent. In this case report, we present a 53-year-old woman who is a follow-up case of sarcoidosis and developed TCB with focal neurological symptoms following contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral T2\/Flair hyperintensities in parieto-occipital, high frontal, and cerebellar hemispheres with involvement of corpus callosum. Clinically and radiologically patient improved significantly in 4 days. The exact mechanism is still speculative and its possible relationship with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome is briefly discussed. The patient's symptoms were presumed to be exacerbated by presence of hypertension, underlying autoimmune disorder, sepsis, and high osmolality of contrast agent. Though there is no definite evidence to suggest that a certain treatment regimen improves the natural history of this disease but control of risk factors can possibly prevent this rare but devastating complication.","1729":"A 20-year-old man presented with left-sided headache and seizures of three years duration. Conglomerate ring-enhancing lesions were seen in the first magnetic resonance imaging study. He was initially treated with anticonvulsants for two years. Because the symptoms and the lesions were persisting, antitubercular treatment was added. He was asymptomatic after antitubercular treatment despite persisting lesion. Lesion showed exuberant ring enhancement with increased perfusion. Because the lesion was persisting even after 24 months of antitubercular treatment, excision was considered. Lesionectomy was done and histopathology reported meningoencephalitis secondary to neurocysticercosis. The case report highlights the difficulty in differentiating cysticercosis from tuberculoma in patients from countries where both the conditions are endemic.","1730":"The case of an 82-year-old female with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD), who developed unusual artistic creativity after development of her disease, is described. The possible pathogenetic mechanism is discussed. The patient showed no inclination toward visual arts during her premorbid years. However, 4 years after development of AD suggestive symptoms she started painting beautiful pictures rather impulsively. Some such paintings have been appreciated even by a qualified art expert. Such de novo development of artistic creativity had been described earlier in subjects with the semantic form of fronto-temporal dementia (FTD), but not in AD. The prevailing concept of lateralized compromise and paradoxical functional facilitation, proposed in connection with FTD subjects, may not be applicable in AD subjects where the affection is more diffuse and more posterior in the brain. Hence, the likely pathogenetic mechanism involved in the case described may remain uncertain. Possibilities are discussed.","1731":"Statistical analysis is an essential technique that enables a medical research practitioner to draw meaningful inference from their data analysis.

This case-control retrospective study was carried out in the pediatric neurology outpatient service of the Trivandrum Medical College. All children (1-12 years) with epilepsy satisfying the selection criteria were included, after obtaining consent from parents. Those with single seizures or febrile seizures were excluded. Controls were children without epilepsy attending the same hospital. Parents were interviewed and clinical data were obtained from medical records. Statistical analysis included chi-square test, odds ratio (OR), and logistic regression. There were 82 cases and 160 controls whose mean age was 6.9 + 3.6 and 5.2 + 3.1, years respectively. On univariate analysis, family history of epilepsy, prolonged labor, cyanosis at birth, delayed cry after birth, admission to newborn intensive care unit, presence of congenital malformations, neurocutaneous markers, incessant cry in the first week, delayed developmental milestones, meningitis, encephalitis, and head trauma were found to be significant. On logistic regression, family history of epilepsy (OR 4.7), newborn distress (OR 8.6), delayed developmental milestones (OR 12.6), and head trauma (OR 5.8) were found to be significant predictors. Infants who had history of newborn distress are likely to manifest epilepsy before 1 year if they are eventually going to have epilepsy (OR 3.4). Modifiable factors such as newborn distress and significant head trauma are significant risk factors for childhood epilepsy. Newborn distress is a risk factor for early-onset (&lt;1 year age) epilepsy. ","1733":"Epilepsy is a chronic medical condition with many co-morbid features. It has been observed that children with epilepsy (CWE) have a compromised quality of life (QOL). To assess the QOL in CWE and to study the various factors affecting QOL among CWE. The sample consisted of 102 CWE aged 5-15 years of either sex. QOL was measured by Quality of Life in Childhood Epilepsy (QOLCE) questionnaire, a 76-item, parent-reported questionnaire. Cronbach alpha was used to determine the internal consistency of the subscales and Pearson correlation to determine construct validity. The t-test and analysis of variance were used to compare mean QOLCE scores. Factors affecting QOL included age, place of residence, socioeconomic condition, maternal education, seizure type and frequency and number of antiepileptic drugs. CWE have a relatively compromised QOL and comprehensive care needs to go beyond the attempt of controlling seizures.

Neurological complications of dengue infection have been observed more frequently in the recent past and some studies highlighted varied neurological complications arising in the course of dengue illness. In this retrospective study, we report various neurological complications observed during the last 2 years in patients of dengue fever. The patients presenting with neurological complications with positive serology (IgM antibody) for dengue infection were consecutively recruited from the Department of Neurology\/Medicine from a tertiary center of Lucknow, India. These patients were subjected to a detailed clinical evaluation, laboratory assessment including blood count, hematocrit, coagulation parameters, biochemical assays, serology for dengue fever, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for human immunodeficiency virus and other relevant investigations. Twenty-six patients with neurological complications associated with confirmed dengue infection were observed during the last 2 years. Eighteen of these patients were male. Of the 26 patients, 10 patients were suffering from brachial neuritis, four patients had encephalopathy, three patients were consistent with the diagnosis of Guillain Barre syndrome, three patients had hypokalemic paralysis associated with dengue fever and two patients had acute viral myositis. Opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome was diagnosed in two patients, myelitis in one patient and acute disseminated encephalo-myelitis also in one patient. Dengue fever was associated with widespread neurological complications. Brachial neuritis and opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome were observed for the first time in this study.

Stagewise distribution of the patients revealed 2.5% in stage I, 48.7% in stage IIA, 33.8% in stage IIB, 8.7% in stage III, and 6.3% in stage IV. The surgical approach was either trans-sternal (n=67) or video-assisted thoracoscopic route (n=13). Follow-up was obtained in 91.2% (n=73) of patients with mean duration of 67.7 months. At their last follow-up, 26.0% were in complete remission, 35.6% were asymptomatic on decreased medications, and 17.8% had clinical improvement on decreased medications. Overall, 79.4% of patients benefited from surgery, 8.2% had unchanged disease status, and 12.3% worsened clinically. Factors influencing favorable outcome include sex, disease stage, gland weight, and preoperative medication with anti-cholinesterase (P&lt;0.05).

It has also been used as a therapeutic tool in various neuropsychiatric disorders because of its ability to specifically modulate distinct brain areas. Studies have shown that repeated stimulation at low frequency produces long-lasting inhibition, which is called as long-term depression, whereas repeated high-frequency stimulation can produce excitation through long-term potentiation. This paper reviews the current status of rTMS as an investigative and therapeutic modality in various neuropsychiatric disorders. It has been used to study the cortical and subcortical functions, neural plasticity and brain mapping in normal individuals and in various neuropsychiatric disorders. rTMS has been most promising in the treatment of depression, with an overall milder adverse effect profile compared with electroconvulsive therapy. In other neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, mania, epilepsy and substance abuse, it has been found to be useful, although further studies are required to establish therapeutic efficacy. It appears to be ineffective in the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder. There is a paucity of studies of efficacy and safety of rTMS in pediatric and geriatric population. Although it appears safe, further research is required to optimize its efficacy and reduce the side-effects. Magnetic seizure therapy, which involves producing seizures akin to electroconvulsive therapy, appears to be of comparable efficacy in the treatment of depression with less cognitive adverse effects.","1741":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common motor neuron disease in adults. Typically, patients with ALS develop progressive weakness resulting, eventually, in respiratory muscle paralysis and death in 3-5 years after the onset of the disease. No definite therapy currently exists for ALS. The biologic basis of the disease is unknown. However, ALS research has taken a dramatic turn over the last 3 years. Landmark discoveries of mutations in the transactive response DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) and fused in sarcoma\/translocated in liposarcoma (FUS\/TLS) as causative of ALS and demonstration that abnormal aggregation of these proteins is the proximate cause of motor neuron loss in familial and sporadic ALS have initiated a paradigm shift in understanding the pathogenic mechanism of this disease. TDP-43 and FUS\/TLS are DNA\/RNA-binding proteins with striking structural and functional similarities. This article reviews the current direction of research efforts toward understanding the role of RNA (ribonucleic acid) processing regulation in ALS and possible therapeutic pathways in this fatal disease.","1742":"The present article is a treatise on the illuminating voyage of a Neurophysician along the fascinating horizons and frontiers of neurosciences.

These atypical presentations can cause delayed diagnosis resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a neuroradiologic condition associated with headache, seizures, altered sensorium, visual disturbances, and characteristic lesions on neuroimaging. We report a child with Takayasu's arteritis who presented a posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. He also had associated abdominal tuberculosis for which anti-tuberculous treatment was started. PRES was diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging with fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences. The child was started on nifedipine and propranolol. The child regained his consciousness within 48 h of admission. Prompt treatment of hypertension led to rapid reversal of neurological symptoms. In view of hypertension a computed tomography aortogram was done, which showed features suggestive of high grade (&gt;75%) focal proximal left renal artery stenosis. EULAR (European League Against Rheumatism)\/PReS (Paediatric Rheumatology European Society) consensus criteria was used for the diagnosis of Takayasu's arteritis in our patient.

There are a few case reports of central causes of fluctuating ptosis. A 58-year-old man presented with fluctuating ptosis of one year duration. He was diagnosed as having ocular myasthenia and investigated. On evaluation, his electrophysiological tests revealed negative decremental response and results of neostigmine test was negative. During follow-up, patient developed headache. Imaging of the brain revealed midbrain cysticercosis granuloma. The focal encephalitis and edema was responsible for fluctuating ptosis. It is therefore essential to be aware of conditions that cause such pseudomyasthenic features.

It is presumed to be autoimmune in origin with high serum titers of antithyroid peroxidase antibodies (anti-TPA). Thyroid function might often be normal. The diagnosis is arrived at by excluding other toxic, metabolic and infectious causes of encephalopathies, supportive clinical profile, elevated thyroid antibodies and optimum steroid response. We present the characteristic phenotypic manifestations, magnetic resonance imaging and electroechography observations and response to immunomodulation with follow-up in three cases of H.E. All the three cases manifested with subacute to chronic progressive encephalopathy, cerebellar dysfunction, seizures, behavioral abnormalities and oculomotor disturbances and had evidence of hypothyroidism, elevated titers of anti-TPA and positive thyroid anti-microsomal antibodies.

Desmoplastic variety of medulloblastoma is usually seen in the adults and is known to show some atypical features like lateral cerebellar location, variable enhancement, and early meningeal infilteration. Therefore medulloblastoma should always be considered in differential diagnosis of posterior fossa mass in adults even when typical imaging findings are not that of medulloblastoma. Enhancement pattern can be variable in these tumors varying from mild to striking. Occasionally, totally non-enhancing tumors are encountered, which can cause further diagnostic confusion. We describe the magnetic resonance (MR) and MR spectroscopy findings in a case of midline vermian mass, which did not show any enhancement on post-contrast images, and was subsequently proven to be desmoplastic medulloblastoma. On MR spectroscopy, the mass showed elevated choline peak consistent with mitotic lesion. No significant lipid lactate leak was seen, which is also consistent with the ususally homogeneous nature of these tumors. Moreover, it displayed taurine peak at 3.4 ppm which is considered fairly specific for medulloblastoma. Therefore, MR spectroscopy findings can be helpful in the diagnosis of medulloblastoma in adults when MR imaging findings can be nonspecific.","1759":"We describe a phenomenon of \"kinaesthetic extensor plantar response\" in advanced pyramidal dysfunction, an interesting observation noted in a patient with dorsal myelopathy. A 44-year-old woman presented with one-year history of gradually progressive weakness and stiffness of both lower limbs along with urge incontinence of urine. Examination showed spontaneous elicitation of extensor plantar response while assessing the tone by rolling method as well as on noxious stimulation of the thigh. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the dorsal spine and digital subtraction angiography showed the presence of spinal dural arteriovenous fistula causing myelopathy. This case exemplifies the fact that in advanced pyramidal dysfunction, not only the receptive field of Babinski reflex may extend to the leg or thigh, but may also integrate with other modalities of stimulation, such as the rolling movement.

We studied 74 patients with rheumatoid arthritis of at least 2 year duration for the presence of peripheral neuropathy both clinically and electrophysiologically. The data obtained were entered into a database and continuous variables were analyzed using the Student t test and categorical variables were analyzed using the chi-square test. Peripheral neuropathy was detected in 39.19% (29 out of 74 patients) patients on electrophysiologic testing and 82.76% (24 out of 29 patients) of the patients were asymptomatic. There was significant association between the presence of peripheral neuropathy and disease duration and rheumatoid factor positivity by the latex agglutination method. Sensory neuropathy was the most common form detected. Our study shows that subclinical peripheral neuropathy particularly sensory neuropathy which is not related to disease severity is very common in patients with prolonged disease duration.

We report three biopsy-proven cases of idiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis. All our patients had headaches and multiple cranial neuropathies; ataxia was seen in one patient. One patient had recurrent anterior and posterior cranial neuropathies, while one each had recurrent anterior and posterior cranial neuropathies. Two patients had profound irreversible mono-ocular visual loss. All of them showed prominent pachymeningeal thickening on imaging. Infarcts were seen in one patient, which have rarely been documented. All patients showed biopsy evidence of meningeal thickening and nonspecific chronic inflammation of the dura. The disease may have a remitting and relapsing course, and usually responds to steroids. Clinical improvement was excellent in two patients and modest in one on steroid therapy.

The clinical findings from our subjects showed that GAWH could result from either single\/multiple lesions including subcortical lesions. The recovery was rapid, although not complete. One case evolved into Wernicke's aphasia as seen in earlier studies. Two subjects revealed evolution to transcortical sensory aphasia and one to Broca's aphasia which is distinct from previous proposals. Two cases showed lack of clinico-anatomic correlation during recovery. GAWH could result from both embolic and large vessel strokes and single or multiple lesions. The recovery pattern may be variable and may show lack of clinico-anatomical correlation indicating anomalous cerebral functional reorganization, questioning the conventional teaching of language representation in the brain.

Of late, a new category of disorders, \"autoimmune encephalitis,\" has been described, which present with features similar to viral encephalitides. A well-delineated and common entity among this group is the recently described anti-NMDAR encephalitis (NMDARE). Although this entity was initially described in young women harboring ovarian teratomas, it is now characterised as well in children and men. Approximately 60% of the patients have an underlying tumor, usually an ovarian teratoma. In 40% of the patients, no cause can be found (idiopathic NMDARE). NMDARE typically presents with psychiatric features followed by altered level of consciousness, severe dysautonomia, hyperkinetic movement disorders, seizures and central hypoventilation. Orofacial dyskinesias resulting in lip and tongue mutilation are quite common. Seizures, are common and may be difficult to treat. The disease can be confirmed by serum and cerebrospinal fluid anti-NMDAR antibodies. Titers of these antibodies can also guide response to treatment. Tumor removal is necessary if identified, followed by immunological treatment. Intravenous methylprednisolone and immunoglobulins aim to suppress\/modulate immune response while plasma exchange attempts to remove antibodies and other inflammatory cytokines. Rituximab and cyclophosphamide aim to suppress antibody production. Recovery is slow and often with neurological deficits if treatment is delayed. With many distinctive clinical features, a specific antibody that aids diagnosis, and early effective treatment with commonly available drugs leading to good outcomes, NMDARE is a diagnosis that should be considered early in any case of \"unexplained encephalitis.\"","1770":"Nonpharmacological treatment of epilepsy includes surgery, vagal nerve stimulation, ketogenic diet, and other alternative\/complementary therapies, e.g., yoga, Ayurveda, electroencephalography (EEG) biofeedback technique, aerobic exercise, music therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, acupuncture, and herbal remedies (traditional Chinese medicine). Alternative therapies, despite the term, should not be considered as an alternative to antiepileptic medication; they complement accepted drug treatment. Alternative therapies like yoga, through techniques that relax the body and mind, reduce stress, improve seizure control, and also improve quality of life. Ketogenic diet is a safe and effective treatment for intractable epilepsies; it has been recommended since 1921. The diet induces ketosis, which may control seizures. The most successful treatment of epilepsy is with modern antiepileptic drugs, which can achieve control of seizures in 70-80% cases. Patients opt for alternative therapies because they may be dissatisfied with antiepileptic drugs due to their unpleasant side effects, the long duration of treatment, failure to achieve control of seizures, cultural beliefs and, in the case of women, because they wish to get pregnant Surgical treatment may lead to physical and psychological sequelae and is an option only for a minority of patients.

He was given neck massage and physical therapy for a day, and subsequently after two days developed severe generalized headache when sitting or standing. He was hospitalized in his hometown. Investigations revealed venous sinus thrombosis and bilateral thin subdural collections for which he was anticoagulated. Headache improved and then worsened and became severe in all positions. He was then admitted under our care. MRI scan of the brain at our hospital showed left subdural hematoma with midline shift. It required urgent evacuation. His previous first brain MRI was re-evaluated. It showed characteristic features of spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH). If not recognized early, SIH results in various complications, some of which require immediate intervention. Any change in the pattern of headache in SIH one must alert the clinician due to the possibility of one of its complications.","1805":"Simultaneous or sequential involvement of lungs is frequently encountered with neurological syndromes like meningoencephalitis, cerebellitis, aseptic meningitis, transverse myelitis, or multiple cranial nerve palsies. However, pulmonary involvement is frequently overlooked when all the attention of physician is diverted to neurological disorder. Prompt and early recognition of such potentially treatable association is required to improve diagnostic and therapeutic outcome.

Literature describing the neurological involvement in SS among Indian patients is lacking. Six patients of SS fulfilling the histological or serological criteria of the American European Consensus Group for SS were studied prospectively. The patients underwent clinical examination and laboratory investigations. Their clinical and investigation features are described. The age of the patients ranged from 26 to 48 years, with a male to female ratio of 2:4. In our series, peripheral sensori-motor neuropathy and sensory ataxic neuropathy was seen in 3\/6, mononeuritis multiplex in 2\/6, cranial neuropathy in 2\/6, autonomic neuropathy in 1\/6, myelopathy in 4\/6, optic neuropathy in 2\/6, with presence of classical sicca features in 5\/6 patients.

The conus medullaris is a primary site of schistosomiasis, either granulomatous or acute necrotizing myelitis. To report the clinical, radiological, and laboratory results of spinal cord schistosomiasis (SCS) and to design proper therapeutic regimens. Seventeen patients (13 males and four females) with SCS were enrolled between 1994 and 2009 at Mansoura University Hospitals. Their median age at diagnosis was 19 years (13-30 years). Independent neurological, radiological, and laboratory assessments were performed for both groups, excluding pathological confirmation that was done earlier in eight patients (Group 1). In the group 2 (nine patients), indirect hemagglutination (IHA) test for bilharziasis in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was performed. Higher positive titer in CSF than serum indicated SCS plus induction of antibilharzial and corticosteroid protocols for 12 months with a three-year follow-up. Rate of neurological symptoms of granulomatous intramedullary cord lesion was assessed independently in 16 cases and acute paraparesis in one case. All patients in group 2 had positive IHA against Schistosoma mansoni with median CSF and serum ranges 1\/640 and 1\/320, respectively. Seven patients (41.18%) had complete recovery, eight patients (47.06%) showed partial recovery, and no response was reported in two patients (11.76%) (P = 0.005). There was no recorded mortality in the current registry. Rapid diagnosis of SCS with early medical therapies for 12 months is a crucial tool to complete recovery.

To investigate the role of C. pneumoniae antibodies in AIS. Patients with AIS and sex- and environment-matched controls were enrolled. Antibodies to C. pneumoniae (IgA, IgG and IgM) were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A total of 51 patients and 48 controls were enrolled. The IgA seropositivity was significantly associated with AIS (unadjusted odds ratio 3.1; 95% CI 1.38, 6.96; P = 0.005), whereas IgG (unadjusted OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.18, 1.09; P = 0.07) and IgM (unadjusted OR 1.1; 95% CI 0.36, 3.3; P = 0.88) were not.

Pure motor (multifocal motor neuropathy), sensorimotor with asymmetrical involvement (multifocal acquired demylinating sensory and motor neuropathy), exclusively distal sensory (distal acquired demyelinating sensory neuropathy) and very proximal sensory (chronic immune sensory polyradiculopathy) constitute the variants of CIDP. Correct diagnosis of these entities is of importance in terms of initiation of appropriate therapy as well as prognostication of these patients. The rates of detection of immune-mediated neuropathies with monoclonal cell proliferation (monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance, multiple myeloma, etc.) have been facilitated as better diagnostic tools such as serum immunofixation electrophoresis are being used more often. Immune neuropathies associated with malignancies and systemic vasculitic disorders are being defined further and treated early with better understanding of the disease processes. As this field of dysimmune neuropathies will evolve in the future, some of the curious aspects of the clinical presentations and response patterns to different immunosuppressants or immunomodulators will be further elucidated. This review also discusses representative case studies.","1816":"Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder with diverse etiologies. Neuroimaging plays an important role in workup of patients with epilepsy. It helps to identify brain pathologies that require specific treatment; and also in formulating syndromic and etiological diagnoses so as to give patients and their relatives an accurate prognosis. Magnetic resonance imaging, specially the 3 tesla MRI is the imaging of choice because of its ability to detect small lesions like mesial temporal sclerosis, cortical dysplasias, small tumors, etc that are not detected by conventional MR or CT scan of brain. Identification of these lesions often helps in managing refractory epilepsies more effectively. However, cost and non-availability of MR in large part of the country necessitate the use of CT as an alternative. CT is often the initial investigation and also useful in acute situations. Functional imagings are used for pre-surgical work-up of refractory epilepsy cases with an aim to identify the epileptogenic focus and to delineate functional areas nearing the focus.","1817":"","1818":"","1819":"","1820":"The present report deals with the clinical phenomenology of three members (brothers) of one family with McLeod syndrome (MLS).

Dermatomyositis (DM) is a type of inflammatory myopathy that is strongly associated with a broad range of malignant disorders. The malignancy can occur before, concomitantly or after the onset of myositis. The malignancies most commonly associated with DM are carcinomas of ovary, lung, stomach, colorectal and pancreas, as well as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. An association of DM with carcinoma of the gall bladder (GB) is extremely rare with only two previously reported cases in the literature. We report a case of carcinoma of GB with DM as the paraneoplastic manifestation.","1824":"Vocal cord palsy can have myriad causes. Unilateral vocal cord palsy is common and frequently asymptomatic. Trauma, head, neck and mediastinal tumors as well as cerebrovascular accidents have been implicated in causing unilateral vocal cord palsy. Viral neuronitis accounts for most idiopathic cases. Bilateral vocal cord palsy, on the other hand, is much less common and is a potentially life-threatening condition. Myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disorder caused by antibodies targeting the post-synaptic acetylcholine receptor, has been infrequently implicated in its causation. We report here a case of bilateral vocal cord palsy developing in a 68-year-old man with no prior history of myasthenia gravis 2 months after he was operated on for diverticulitis of the large intestine. Delay in considering the diagnosis led to endotracheal intubation and prolonged mechanical ventilation with attendant complications. Our case adds to the existing literature implicating myasthenia gravis as an infrequent cause of bilateral vocal cord palsy. Our case is unusual as, in our patient, acute-onset respiratory distress and stridor due to bilateral vocal cord palsy was the first manifestation of a myasthenic syndrome.","1825":"","1826":"","1827":"","1828":"","1829":"Multidetector computed tomography angiography (MDCTA) is a minimally invasive radiological technique providing high-resolution images of the arterial wall and angiographic images of the lumen.

Review of patients identified prospectively over a 4-year period with VAD assessed by MDCTA was conducted. Radiological features of VAD on MDCTA were reanalyzed utilising previously reported criteria for VAD. Thirty-five patients (25 males, mean age 49.6 years) with a total of 45 dissected vertebral arteries were reviewed. MDCTA features of VAD included increased wall thickness in 44\/45 (97.7%) arteries and increased total vessel diameter in 42\/45 arteries (93.3%). All dissected arteries had either lumen stenosis (21\/45) or associated segmental occlusion (24\/45). An intimal flap was detected in 6\/45 (13.3 %) vessels. Twenty-five patients had follow-up imaging, 14\/32 vessels returned to normal, 4 showed improvement in stenosis but did not return to normal and 14 demonstrated no change. The majority of non-occluded vessels became normal or displayed improved patency. Only 4\/17 occluded arteries demonstrated re-establishment of flow. No adverse effects were recorded.

Two hundred and fourteen subjects were studied (109 NCC patients, and 105 age- and gender-matched controls without NCC). The participants were selected from neurology and medical wards of a tertiary referral hospital in northwest India. They were interviewed by trained medical interns using a questionnaire. 64.2% of the NCC patients and 19% of control group had heard about NCC (P &lt; 0.001). Knowledge regarding organ affected by NCC in the NCC group was 61.4% and in the control group was 80% (P = 0.09). Only 12.9% of the NCC group and none in the control group identified tape worm as a causative agent for NCC (P = 0.092). Negative effects of NCC on marriage and social life were more often cited by the NCC group but in the control group it was towards education (P = 0.004). The awareness of NCC was poor in both the groups. Educational programs are needed to improve the awareness about NCC among the patients and the public. ","1832":"The purpose of this study was to investigate Iintra-rater reliability of the Modified Tardieu Scale (MTS) in elbow flexors and ankle plantar flexors in adult subjects with stroke. A total of 91 subjects with stroke participated in this test-retest study. Intra-rater reliability of the MTS was investigated by a qualified and trained physiotherapist for elbow flexors and ankle plantar flexors in two sessions. A rater was one who performed the procedure and an observer only records the angles so that the rater was blinded to findings. Outcome measures in this study were measurable components of MTS, which are angle of muscle reaction (R1), passive range of motion (R2), dynamic component (R2-R1), and quality of muscle reaction (grade 0 - 4) termed as MTS score. Intra-rater reliability of MTS was very good for R1, R2, R2-R1, and MTS score (ICC &gt; 0.85, P&lt;0.0001) across two sessions in elbow flexors and ankle plantar flexors.

Retrospective chart review of patients with definite IIH was evaluated at the Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology between 1998 and 2006. Patients' demographic data, clinical, neuro-ophthalmic examinations, and treatment details were abstracted. Patients were further categorized into three groups based on whether they improved, worsened, or relapsed on follow-up. Final visual outcome of each patient was defined according to grading of the worse eye at the last visit. Statistical analysis included t test to compare group means and chi-square test to compare proportions. Of the 43 women included, visual impairment was observed in 80 eyes (93%) at presentation and it was moderate to severe in 14%. The mean CSF opening pressure at presentation did not differ significantly in those with visual impairment compared to those with normal vision. Those having early severe visual impairment had significantly higher (P = 0.015) likelihood of severe visual impairment on last follow-up. Of the total, 34 patients (79%) improved, 4 (9.3%) relapsed on follow-up after period of stability, and 5 (11.6%) worsened over 56 months follow-up (range, 26-132 months). The groups were comparable, except those who improved were younger (P&lt;0.05). At last examination, 9% had significant vision loss. IIH patients can have delayed worsening or relapses and about tenth of patients can have permanent visual loss early or late in the course of the disease.

","1834":"One hundred and forty-six years after its first description, the differential diagnosis of Meniere's disease remains very challenging. The aim of the present study is to review the current knowledge on the advantages and disadvantages of the new diagnostic methods for Meniere's disease. The importance of accurate diagnosis for primary healthcare systems is also discussed. An extensive search of the literature was performed in Medline and other available database sources. Information from electronic links and related books were also included. Controlled clinical studies, prospective cohort studies, retrospective cohort studies, cross-sectional studies, case reports, written guidelines, systematic reviews, and books were selected. The typical clinical triad of symptoms from the vestibular and cochlear systems (recurrent vertigo, fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus) is usually the key for clinical diagnosis. Glycerol dehydration test and electrocochleography are the main diagnostic tests in current practice, while vestibular evoked myogenic potentials may be used in disease staging. Imagine techniques are not specific enough to set alone the diagnosis of Meniere's disease, although they may be necessary to exclude other pathologies. Recently developed 3D MRI protocols can delineate the perilymphatic\/endolymphatic spaces of the inner ear and aid diagnosis. Meniere's disease is a continuous problem for the patients and affects their quality of life. Taking into account the frequent nature of the disease in certain countries, efforts for reliable diagnosis, prompt referral, and successful management are undoubtedly cost-effective for healthcare systems.","1835":"Attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of common neurodevelopmental disorder often comorbid with epilepsy. There are no existing guidelines on how to manage these two conditions when they are comorbid. To identify relationship between epilepsy and ADHD and to know role of antiepileptics and safety of stimulant like methylphenidate in such conditions from existing literature, we searched articles published in clinical journals available online between 1990-2010, with these key words in medline:children, epilepsy, seizure, comorbid, ADHD, treatment. Relevant abstracts were further selected for their focus on current topic. Cross references were extracted. Finally relevant articles that included original research articles, reviews and abstracts of non-english literature were used. Children with epilepsy may manifest with symptoms of ADHD. Children with ADHD may develop epilepsy. Some antiepileptics like phenobarbitone, gabapentin, topiramate may not be helpful in controlling behavioral symptoms of ADHD. Stimulants are the main stay of pharmacotherapy for ADHD but there is risk of decreasing seizure threshold in children with comorbid epilepsy especially when their epilepsy is not well controlled. Existing evidence is not in favor of screening children with ADHD for EEG abnormality before starting stimulant therapy.","1836":"A provoked seizure may be due to structural damage (resulting from traumatic brain injury, brain tumor, stroke, tuberculosis, or neurocysticercosis) or due to metabolic abnormalities (such as alcohol withdrawal and renal or hepatic failure). This article is a part of the Guidelines for Epilepsy in India. This article reviews the problem of provoked seizure and its management and also provides recommendations based on currently available information. Seizure provoked by metabolic disturbances requires correction of the triggering factors. Benzodiazepines are recommended for treatment of seizure due to alcohol withdrawal; gabapentin for seizure seen in porphyria; and antiepileptic drugs (AED), that are not inducer of hepatic enzymes, in the seizures seen in hepatic dysfunction. In severe traumatic brain injury, with or without seizure, phenytoin (PHT) may be given for 7 days. In ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke one may individualize the AED therapy. In cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), AED may be prescribed if there is seizure or computed tomographic (CT) abnormalities or focal weakness; the treatment, in these cases, has to be continued for 1 year. Prophylactic AED is not recommended in cases of brain tumor and neurosurgical procedures and if patient is on an AED it can be stopped after 1 week.","1837":"","1838":"Recent reports indicate that gait dysfunction can occur early in the course of cognitive decline suggesting that motor and cognitive functions in older adults may share common underlying brain substrates, pathological processes, and risk factors. This study was designed to report the association between gait and cognition in older adults in USA and the southern Indian state of Kerala. Literature review of gait and cognition studies conducted in Bronx County, USA as well as preliminary results from the Kerala-Einstein study (Kozhikode city, Kerala). Review of published studies based in the Bronx shows that both clinical and quantitative gait dysfunction are common in older adults with cognitive impairment. Furthermore, clinical and quantitative gait dysfunction in cognitively normal older adults was a strong predictor of future cognitive decline and dementia. Our preliminary study in Kozhikode city shows that timed gait is slower in older adults diagnosed with dementia and mild cognitive impairment syndrome compared to healthy older controls. A strong association between gait and cognition is seen in seniors in USA as well as Kerala. A better understanding of the relationship between gait and cognition may help improve current diagnostic and therapeutic approaches globally. ","1839":"The behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) have been a difficult management area for neurologists and psychiatrists alike. The correct identification of each symptom and the underlying precipitating cause is the key to proper management-nonpharmacological as well as pharmacological. BPSD has been well documented in all types of dementia in various stages of the disease and in all dementias at an advanced stage. The proper management is not only rewarding in terms of responsiveness in an otherwise \"incurable\" and progressive disease, but also improves the quality of life of the patients and the caregivers alike. The caregiver burden is greatly decreased by an efficient management of BPSD. This review discusses the implications and boundaries of the term BPSD and unravels each symptom and its identification. Manifestations of psychological symptoms such as delusion, hallucination, misidentification, psychosis, depression, apathy, and anxiety are briefly described. Correct identification of behavior symptoms such as wandering, agitation, catastrophic reaction, disinhibition, and delirium has been outlined. While the subtle differences in each entity make the precise identification difficult, the different therapeutics of each make the exercise necessary. Pharmacological recommendations and side effects of medications have been mentioned thereafter. The review will help in the identification and correct pharmacological management of BPSD.","1840":null,"1841":"The relationship between motor neurone disease (MND) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) has been a topic of scientific exploration for over hundred years. A connection between both diseases was first postulated in 1932 and has been strengthened by a steady stream of case reports since then. By the late 20th century, the link between both diseases was firmly established, with the resulting condition often referred to as MND\/FTD. Several strands of evidence support the notion of an MND\/FTD overlap. First, a small but well-documented group of patients present with a full-blown FTD, associated with MND. Second, subtle but characteristic changes in frontal-executive functions and social cognition have been described in non-demented MND patients, often in association with frontal atrophy\/hypoactivity on neuroimaging. Third, amyotrophic features have been documented in patients primarily diagnosed with FTD. Moreover, the same genetic defect can lead to FTD and MND phenotypes in different members of the same family. However, as the current research is moving toward a more fine-grained evaluation, an increasingly complex picture begins to emerge. Some features, such as psychotic symptoms or severe language deficits (particularly in comprehension and verb processing), seem to occur more often in MND\/dementia than in the classical FTD. On the basis of the review of 100 years of literature as well as 10 years of clinical experience of longitudinal follow-up of MND\/dementia patients, this review argues in favor of MND\/dementia (or, more precisely, MND\/dementia\/aphasia) as a separate clinical entity, not sufficiently explained by a combination of MND and FTD.","1842":"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) syndromes comprise a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative conditions characterized by atrophy in the frontal and temporal lobes. Three main clinical variants are recognized: Behavioral variant (bv-FTD), Semantic dementia (SD), and Progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA). However, logopenic\/phonological (LPA) variant has been recently described, showing a distinctive pattern of brain atrophy and often associated to Alzheimer's disease pathology. The diagnosis of FTD is challenging, since there is clinical, pathological, and genetic overlap between the variants and other neurodegenerative diseases, such as motoneuron disease (MND) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD). In addition, patients with gene mutations (tau and progranulin) display an inconsistent clinical phenotype and the correspondence between the clinical variant and its pathology is unpredictable. New cognitive tests based on social cognition and emotional recognition together with advances in molecular pathology and genetics have contributed to an improved understanding. There is now a real possibility of accurate biomarkers for early diagnosis. The present review concentrates on new insights and debates in FTD.","1843":"Dementia and depression are mental health problems that are commonly encountered in neuropsychiatric practice in the elderly. Approximately, half of the patients with late-onset depression have cognitive impairment. The prevalence of depression in dementias has been reported to be between 9 and 68%. Depression has been both proposed to be a risk factor for dementia as well as a prodrome of dementia. This article is a selective literature review of the complex relationship between the two conditions covering definitions, epidemiology, related concepts, treatment, and emerging biomarkers. The methodological issues and the mechanisms underlying the relationship are also highlighted. The relationship between the two disorders is far from conclusive.","1844":"One of the first steps toward the correct diagnosis of dementia is to segregate out the nondegenerative dementias from possible degenerative dementias. Nondegenerative dementias could be due to traumatic, endocrine, metabolic, nutritional, toxic, infective, and immunological causes. They could also be caused by tumors, subdural hematomas, and normal pressure hydrocephalus. Many of the nondegenerative dementias occur at an earlier age and often progress quickly compared to Alzheimer's disease and other degenerative dementias. Many are treatable or preventable with simple measures. This review aims to give an overview of some of the more important endocrine, metabolic, nutritional, and toxic disorders that may lead to dementia.","1845":"Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a highly heterogenous group of progressive neurodegenerative disorders characterized by atrophy of prefrontal and anterior temporal cortices. Recently, the research in the field of FTLD has gained increased attention due to the clinical, neuropathological, and genetic heterogeneity and has increased our understanding of the disease pathogenesis. FTLD is a genetically complex disorder. It has a strong genetic basis and 50% of patients show a positive family history for FTLD. Linkage studies have revealed seven chromosomal loci and a number of genes including MAPT, PGRN, VCP, and CHMB-2B are associated with the disease. Neuropathologically, FTLD is classified into tauopathies and ubiquitinopathies. The vast majority of FTLD cases are characterized by pathological accumulation of tau or TDP-43 positive inclusions, each as an outcome of mutations in MAPT or PGRN, respectively. Identification of novel proteins involved in the pathophysiology of the disease, such as progranulin and TDP-43, may prove to be excellent biomarkers of disease progression and thereby lead to the development of better therapeutic options through pharmacogenomics. However, much more dissections into the causative pathways are needed to get a full picture of the etiology. Over the past decade, advances in research on the genetics of FTLD have revealed many pathogenic mutations leading to different clinical manifestations of the disease. This review discusses the current concepts and recent advances in our understanding of the genetics of FTLD.","1846":"","1847":"","1848":"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the commonest progressive, dementing neurodegenerative disease in elderly, which affects innumerable people each year, and these numbers are likely to further increase as the population ages. In addition to the financial burden of AD on health care system, the disease has powerful emotional impact on caregivers and families of those afflicted. In this advancing era of AD research, with the availability of new treatment strategies having disease-modifying effects, there is growing need for the early diagnosis in AD, often hampered by paucity of biomarkers of AD. Various candidate biomarkers for AD have been developed that can detect patients with AD at an early stage. In the recent years, the search for an ideal biomarker has undergone a rapid evolution. Novel technologies in proteomics, genomics, and imaging techniques further expand the role of a biomarker not only in early diagnosis, but also in monitoring the response to various treatments. However, the availability of sensitive and specific biomarkers requires the method to be standardized so as to be able to compare the results across studies. Inspite of tremendous advances in this field the quest for an \"ideal biomarker\" still continues. In this review, we will discuss the various candidate markers in five spheres namely biochemical, neuroanatomical, metabolic, genetic and neuropsychological, and their current status and limitations in AD diagnosis.","1849":"Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a focal neurodegeneration of the brain affecting the language network.

PPA is classified as primary progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA), semantic dementia (SD), and logopenic aphasia, which have distinct patterns of atrophy on neuroimaging. PNFA and SD are included under frontotemporal lobar degenerations. PNFA patients have effortful speech with agrammatism, which is frequently associated with apraxia of speech and demonstrate atrophy in the left Broca's area and surrounding region on neuroimaging. Patients with SD have dysnomia with loss of word and object (or face) meaning with asymmetric anterior temporal lobe atrophy. Logopenic aphasics have word finding difficulties with frequent pauses in conversation, intact grammar, and word comprehension but impaired repetition for sentences. The atrophy is predominantly in the left posterior temporal and inferior parietal regions. Recent studies have described several progranulin mutations on chromosome 17 in PNFA. The three clinical syndromes have a less robust relationship to the underlying pathology, which is heterogeneous and includes tauopathy, ubiquitinopathy, Pick's disease, corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, and Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies, however, seem to indicate that a better characterization of the clinical phenotype (apraxic, agrammatic, semantic, logopenic, jargon) increases the predictive value of the underlying pathology. Substantial advances have been made in our understanding of PPAs but developing new biomarkers is essential in making accurate causative diagnoses in individual patients. This is critically important in the development and evaluation of disease-modifying drugs.","1850":"Cognitive impairment due to cerebrovascular disease is termed \"Vascular Cognitive Impairment\" (VCI) and forms a spectrum that includes Vascular Dementia (VaD) and milder forms of cognitive impairment referred to as Vascular Mild Cognitive Impairment (VaMCI). VCI represents a complex neurological disorder that occurs as a result of interaction between vascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia, and brain parenchymal changes such as macro and micro infarcts, haemorrhages, white matter changes, and brain atrophy occurring in an ageing brain. Mixed degenerative and vascular pathologies are increasingly being recognised and an interaction between the AD pathology, vascular risk factors, and strokes is now proposed. The high cardiovascular disease burden in India, increasing stroke incidence, and ageing population have contributed to large numbers of patients with VCI in India. Inadequate resources coupled with low awareness make it a problem that needs urgent attention, it is important identify patients at early stages of cognitive impairment, to treat appropriately and prevent progression to frank dementia.","1851":"","1852":"","1853":"","1854":null,"1855":"A 41-year-old male presented with acute onset weakness of the left hand. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed hyperacute infarct in the right middle cerebral artery (MCA)-posterior cerebral artery (PCA) watershed territory. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), Doppler ultrasonography, and digital subtraction angiography revealed severe right internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis. The patient underwent carotid endarterectomy. The second patient was a 48-year-old male with acute onset right wrist drop. MRI of brain showed acute infarct in the left MCA-PCA watershed territory. MRA of brain and neck, Doppler ultrasonography of the neck vessels, and echocardiography were normal. Both the cases were not initially considered strokes by the referring physicians. Isolated hand palsy is a rare presentation of stroke, often mistaken for peripheral lesion. Fractional limb weakness as a presentation of acute ischemic stroke due to borderzone infarction involving parietal lobe is a rarely reported entity.","1856":"Leukoencephalopathy, intracranial calcifications, and cysts (LCC) is a very rare cerebral disorder, first described in 3 children in 1996. It has subsequently been reported in adults and children from Europe and America, but has not so far been reported from Asia. We report an adult patient with pathologically proven LCC from a tertiary care hospital in South India. He presented with features of ataxia and raised intracranial pressure. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed multiple bilateral cerebral cystic lesions along with diffuse white matter lesions in the cerebral and cerebellar white matter, and computed tomography of brain showed multiple calcifications in the white matter and basal ganglia. A large right cerebellar cyst causing mass effect was surgically excised. Histopathologic features were consistent with earlier reports of LCC and showed Rosenthal fibers, angiomatous changes, and calcifications. Our report suggests that although it is rare, LCC has a global distribution.","1857":"","1858":"The cerebrospinal fluid hypovolemia syndrome (CHS) is an under recognized cause of headache. This study was designed to highlight the clinico-radiological and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) picture of CHS and their long-term outcome from a tertiary referral center. The CHS was diagnosed on the basis of the criteria proposed by Chung et al. Cases with CSF rhinorrhoea or other CSF leak or head trauma were excluded from the study. The study included eight consecutive cases of CHS diagnosed over the past 7 years from 2001. The mean age at diagnosis was 40.7 years (range, 34-56 years) and male-to-female ratio was 1:3. All patients presented with orthostatic headache of subacute onset and normal neurological examination. Magnetic resonance imaging studies of all patients showed hyperintensity of pachymeninges in T2W sequences, venous distension sign, and diffuse pachymeningeal gadolinium enhancement. The descent of the brainstem and subdural effusion were noted in two each (25%). CSF study (n = 5) showed low opening pressure in three (60%), and mild pleocytosis with elevated protein in two each (40%). The mean time to complete recovery with conservative treatment alone was 25.6 days. All radiological signs disappeared with clinical improvement in three patients where follow-up imaging was done. On mean follow-up period of 3.6 years, all were asymptomatic without any recurrence of CHS. CHS can resolve completely with conservative management and intervention with subdural blood patch or surgical repair would be required only if symptoms persist for more than 1 month. ","1859":"Childhood Central Nervous System (CNS) inflammatory demyelinating disorders (CIDD) are being diagnosed more commonly now. There is ambiguity in the use of different terms in relation to CIDD. Recently, consensus definitions have been proposed so that there is uniformity in studies across the world. The prevalence of these disorders and the spectrum varies from place to place. This study was undertaken to study the clinico-radiological profile and outcome of children with CIDD using the recent consensus definition. Prospective descriptive study. All patients admitted in pediatric ward and pediatric intensive care with neurological symptoms and signs suggestive of CNS inflammatory demyelinating disorders from July 2007-August 2008 were enrolled. The details of clinical presentation, neuroimaging findings, laboratory results, treatment, and outcome were noted and analyzed. Fifteen patients (11 with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and 4 with clinically isolated syndrome) were diagnosed with CIDD. Clinical presentation was quite varied. Eight patients recovered completely; 4 cases were left with sequelae and 3 patients expired. There were no cases of multiple sclerosis or neuromyelitis optica. CNS inflammatory demyelinating disorders are common illnesses in developing countries because of recurrent infections. Even the spectrum of CIDD is different. Neuroimaging in the form of magnetic resonance imaging is essential for diagnosis.

The study was conducted on the migraine patients. For test-retest reliability, the respondents filled the MIDAS and HIT-6 questionnaires twice, at an interval of three weeks. For validity, the same population of patients filled the headache diary for three months. After three months they filled the MIDAS and HIT-6 questionnaires again. The patients were subgrouped according to their occupation and level of education. The test-retest reliability and validity were calculated by the Pearson correlation coefficient. Internal consistency was calculated using the Cronbach alpha. A total of 236 migraine patients were screened. Seventy-nine patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A total of 69 patients completed the study. The HIT-6 questionnaire was applicable to all the subgroups of patients and had better comprehensibility than the MIDAS. Housewives missed out on the first two questions of the MIDAS and had lower mean MIDAS scores than HIT-6. The test-retest correlation coefficients for the total MIDAS and HIT-6 scores were 0.94 and 0.81, respectively. The correlation coefficients between the total score in the headache diary equivalent and the MIDAS and HIT-6 total score were 0.91 and 0.77, respectively. Cronbach alpha, a measure of internal consistency for the MIDAS questionnaire was &gt; 0.90 at all the compilations. For the HIT-6 questionnaire, it ranged from 0.67 to 0.79. The Hindi versions of MIDAS and HIT-6 questionnaires were reliable and valid, but could not be interchanged. HIT-6 had better comprehensibility.

They may increase the risk of Alzheimer's dementia (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) as their deficiency can increase the homocysteine level due to slowed methylation reaction. Homocysteine has a neurotoxic effect that could lead to neurologic disturbances. Hence, it is important to explore the status of serum B(12) and folate in AD and VaD to evolve the treatment strategies for the same. A retrospective study was conducted to assess the levels of vitamin B(12), folate, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in serum and the relationship of these factors, including age and sex to cognitive decline in VaD, AD, and dementia due to other causes (DOC). Serum vitamin B(12), folate, TSH, and total cholesterol were studied in 32 AD patients (mean age: 65 years), 12 VaD patients (mean age: 61 years), 83 DOC (mean age: 65 years), and 127 control subjects (mean age: 49 years). In AD, VaD, and DOC, the levels of vitamin B(12) and folate were significantly lower (P &lt; 0.002; 0.026; 0.002 for vitamin B(12) and P &lt; 0.000 in all the 3 groups for folate) as compared with the controls. Similarly, TSH levels were significantly lower in AD and DOC (P &lt; 0.008; 0.038) as compared with the controls. Vitamin B(12) and folate were significantly low in both AD and VaD patients. Hence, B vitamin supplementation should be considered as possible targets for the therapeutic intervention in dementia.

This article reviews the classification systems used for epileptic seizures and epilepsy and present the recommendations based on current evidence. At present, epilepsy is classified according to seizure type and epilepsy syndrome using the universally accepted International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification of epileptic seizures and epilepsy syndromes. A multi-axial classification system incorporating ictal phenomenology, seizure type, epilepsy syndrome, etiology and impairments is being developed by the ILAE task force. The need to consider age-related epilepsy syndromes is particularly important in children with epilepsy. The correct classification of seizure type and epilepsy syndrome helps the individual with epilepsy to receive appropriate investigations, treatment, and information about the likely prognosis.","1867":"Kleine-Levin syndrome (KLS) is a rare sleep disorder mainly affecting teenage boys in which the main features are intermittent hypersomnolence, behavioral and cognitive disturbances, hyperphagia, and in some cases hypersexuality. Each episode is of brief duration varying from a week to 1-2 months and affected people are entirely asymptomatic between episodes. No definite cause has been identified, and no effective treatments are available even though illness is having well-defined clinical features. Multiple relapses occur every few weeks or months, and the condition may last for a decade or more before spontaneous resolution. In this study, PubMed was searched and appropriate articles were reviewed to highlight etiology, clinical features, and management of KLS. On the basis of this knowledge, practical information is offered to help clinicians about how to investigate a case of KLS, and what are the possible treatment modalities available currently for the treatment during an episode and interepisodic period for prophylaxis. Comprehensive research into the etiology, pathophysiology, investigation, and treatments are required to aid the development of disease-specific targeted therapies.","1868":"Nearly 80% of the 50 million people with epilepsy worldwide reside in developing countries that are least equipped to tackle the enormous medical, social and economic challenges posed by epilepsy. These include widespread poverty, illiteracy, inefficient and unevenly distributed health care systems, and social stigma and misconceptions associated with epilepsy. Several studies have reported that a large proportion of patients with epilepsy in developing countries never receive appropriate treatment for their condition, and many, though diagnosed and initiated on treatment, soon discontinue treatment. Unaffordable cost of treatment, unavailability of antiepileptic drugs, and superstitious and cultural beliefs contribute to high epilepsy treatment gap in resource-poor countries. A significant proportion of the current burden of epilepsy in developing countries can be minimized by educating the public about the positive aspects of life with epilepsy and the primary and secondary physicians about current trends in the management of epilepsies, scaling up routine availability of low-cost antiepileptic drugs, and developing cost-effective epilepsy surgery programs.","1869":"","1870":"","1871":"","1872":"","1873":"","1874":"Dengue is an acute mosquito-borne infection caused by dengue viruses from the genus flavivirus. Neurologic complications have been attributed chiefly to metabolic alterations and to focal and sometimes massive intracranial haemorrhages, but anecdotal cases and limited case series have indicated the possibility of viral CNS and skeletal muscle invasion causing encephalitis and myositis. We present a case of a 40-year-old male who presented with severe dengue myositis resulting in quadriparesis, respiratory failure and acute renal failure with red urine. His elevated serum creatine kinase (CK), serum and urine myoglobin levels justified rhabdomyolysis as the cause of acute renal failure. A muscle biopsy revealed inflammatory myositis. He required ventilator support for respiratory failure and was treated conservatively. This case highlights the severe and persistent muscle involvement in dengue which is a rarity.","1875":"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is an important cause for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), yet often goes undiagnosed in the absence of histological examination of the blood vessels in the clot. In this study, we report three patients who presented with ICH. Two patients had no risk factors for bleed, whereas one patient had systemic hypertension. Tissue for analysis was obtained during hematoma evacuation in two patients and necropsy in the third. Histopathology in all three patients revealed severe degree of amyloid angiopathy with extensive amyloid deposits in the vessel walls, which was diagnostic of CAA. Both medium- and small-sized leptomeningeal and cortical vessels were affected. The vascular amyloid deposits stained with Congo red and displayed characteristic birefringence under polarizing light. In addition, vessels also showed fibrinoid necrosis and vascular endothelial proliferation. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated beta-amyloid peptide in all three cases-the protein most commonly involved in sporadic CAA. Senile plaques with amyloid cores were present in all areas, whereas neurofibrillary tangles were restricted to the medial temporal region in the autopsied case. CAA is an important cause for intracerebral bleed and may be a contributory factor even when other risk factors for ICH are present. Areas of hemorrhage tend to correlate with severity of CAA changes.","1876":"A 51-year-old male was admitted in our institute following an episode of near-drowning. He later developed ventriculitis and cerebral ring-enhancing lesions. He died following a subarachnoid hemorrhage due to rupture of a mycotic aneurysm involving the right fetal posterior cerebral artery. Scedosporium apiospermum was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid. Central nervous system invasion by S apiospermum may present insidiously in near-drowning patients and, therefore, requires a high index of suspicion. In cases with the characteristic cerebral ring-enhancing lesions and concomitant ventriculitis, treatment should be instituted while awaiting fungal culture. With this article we intend to alert neurologists, intensivists, and physicians to this near fatal infection, as early identification and prompt treatment with voriconazole may be life saving.","1877":"Opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome (OMS) is a rare condition that has been reported from all parts of the world. It is well recognized as a paraneoplastic syndrome in children with neuroblastoma and in adults with small-cell carcinoma of lung and some other cancers. It may also occur in association with various central nervous system infections. We report a case of OMS in a patient with varicella zoster virus infection. IgM antibody for varicella-zoster virus was detected in the serum and the cerebrospinal fluid. The patient improved after treatment with clonazepam and was asymptomatic at 1-month follow-up.","1878":null,"1879":"We report three children with pseudohypoparathyroidism aged 13-16 years who presented with seizures and tetany.

T2 and FLAIR images were normal. T1 hyperintensity could represent early stage of calcification in whom MRI is more sensitive.","1880":"Acute decompression syndrome (Caisson's disease) is an acute neurological emergency in divers. It is caused due to release of nitrogen gas bubbles that impinge the blood vessels of the spinal cord and brain and result in severe neurodeficit. There are very few case reports in Indian literature. There are multiple factors in the pathogenesis of Acute decompression syndrome (Caisson's disease) such as health problems in divers (respiratory problems or congenital heart diseases like atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus etc), speed of ascent from the depth and habits like smoking that render divers susceptible for such neurological emergency. Usually, immediate diagnosis of such a condition with MRI is not possible in hospitals in the Coastal border. Even though, MRI is performed, it has very low specificity and sensitivity. Facilities like hyperbaric oxygen treatment are virtually non-existent in these hospitals. Therefore, proper education of the divers and appropriate preventive measures in professional or recreational divers is recommended.","1881":"The purpose of this study was to examine the degree of contribution from the vertebrobasilar and carotid systems to the origin of the PCA in fetal autopsy brains of last trimester of pregnancy and to compare with published data on the configuration of adult and fetal brains in a population of Sri Lankan origin. The external diameter of the PcomA, pre-communicating part (P1), and the post-communicating part (P2) of posterior cerebral artery (PCA) of 34 fetal brain in the last trimester of pregnancy (30 to 40 weeks of gestation) was measured using a stereomicroscope equipped with a micrometer calibrator. The blood supply to the occipital lobe mainly via the PCA was seen in 25 (59%) of fetal brains as compared to that in the literature 220 (93%) in adults brains and the blood supply to the occipital lobe mainly via the internal carotid artery (ICA) was seen in 16 (34%) of fetal brains as compared to 25 (7%) of adults brains (P &lt; 0.0001), transitional configuration where the PcomA is equal in diameter to P1 segment of the PCA was seen in 5 (7.4%) of fetal brains and 8 (2%) of adults brains.

The aim of this study is to compare the cerebral activation patterns in patients of PWT, WC and healthy controls, during a task of signing on paper, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Six subjects with PWT, three with WC and six healthy volunteers were examined using a 1.5-Tesla scanner. The paradigm consisted of three times repetition of a set of period of rest and activity. Each set consisted of 10 blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) echo-planar imaging (EPI) acquisitions at rest followed by 10 BOLD EPI acquisitions while signing their names on paper using the dominant right hand. Entire brain was covered. SPM99 analysis was done. IN COMPARISON TO THE HEALTHY CONTROLS, THE FOLLOWING DIFFERENCES IN CEREBRAL ACTIVATION WERE NOTED IN THE PATIENTS: (a) primary and supplementary motor areas showed overactivation in patients of PWT and underactivation in patients of WC, (b) the cingulate motor area showed underactivation in patients of PWT and overactivation in patients of WC and (c) the cerebellar activity was reduced in both WC and PWT. Our preliminary findings suggest that the cerebral and cerebellar activation patterns in PWT and WC during signing on paper are distinct from each other and from healthy controls. There may be cerebellar dysfunction in addition to motor dysfunctions in the pathogenesis of these disorders.

Many studies revealed that control of hypertension with antihypertensive therapy controls the cognitive decline associated with hypertension. While there are reports that suggest that antihypertensive drugs do not provide protection from cognitive decline, the present study is designed to evaluate the cognitive status of patients recently diagnosed as hypertensive and effect of 3 month long antihypertensive therapy on cognitive functions. A predesigned pretested questionnaire was used to collect the information. The PGI memory scale (PGIMS) was employed to assess memory function of patients. Baseline memory functions were evaluated before starting the treatment with antihypertensive and compared with the cognitive function scores of healthy volunteers. After the 3 months of treatment, cognitive functions were evaluated again by the same scale. The unpaired t-test was used to compare the cognitive functions between case and control and the paired t-test was used to compare pre- and post-treatment score. This study revealed that mean scores of six subtests of cognitive functions were less in cases as compared to subjects in comparison group. After 3 months of antihypertensive therapy, scores of five sub-tests were found to be increased. Among these five subtests, four were those which were found declined at the baseline. This suggests that antihypertensive therapy given for 3 months improved the score of those cognitive function tests in which hypertensive patients perform poorly during recruitment and there was no deterioration of any test after 3 months of antihypertensive therapy.

We have designed in two phases a new instrument to evaluate the child rearing knowledge and practice under the four major domains of child rearing. Twenty-five subject experts from the field of Paediatrics, Obstetrics, Neurology and Nursing elicited the content validity of the instrument. The test retest reliability was evaluated by 25 young mothers who completed the CRKS at an interval of two weeks. The Content Validity Ratio (CVR) of individual items ranged between 0.6 to 1. The reliability was tested for the 20 individual items of the CRKS using Kappa coefficient. The measurement of agreement Kappa ranged from 0.51 to 1. The total knowledge scores and sub scores data were analysed for correlation using Pearson's correlation coefficient. A significant Pearson's correlation indicated that the total scores were consistent over time (r = 0.89). The sub scores on feeding (6 items), Growth and development (4 items), protection (7 items), and infant stimulation (3 items) were found to have reliability of 0.91, 0.76, 0.84, and 0.89 respectively using Pearson's correlation.

To determine the of pattern of neurologic diseases warranting admission in a tertiary hospital in Kano and compare it with those elsewhere in the country with the view to using the data generated as a baseline for planning purposes and for future studies. The medical records of all cases admitted with neurologic diseases in the Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, Kano between January 2005 and September 2008, were retrospectively reviewed and the frequency of neurologic diseases, sex, age, and outcome of these diseases analyzed. Stroke, predominantly ischemic, accounted for 77.6% of the neurological cases for the period of study. Central nervous system infections, comprising mainly of meningitis and tetanus, accounted for 6.6% (64) and 3% (29) of cases, respectively. The myelopathies were the cause of neurologic admissions in 5.4% (53) with paraplegia and quadriplegia resulting from myelopathies accounting for 5% (49) and 0.4% (4) of the cases. Hypertensive encephalopathy and status epilepticus as the causes of admissions accounted for 1.6% each. Gullain Barre syndrome, Parkinson's disease, and cerebral malaria were relatively rare causes of neurologic admissions in this study. The average duration of hospitalization was 25 days, and regarding outcome, 219 (22.4%) of these cases died. Stroke appeared to be the most common neurologic admission and the most common cause of neurologic and medical death in Kano as observed in other regions of the country and a little over one-fifths of stroke patients die. Central nervous system infections mainly meningitis and tetanus are the next common cause of admission. In view of these findings, the provision of a regional stroke unit, the improvement of the sanitary conditions of the home and environment; the widespread use of immunizations against meningitis, tetanus cannot be over-emphasized. These interventions will go a long way to reduce morbidity and mortality of stroke and neurologic infections.

Interestingly, Goliath probably suffered from acromegaly. We propose autism as a diagnosis for Samson which would precede the first known case of autism by centuries. Isaac was a diabetic, and he probably had autonomic neuropathy. Few verses from the books of I Samuel, Psalms, and Ezekiel reveal symptoms suggestive of stroke. Jacob suffered from sciatica, and the child of the Shunnamite woman in II Kings had a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Known risk factors include therapy with multiple antiepileptic drugs, especially when topiramate is one of the drugs; presence of underlying inborn errors of metabolism; febrile states; and insufficient nutritional intake. We describe a 5-year-old male child who developed VNHE while on polypharmacy with topiramate and phenobarbitone; the child also had poor nutritional intake. The encephalopathy reversed with withdrawal of VPA and treatment with L-carnitine.

We report a case of a 4-year-old boy with progressive ptosis and limitation of ocular movements who was diagnosed as slow-channel CMS based on the characteristic electrodiagnostic features. Repetitive compound muscle action potentials (R-CMAPs) were recorded after single nerve stimulus, with decremental response after repetitive trains performed at 3 Hz.

It is not known if the response to beta-interferon is also different. To demonstrate the decrease in relapses with beta-interferon in Indian patients with multiple sclerosis. Patients with relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive multiple sclerosis with at least two relapses were started on beta-interferon. Sixteen patients were followed up for a period of 1-3 years. Fifteen had relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). The mean number of relapses in these patients before interferons were started was 3.4. The mean yearly relapse rate was 1.3. The mean Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) at the start of beta-interferon therapy in relapsing-remitting MS was 1.7. Ten of these patients were on Avonex((R)) (interferon beta1a) and six (including the patient with secondary progressive MS) were on Betaferon((R)) (interferon beta1b). On follow-up, three patients (two on Avonex((R)) and one on Betaferon((R)) ) had relapses. The respective beta-interferon being received by these patients was continued, with no further relapses. The remaining patients had no relapse or clinical or MRI progression after starting the drug. The side effect profile of the drug in these patients was favorable; although nearly all developed fever on the first day of the injection, only 50% of the patients continued to have fever after 3 months. Two patients developed psychiatric symptoms, requiring discontinuation of the drug.

We identified definite cases of CNS mycosis by screening the medical records of our institute for the period 2000-2008. The clinical and imaging details and the outcome were abstracted from the medical records and entered in a structured proforma. There were 12 patients with CNS mycosis (i.e., 2.7% of all CNS infections treated in this hospital); six (50%) had cryptococcal infection, three (25%) had mucormycosis, and two had unclassified fungal infection. Four (33%) of them had diabetes as a predisposing factor. The common presentations were meningoencephalitis (58%) and polycranial neuritis (41%). Magnetic resonance imaging revealed hydrocephalus in 41% and meningeal enhancement in 25%, as well as some unusual findings such as subdural hematoma in the bulbocervical region, carpeting lesion of the base of the skull, and enhancing lesion in the cerebellopontine angle. The CSF showed pleocytosis (66%), hypoglycorrhachia (83%), and elevated protein levels (100%). The diagnosis was confirmed by meningocortical biopsy (in three cases), paranasal sinus biopsy (in four cases), CSF culture (in three cases), India ink preparation (in four cases), or by cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen test (in three cases). Out of the ten patients for whom follow-up details were available, six patients recovered with antifungal medications (amphotericin B, 1 mg\/kg\/day for the minimum period of 6 weeks) and\/or surgical treatment. Four patients expired (only one of them had received antifungal therapy). Most patients with CNS mycosis recover with appropriate therapy, but the diagnosis and management of these rare infections remains a challenge to clinicians. ","1905":"To evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of different neurological and psychiatric presentations in patients admitted to hospital with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In this retrospective hospital-based study, we examined the medical records of patients with SLE who were referred to the hospitals affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences from 1995 to 2005. All patients of SLE who had clinical neurological or psychiatric features were included in this study. The patients demographic data, findings on general examination, neuropsychiatric manifestations, and the results of laboratory investigations and imaging studies were recorded. Clinical manifestations were classified according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) case definitions. Of the 407 study patients, 11.3% had neuropsychiatric complications. The most frequent findings were seizure (63%), headache (60%), and decreased level of consciousness (50%). Cerebrovascular disease (28.3%), seizure disorder (26.5%), and acute confusional state (19.6%) were the most prevalent syndromes. The prevalence and nature of different neurological presentations of SLE in Iranian patients has some similarities to that seen in other populations, as well as some differences. Ethnic and environmental factors may contribute to these differences. ","1906":"Psychomotor seizures, referred to as limbic or partial complex seizures, have had an interesting evolution in diagnosis and treatment. Hughlings Jackson was the first to clearly relate the clinical syndrome and likely etiology to lesions in the uncinate region of the medial temporal lobe. With the application of electroencephalography (EEG) to the study of human epilepsy as early as 1934 by Gibbs, Lennox, and Davis in Boston, electrical recordings have significantly advanced the study of epilepsy. In 1937, Gibbs and Lennox proposed the term \"psychomotor epilepsy\" to describe a characteristic EEG pattern of seizures accompanied by mental, emotional, motor, and autonomic phenomena. Concurrently, typical psychomotor auras and dreamy states were produced by electrical stimulation of medial temporal structures during epilepsy surgery by Penfield in Montreal. In 1937, Jasper joined Penfield, EEG was introduced and negative surgical explorations became less frequent. Nevertheless, Penfield preferred to operate only on space occupying lesions. A milestone in psychomotor seizure diagnosis was in the year 1946 when Gibbs, at the Illinois Neuropsychiatric Institute, Chicago, reported that the patient falling asleep during EEG was a major activator of the psychomotor discharges and electrographic ictal episodes becoming more prominently recorded. Working with Percival Bailey, Gibbs was proactive in applying EEG to define surgical excision of the focus in patients with intractable psychomotor seizures. By early 1950s, the Montreal group began to clearly delineate causative medial temporal lesions such as hippocampal sclerosis and tumors in the production of psychomotor seizures.","1907":"Insomnia is a disorder characterized by inability to sleep or a total lack of sleep, prevalence of which ranges from 10 to 15% among the general population with increased rates seen among older ages, female gender, White population and presence of medical or psychiatric illness. Yet this condition is still under-recognized, under-diagnosed, and under-treated. This article aims to review the operational definitions and management of chronic insomnia. A computerized search on PubMed carried from 1980 to January 2009 led to the summarization of the results. There are several strategies to manage chronic insomnia. To initiate treatment, it is necessary to define it and differentiate it from other co-morbid psychiatric disorders. Non-pharmacologic strategies such as stimulus control therapy and relaxation and cognitive therapies have the best effect sizes followed by sleep restriction, paradoxical intention and sleep hygiene education which have modest to less than modest effect sizes. Among pharmacotherapeutic agents, non-benzodiazepine hypnotics are the first line of management followed by benzodiazepines, amitryptiline and antihistaminics. However, adequate trials of combined behavior therapy and pharmacotherapy are the best course of management.","1908":"The following article recommends guidelines for epilepsy surgery for India. This article reviews the indications, the various surgical options available and the outcome of surgery for drug resistant epilepsy based on current evidence. Epilepsy surgery is a well-established option for patients who have been diagnosed to have drug resistant epilepsy (DRE) (on at least two appropriate, adequate anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) (either in monotherapy or in combination) with continuing seizures), where the presurgical work-up has shown concordance of structural imaging (magnetic resonance imaging) and electrical mapping data (electroencephalography (EEG), video EEG). There may be a requirement of functional imaging techniques in a certain number of DRE like positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission tomography, (SPECT)). Invasive monitoring should be restricted to a few when all noninvasive investigations are inconclusive, there is a dual pathology or there is a discordance of noninvasive data. The types of surgery could be curative (resective surgeries: amygdalo hippocampectomy, lesionectomy and multilobar resections; functional surgeries: hemispherotomy) and palliative (multiple subpial transaction, corpus callosotomy, vagal nerve stimulation). Epilepsy surgery in indicated cases has a success range from 50 to 86% in achieving seizure freedom as compared with &lt;5% success rate with AEDs only in persons with DRE. Centers performing surgery should be categorized into Level I and Level II.","1909":"Interplay between susceptibility genes and environmental factors is considered important player in the genesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Among environmental factors, a role for an infectious pathogen has long been considered central to the disease process. This opinion has support both from epidemiological data and the findings of immunological abnormalities in spinal fluid that reflect an immune response to an as yet undetermined antigen, possibly a pathogen, in the cerebrospinal fluid. Our review will outline the current understanding of the role of infection in the causation and progression of MS. We will review the data that point to an infectious cause of MS and consider the specific agents Chlamydophila (Chlamydia) pneumoniae, Human Herpes Virus 6, and Epstein-Barr Virus, that are implicated in either the development or progression of MS.","1910":"","1911":"","1912":"","1913":"","1914":"","1915":"A 44-year-old male developed acute fulminant hepatic failure of unknown etiology and expired within four days.

Complications of IV thrombolysis with tPA are commonly related to hemorrhage, anaphylaxis, or arterial occlusion. We describe two cases of acute myocardial infarction (MI) following IV tPA infusion for acute stroke. One of the patients had underlying ischemic heart disease (IHD) while the other did not have any prior IHD. Both had presented with acute ischemic stroke within the window period of thrombolysis and had no contraindications for thrombolysis. Both the patients succumbed due to myocardial infarction and cardiovascular collapse due to new onset arrhythmias. Acute MI immediately following IV tPA for stroke is a rare but serious complication. The disruption of intracardiac thrombus and subsequent embolization to coronary arteries may be an important mechanism in the occurrence of MI after administration of tPA for acute ischemic stroke. As both the patients succumbed before the arrangement for coronary angiography, the demonstration of intracardiac or intracoronary thrombus was not possible. But clinically, the presence of chest pain with elevated troponin levels and ST segment elevation pointed to MI. We suspect that fragmentation and lysis of intracardiac thrombus may result in MI after use of tPA for acute ischemic stroke, though the remote possibility of simultaneous occurrence of two atherosclerotic events MI and stroke exists.","1918":"Chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy (CRION) is a recently described recurrent optic neuropathy which is steroid responsive. Several features distinguish this entity from optic neuritis associated with demyelinating disorders and connective tissue diseases. The severe degree of visual loss, persistence of pain after onset of visual loss, and recurrent episodes are unique to this disorder. We describe here a patient who presented with recurrent episodes of painful visual loss, followed by resolution of deficits, over a period of ten years. He was diagnosed as isolated optic neuritis conforming to features of CRION.","1919":"Diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is a challenge because of the manifold clinical presentation, and diagnosis is often delayed. We wanted to share our experience of directly observed treatment short course (DOTS) in TBM. We did a retrospective analysis to look at the presentation, management and outcome of TBM patients from November 2006 to April 2008. TBM was diagnosed based on clinical criteria. We excluded patients with HIV. We had 11 patients on DOTS regime. One died following hepatitis and another patient died of unrelated gastroenteritis. The only patient on daily regime died. Our patients generally presented late, at a median duration 20 days from onset of symptoms, and 50% had stage 3 disease at presentation. The median delay in diagnosis was 4.5 days. We found DOTS to be effective in TBM but not without side effects. ","1920":"There are a growing number of studies suggesting that depression may increase the risk of stroke. Impaired autoregulation of vascular tone may contribute to a higher risk of developing cerebrovascular diseases. Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) reflects the compensatory dilatory capacity of cerebral arterioles to a dilatory stimulus and is an important mechanism that ensures constant cerebral blood flow. There is a hypothesis that CVR is reduced in major depression, which would explain the association between depression and stroke. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of depression on CVR in cerebral vessels by comparing CVR during the depression phase with that during remission. Using the apnea test, we assessed CVR in 16 patients with unipolar depression during disease and after remission of disease by calculating the increase in cerebral blood flow velocity after breath-holding (the apnea test). Blood flow velocities were measured by transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD). CVR was significantly reduced in the depression phase in comparison to that in the remission phase. However, this change was not seen in all the patients. CVR was reduced in most of the depressed patients. The decreased CVR, as indicated by the changes in peak systolic velocity (PSV) and mean flow velocity (MFV) of the middle cerebral artery, in depressed patients was more marked on the right side, which could point to a vascular basis for some kinds of depression. We recommend that other studies, with larger samples, be done; future studies should assess whether the changes in the CVR varies with the severity and type of depression. ","1921":"TO STUDY BRAIN NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE (BNP) LEVELS IN THREE SUBGROUPS: patients having stroke with hypertension (HT), those having stroke without HT, and those with HT alone. We also tried to identify whether BNP levels predict the length of stay in hospital and mortality. The groups were formed by patients who had been admitted to the emergency department in the first 4-12 h after the onset of symptoms. There were 30 stroke patients with a history of HT (group I), 30 stroke patients without a history of HT (group II), and 20 HT patients without stroke (group III). Patients with congestive heart failure, chronic cor pulmonale, severe valvular heart disease, chronic renal failure, liver insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and those with a history of stroke were excluded from the study since these diseases can affect the plasma BNP levels. The demographic characteristics, except the age distribution, were similar among the groups. The mean BNP levels in the three groups were 168.8 +\/- 223.9 pg\/ml, 85.0 +\/- 75.1 pg\/ml, and 84.8 +\/- 178.3 pg\/ml, respectively. The differences between the groups were statistically significant. The mean BNP levels were affected by HT and\/or stroke. The simultaneous presence of HT and stroke results in a more significant increase BNP than the presence of either stroke or HT alone. When diseases that can affect the plasma BNP levels are excluded, the BNP levels in stroke patients without a history of HT are similar to the levels seen in patients with only HT. ","1922":"Vascular cognitive impairment, being the only treatable cause of dementia in the early stages, and having a diverse etiology, requires sensitive criteria for definition. This study aimed to study cognitive functions at 3 months post-stroke, utilising the Mini mental scale examination (MMSE) and the Frontal assessment battery (FAB), and to correlate the same with subgroups of ischemic stroke. 164 patients were studied, 108 of these having multiple infarcts. Pure cortical infarcts were seen in 41 patients. At 3 months, 112\/164 patients had MMSE more than 24, with no frontal executive dysfunction. MMSE score less than 24 was seen in 24 patients, all of them having FAB score below 10. Normal MMSE with impaired FAB was seen in 28 patients. Impairment on either the MMSE or the FAB was thus seen in 31.7% patients (52\/164), at 3 months after stroke. FAB impairment alone, with MMSE in normal range, was seen in 28\/52 (53.8%) patients. Memory was significantly more commonly affected in muti-infarct strokes as compared to single infarcts. Frontal executive dysfunction was not significantly different when single and multiple infarcts, or cortical and subcortical infarcts, were compared. ","1923":"To discuss the clinical features and management of patients who presented with optic disc edema and had features of presumed idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Case series of all patients diagnosed to have IIH from January 2000 to December 2003 in the neuro-ophthalmology clinic of a tertiary referral ophthalmic institution, were retrospectively analyzed. Analysis was done for 50\/106 patients who fulfilled modified Dandy's criteria and had optic disc edema and a minimal follow-up period of two years. Most (40\/50, 80%) of the patients were females and the mean age of presentation for all the 50 patients was 32.89 years. Chief complaints were headache in 38 (76%) patients, 24(48%) patients had transient visual obscuration, 24 (48%) patients had reduced vision, 15 (30%) patients had nausea, vomiting, 4(8%) patients had diplopia. Bilateral disc edema was seen in 46 (92%) patients and unilateral disc edema in 4 (8%) patients. 60 eyes had enlarged blind spot as the common visual field defect. Neuroimaging revealed prominent perioptic CSF spaces in 14 patients and empty sella in three patients. CSF opening pressure was 250-350 mm H2O (water) in 39 patients and was &gt;350 mm H2O in 11 patients. Medical treatment was started for all patients; whereas 35 [70%] patients responded, 15 [30%] patients had to undergo LP shunt. ","1924":"Glycosylation of altered tumor cell in relation to cellular heterogeneity in human intracranial tumors remains relatively unexposed. Serum protein-bound carbohydrate, L-Fucose is reported to be overexpressed during tumor progression by many investigators. Therefore, there is a need to determine the diagnostic, prognostic, functional significance of glycoprotein elevations in various cases of tumors. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the clinical utility of serum L-fucose in patients with brain tumor. Serum glyco-conjugate levels were estimated in 99 patients with brain tumors. Estimation of L-fucose was carried out colorimetrically by the method of Winzler using cysteine hydrochloride. There was a significant increase in L-fucose level in most of the patients. In the posttreatment cases, the L-fucose levels were apparently low compared to preoperative values. Our results showed that the rise in serum L-fucose may be used as a general marker for brain tumors in addition to other markers. ","1925":"India is silently witnessing a stroke epidemic. There is an urgent need to develop a national program towards \"Fighting Stroke\". This program should be specific to our national needs. In order to recommend on who should lead an Indian fight-stroke program, we examined the published opinions of stroke clinicians and the official documents on stroke care training abroad. We identified the resources that already exist in India and can be utilized to develop a national fight-stroke program. Through a review of published literature, we noted different opinions that exist on who would best manage stroke. We found that because stroke is a cardiovascular disorder of the central nervous system, its management requires a multi-disciplinary approach involving clinicians with background not limited to neurology. India has very few neurologists trained in stroke medicine and they cannot care for all stroke patients of the country. We propose a mechanism that would quickly put in place a stroke care model relevant in Indian context. We recommend for tapping the clinical expertise available from existing pool of non-neurologist physicians who can be trained and certified in stroke medicine (Strokology). We have discussed an approach towards developing a national network for training and research in Strokology hoping that our recommendations would initiate discussion amongst stroke academicians and motivate the national policy makers to quickly develop an \"Indian Fight Stroke Program.\"","1926":"Tumors of the cerebellum and brainstem account for half of all brain tumors in children. The realization that cerebellar lesions produce clinically relevant intellectual disability makes it important to determine whether neuropsychological abnormalities occur in long-term survivors of pediatric cerebellar tumors. Little is known about the neurobehavioral sequale resulting specifically from the resection of these tumors in this population. We therefore reviewed neuropsychological findings associated with postoperative cerebellar mutism syndrome and discuss the further implications for cerebellar cognitive function.","1927":"Magnetoencehalography (MEG) is being used with increased frequency in the pre-surgical evaluation of patients with epilepsy. One of the major advantages of this technique over the EEG is the lack of distortion of MEG signals by the skull and intervening soft tissue. In addition, the MEG preferentially records activity from tangential sources thus recording activity predominantly from sulci, which is not contaminated by activity from apical gyral (radial) sources. While the MEG is probably more sensitive than the EEG in detecting interictal spikes, especially in the some locations such as the superficial frontal cortex and the lateral temporal neocortex, both techniques are usually complementary to each other. The diagnostic accuracy of MEG source localization is usually better as compared to scalp EEG localization. Functional localization of eloquent cortex is another major application of the MEG. The combination of high spatial and temporal resolution of this technique makes it an extremely helpful tool for accurate localization of visual, somatosensory and auditory cortices as well as complex cognitive functions like language. Potential future applications include lateralization of memory function.","1928":"Role of antiplatelet therapy in secondary stroke prevention is of major significance. Antiplatelet agents predominantly in use are aspirin, clopidogrel, and combination regimes. The review focuses on the optimization of antiplatelet regimen based on evidence obtained from randomized-controlled trials, on different antiplatelet regimes and the risk assessment that may be unique to each patient.","1929":"","1930":"","1931":"While current immunomodulating drugs aim to reduce multiple sclerosis (MS) exacerbations and slow disease progression, rehabilitation aims to improve and maintain the functional abilities of patients in the face of disease progression. An increasing number of journal articles are describing the value of the many rehabilitation interventions that can be used throughout the course of the disease, from the initial symptoms to the advanced stages. An integrated team of healthcare professionals is necessary to address a myriad of problems to reduce impairments, disabilities, and handicaps. The problems may be related to fatigue, weakness, spasticity, mobility, balance, pain, cognition, mood, relationships, bowel, bladder, sexual function, swallowing, speech, transportation, employment, recreation, and activities of daily living (ADL) such as dressing, eating, bathing, and household chores. The team can help prevent complications and secondary disabilities, while increasing patient safety. Improving neurologically related function, maintaining good relationships, and feeling productive and creative adds enormously to the quality of life of people with MS and their families. Rehabilitation is more than an 'extra' service that is given after medical therapies; it is an integral part of the management of the diverse set of problems encountered throughout the course of the disease. An interdisciplinary team may have many members, including physicians, nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech and language pathologists, psychotherapists, social workers, recreational therapists, vocational rehabilitation therapists, patients, families, and other caregivers.","1932":"The management of multiple sclerosis (MS) revolves around disease management, symptom management, and person management. Of these, symptom management takes up the bulk of the time of the practicing physician. Some symptoms are easily managed whereas others are more difficult. Decisions have often to be made on whether to treat or to wait and watch. This article discusses the varied symptoms of MS and the approaches to management, which involves rehabilitation, pharmacological treatments, and surgical procedures. The skilled physician managing MS should be familiar with the multiple approaches to improving the quality of life of those with MS. After the diagnosis has been established and the decisions regarding treatment approaches have been made, the talk in a typical office appointment for MS usually turns to symptom management. Thus, the majority of management decisions made by the clinician revolve around that important topic. It is symptom management that will determine quality of life for those with MS, It is the basis for improving function, and, up until twenty years ago, it was the only basis for treating MS. Now, however, we can approach treatment by disease management, symptom management, and person management. The MS specialist must be well versed in all three areas.","1933":"The therapeutic options for multiple sclerosis are rapidly expanding. What was once seen as a disease with little hope for treatment is now a target of rapid drug development. Current therapies have demonstrated efficacy in limiting the impact of the disease, but none is fully effective in all patients. However, promising new treatments are on the horizon. In this review we will discuss potential novel immunomodulating drugs that are in advanced stages of investigation; these drugs include monoclonal antibodies, chimeric molecules, and oral therapies. The use of hematopoietic stem cells will also be discussed and, in addition, we will look farther ahead at possible novel targets for the development of new immunomodulatory or neuroprotective pharmaceuticals.","1934":"Since 1993, six disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS) have been proven to be of benefit in rigorous phase III clinical trials. Other agents are also available and are used to treat MS, but definitive data on their efficacy is lacking. Currently, disease-modifying therapy is used for relapsing forms of MS. This includes clinically isolated syndrome\/first-attack high-risk patients, relapsing patients, secondary progressive patients who are still experiencing relapses, and progressive relapsing patients. The choice of agent depends upon drug factors (including affordability, availability, convenience, efficacy, and side effects), disease factors (including clinical and neuroimaging prognostic indicators), and patient factors (including comorbidities, lifestyle, and personal preference). This review will discuss the disease-modifying agents used currently in MS, as well as available alternative agents.","1935":"A key component of multiple sclerosis is the occurrence of episodes of clinical worsening with either new symptoms or an increase in older symptoms over a few days or weeks. These are known as exacerbations of multiple sclerosis. In this review, we summarize the pathophysiology and treatment of exacerbations and describe how they are related to the overall management of this disease.","1936":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has brought in several benefits to the study of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). It provides accurate measurement of disease activity, facilitates precise diagnosis, and aid in the assessment of newer therapies. The imaging guidelines for MS are broadly divided in to approaches for imaging patients with suspected MS or clinically isolated syndromes (CIS) or for monitoring patients with established MS. In this review, the technical aspects of MR imaging for MS are briefly discussed. The imaging process need to capture the twin aspects of acute MS viz. the autoimmune acute inflammatory process and the neurodegenerative process. Gadolinium enhanced MRI can identify acute inflammatory lesions precisely. The commonly applied MRI marker of disease progression is brain atrophy. Whole brain magnetization Transfer Ratio (MTR) and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) are two other techniques use to monitor disease progression. A variety of imaging techniques such as Double Inversion Recovery (DIR), Spoiled Gradient Recalled (SPGR) acquisition, and Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) have been utilized to study the cortical changes in MS. MRI is now extensively used in the Phase I, II and III clinical trials of new therapies. As the technical aspects of MRI advance rapidly, and higher field strengths become available, it is hoped that the impact of MRI on our understanding of MS will be even more profound in the next decade.","1937":"Technological advances have made it possible to examine the human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in a manner that was previously impossible. CSF provides a window into the changes that occur in the central nervous system (CNS) in health and disease. Through analysis of the CSF, we discern indirectly the state of health of the CNS, and correctly or incorrectly, draw conclusions regarding mechanisms of CNS injury and repair. OBJECTIVE, MATERIALS AND METHODS: To review the current state of knowledge of changes in the CSF in multiple sclerosis. Establishing CSF markers that permit evaluation of the various biological processes in multiple sclerosis remains a challenge. Of all the biological processes, inflammatory markers are probably the best identified. Detection of oligoclonal immunoglobulin bands in the CSF is now established as the single most useful laboratory marker in the CSF to aid in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Markers of demyelination, remyelination, neuro-axonal loss, neural repair and regeneration, and astrogliosis are only now being recognized. A good surrogate for any of these pathophysiological processes has not been defined to date. The goal of future research is not only to define surrogate markers in the CSF for each of the above functions, but also to extend it to other more readily accessible body fluids like blood and urine. A synopsis of the current literature in most of these areas of CSF evaluation pertaining to multiple sclerosis is presented in this article. ","1938":"Pediatric multiple sclerosis (MS) represents a particular MS subgroup with unique diagnostic challenges and many unanswered questions. Due to the narrow window of environmental exposures and clinical disease expression, children with MS may represent a particularly important group to study to gain a better understanding of MS pathogenesis. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is more common in children than in adults, often making the differential diagnosis of MS, particularly a clinically isolated syndrome, quite difficult. Although both disorders represent acute inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system and have overlapping symptoms, ADEM is typically (not always) self-limiting. The presence of encephalopathy is much more characteristic of ADEM and may help in distinguishing between the two. Young children (under ten years old) with MS differ the most from adults. They have a lower frequency of oligoclonal bands in their cerebrospinal fluid and are less likely to have discrete lesions on MRI. Problems of cognitive dysfunction and psychosocial adjustment have particularly serious implications in both children and teenagers with MS. Increased awareness of these difficulties and interventions are needed. While clinical research on therapies to alter the disease course is limited, the available data fortunately suggests that disease-modifying therapy is well tolerated and likely to be effective. Ultimately, multinational research studies are necessary to advance our knowledge of the causes, symptoms, and treatment of pediatric MS and such collaborations are currently underway.","1939":"Neuromyelitis optica is an inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system. The discovery of a specific antibody (NMO IgG \/aquaporin-4 antibody) in patients with this condition has led to a marked revival of research on the disease. This article summarizes the major advances in neuromyelitis optica, particularly in the last 2 years, and supplements the previous review published in this Journal in 2007. Important among these developments are: the epidemiological studies, which have provided estimates of incidence and prevalence; identification of mutations in the aquaporin-4 gene; improved understanding of the effects of anti-aquaporin-4 antibody on astrocytes; roles of excitatory amino acid transporter type 2 and glutamate; requirement of aquaporin-4 to be in orthogonal arrays to be antigenic; recognition of the presence of aquaporin-4 antibody in patients with cancer and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome; possibility of monitoring the disease using the antibody, and the effectiveness of rituximab and mycophenolate in preventing relapses.","1940":"The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) requires objective findings referable to the central nervous system. A wide differential diagnosis often has to be considered. Magnetic resonance imaging and electrophysiologic and cerebrospinal fluid studies can all contribute to an early definitive diagnosis. The McDonald diagnostic criteria for MS (2005) are the currently recognized MS diagnostic criteria. The clinical subtypes of MS and their diagnosis are discussed in this article. Being informed of the diagnosis may be a stressful experience for the patient and this is also dealt with.","1941":"B cells have recently been identified as an integral component of the immune system; they play a part in autoimmunity through antigen presentation, antibody secretion, and complement activation. Animal models of multiple sclerosis (MS) suggest that myelin destruction is partly mediated through B cell activation (and plasmablasts). MS patients with evidence of B cell involvement, as compared to those without, tend to have a worse prognosis. Finally, the significant decrease in new gadolinium-enhancing lesions, new T2 lesions, and relapses in MS patients treated with rituximab (a monoclonal antibody against CD20 on B cells) leads us to the conclusion that B cells play an important role in MS and that immune modulation of these cells may ameliorate the disease. This article will explore the role of B cells in MS and the rationale for the development of B cell-targeted therapeutics. MS is an immune-mediated disease that affects over 2 million people worldwide and is the number one cause of disability in young patients. Most therapeutic targets have focused on T cells; however, recently, the focus has shifted to the role of B cells in the pathogenesis of MS and the potential of B cells as a therapeutic target.","1942":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a suspected autoimmune disease in which myelin-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells enter the central nervous system (CNS) and initiate an inflammatory response directed against myelin and other components of the CNS. Acute MS exacerbations are believed be the result of active inflammation, and progression of disability is generally believed to reflect accumulation of damage to the CNS, particularly axonal damage. Over the last several years, the pathophysiology of MS is being appreciated to be much more complex, and it appears that the development of the MS plaque involves a large number of cell populations, including CD8+ T lymphocytes, B cells, and Th17 cells (a population of helper T cells that secrete the inflammatory cytokine IL-17). The axonal transection and degeneration that is thought to represent the basis for progressive MS is now recognized to begin early in the disease process and to continue in the progressive forms of the disease. Molecules important for limiting aberrant neural connections in the CNS have been identified, which suppress axonal sprouting and regeneration of transected axons within the CNS. Pathways have also been identified that prevent remyelination of the MS lesion by oligodendrocyte precursors. Novel neuroimaging methodologies and potential biomarkers are being developed to monitor various aspects of the disease process in MS. As we identify the pathways responsible for the clinical phenomena of MS, we will be able to develop new therapeutic strategies for this disabling illness of young adults.","1943":"THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY INVESTIGATED AND TWO FEATURES HAVE CONSISTENTLY EMERGED: marked geographical variation in prevalence and substantial familial clustering. At first sight, geographic variation would seem to imply an environmental cause for the disease, while familial clustering would seem to suggest that genetic factors have the predominant etiological effect. However, given that geographic variation in prevalence could result from variation in the frequency of genetic risk alleles and that familial clustering might result from shared environmental exposure rather than shared genetic risk alleles, it is clear that these crude inferences are unreliable. Epidemiologists have been resourceful in their attempts to resolve this apparent conflict between \"nurture and nature\" and have employed a whole variety of sophisticated methods to try and untangle the etiology of multiple sclerosis. The body of evidence that has emerged from these efforts has formed the foundation for decades of research seeking to identify relevant genes and this is the obvious place to start any consideration of the genetics of multiple sclerosis.","1944":"","1945":"","1946":"","1947":"The apnea test is a mandatory examination for determining brain death (BD), because it provides an essential sign of definitive loss of brainstem function. However, several authors have expressed their concern about the safety of this procedure as there are potential complications such as severe hypotension, pneumothorax, excessive hypercarbia, hypoxia, acidosis, and cardiac arrhythmia or asystole. These complications may constrain the examiner to abort the test, thereby compromising BD diagnosis. Nevertheless, when an appropriate oxygen-diffusion procedure is used, this technique is safe. We review here the prerequisites to begin the test, its procedure, potential complications, and the use of alternative ancillary tests. We recommend that the apnea test be retained as a mandatory procedure for the diagnosis of BD. In those situations when the apnea test is terminated by the examiner for some reason or when it is impossible to carry it out in a patient due to the presence of some pathologic condition, alternative ancillary tests should be used to confirm BD.","1948":"","1949":"","1950":"","1951":"Paraplegia due to a spinal cord epidural mass is an extremely rare presentation of undiagnosed leukemia.

Granulocytic sarcoma or chloroma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of an epidural mass in patients with or with out leukemia granulocytic sarcoma, which are rare extramedullary tumor-like proliferation of myelogenous precursor cells that may de novo precede acute leukemia or coincide with the first manifestation or relapse of acute myeloid leukemia.","1952":"A mobile plaque in the carotid artery is an uncommon entity, usually detected incidentally on a carotid duplex scan or angiography. It is associated with an indeterminate risk of an embolic stroke and should be managed on an emergent basis.

Thrombophilic factors have been implicated in 4-8% of the young strokes worldwide. Protein S deficiency is a rare cause of recurrent ischemic stroke in young population. Only a few sporadic cases have been described in the literature. We are reporting a case of protein S deficiency-related recurrent ischemic stroke in a 16-year-old girl. Early diagnosis and targeted approach can help such patients to prevent recurrent thrombotic episodes.","1954":"Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is characterized by orthostatic headache (OH), low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, and diffuse pachymeningeal gadolinium enhancement (DPME). We present here the case studies of two patients. One patient demonstrated a CSF leak in the mid-thoracic region, and recovered completely with conservative treatment. The other patient in whom leak could not be demonstrated, developed dementia, rapidly worsening encephalopathy, and became comatose, necessitating urgent epidural blood patch (EBP) with 25 cc of autologous blood, after which immediate and complete symptomatic relief was obtained. A second EBP was required a few days later and also provided complete and sustained clinical benefit, without subsequent recurrence. Both patients had OH and showed bilateral subdural fluid collections, DPME and \"sagging\" of brain on MRI. A high index of suspicion, recognizing the orthostatic nature of headache, and typical findings on contrast enhanced MRI should point to the diagnosis of SIH. EBP can be effective treatment in patients unresponsive to conservative measures.","1955":"The neurovascular conflict in trigeminal neuralgia is an intractable condition; medical treatment is usually of long duration and can be annoying for both patients and clinicians. This prospective study was designed to assess the outcome of microvascular decompression (MVD) in patients with more than 3 years' history of intractable idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (TN) and poor response to drugs. Twenty-one patients (8 females and 13 males) with intractable idiopathic TN (group 1) underwent MVD and were followed up for 2 years. Group 2 (n = 15), which included 6 females and 9 males, received pharmacotherapy. The outcome responses of pain relief were evaluated using a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS) and the Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) scoring system. The patients' morbidity was recorded as well. All patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were offered MVD surgery. Freedom from pain was achieved immediately after surgery in 95.2% (n = 20) of patients in group 1, and 90.5% (n = 19) had sustained relief over the follow-up period. There were no statistical significance recurrences or surgical complications in group 1 (P&gt;0.5), while 53.3% (n = 8) of the subjects in group 2 showed poor response with pharmacotherapy over the same period of time and many patients experienced drug intolerance that had statistical significance (P&lt;0.01). Early MVD in TN can help patients avoid the side effects of drugs and the adverse psychological effects of long-term pharmacotherapy and prolonged morbidity. ","1956":"A primary headache, particularly migraine, is associated with oxidative stress during the attack. However, data regarding the interictal state in migraineurs and in those with tension-type headache (TTH) is limited. (1) To assess the oxidative stress in migraineurs and TTH subjects in between the episodes and (2) to see if there is a difference in the degree of oxidative stress in the different subtypes of migraine and TTH. Fifty migraineurs, 50 patients with TTH, and 50 control subjects were included in this study after screening for the exclusion criteria. Diagnosis of headache was made according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD)-2 criteria. A venous blood sample was collected from the antecubital vein at least 3 days after the last attack of headache. The sample was centrifuged immediately and the plasma was stored at -70 degrees C. The ferric reducing activity of plasma (FRAP) and the malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were assessed using colorimetric methods. Statistical analysis was done with the help of SPSS for Windows, v 11.0. One way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey test, independent sample t test, univariate regression, and multivariate regression analysis were done as indicated. Migraineurs had higher values of MDA and FRAP than the subjects in the other two groups (P&lt;0.001). No difference was observed between the TTH group and the control group. FRAP levels were significantly higher in subjects who had mixed migraine (migraine with aura and without aura) as compared to those with only migraine without aura (mean difference 196.1; 95% CI = 27.3 to 364.9; P = 0.01). Similarly, oxidative stress was significantly higher in patients with episodic TTH as compared to those with chronic TTH (FRAP t = 3.16; P = 0.003 and MDA t = 2.75; P = 0.008). This study suggests that oxidative stress continues even between headache episodes in migraineurs but not in those with TTH. This could probably be consequent to the different pathophysiological mechanisms of TTH and migraine. ","1957":"Glycoconjugate molecules expressed at the plasma membrane of mammalian cells have been reported to be associated with tumor progression. The measurement of total sialic acid (TSA) and lipid-bound sialic acid (LBSA) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is suggested to be useful for the diagnosis of brain tumors. But there are very few reports available on the serum glycoconjugate levels in patients with brain tumors. The objective of this study is to check the feasibility of using serum glycoconjugates such as TSA and LBSA as tumor markers in brain tumor patients. Colorimetric estimation of TSA using diphenylamine was done on 100 patients with intracranial tumors; follow-up study was carried out in 24 cases. The LBSA fraction was isolated from the serum of 68 brain tumor patients and evaluated using phosphotungstic acid and resorcinol; follow-up study was done on 23 patients. The various types of brain tumors included in this study were glioma, meningioma, and acoustic neurinoma as well as some other types such as medulloblastoma, secondary tumors, and craniopharyngioma. There was no significant difference between the TSA and LBSA concentrations seen in pretreatment or post-treatment cases and that seen in control subjects. TSA and LBSA do not have the ability to discriminate between benign and malignant brain tumors. TSA and LBSA appear to be tumor markers of very limited value in patients with brain tumors.

The external diameter of all the arteries forming the CW in 225 normal Sri Lankan adult cadaver brains was measured using a calibrated grid to determine the occurrence of \"typical\" CWs, where all of the component vessels had a diameter of more than 1 mm. Variations in the AcomA were classified into 12 types based on Ozaki et al., 1977. 193 (86%) showed \"hypoplasia\", of which 127 (56.4%) were with multiple anomalies. Posterior communicating artery (PcoA) was hypoplastic bilaterally in 93 (51%) and unilaterally in 49 (13%). Precommunicating segment of the posterior cerebral arteries (P1) was hypoplastic bilaterally in 3 (2%), unilaterally in 14 (4%), and AcomA was hypoplastic in 91 (25%). The precommunicating segment of the anterior cerebral arteries (A1) was hypoplastic unilaterally in 17 (5%). Types of variations in the AcomA were: single 145 (65%), fusion 52 (23%), double 22 (10%) [V shape, Y shape, H shape, N shape], triplication 1 (0.44%), presence of median anterior cerebral artery 5 (2%), and aneurysm 1 (0.44%). The occurrence of \"typical\" CW in autopsy brains was rare. Further studies would be necessary to determine if these anatomical variations could predispose to cerebral ischemia and premature stroke in the Sri Lankan population.

Mishriwala migrant camp has seen minimal immigration and out-migration since its establishment. In an earlier study we reported on the prevalence of dementia amongst a Kashmiri migrant population. That study was conducted in the migrant camp at Mishriwala, 12 km west of Jammu city, the winter capital of Jammu and Kashmir State. We have developed standardized study methods and instruments for use in the Kashmiri-speaking population, which we used for screening for dementia during the prevalence study. We now report the results of a 1-year prospective study carried out to find out the incidence of dementia in the same population. To ascertain the incidence of dementiain the Kashmiri Pandit population aged 60 years and above. A 1-year, prospective, epidemiological study of 186 subjects aged 60 years and above, using cognitive and functional ability screening and clinical evaluation.

SE is defined as a continuous seizure lasting more than 30 min, or two or more seizures without full recovery of consciousness between any of them. Based on recent understanding of the pathophysiology, it is now considered that any seizure that lasts more than 5 min probably needs to be treated as SE. GABAergic mechanisms play a crucial role in terminating seizures. When the seizure persists, GABA-mediated mechanisms become ineffective and several other putative mechanisms of seizure suppression have been recognized. Early treatment of SE with benzodiazepines, followed if necessary by fosphenytoin administration, is the most widely followed strategy. About a third of patients with SE may have persistent seizures refractory to the first-line medications. They require aggressive management with second-line medications such as barbiturates, propofol, or other agents. In developing countries where facilities for assisted ventilation are not readily available, it may be helpful to use nonsedating antiepileptic drugs (such as sodium valproate, levetiracetam, or topiramate) at this stage. It is important to recognize SE and institute treatment as early as possible in order to avoid a refractory state. It is equally important to attend to the general condition of the patient and to ensure that the patient is hemodynamically stable. This article reviews current knowledge regarding the management of convulsive SE in adults.","1961":"","1962":"","1963":"","1964":"","1965":"","1966":"Neonatal electroencephalogram (EEG), though often perceived as being difficult to record and interpret, is relatively easy to study due to the immature nature of the brain, which expresses only a few well-defined set of patterns.

She succumbed to the disease within 8 weeks of onset of symptoms. MRI revealed hyperintense signals on T2WI and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images in basal ganglia and fronto-temporal and parietal cortex, sparing thalamus, striate cortex and globus pallidum. Abundant abnormal prion protein deposits (PrP(sc)) were detected in caudate, putamen, thalamus, cingulate and striate cortex, in comparison to frontal and parietal cortex while no deposits were found in globus pallidum. MRI changes did not correlate with degree of spongy change, gliosis or prion protein deposition.

A 40-year-old unmarried man presented with progressive ataxia and dysarthria along with complaints of non-development of secondary sexual characteristics and erectile dysfunction. There were complaints of intermittent diarrhea. Clinical examination revealed a pan-cerebellar syndrome with features of hypoandrogenism. No eye movement abnormalities were evident. There were signs of malabsorption. Investigations confirmed the presence of auto-antibodies found in celiac disease, and a duodenal biopsy confirmed the same. Hypoandrogenism was postulated to be due to hypergonadotropic hypogonadism which has been mentioned in a few patients of celiac disease. However, the pattern seen in our patient was of a hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. This is probably secondary to an autoimmune hypophysitis seen in some patients in the absence of other clinical manifestations. Autoantibody testing should be a diagnostic necessity in any adult with a sporadic cerebellar ataxia.","1975":"To study the significance of filling cystometry in assessment and management of neurogenic bladder in myelopathies and correlate neurological recovery and bladder management in the follow up. Retrospective analysis of reports of filling cystometry in patients with traumatic and non-traumatic myelopathy. Neuro-rehabilitation unit of a tertiary care university hospital. The study was carried out between September 2005 and June 2006 and included all subjects with myelopathy who underwent filling cystometry. ASIA impairment scale was used to assess neurological status during admission as well as in the follow up. Bladder management was advised based on the cystometric findings. Neurological recovery and mode of bladder management were correlated during the follow up after a minimum of 6 months. Fifty-two subjects (38 males, 14 females), mean age 33.26 +\/- 14.66 years (10-80) underwent filling cystometry. Twenty patients had cervical, 24 had thoracic and 8 had lumbar myelopathy. Cystometric findings were overactive detrusor observed in 43 patients, (21 had detrusor sphincter dyssynergia (DSD), 22 without DSD) and areflexic\/underactive detrusor in 9. Post-void residual (&gt;15% of voided urine) was significant in 27 patients. Twenty-three patients (44%) reported for follow up (16 males, 7 females) after a mean duration of 9.04 +\/- 2.44 months (6-15 months). Neurological recovery was seen in 61% cases, while 1 patient showed deterioration. Only 26% patients reported change in bladder management during follow up. Correlation between neurological recovery and bladder management was found to be insignificant (P &gt; 0.05) using spearman correlation co-efficient. Filling cystometry is valuable for assessment and management of neurogenic bladder after myelopathy. No significant relationship was observed between neurological recovery and neurogenic bladder management in the follow up in the present study. ","1976":"Fine motor skills disorders belong to the neurological manifestation of Wilson's disease. The aim of this study is to investigate if fine motor performance changes during the course of the disease and with therapy. In 15 neurological patients with Wilson's disease, severity of neurological symptoms was assessed with a neurology score. A test battery consisting of the hand writing of a test sentence, lines of \"double-I\" and retracing a circle was carried out for analysis. By means of a computer-aided analysis of the patient's handwriting, 10 kinematic parameters of the writing trace were calculated. These parameters were determined once at the very beginning of the study and then again after 7 years. Improvement of clinical symptoms was observed after onset of therapy only within the first 2 years. In contrast to the standard population, a reduced degree of automation could be detected both at the beginning and at the end of the 7-year interval. There was no significant change in 8 out of the 10 kinematic parameters during the observation period, 2 deteriorated. The absence of a significant increase in fine motor disturbances proves, on the one hand, the efficacy of the therapy regime applied. On the other hand, the end point of a possible reversibility had been reached. A computer-aided analysis of the patient's handwriting allows for a sensitive detection of the \"functional scar\" in the extrapyramidal control and can subsequently prompt a timely correction of therapy in case of progression.

The contribution of hypertension to the cognitive decline in nondemented diabetic patients is unclear. We wanted to see if cognition in patients with type 2 diabetes is associated with the duration of diabetes, control of diabetes, complications of diabetes, vascular risk factors, or depression. We also looked at association of noncompliance with cognition, and depression. We recruited ambulant patients with type 2 diabetes who are 55 years or more in age from the weekly diabetic clinic. We excluded patients with past history of stroke. We selected the time taken for the Trial A test, delayed recall on ten-word list from Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD), Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment Scale (RUDAS) and Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D) screening instrument to assess these patients. We utilized mean, standard deviation, Chi-square test and Pearson's correlation for statistical analysis. We considered P &lt; 0.05 to be significant. RUDAS scores inversely correlated (r = -0.360) with CES-D scores (P = 0.002). Scores of the screening instrument for depression, the CES-D was associated with the duration of diabetes mellitus (P = 0.018), fasting blood glucose (P = 0.029) as well as with 2-hour post prandial blood glucose (P = 0.017).

Unlike the west where multiple sclerosis (MS) is the commonest white matter disease encountered, in the tropics, there are myriad causes for the same. Infectious and post infectious disorders probably account for the vast majority of these diseases. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection tops the list of infective conditions. Central nervous system (CNS) tuberculosis occasionally presents with patchy parenchymal lesions unaccompanied by meningeal involvement. Human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV) infection and cystic inflammatory lesions such as neurocysticercosis are important causes to be considered in the differential diagnosis. Diagnosing post infectious demyelinating disorders is equally challenging since more than a third of cases seen in the tropics do not present with history of past infection or vaccinations. Metabolic and deficiency disorders such as Wernicke's encephalopathy, osmotic demyelinating syndrome associated with extra pontine lesions and Vitamin B12 deficiency states can occassionaly cause confusion in diagnosis. This review considers a few important disorders which manifest with white matter changes on MRI and create diagnostic difficulties in a population in the tropics.","1980":"Mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics has emerged as a powerful approach that has the potential to accelerate biomarker discovery, both for diagnostic as well as therapeutic purposes. Proteomics has traditionally been synonymous with 2D gels but is increasingly shifting to the use of gel-free systems and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS). Quantitative proteomic approaches have already been applied to investigate various neurological disorders, especially in the context of identifying biomarkers from cerebrospinal fluid and serum. This review highlights the scope of different applications of quantitative proteomics in understanding neurological disorders with special emphasis on biomarker discovery.","1981":"","1982":"","1983":"","1984":"","1985":"","1986":"","1987":"During the last 20 years at least 23 cases of motor neuron disease have been reported in HIV-1 seropositive patients. In this report we describe the clinical picture of a young man with HIV-1 clade C infection and flail arm-like syndrome, who we were able to follow-up for a long period. We investigated and prospectively monitored a 34-year-old man with features of flail arm syndrome, who developed the weakness and wasting 1 year after being diagnosed with HIV-1 infection after a routine blood test. He presented in 2003 with progressive, symmetrical wasting and weakness of the proximal muscles of the upper limb of 2 years' duration. He had severe wasting and weakness of the shoulder and arm muscles. There were no pyramidal signs. He has been on HAART for the last 4 years and the weakness or wasting has not worsened. At the last follow-up in July 2007, the patient had the same neurological deficit and no other symptoms or signs of HIV-1 infection. MRI of the spinal cord in 2007 showed characteristic T2 hyperintense signals in the central part of the spinal cord, corresponding to the central gray matter. Thus, our patient had HIV-1 clade C infection associated with a 'flail arm-like syndrome.' The causal relationship between HIV-1 infection and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-like syndrome is still uncertain. The syndrome usually manifests as a lower motor neuron syndrome, as was seen in our young patient. It is known that treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) stabilizes\/improves the condition. In our patient the weakness and atrophy remained stable over a period of 3.5 years after commencing HAART regimen.","1988":null,"1989":"Reading and writing disturbances are common accompaniments of aphasia following brain damage. However, impaired writing in the absence of apparent primary linguistic disturbances is infrequently reported in the literature. A 67-year-old right-handed subject underwent neurological, neuroradiological, and linguistic investigations following development of a minimal right upper limb weakness. The patient had polycythemia and the neurological investigation revealed right upper limb paresis. The neuroradiological investigation revealed hypodense areas involving the gray-white matter of the left postero-parietal and frontal lobe, left caudate and lentiform nuclei, and the anterior limb of the internal capsule, suggesting an infarct. The linguistic investigation revealed a mild anomic aphasia with apraxic agraphia. This mild anomic aphasia resulted primarily from the relatively poor scores on the verbal fluency tests. The marked writing impairment, even with the left hand, points to disturbances in written output - apraxic agraphia - in the presence of near-normal spoken output. This finding should raise suspicion about hidden apraxic agraphia in subjects with posterior aphasias.

The study was conducted to analyse the pattern of this nerve lesion in clinical and electrophysiological parameters and also to study the outcome in a conservatively treated cohort. One hundred and six patients who underwent evaluation at our laboratory from 2000 to 2006 for post injection sciatic neuropathy formed the study population. Twenty two of these were followed up (mean 6.6 months) for the outcome. In the cases with full data, common peroneal division of the sciatic nerve was affected alone or predominantly. On follow up, 72% cases showed little or partial recovery. Thirty two percent patients had residual trophic changes and causalgia at their last visit. The majority of cases of postinjection sciatic nerve injury have poor prognosis on conservative treatment.

Research conducted in recent years has increased public health concern about the toxicity of lead at low doses and has supported a reappraisal of the levels of lead exposure that may be safely tolerated in the workplace. Neuropathy is one complication of lead poisoning. The aim of this study is to describe the phenotypic and electrophysiological profile in five male patients working in a battery factory who developed radial nerve neuropathy due to lead exposure. All patients had elevated blood lead levels that were in the toxic range. The concerned regulatory bodies should make it mandatory for workers to undergo regular health checkups to detect signs of lead poisoning and must ensure that workers are aware about the ill effects of exposure to this metal. Chelation therapy removes lead from the blood and soft tissues and chronic lead exposure often requires repeated courses of treatment.","1992":"In this retrospective study, we compared the initial presentation of patients who were eventually diagnosed with either benign fasciculations (BF) or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We found a significantly higher number of patients with BF reporting a past history of psychiatric symptoms, life stressors, and concurrent psychosomatic symptoms. There was no difference between the two groups in patient report of current anxiety or depression symptoms. These findings support our hypothesis that BF are a manifestation of psychological distress due to somatization and that reviewing psychosocial history is important when patients are being evaluated for fasciculations. Patients seeking medical attention for fasciculations and who do not report a history of underlying psychiatric or psychosomatic disorders should be followed closely as fasciculations have been reported to be a presenting feature of ALS.","1993":"Assessment of bladder by urodynamic study (UDS) in patients with urinary incontinence following stroke, and correlation with site of lesion. Retrospective cross-sectional study in the neurological rehabilitation unit of a tertiary care institute. Forty patients (22 males) with arterial or venous, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, with urinary incontinence in the acute phase following the event, underwent UDS. Seventeen patients had right hemiplegia, 18 had left hemiplegia, and five had posterior circulation stroke with brainstem\/cerebellar features. Bladder type was correlated with age, side, and site of lesion. The mean age was 46.80 +\/- 16.65 years (range: 18-80 years). Thirty-six patients had arterial stroke and four had cortical venous thrombosis. UDS was performed after a mean of 28.32 +\/- 10.27 days (range: 8-53 days) after the stroke. All but one patient had neurogenic bladder dysfunction, with 36 patients (90%) having overactive detrusor (OD) and three having underactive\/areflexic detrusor. Among the 36 patients with OD, 25 patients (62.5%) had OD without detrusor-sphincter dyssynergy (DSD) and 11 (27.5%) had OD with DSD. Bladder management was advised based on the UDS findings. No significant correlation (P &gt; 0.05) was found between type of bladder and age or side and site of lesion. UDS is a useful tool to assess and manage the bladder following stroke with urinary incontinence. In this study, no significant correlation was found between UDS findings and site of lesion.

The film hints at a curious neurocognitive phenomenon of creativity in the midst of language disability, as exemplified in the lives of people like Leonardo da Vinci and Albert Einstein, both of whom demonstrated extraordinary creativity even though they were probably affected with developmental learning disorders. It has been hypothesized that a developmental delay in the dominant hemisphere most likely 'disinhibits' the nondominant parietal lobe, unmasking talents-artistic or otherwise-in some such individuals. It has been suggested that, in remedial training, children with learning disorders be encouraged to develop such hidden talents to full capacity, rather than be subjected to the usual overemphasis on the correction of the disturbed coded symbol operations.","1995":"Acquired resistance to antibiotics and other chemotherapeutic agents is a major problem in the practice of neurology and other branches of medicine. There are several mechanisms by which drug resistance is acquired. Multidrug transporters are important glycoproteins located in the cell membrane that actively transport small lipophilic molecules from one side of the cell membrane to the other, most often from the inside to the outside of a cell. They have important protective role yet may prove inconvenient in chemotherapy. In epilepsy and other disorders this mechanism augments the elimination of drugs from their target cells and leads to drug resistance. In this review, we have discussed the biochemical characteristics of multidrug transporters and the mechanisms by which these membrane bound proteins transport their target molecules from one side to the other side of the cell membrane. We have also briefly discussed the application of this knowledge in the understanding of drug resistance in various clinical situations with particular reference to neurological disorders. These proteins located in the placenta have important role in preventing the transplacental movement of drugs in to the fetus which may result in congenital malformations or other defects. The molecular genetic mechanisms that govern the expression of these important proteins are discussed briefly.

It resembles neuroleptic malignant syndrome and is characterized by fever, marked rigidity, altered consciousness, leucocytosis and elevated creatine kinase. Malignant syndrome is a potentially fatal condition and awareness of this condition is imperative for prevention and treatment. The commonest precipitating factor is dopaminergic drug withdrawal or dose reduction. We report malignant syndrome (precipitated by hyponatremia) in a case of Parkinson's disease, in the absence of dopaminergic drug withdrawal. A 60-year-old man presented with fever, severe rigidity and altered sensorium following repeated vomiting. On investigation, he was found to have hyponatremia precipitated malignant syndrome. Treatment with hydration, cooling, correction of hyponatremia and dopaminergic drugs reversed his condition. The triad of fever, severe rigidity and altered sensorium should prompt evaluation for malignant syndrome in Parkinson's disease.","2003":"Rhodotorula species may be responsible for systemic infection in immunocompromised patients. Meningitis by Rhodotorula species in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected persons has been reported previously. We report a case of meningitis caused by Rhodotorula mucilaginosa in a 36-year-old HIV seropositive male patient who presented with fever, altered sensorium and features of meningeal irritation i.e. neck rigidity. The Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell counts were high, showing 150 cells\/mm(3), with 60% lymphocytes and 40% polymorphs, and protein content of 100 mg%; glucose was 60 mg%. The diagnosis was confirmed by culture on Sabouraud's Dextrose agar. The patient was treated successfully with intensive Amphotericin B (1 mg\/kg), for two weeks, followed by oral Itraconazole (400 mg daily), for a period of two months. The patient was started on anti retroviral therapy. He did not show any relapse of the symptoms when the last follow up was done six months after the date of discharge.","2004":"Acquired myasthenia Gravis (MG), a disorder of impaired neuromuscular transmission is recognized as an autoimmune disorder, with a majority of the patients having antibodies against acetylcholine receptor (AChR antibodies) in the serum. To correlate the AChR antibody status with the clinical characteristics of patients with myasthenia gravis. Retrospective and prospective study. This study was carried out in patients with definite MG, attending the Neurology services of the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bangalore, India, during the period 1999-2003. The AChR antibody status was determined using the direct and indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. There were 165 patients in this study (M : F :: 1.5 : 1). The overall seropositivity rate was 59.4%. Seropositive patients had higher age of onset and presentation, and more frequent occurrence of crises, both at presentation and at any time during the course. Other parameters, viz. gender of the patient, Osserman staging, thymic enlargement on CT and remission during follow-up did not differ between the two groups. This communication reports the result of AChR antibody assay in a large cohort of patients, using a simple diagnostic tool, namely direct and indirect ELISA technique. In addition, the characteristics of a large cohort of patients with seronegative myasthenia gravis are described. ","2005":"Only few papers have investigated the impact of multiple sclerosis (MS), especially MS-related fatigue and the impact of the quality of sleep on the quality of life (QoL) in MS patients. The objective of this study was to measure the quality of life in MS patients and the impact of disability, fatigue and sleep quality, using statistical modeling. A cross-sectional study was conducted and data was collected from 141 MS patients, who were referred to the Mottahari Clinic, Shiraz, Iran, in 2005. Data on health-related quality of life (MSQoL-54), fatigue severity scale (FSS), and Pittsburgh sleep quality Index (PSQI) were obtained in the case of all the patients. Epidemiology data concerning MS type, MS functional system score, expanded disability status scale (EDSS) etc. were also provided by a qualified neurologist. Spearman alpha coefficient, Mann-Whitney U test, and linear regression model were used to analyze the data. The mean +\/-SD age of 141 MS patients was 32.6+\/-9.6 year. Thirty five (24.8%) of them were male and the others were female. Eighty two (58.1%) of the patients had EDSS score of &lt;\/= 2, 36 (25.5%) between 2.5 and 4.5, and 23 (16.3%) &gt;\/= 5. As per PSQI scores, two (1.4%) of the patients had good sleep, 16 (11.3%) had moderate sleep and 123 (87.2%) had poor sleep. There was a significant high positive correlation between the quality of mental and physical health composite scores (r = 0.791, P&lt;0.001). There was a significant negative correlation between the quality of physical score and age (r = -0.88, P&lt;0.001), fatigue score (r = -0.640, P&lt;0.001), EDSS score (r = -0.476, P&lt;0.001) and PSQI (sleep quality r = -0.514, P&lt;0.000). Linear regression analysis showed that PSQI score, EDSS, and fatigue score were predictors in the model between the quality of physical score and covariates (P&lt;0.001). Linear regression model showed that fatigue score and PSQI were predictors in the model between the quality of mental score and covariates (P&lt;0.001). In conclusion, it may be said that MS patients had poor and moderate quality of mental and physical health. The quality of life was impaired as seen by PSQI, EDSS, and FSS. It is our suggestion that these patients require the attention of health care professionals, to be observed for the need of possible psychological support. ","2006":"A number of diabetic patients with diabetic neuropathy, in India, were treated with epalrestat, an aldose reductase inhibitor. In this study, more than 2000 patients with diabetic neuropathy, who were treated with epalrestat for 3-12 months, were analyzed to assess the efficacy and the adverse reactions of the drug. We analyzed the subjective symptoms (spontaneous pain, numbness, coldness and hypoesthesia) and the nerve function tests (motor nerve conduction velocity, sensory nerve conduction velocity and vibration threshold). The improvement rate of the subjective symptoms was 75% (slightly improved or better) and that of the nerve function tests 36%. Adverse drug reactions were encountered in 52 (2.5%) of the 2190 patients, none of which was severe. Although data are limited, it is strongly suggested that epalrestat is a highly effective and safe agent for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy. ","2007":"To assess the quality of life (QoL) and prevalence of psychological problems (PP) in patients with neurological illness, and their correlation with functional abilities. Prospective cross-sectional study conducted in the neurological rehabilitation unit of tertiary research hospital in 30 consecutive hospitalized patients (21 men), age 16-55 years (34.63+\/-11.87). WHOQoL-BREF was used to assess QoL. The prevalence of PP was recorded using Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). QoL and HADS scores were correlated with functional abilities using mean Barthel Index (BI) Score. The duration of illness was three to 30 months (10.63+\/-7.83) and their primary diagnoses were stroke 12, traumatic spinal cord injury seven and non-traumatic spinal cord lesion 11. Twenty-two patients qualified for GHQ-12 caseness, with 15 patients having distress (score &gt;\/=15) and seven having severe problem and psychological distress (score&gt;\/=20). Twenty five patients had abnormal anxiety and 17 had abnormal depression on HADS (abnormal = 8-21), with moderate to severe anxiety and depression (scores&gt;\/=11) in nine and three patients respectively. The mean WHOQoL-BREF transformed scores (on WHOQoL 0-100 scale) were (38.83+\/-8.02), (50.76+\/-9.79), (48.53+\/-18.46) and (49.13+\/-10.63) in physical, psychological, social, and environmental domains respectively. The social domain of QoL had significant correlation (P&lt;.05) with functional abilities. Patients with neurological disorders requiring inpatient rehabilitation have impaired QoL that affects all domains of life. There is high prevalence of psychological problems, including anxiety and depression. The social domain of QoL adversely affected functional abilities, but the correlation between PP and functional abilities was insignificant. ","2008":"Given the constraints of resources, thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is under evaluation in developing countries like India, especially in areas such as western Utter Pradesh, where it is overly crowded and there is poor affordability. This study was done to evaluate recombinant tissue plasminogen activator r-tpa in acute ischemic stroke in hyper acute phase, in selected patients of western Utter Pradesh, in terms of feasibility and effectivity. Open, non randomized study. Thirty two patients were classified using Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke treatment (TOAST) criteria (large artery atherosclerotic = 8; cardio embolic = 6; small vessel occlusion = 14; other determined etiology = 2; undetermined etiology = 2). The mean time to reach the hospital was 2 h (1.15-3.0), the mean door to CT scan 20 min (10-40) and door to r-tpa injection was 30 min (24-68). The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores ranged from 11-22 (mean 15.5 +2.7). The dose of r-tpa administered was 0.9 mg\/kg. Twenty one patients (65.6%) showed significant improvement on the NIHSS score, at 48 h (4 points). (Mean change = 10; range = 4-17). At one month, 25 (78%) recorded improvement on the Barthel index (mean change = 45%). One developed frontal lobe hemorrhage and another developed recurrent stroke; one died of aspiration; and four showed no improvement. Modified Rankin score (m RS) was administered at the end of three months to 28 patients (90%); however, the rest could not be directly observed. The average modified Rankin Score was 1.2 (0-2). Hyperacute thrombolysis was found feasible and effective in selected patients with AIS from western Utter Pradesh and who had poor affordability. ","2009":"Several aspects of physiology, notably blood pressure, body temperature, blood glucose, and blood oxygen saturation, may be altered after an ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage. Generally, blood pressure and temperature rise acutely after a stroke, before returning to normal. Blood glucose and oxygen levels may be abnormal in individuals, but they do not follow a set pattern. Several aspects of these physiological alterations remain unclear, including their principal determinants - whether they genuinely affect prognosis (as opposed to merely representing underlying processes such as inflammation or a stress response), whether these effects are adaptive or maladaptive, whether the effects are specific to certain subgroups (e.g. lacunar stroke) and whether modifying physiology also modifies its prognostic effect. Hypertension and hyperglycemia may be helpful or harmful, depending on the perfusion status after an ischemic stroke; the therapeutic response to their lowering may be correspondingly variable. Hypothermia may provide benefits, in addition to preventing harm through protection from hyperthermia. Hypoxia is harmful, but normobaric hyperoxia is unhelpful or even harmful in normoxic patients. Hyperbaric hyperoxia, however, may be beneficial, though this remains unproven. The above-mentioned uncertainties necessitate generally conservative measures for physiology management, although there are notably specific recommendations for thrombolysis-eligible patients. Stroke unit care is associated with better outcome, possibly through better management of poststroke physiology. Stroke units can also facilitate research to clarify the relationship between physiology and prognosis, and to subsequently clarify management guidelines.","2010":"","2011":"There exist individual, institutional and national barriers to change, none more so than when introducing new therapies into medical practice especially those that involve organizational change. This paper, presented as an address to the joint meeting of the Association of British Neurologists and the Indian Academy of Neurology in October 2007, explores these barriers in the context of the instruction of thrombolytic therapy for patients with acute ischaemic stroke and suggests how they might be overcome using evidence from relevant clinical trials and observational studies.","2012":"","2013":"","2014":"","2015":"","2016":"An 11-year-old girl manifested with photophobia, ptosis, external ophthalmoplegia, hypotonia, weakness of proximal limb muscles, hyporeflexia, and generalized seizures (six months). Her elder sister had had uncontrolled seizures and photophobia and died at seven years of age. In the patient, serum lactate was high (55 mg\/dl). Muscle biopsy revealed characteristic ragged red and ragged blue fibers, diagnostic of mitochondrial cytopathy. Sequencing of the complete mitochondrial genome of the DNA obtained from the muscle biopsy of the patient did not show any characteristic mutation. Four months later, the girl was admitted with a one-week history of epilepsia partialis continua (EPC). EEG revealed Periodic Lateralized Epileptiform Discharges (PLEDs), once in 2-4 seconds, over the right temporo-occipital leads. MRI revealed signal change of right motor cortex, which had restricted diffusion. MR spectroscopy (MRS) from this region revealed lactate peak. EPC remained refractory to multiple anti-epileptic drugs, immuno-modulators, coenzyme-Q, and carnitine.

He presented with accelerated linear growth, facial gestalt, distinctive facial features, seizures and progressive diminution of vision in both eyes. He had features of gigantism from early childhood. An MRI showed that brain and endocrine functions were normal. This case is of interest, as we have to be aware of this not so rare disorder. In addition to the classic features, there were two unusual associations with Sotos syndrome in the patient.","2018":"Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a common disease of the geriatric age group in the western world, with a prevalence of 0.2% in the fifty plus age group. It is an important cause of morbidity, with irreversible visual loss being the most ominous complication. This diagnosis is an important consideration in all cases of new onset headache in elderly subjects. Reports of giant cell arteritis are few and far between in the Indian subcontinent. In this report, we describe the clinical details of four cases of giant cell arteritis, detected at Guwahati, Assam. The four patients were in the 70-82 age group. Sex distribution was equal. All of them had polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), with one case displaying an initial presentation as only PMR. Cardinal manifestation was a severe headache, frequently accompanied by scalp allodynia and abnormalities of the superficial temporal artery (STA) on examination. STA biopsy yielded histopathological confirmation in three patients. Permanent visual loss was noted in one patient. These cases highlight the importance of assessing the possibility of giant cell arteritis through appropriate clinical history, estimation of acute phase reactants and the judicious use of superficial temporal artery biopsy, to clinch the diagnosis.","2019":"Fabry's disease, an X linked recessive disorder caused by the deficiency of alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-gal A), leads to progressive accumulation of glycosphingolipids.

The entity is not rare, and unless suspected, cirrhosis can easily be overlooked. We report our experience with three such patients. They presented to us, over a period of two years, with symmetrical Parkinsonism and were later diagnosed to have cirrhosis with portal hypertension. All patients had minimal or absent tremors. Reversal of serum albumin to globulin ratio and evidence of cirrhosis on abdominal ultrasound were consistent. All three patients had the characteristic MRI abnormality of symmetrical T1 hyperintensity in basal ganglia and anterior midbrain. They improved to variable extents after treatment for cirrhosis, along with dopa agonists.

Carotid endarterectomy has a proven track record with compelling evidence in stroke prevention. a) To confirm that carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is safe and effective in preventing stroke at both short and long term. b) to demonstrate long term patency of internal carotid artery when arteriotomy repair is performed using autologous saphenous vein patch. During ten years, from September 1997 to February 2008, thirty nine patients who underwent consecutive carotid endarterectomy at our institute, form the basis of this report. Their age ranged from thirty to seventy eight years, with a mean age of 56. There were four women in this cohort. Thirty seven patients were symptomatic with &gt;70% stenosis and two were asymptomatic with &gt;80% stenosis, incidentally detected. Imaging included Duplex scan and MRA for carotid territory and brain, and non-invasive cardiac assessment. Co-morbidities included smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease. Carotid Endarterectomy was performed under general anaesthesia, using carotid shunt and vein patch arteriotomy repair. All the patients made satisfactory recovery, without major adverse cerebral events in this series. Morbidities included Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) in two, needing only medications in one, and carotid stenting in the other. Minor morbidities included neck hematoma in two and transient hypoglossal paresis in three patients. Yearly follow-up included duplex scan assessment for all the patients. Two patients died of contralateral stroke, two of myocardial events and two were lost to follow up. Thirty three patients are well and free of the disease during the follow up of three to 120 months. Carotid endarterectomy provided near total freedom from adverse cerebral events and its catastrophic sequelae, leading to excellent outcome, both short as well as long term. ","2022":"Headache patients commonly report sleep disruption and sleep disorders. Available literature suggests that the sleep pattern of headache sufferers is different from the control group. Patients in these studies were recruited from headache clinics; they did not include tension type headache. The aim of this study is to find out whether primary headaches affect sleep patterns. Community based cross sectional study This study was conducted in three high schools. Children in the 12-19 age group were allowed to participate. They were given a questionnaire in the presence of at least one of the authors, who assisted them in filling it. They were asked to provide responses based on most severe recurrent headache that they had experienced rather than the more frequent ones. The questionnaire included questions regarding demographic data and the characteristics of headache according to International Classification of Headache Disorders-2 criteria. Part B of the questionnaire contained questions regarding sleep habits. The children were asked to provide data regarding sleep habits on a normal school day. Diagnosis was based upon the information contained in the questionnaire. A telephonic interview was also done, where the information provided was found inadequate. Analysis was done with the help of SPSS v. 11.0., descriptive analysis, Chi square, and one way ANOVA with post hoc analysis. Kruskall-Wallis tests were run. A total of 1862 subjects were included in the study. Migraineurs and tension type headache sufferers comprised 35.7% and 13.4% of the group respectively. Migraineurs had the highest prevalence of nocturnal awakenings (P &lt; 0.001), abnormal movements (P=0.001) and breathing problems during sleep (P &lt; 0.001). Approximately half the migraineurs felt sleepy during the day (P&lt; 0.001) and spent around 1.17 hours in sleep during the day (P = 0.007). Similarly, values for frequency of nocturnal awakenings per week (P &lt; 0.001), wake time after sleep onset and offset (P &lt; 0.001 and 0.002 respectively) were the maximum in migraineurs. Only 32.8% migraineurs reported refreshing sleep (P&lt; 0.001). Post hoc analysis revealed that migraineurs were different from the other two groups on most of the parameters. Sleep disruption is more common in migraineurs than those in the tension type headache sufferers and the control group. ","2023":"The aim of this study is to present a comprehensive profile of clinical and psychosocial characteristics of children with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures and to assess the short-term outcome of these patients. The subjects were consecutive cases of children with a diagnosis of nonepileptic seizures (N=17, mean age = 10.7 years, S.D. = 1.26) and two groups of control groups matched on age and sex: true seizure group and healthy controls. All the children were recruited from the out-patient services of the Department of Pediatrics of a tertiary care teaching hospital in North India. Detailed history taking and clinical examination was done in the case of every child. A standard 18 channel EEG was done in all the children and a video EEG was done in 12 cases of children with nonepileptic seizures. The Childhood Psychopathology Measurement Schedule (CPMS) and Life Events Scale for Indian Children (LESIC) were used to measure the children's emotional and behavioral functioning at home, and the number of life events and the stress associated with these events in the preceding year and the year before that. Short-term outcome was examined three to six months after the diagnosis of nonepileptic seizures was made. Unresponsiveness without marked motor manifestations was the most common \"ictal\" characteristic of the nonepileptic seizures. Pelvic thrusting, upper and lower limb movements, head movements, and vocalization were observed in less than one-third of the patients. Increased psychosocial stress and significantly higher number of life events in the preceding year were found to characterize children with nonepileptic seizures, as compared to the two control groups. The nonepileptic seizures and true seizures groups had a higher proportion of children with psychopathology scores in the clinically significant maladjustment range, as compared to those in the healthy control group. A majority of the patients (82.4%) either recovered completely or had more than 50% reduction in the frequency of their symptoms, after three to six months of initiation of therapy. Psychosocial stress is common among children with nonepileptic seizures. Confirmatory diagnosis by video EEG, along with prompt psychosocial intervention, often results in a favorable outcome for most children with nonepileptic seizures. ","2024":"The aim of this paper is to trace the nucleotide alterations within the D-loop region of the mitochondrial DNA, affecting both the mtDNA ability to replicate and the transcription activity of the coding genes located in the H and L threads, in Caucasian patients with an ischemic and hemorrhagic brain strokes. The DNA from the peripheral blood of 85 patients with recent sustained ischemic and primary hemorrhagic brain stroke was analysed. The control group consisted of 24 volunteers. The genetic studies were conducted by the PCR method, with the application of the primers for the tRNA-treonine. In the blood samples examined, 3-striatal mtDNA patterns were detected. Pattern-1 is characterised by the C16126T substitution, pattern-2 by the G16319A substitution, and pattern-3 by the C16242T substitution. The frequency of occurrence for the particular mtDNA-1, -2, and -3 patterns, established for the group with an ischemic stroke (77.3, 15.2, and 7.6%), the group with a hemorrhagic stroke (0, 73.7, and 26.3%), and the control group (75, 0, and 25%), differs significantly. The exchange of the nucleotides within the D-loop region may affect both the mtDNA replication ability and the transcription activity of the coding genes located in the H and L threads. A hypothesis might be made. The G16319A mutation may result in the formation of lesions within the vascular wall. These lesions have a tendency to form microaneurysms or other defects, which, in turn, will decrease the strength of the vascular wall, making it more susceptible to ruptures. The G16319A substitution may be considered a factor that increases the risk of a hemorrhagic brain stroke.

Detailed study of the cases failed to indicate any specific etiology, thereby suggesting the diagnosis of idiopathic neuroretinitis. Although funduscopy showed marked inflammatory changes in the retina and optic nerve head, the recovery following medical treatment was remarkable. Familiarity with the fundus picture and awareness of the specific causes of neuroretinitis among neurologists and physicians may enable a prompt clinical diagnosis, avoidance of expensive brain imaging studies and early referral for appropriate and effective therapy.

The remaining patients made rapid and excellent recovery without any residual neurological sequelae. In these cases, the results of all routine investigations, i.e., serum chemistry, brain imaging (computed tomography in 2 and magnetic resonance imaging in 10) and electroencephalography were normal. The clinical clustering of these cases in winter months with similar presentations of reversible encephalopathy probably indicates an inhalational toxin exposure. Therefore, we postulate a hypothesis that harmful emissions consisting of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon gases (HC) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), produced by incomplete combustion of LPG might be responsible for the cellular injury and subsequent transient neurological deficits.

A prospective study (2003-05) on 800 adult migraine patients (International Classifications of Headache Disorders (ICHD), 2:1.1, 1.2.1 and 1.6.1) was conducted to document (a) sites of onset of pain and (b) location of pain during established attacks (in &gt;50% occasions) through semistructured interviews. DEMOGRAPHY: N = 800; M:F = 144:656 (1:4.56); age, 16-42 years (mean, 26 years); duration of migraine, 1-18 years (mean, 6.8 years). 87% of the subjects were ethnic Bengalis from the eastern Indian state of West Bengal, Calcutta being the capital city. MIGRAINE TYPES: (on the basis of &gt;50% headache spells): N = 800; 1.1:668 (83.5%); 1.2.1:18 (2.25%); 1.6.1:114 (14.25%). LOCATION OF PAIN AT ONSET: Unilateral onset was present in 41.38% of the patients; of these, 53.17% had eye pain; 8.16%, frontal pain and 38.67%, temporal pain. In 32.25% of the patients, bilateral\/central location of pain, mostly bitemporal or at vertex was noted. Cervico-occipital pain onset was noted in 26.43% patients (predominantly occipital, 14.68%; predominantly cervical, 11.75%). LOCATION OF ESTABLISHED HEADACHES: In 47.4% of the patients, with unilateral ocular or temporal onset, pain remained at the same site. Pain became hemicranial in 32.9%. In most patients, unilateral frontal onset pain (55.5%) became bilateral or holocranial. Most bilateral ocular (69.4%) and temporal onset (69.7%) pains remained at the same location. However, most bifrontal (55.6%) and vertex onset (56.9%) pains subsequently became holocranial. Most occipital pains at onset became holocranial (45.3%), but cervical pains subsequently became either hemicranial (38.3%) or holocranial (36.2%). This study documents location of pain at the onset and during established headaches in migraine patients largely from a specific ethnic group. Migraine with aura appears to be rare among ethnic Bengalis in eastern India. More than half had onset pain bilaterally\/centrally and in the cervico-occipital regions.

","2040":"Peripheral neuropathy refers to disorders of the peripheral nervous system. They have numerous causes and diverse presentations; hence, a systematic and logical approach is needed for cost-effective diagnosis, especially of treatable neuropathies. A detailed history of symptoms, family and occupational history should be obtained. General and systemic examinations provide valuable clues. Neurological examinations investigating sensory, motor and autonomic signs help to define the topography and nature of neuropathy. Large fiber neuropathy manifests with the loss of joint position and vibration sense and sensory ataxia, whereas small fiber neuropathy manifests with the impairment of pain, temperature and autonomic functions. Electrodiagnostic (EDx) tests include sensory, motor nerve conduction, F response, H reflex and needle electromyography (EMG). EDx helps in documenting the extent of sensory motor deficits, categorizing demyelinating (prolonged terminal latency, slowing of nerve conduction velocity, dispersion and conduction block) and axonal (marginal slowing of nerve conduction and small compound muscle or sensory action potential and dennervation on EMG). Uniform demyelinating features are suggestive of hereditary demyelination, whereas difference between nerves and segments of the same nerve favor acquired demyelination. Finally, neuropathy is classified into mononeuropathy commonly due to entrapment or trauma; mononeuropathy multiplex commonly due to leprosy and vasculitis; and polyneuropathy due to systemic, metabolic or toxic etiology. Laboratory investigations are carried out as indicated and specialized tests such as biochemical, immunological, genetic studies, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination and nerve biopsy are carried out in selected patients. Approximately 20% patients with neuropathy remain undiagnosed but the prognosis is not bad in them.","2041":"Developing regions of the world host the majority of elderly subjects who are at risk for dementia.

A fatalistic attitude regarding aging in the communities, significant heterogeneity in educational abilities and activities of daily living, high illiteracy among rural subjects, and lack of an organized health care system and updated demographic figures are some of the major factors that contribute to technical, namely, methodology-related problems and practical, namely, subject-related problems in such epidemiological studies. ","2042":"Neurological dysfunction is an important manifestation of inherited metabolic disorders. Although these are more common in childhood, adult onset forms with a different clinical presentation are often encountered. Recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of these conditions have substantially improved the outcome in many of these conditions. This makes it essential that the practicing physician be familiar with the clinical presentation and diagnosis of these disorders. For the evaluation of a patient with a possible inborn error of metabolism, simple screening tests may aid in the diagnosis and provide direction for more comprehensive laboratory analysis. In this review, we present a practical approach to diagnosis of neurometabolic disorders. Establishing a specific diagnosis in these disorders will enable the clinician in offering a definitive long-term treatment, prognosis and genetic counselling.","2043":"","2044":"","2045":"","2046":"","2047":"","2048":"Baller Gerold Syndrome (BGS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that is apparent at birth. The disorder is characterized by distinctive malformations of the skull and facial area and bones of the forearms and hands. We are reporting a new case of BGS in a 10-month-old female child born of an epileptic mother who was on sodium valproate during the initial months of pregnancy. The baby was born with premature closure of the metopic suture, unilateral radial aplasia with limb malformation and other congenital anomalies that conformed with the description of BGS. The parents and other family members were unaffected, karyotyping was normal and there was no history of consanguinity. Fetal valproate exposure has been previously reported as the cause of this fetal malformation syndrome, which is generally inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The peculiar pregnancy history and the supporting literature on the effects of valproic acid on the fetus exposed in utero to it with numerous case reports in the literature referring to BGS as a result of fetal exposure to valproate made us conclude that this is indeed a case of BGS secondary to valproate-induced teratogenesis.","2049":"The authors report a family from Punjab (India) with 10 members having benign familial neonatal convulsions (also known as benign familial neonatal seizures) in two generations. This disorder is quite rare. The clinical presentation of index case along with the findings of computed tomography of the brain and electroencephalograph is described. Important features of all the family members along with a brief review of the literature are also given.","2050":"The syndrome of central diabetes insipidus (cDI) and spastic cerebellar ataxia is rare with only a few reports in the literature. We report the case of a 21-year-old patient who was diagnosed to have central diabetes insipidus at the age of 7 years and presented to us at the age of 21 years with progressive spastic cerebellar ataxia that evolved over four years. His MRI showed normal hyperintense signal from the posterior pituitary. The persistence of posterior pituitary signal in patients with cDI is unusual and is observed in the familial variety of cDI, the possible etiology in our patient. A brief review of the literature on the rare syndromic association of cerebellar ataxia and cDI has been discussed.","2051":"Lipid peroxidation is an indicator of free radical metabolism and oxidative stress in human beings and other organisms. Malondialdehyde (MDA), an end product of lipid peroxidation, is a metabolite that can be readily estimated in serum samples. Excess oxidative stress may be a final common pathway through which anti epileptic drugs may exert their teratogenic potential in pregnant women with epilepsy. Our objective in this study was to ascertain the variations in malondialdehyde (MDA) in women with epilepsy. This study was carried out in the Kerala Registry of Epilepsy and pregnancy after obtaining clearance from the Institutional Ethics Committee. Informed consent was obtained from all the subjects. The quantitative examination of MDA was performed according to standard procedures. The ideal plasma level of MDA is below 2 nmol\/ml. Fifteen women with confirmed epilepsy (mean age 26.9 +\/- 3.5) were included in the study. Two women were pregnant. MDA levels ranged from 1.7 to 2.8 nmol\/ml (mean level = 2.13 +\/- 0.37 nmol\/ml). Eight women (53 %) had MDA levels above the upper limit of normal. Three patients had levels above 2.5 nmol\/ml, which corresponded to the 75 centile. This study had shown that the estimation of MDA levels in plasma is a convenient method to study lipid peroxidation and thereby oxidative stress in women with epilepsy. Over half of Women With Epilepsy (WWE) have excess oxidative stress as indicated by high levels of MDA in the plasma. Correlations between MDA level and characteristics of epilepsy, AED therapy, nutritional status and other medical conditions need to be observed in a larger cohort. ","2052":"Assessment of Quality of life (QoL) is fast assuming significance as the measure of health in many disorders. To correlate clinical severity and QoL in patients with Wilson's disease (WD). We evaluated patients of WD on regular follow up for at least two years and aged over 18 years using Neurological Symptom Score (NSS) for clinical severity and WHO-BREF for QoL at a university teaching hospital. Patients with inability to respond to the questionnaire due to behavioral problems, low IQ or other disease related factors were excluded. These 30 patients (M:F:: 23:7) had a mean age of 27.97 +\/- 11.16 years at evaluation and the mean duration of treatment of 9.2 +\/- 6.4 years. All four domains of WHO-QoL-BREF viz., Physical, Psychological, Social and Environmental correlated well with each other (p &lt; 0.01). The NSS correlated inversely with the physical domain (p &lt; 0.02), while the duration of treatment had a positive correlation with the physical domain (p &lt; 0.01). None of the other features of QoL showed any significant correlation with age, NSS or duration of treatment. QoL is complementary to formal neurological assessment and should be routinely incorporated in the evaluation of outcome of patients with WD and other chronic neurological disorders. ","2053":"To optimize the use of phenobarbital and\/or phenytoin as frontline drugs for treatment of childhood epilepsy. Before-and -after study. Epilepsy clinic at paediatric OPD, Sassoon General Hospital, Pune. Epilepsy is a condition in which seizures are triggered recurrently from within the brain. For epidemiological classification purpose epilepsy is considered to be present when two or more unprovoked seizures occur at an interval greater than twenty four hours apart. Seizures were classified as generalized and partial seizures, with underlying etiology investigated with EEG, CT scan in majority of the patients. Follow - up rate, seizure - control and antiepileptic drugs used among 151 children enrolled as on 31 March 2005 were compared with 106 children with new onset epilepsy enrolled as on February 2006. Eight children with breakthrough convulsion after a seizure free period of five to eighteen months were followed up after injection vitamin D. Nineteen children with poor control of seizures receiving polytherapy with newer antiepileptic drugs were assessed with frontline antiepileptic medication of phenobarbital and\/or phenytoin. Serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase were done in seventy two consecutive children with seizure disorder. During post protocol period good seizure control was achieved in 84.8% as against 80.7% and use of phenobarbital and\/or phenytoin increased to 65.11% from 22.87%. Of the 8 cases with breakthrough seizures seven remained seizure free after vitamin D administration and with no dose enhancement of AED medications of the nineteen. Children receiving polytherapy thirteen children could be successfully switched to phenobarbital and\/or phenytoin. Forty four (61%) children had hypocalcemia (less than 9 mg%), fifty seven (79%) children had raised alkaline phosphatase levels (more than 270 IU). Phenobarbital and\/or phenytoin have been found to be effective frontline AED. Periodic administration of vitamin D plays a supportive role. ","2054":"Assessment of Quality of Life in Epilepsy has currently been emphasized to provide comprehensive care to patients. To develop and standardize and assess the psychometric properties of Bengali version of QOLIE-10 and to assess the relationship of quality of life with seizure variables and presence of psychiatric morbidity. English QOLIE-10 was translated into Bengali by a translation committee using translation-re-translation technique. Inter-rater reliability between the English and Bengali version was assessed during initial practice session held amongst 20 bilingual patients. It was found that item 3 (related to driving) was reported to have difficulty in answering by all the patients as none drove any vehicle. Thus, this item was dropped. The inter-rater reliability of the resultant 9 item scale was found to be high (kappa = 0.9). One hundred and seven epilepsy patients attending the Epilepsy clinic were selected for the study if they met the following criteria: age &gt;15 years, duration of seizure &gt;1 year, regular intake of antiepileptic drugs, presence of informant and ability to read Bengali. For each patient, demographic and clinical data (seizure frequency, last seizure date, seizure type as per record, medicine intake history and records of past investigations such as EEG) was collected. Each patient were administered QOLIE-9 (Bengali) and SRQ-24 Bengali version to screen for psychiatric morbidity. The Cronbach's Alpha coefficient for QOLIE-9 was 0.81, which did not improve if any item was dropped. All items showed strong correlation with the total score. The instrument showed stable factor structure with three factors (Limitation, Depression, Illness effects). However, the item with regard to memory problem did not fit into any of the factors. The QOLIE-9 total showed a significant correlation with the seizure frequency (r = 0.76**). SRQ positive (i.e., suspected psychiatric morbidity) cases had higher QOLIE-9 score (thus, poorer quality of life) in comparison to non-psychiatric cases. Bengali QOLIE-9 is a valid and reliable instrument to assess the quality of life in patients suffering from epilepsy. ","2055":"Myotonic syndromes and periodic paralyses are rare disorders of skeletal muscle characterized mainly by muscle stiffness or episodic attacks of weakness. Familial forms are caused by mutation in genes coding for skeletal muscle voltage ionic channels. Familial periodic paralysis and nondystrophic myotonias are disorders of skeletal muscle excitability caused by mutations in genes coding for voltage-gated ion channels. These diseases are characterized by episodic failure of motor activity due to muscle weakness (paralysis) or stiffness (myotonia). Clinical studies have identified two forms of periodic paralyses: hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoKPP) and hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (hyperKPP), based on changes in serum potassium levels during the attacks, and three distinct forms of myotonias: paramyotonia congenita (PC), potassium-aggravated myotonia (PAM), and myotonia congenita (MC). PC and PAM have been linked to missense mutations in the SCN4A gene, which encodes alpha subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel, whereas MC is caused by mutations in the chloride channel gene (CLCN1). Exercise is known to trigger, aggravate, or relieve symptoms. Therefore, exercise can be used as a functional test in electromyography to improve the diagnosis of these muscle disorders. Abnormal changes in the compound muscle action potential can be disclosed using different exercise tests. Five electromyographic (EMG) patterns (I-V) that may be used in clinical practice as guides for molecular diagnosis are discussed.","2056":"This paper discusses the effects of curcumin on patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Curcumin (Turmeric), an ancient Indian herb used in curry powder, has been extensively studied in modern medicine and Indian systems of medicine for the treatment of various medical conditions, including cystic fibrosis, haemorrhoids, gastric ulcer, colon cancer, breast cancer, atherosclerosis, liver diseases and arthritis. It has been used in various types of treatments for dementia and traumatic brain injury. Curcumin also has a potential role in the prevention and treatment of AD. Curcumin as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and lipophilic action improves the cognitive functions in patients with AD. A growing body of evidence indicates that oxidative stress, free radicals, beta amyloid, cerebral deregulation caused by bio-metal toxicity and abnormal inflammatory reactions contribute to the key event in Alzheimer's disease pathology. Due to various effects of curcumin, such as decreased Beta-amyloid plaques, delayed degradation of neurons, metal-chelation, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and decreased microglia formation, the overall memory in patients with AD has improved. This paper reviews the various mechanisms of actions of curcumin in AD and pathology.","2057":"Human rabies still continues to be a significant health problem in India and other developing countries where dogs are the major vectors of transmission. Rabies in humans can present in two clinical forms, i.e., furious and paralytic. While diagnosis of furious rabies can be made based on the typical symptoms and signs, paralytic rabies poses a diagnostic dilemma to the neurologists who may encounter these cases in their practice. Although there are certain clinical features that distinguish this disease from other forms of Guillain-Barre syndromes, confirmation of diagnosis may require laboratory assistance. Conventional techniques such as antigen detection, antibody assays and virus isolation have limited success. The recently introduced molecular techniques show more promise in confirming the cases of paralytic rabies. There has not been much success in the treatment of confirmed rabies cases and recovery from rabies is extremely rare. Therefore, preventive measures of this dreaded disease after an exposure become extremely important. The present article reviews the current status of human rabies with regard to antemortem diagnosis, disease management and post-exposure prophylaxis.","2058":""},"articletitle":{"0":"Granulomatous Amebic Encephalitis Presenting Like a Tumor-Chasing a Diagnostic Conundrum.","1":"Impact of Disrupted Botulinum Toxin Therapy in Movement Disorders Due to COVID-19 Pandemic.","2":"A Neurocysticercosis Infestation Masquerading as Malignant Brain Tumour.","3":"Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in Nonagenarian: A Rare Presentation from India.","4":"Young Stroke and Systemic Manifestations: Deficiency of Adenosine Deaminase-2 (DADA-2).","5":"Impact of Levodopa in Lung Functions in Patients with Parkinson's Disease.","6":"Rescue Strategies in Anterior Circulation Stroke with Failed Mechanical Thrombectomy-A Retrospective Observational Study (RAFT).","7":"Clinical, Biochemical, Radiological, and Genetic Profile of Patients with Homocysteine Remethylation Pathway Defect and Spastic Paraplegia.","8":"Neurologic Manifestations of COVID 19 in Children: Prospective Study in a Single Center.","9":"CErebral Dysgenesis, Neuropathy, Ichthyosis, and Keratoderma (CEDNIK) Syndrome with Brain Stem Malformation.","10":"Effect of Different Wrist Positions on Median Nerve Conduction in Patients with and without Carpal Tunnel Syndrome -
