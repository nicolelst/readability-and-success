knowledge about cannabidiol (CBD) demonstrates that CBD is a substance that is not pharmacologically inert. If it does not act efficiently on cannabinoid receptors (those where tetrahydrocannabidol [THC] is fixed), it acts on brain receptors, especially on dopamine and serotonin receptors, making it a psychoactive product in its own right. Its consumption can thus have psychoactive effects, such as sedation and drowsiness for example. In humans, interactions between CBD and drugs such as anti-epileptics, anticoagulants, immunosuppressants or methadone, have been highlighted. Therefore, the drug treatment of patients with chronic diseases may be impacted because of the unknown interaction with CBD. In addition, a recent experimental study has shown that the use of CBD by vaping (e-cigarette) generated by pyrolysis, products containing THC; it could result in possible negative health consequences for the user in terms of clinical effects and\/or collateral effects (including on driving). Finally, therapeutic claims (outside of authorized drugs) that are purely speculative at this stage may divert users from proven management (stopping their drug treatment in favor of CBD or \"self-medication\"). All these data underline the importance of implementing measures related to the accessibility of CBD in order to avoid public health consequences and to better protect the users.","4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":"Two off-label use of ketamine are framed by recommendations: in intractable pain in palliative situations or in postoperative pain. Ketamine is used in hospital but can also be used outside hospital with dispensations by hospital pharmacy to outpatients. Few data are available on ketamine use outside hospital. In this context, the French Addictovigilance Network has set up a study with hospital pharmacies. This survey assesses ketamine dispensations from 1 January to 30 April 2019, for patients who have an administration of ketamine outside hospital. Sixty-five (65) hospital pharmacies have dispensed ketamine for 553 patients. Ketamine was indicated within non-palliative care in 86% of cases. Most of non-cancer pain were in fibromyalgia (44%) and neuropathic pain (29%). During the 4-month monitoring period, 1352 dispensations were analysed. The frequency of administration is daily in 91% of cases within palliative care whereas it is much more diverse within non-palliative care (33% daily, more than 15 different frequency in fibromyalgia). Within palliative care, ketamine is most administered intravenously or by Patient Controlled Analgesia or syringe pump (78% of cases) whereas in non-palliative care, ketamine is most used subcutaneously (44%), orally (32%) or both subcutaneously and orally (20%). A large number of ampoules could be dispensed (more than 30 ampoules for 10% of dispensations). These data highlighted that recommendation in pain are not respected because most of ketamine is used within non-palliative care context and it should be noted a great heterogeneity of practice. This study underlines the urgency of targeted and clear information on certain off-label uses of ketamine for which no robust clinical studies are available and for which the risk of health complications like psychiatric (addiction), urologic and hepatologic complications is proven. ","8":"Ten years after the launch of the Future Investment Program (Programme d'Investissement d'Avenir, PIA) and the implementation of these tools, one of Giens' roundtable workshop wanted to further explore the impact of PIA on health research and innovation with the aim of preparing action reports (bibliometrics, valuation, reputation) based on 2019 findings and the history of PIA deployment in relation to the healthcare sector; to analyze the development of the industrial sector vis-a-vis the PIA actions and to examine how the specific actions and the healthcare sector in general were able to duly articulate themselves, or, take form, given existing structures or organizations and contribute to site policies through Idex\/Isite.

PROMs are useful both as 1) a primary or secondary efficacy endpoints, and 2) a tolerability criterion to supplement vigilance data reported by clinicians. Measurement of PROMs must be subject to methodological rigor that is identical to that of other assessment criteria measured by an observer. Scales must be validated, suitable for the objective, and where possible specific to a disease. In addition to standard measures of quality of life, PROMs are taken into consideration in the assessments performed by the HAS, even if their impact on the conclusions is difficult to isolate, as assessments are multifactorial and take into account all data available with regard to the medical context. The CEPS will indirectly take into account PROMs in the fixing of the price or tariff only if they have contributed to the award of the ASA\/ASMR by the ad hoc committee of the HAS. The working group has formulated three recommendations which aim to further the implementation of patient-reported outcome measures: (1) Better information for all parties involved in a dossier for technology assessment, (2) Systematization of the collection of PROMs for evaluation of health products, (3) Improved quality of dossiers thanks to the use of relevant and validated tools.","13":"","14":"","15":"","16":"Over the past two decades, protein\/kinase inhibitors, as targeted therapies, raised in number and have become increasingly mainstream in the treatment of malignant diseases, thanks to the ease of oral administration and the minimal adverse drug reactions. These drugs have similar pharmacokinetic properties: a relatively good absorption and distribution, a strong hepatic metabolism, and a mainly biliary excretion. However, this pharmacokinetic and route of administration has the disadvantage of resulting in a large inter- and intra-individual variability. Despite this significant variability, these drugs are largely prescribed at the same initial dose for quite all patients (flat dose), even though this variability would require individualized adaptation for each patient and\/or each new circumstance. Promptly after their commercialization, scientific teams have performed concentration measurements of several drugs and showed the existence of efficacy or toxicity thresholds. This has contributed to the development of therapeutic drug monitoring as one of the strategies to improve the response and reduce the adverse reactions of these drugs. There is still a need to determine precise thresholds for the remaining drugs and to evaluate the impact of TDM in therapeutic management.

This paper explores the different factors that influenced public perceptions in France of the efficacy of HCQ as well as their evolution between April 2020 and June 2021. This article draws on 5 surveys conducted among representative samples of the French population (projects COCONEL and TRACTRUST; quota method, n=1006; 1004; 2006; 1014 and 1005). We asked questions on the effectiveness of chloroquine against COVID-19. We also collected sociodemographic variables and attitudes toward politics and science. Between April and June 2021, the proportion of respondents who believed in the efficacy of HCQ decreased rapidly from 35% to 14%. The proportion of respondents who believed that HCQ is ineffective rose gradually from 6% to 21%. After adjusting for the temporal effect, the logistic regression showed a very strong association between political orientation and the belief in the efficacy of HCQ. Respondents who felt closest to the more radical parties (far-right and far-left) were more likely to believe in the efficacy of HCQ than those who felt closest to the political center (O.R. 2.48 [1.95-3.15] and 1.87 [1.44-2.43]). The role of trust in the government and in science and of the degree of political engagement were investigated in the two waves conducted after the scientific consensus was established during the summer of 2020. High levels of trust in the government and in science and of politicization are associated with belief of HCQ proven inefficacy. Across the whole period, a majority of respondents were uncertain. Even in 2021, 41.5% stated that the data were insufficient to decide whether or not HCQ is effective and 25.2% stating that they did not know. Because media coverage of scientific controversies is higher in times of uncertainty than after these controversies have died down, the publicization of therapeutic promises can have lasting consequences on attitudes towards science and medicine.

An additional question also explores whether French PWUD preferred being provided with intranasal or intramuscular THN kits. Five hundred thirty-four (534) PWUD were provided a THN kits, but only 188 (35.2%) could be joined by phone. Of them, 26 (13.8%) did not remember being trained for and dispensed with a THN kit. Of the 160 PWUD interviewed, only six (3.7%) reported having used their kits because of an overdose, in three cases for themselves, and in three cases for someone else.

In parallel, post-marketing surveillance of anticancer drugs through pharmacoepidemiology has gradually developed. This paper provides (i) a detailed argumentation of the foundations for pharmacoepidemiology of anticancer drugs, (ii) an overview of pharmacoepidemiological studies currently available in this field, and (iii) some perspectives to improve pharmacoepidemiology for oncology practice. First of all, according to the existing literature, the development of pharmacoepidemiological studies for the clinical evaluation of anticancer drugs appears particularly justified based on common limitations of clinical trials in oncology regarding essential methodological principles such as adequate control groups, randomisation or double blinding. Many descriptive field cohort studies have investigated together treatment patterns, effectiveness, and safety to compare results from clinical trials with those of everyday practice. The utilisation of anticancer drugs has also been extensively described through cross-sectional or cohort studies by often using medico-administrative or medical databases. Such studies are useful to quantify and characterise use over time in the population, including clinically unvalidated use, and to evaluate adherence and persistence to increasingly available oral anticancer drugs. Despite their importance to increase knowledge, comparative effectiveness or safety studies remain uncommon. In a context of rapidly emerging therapies and personalised treatments, this may be due to methodological challenges especially related to the choice of a comparator or the consideration of confounding by indication. In the future, efforts must be pursued to provide real-time access to high-quality, large-scale clinical, biological and treatment data, and to improve record-linkage between hospital and outpatient databases. More research is also needed to better evaluate all medications, not only anticancer, as part of an overall cancer care pathway and to bring the evaluation of anticancer drugs closer to patients and society (social pharmacology).","37":null,"38":"The COVID-19 pandemic led to the deployment of an unprecedented academic and industrial research effort, the sometimes redundant nature of which is regrettable, as is the lack of both national and international management.

Adverse effects can be explained by direct interactions with their targets of interest, chosen for their indications (on-target) but also interactions with other targets (off-target). The adverse effect profiles of these drugs are therefore varied and it is possible to identify common profiles related to inhibitions of common targets. Identification of these targets has improved the global understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the onset of adverse drug reactions as well as of the related diseases, and makes it possible to predict the adverse effect profile of new protein kinase inhibitors based on their affinities.

As the peptides have many advantages, peptide-based therapeutics might be one of the possible ways in the development of COVID-19 specific drugs. SARS-CoV-2 enters into a human via its S protein by attaching with human hACE2 present on the cell membrane in the lungs and intestines of humans. hACE2 cleaves S protein into the S1 subunit for viral attachment and the S2 subunit for fusion with the host cell membrane. The fusion mechanism forms a six-helical bundle (6-HB) structure which finally fuses the viral envelope with the host cell membrane. hACE2 based peptides such as SBP1 and Spikeplug have shown their potential as antiviral agents. S protein-hACE2 interaction and the SARS-CoV-2 fusion machinery play a crucial part in human viral infection. It is evident that if these interactions could be blocked successfully and efficiently, it could be the way to find the drug for COVID-19. Several peptide-based inhibitors are potent inhibitors of S protein-hACE2 interaction. Similarly, the antiviral activity of the antimicrobial peptide, lactoferrin makes it an important candidate for the COVID-19 drug development process.

MR-induced treatment changes were compared according to the existence of high-risk medications at admission in study participants. Among the 92 study participants, 46 presented with high-risk medications at admission (median age 66 years, IQR 58-70) and 46 without such (median age 54 years, IQR 47-64). High risk-medications (HRM) existing at admission were antithrombotics (52.2%) and antipsychotics (22.4%). MR resulted in treatment changes in 37% of patients admitted with at-risk medications vs. 8.7% of those admitted without such (P=0.001). Overall, the mean number of treatment changes performed after MR was of 1 (95%CI 0.4-1.6) in patients with high-risk medication at admission and of 0.2 (95%CI 0-0.4) in patients without such. MR-induced treatment changes assessed as clinically major at least once by pharmacists or clinicians was greater in HRM group (43.5%) than in non-HRM group (31.6%). However, the consistency was low between clinicians and pharmacists, especially to distinguish the clinical importance of significant and minor interventions. Targeting high-risk medications at admission appeared efficient for the prioritization of MR in non-elderly patients hospitalised in internal medicine.

Amidst the COVID-19 turmoil, recent failures\/uncertain outcomes in clinical trials involving the anti-malarial (hydroxychloroquine), anti-viral (remdesivir) or the combination of anti-malarial\/antibiotic (hydroxychloroquine\/azithromycin) regimens have predisposed the physicians to distrust these \"highly-touted\" drugs for COVID-19. In this milieu, immunotherapy might be a credible modality to target or modify specific\/non-specific immune responses that interfere with the survival of intracellular pathogens. This scientific review throws light on the epidemiology of COVID-19, its pathogenesis and the current clinical scenario of immunotherapeutics including convalescent plasma (CP), type-1 interferons (IFN-I) and human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to combat COVID-19. The treatment outcomes underscore that immunotherapy might be a reliable tool to assuage COVID-19-associated immunopathology.

The most common infection types were abscesses (50%), skin and soft tissue infections (33%), bacteremia\/sepsis (20%), endocarditis (17%), and bone and joint infections (16%). Patients were mainly men (n=94; 80%), and the median age was 40 years [IQR25-75: 34-47]. Four deaths related to systemic infection were reported. The most frequent injected substances were cocaine, opioid maintenance treatments (OMT), and opioids. According to the multivariate analysis, factors associated with the occurrence of systemic infections were number of injection (OR 2.59 [1.07-6.27]; P=0.034) and injection of at least one opioid (OR 3.52 [1.28-9.72]; P=0.015).

These plans' implementation was part of the usual logic of post-marketing surveillance of new and innovative health products. It was especially adapted to the context of post-marketing monitoring of drugs developed according to the usual scientific quality standards but in an accelerated schedule. In Europe, the reinforced surveillance system relies on the complementary strengths of pharmacovigilance and pharmacoepidemiology. If the performances of pharmacovigilance monitoring are incomparable for the detection of safety signals relating to rare events of atypical presentation, it needs to be completed with pharmacoepidemiology activities for more common events, either multifactorial or frequently classified as idiopathic. The pharmacoepidemiological monitoring developed in Europe was elaborated before the first SARS-Cov-2 vaccines where marketed, taking into account the lessons learned from the vaccination campaign against 2009 A (H1N1) influenza. It includes numerous academic studies as well as studies performed within vaccines risk management plans. In terms of safety, those defined a priori mostly concerns a list of pre-established health events of specific interest. Aside of these planned activities, ad-hoc studies will be latter developed on purpose to investigate safety signals or potential signals that could be identified as the result of pharmacovigilance activities. Aside of these regulated activities, as for today, very few studies have been published regarding SARS-Cov-2 vaccines; most of the existing consist in preprints that should be considered with caution. Pharmacoepidemiology of vaccines is thought to allow near-real time monitoring that needs sufficient time to provide with valid results.

The pharmacological heterogeneity of antipsychotic drugs should allow a personalized drug prescription adapted to the different clinical picture of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a chronic disease, during which 3 stages of pharmacological intervention can be identified: the first episode psychotic (FEP), the phase of therapeutic stabilization that can progress to situations of resistance, and the question of long-term prescription. During FEP, the choice of the first antipsychotic treatment seems to be underpinned by its safety profile in relation to the patient for whom it is prescribed, according to the adage start low and go-slow. The therapeutic stabilization phase is based on treatment optimization through a rigorous evaluation of the benefits-harm balance, with the use of tools such as personalized therapeutic drug monitoring and pharmacogenetics. Generally speaking, while some antipsychotic drugs seem to present a more favorable efficacy profile in certain situations, the differences are small, whereas the differences in safety are more important and should be considered in the first line. Individual factors such as the presence of co-morbidities, as well as previously experienced treatments must also be taken into account. Finally, the question of maintaining the prescription of antipsychotic drugs over the long term arises in view of the iatrogenic risk with controversial current data. Overall, the personalized prescription of antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia remains limited by a lack of data in the literature, justifying the development of clinical studies in this field.

Among the 233 observations analyzed, nearly 62% involved abiraterone as a suspect drug and 38% involved enzalutamide; only 1 case involved both drugs. The ADRs profile is different between the drugs. Abiraterone is mostly associated with expected cardiac diseases (heart failure, and QT prolongation), expected with the drug. Also described, several cases of hepatotoxicity have been reported, however some cases with fatal outcome suggest that despite a follow-up of the liver function tests, it is difficult to anticipate this risk. Signals concerning acute renal failure and ischemic stroke have arisen. Enzalutamide is more particularly associated with various neurological disorders (convulsions, hallucinations, fatigue, and memory impairment) expected with the drug. While ischemic heart disease is also expected, signals of heart failure and atrial fibrillation have arisen. A potential hepatotoxicity of the molecule is discussed because of cases of cholestatic hepatitis.

By contrast, the neuroscience-based nomenclature (NbN) offers a clearer and more consistent rationale, according to which the main element of classification is based on the pharmacological mode of action of the medication. This review aims to display the different approved treatments used in SUDs, and to discuss the pros and cons of using this new conceptual framework in the field of addiction. According to the NbN classification, medications approved in the different SUDs can be classified in the different following categories: 1) nicotinic drugs; 2) GABAergic drugs; 3) opioid drugs; and 4) others. More specifically, medications can be distinguished between whether they mimic the same pharmacological action of the \"substance\" whose use should be stopped or reduced, or whether they target other more general pharmacological systems, that are supposed to be common to all SUDs, as they reflect the \"universal\" addiction process. The NbN offers obvious advantages, compared with previous classifications. In particular, it allows to no longer mix drugs with very different pharmacological targets under the same label. The main limitation of the NbN, when applied to psychopharmacology in general, and to SUDs medications in particular, is that drugs frequently have a \"dirty\" action, with multiple pharmacological targets. In this respect, it may be hard to classify drugs according to the NbN classification, without making the individual profile of each medicine more complex.","143":"The importance of clinical psychopharmacological knowledge for modern psychiatric care is both well-established and underdeveloped.

Although NPS are less consumed than established drugs, there has been a sharp increase in their use over the last few years, notably of synthetic cathinones, synthetic cannabinoids and, more recently, synthetic opioids. The latter in particular are involved in deaths in Europe. However, \"established\" drugs (MDMA [methylenedioxymethamphetamine], amphetamines, LSD, methamphetamine) are far from being dethroned by the more recent substances: they are considered \"a safe bet\" already \"tried and tested\" by many consumers over the years. MDMA, in particular, also known as ecstasy, which has been used as a recreational drug since the 1990s, saw its consumption decrease until 2010, and then increase again, especially in higher amounts; inexpensive and easily accessible, it is increasingly associated with emergency admissions or deaths in France. The perpetual appearance of new substances on the drug market is obligating to improve knowledge on these products, particularly by focusing on their analytical identification, and also by monitoring their use and harms.","173":null,"174":"","175":"","176":"The existence of borderline products between the status of a medicinal product and other less regulated products allows some products to have different statuses or even to change from one status to another. In order to quantify these changes, a review of medicines that have changed from drug status to other statuses (medical device, cosmetic product or food supplement) in France between 2010 and 2019 was performed. The lists of medicinal products with archived or revoked marketing authorization (MA) from the French National Authority's Register of Medicinal Products were analyzed in order to identify the medicinal products withdrawn from the market between January 1, 2010 and September 30, 2019 that could be considered as products with a \"potential for status change\". Then, we searched on the official websites of the MA holders and other firms, for a possible return to the market with a different status, marketed by the same firm (self-change of status) or a different firm (hetero-change of status). Out of a list of 206 drugs identified as \"with potential for status change\", we detected a total of 101 status changes, including 36 auto-changes and 65 hetero-changes. These changes mainly concern vitamin or herbal drugs later marketed as food supplements (30 cases of auto-changes and 60 cases of hetero-changes). There are also 6 cases of switching to cosmetic product and 5 cases of switching to medical device. The existence of no clear distinction between the different statuses of health products facilitates their status changes. The increasing shift from \"medicines\" to less regulated products, the trivialization of their use by the public and their increasing consumption make them a fundamental issue of social pharmacology, requiring to raise the awareness of consumers and health professionals.

The purpose of this study is to describe the characteristics and evolution of the prescriptions in geriatric hospital. The prescriptions of patients treated with DOACs in two university geriatric hospitals were analyzed retrospectively over 3 years. Co-treatment and hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications were studied. A total of 399 patients were included, including 10 in 2015, 110 in 2016 and 279 in 2017. The average age was 85 years old, 40% of patients had a weight of less than 60kg, and more than 50% had an estimated creatinine clearance of less than 50mL\/min. The most common indication was atrial fibrillation in 85%. In 32% of cases, the dosage of DOACs was not adapted to official recommendations. Underdosages accounted for approximately 60% of dosage errors. Twelve patients (3% of the cohort) had a thrombotic event under DOACs, associated with an underdosing in 50% of them. 41 patients, or 10% of the cohort, had a hemorrhagic event under DOACs, with 12 patients (29%) having a pharmacologic risk factor (10 overdoses and 2 drug interactions). The prescription of DOACs in elderly patients has increased considerably in recent years. However, dosing errors remain frequent (overdoses as underdoses), associated with hemorrhagic or thrombotic events. Similarly, drug interactions should be known as they are a risk factor for avoidable under- or overdose. Improving prescriptions of DOACs in geriatrics needs to respect the rules of good practice, to regularly reassess renal function, and to transmit observations of adverse effects to pharmacovigilance centers.

These consequences by the use of long-term PPIs may lead to significant vitamin (B12 and C) and mineral (iron, calcium and magnesium) deficiencies which needs gastric acid for their absorption and bioavailability. Long-term use of PPIs by the pregnant patients may impose a potential risk of congenital malformations. Various studies have recommended the life style modifications and antacid use as first choice among pregnant womens by preserving PPIs (omeprazole as a safe choice of PPI) for severe conditions of gastroesophageal reflux disease. The long-term acid suppression by PPIs can also lead to enteric, respiratory and urinary tract infections. The hypochlorhydria by chronic PPIs use may induce hypergastrinemia, which ultimately mediates the gastric polyps, gastric carcinoids and gastric cancer. The concomitant use of PPIs with antiplatelet drugs like clopidogrel can impose the patients to major adverse cardiac events. This review has enlisted the comprehensive information regarding the adverse effects induced by long-term use of PPIs and their possible relations. Considerable studies like case-control, randomized trials, cohort studies and meta-analysis were reported in supporting these adverse effects. The clinicians and patients should be cautious about these effects so that they can avoid the serious outcomes. PPIs should be avoided for long-term use mainly in older adults unless there is a proper indication.","182":null,"183":"Prophylaxis treatment is considered as the reference approach for children with severe haemophilia A or B.

The objective of this 16-year study (2001 to 2016) was to describe the clotting factor concentrates (CFCs) use in haemophiac outpatients. This is a retrospective monocentric study. Pharmaceutical and clinical data were captured using medical records. Main outcome measures are CFCs use and clinical data in paediatrics. Eighty haemophiliacs A or B under 12 years old with a factor level less than 2% were included (74% of HA), from pharmaceutical outpatient data. Global use of CFCs followed the evolution of the patients' number and regimen type introduced: increase of prophylaxis and decrease of on demand regimen. The average age at the prophylaxis introduction is significantly different according to the birth year. Prophylaxis introduction was made earlier with an increase of prophylactic regimen joined to an increase of CFCs use. The significant reduction of haemarthrosis in our cohort can be linked to a first infusion age and a prophylaxis introduction much earlier.","184":null,"185":null,"186":"Addictovigilance is a safety monitoring targeted at substances with potential for abuse and dependence.

This article aims to present the different steps implemented by the French Addictovigilance network in collaboration with the French Health authorities from March to May 2020, including monitoring of potential harmful events, and scientific communication. The first events were identified through the continuity of the networking between the French addictovigilance centres and their partners: community pharmacies, general practitioners, specialized structures and emergency wards. As soon as the lockdown began, first cases of overdoses (lethal or not) were reported with opioids, mainly with methadone, and other opioids (heroin, oxycodone, tramadol or antitussive codeine). Lockdown-related noteworthy events consisted in clinical cases or other relevant information for which lockdown clearly played an important role: among the many substances identified at least once, pregabalin, benzodiazepines, cannabis, cocaine and nitrous oxide were the most significant in terms of prevalence, seriousness or particularly specific to the lockdown context. Despite significant decrease in the activity and travel limited to vital needs, community pharmacies continued to identify falsified prescriptions in this period, highlighting an increase in suspicious requests for pregabalin, codeine and tramadol. In parallel, the French addictovigilance network continued its communications efforts in the period, issuing a newsletter on tramadol, a press release on methadone and naloxone, and participating in the COVID-19 frequently asked questions (FAQs) of the French Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutic website (https:\/\/sfpt-fr.org\/covid19).

Currently, psoriatic manifestations are not listed in the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) of CCBs. In this context, we aimed to investigate the association between psoriasis and CCB exposure. We reviewed spontaneous reports recorded in the French national pharmacovigilance database (FPVD) between 1985 and 2019. The association between CCB exposure and risk of psoriasis was assessed using the case\/non-case method. We also analyzed literature data. Ninety-four reports of psoriatic manifestations after CCB exposure were recorded in the FPVD. Both induction and exacerbation cases were observed. Time to onset was less than 2 years in 64% of reports and outcome was favorable in 71% of reports after CCB discontinuation. These features were concordant with those of literature reports. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) was 2.45 (95% CI 1.99-3.02). Concomitant use of betablockers or angiotensin II receptor blockers did not interact with the association between CCB exposure and psoriasis risk. The ROR for the stratum \"use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors\" (ACEI) was 2.14 (95% CI 1.29-3.55), while the ROR for the stratum ACEI non-use was 0.12 (95% CI 0.10-0.15). Large-scale epidemiologic studies were focused only on first diagnoses and did not include exacerbations; psoriasis risk was therefore probably underestimated. We found a statistically significant association between CCB exposure and psoriasis risk, which constitutes a safety signal. This risk is a class effect, time to onset is mostly less than 2 years and outcome is favorable after CCB discontinuation.

These very legitimate questions are directly the consequence of the recent recognition of the fundamental role of ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) in COVID-19 infection. Indeed, SARS COV2 utilizes ACE2 as a membrane receptor to enter target cells. Consequently, the putative impact of drugs modulating the renin-angiotensin system on the risk of developing severe or fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome in case of COVID-19 infection emerged. As a membrane-bound enzyme (carboxypeptidase), ACE2 inactivates angiotensin II and therefore physiologically counters its effects. Due to a different structure compared with ACE1, ACE2 is insensitive to ACEIs. In vitro, both ARBs and ACEi appear able to upregulate ACE2 tissue expression and activity but these results were not confirmed in Humans. The exact impact of both ARBs and ACEis on COVID-19 infection is definitively known and preliminary results are even in favor of a protective role confers by these drugs. Due to the crucial role of ACE2, some groups support the hypothesis that a modulation of ACE2 expression could represent a valuable therapeutic target could confer protective properties against inflammatory tissue damage in COVID-19 infection. So, studies are currently ongoing to test the impact of elevated ACE2 membrane expression, administration of ARB and infusion of soluble ACE2. In summary, based on the currently available evidences and as recommended by several medical societies, ACEi or ARB should not be systematically discontinued because to date no safety signal was raised with the use of these drugs.","201":"","202":"According to French guidelines on good pharmacovigilance practices, a pharmacovigilance survey is an assessment of the available drug safety data.

All the available data were retrieved by ANSM\/Regional Pharmacovigilance Centers (RPC) and assessed by a nominate RPC which provides a report for discussion during the monthly Committee between ANSM and the Regional Pharmacovigilance Network (RPN). A descriptive analysis of the minutes available on the ANSM website between 2016 and 2018 has been done: objective, data sources, duration of the survey, number of suspected adverse drug reactions, nature of the drugs and of the signals and recommendations for actions. Between 2016 and 2018, a total of 115 surveys were discussed concerning 135 drugs, mainly from the nervous system according to the anatomic therapeutic chemical classification (n=31, 27%). They involved a whole pharmacological class for 18 ones. The main objective of the 115 surveys was to provide a strenghtened monitoring for some drugs (72%) or to validate one or more than one signal (28%).

The results of the first clinical studies evaluating the effect of hydroxychloroquine do not support any efficacy of this drug in patients with COVID-19, due to major methodological weaknesses. Yet, these preliminary studies have aroused considerable media interest, raising fears of massive and uncontrolled use. In the absence of evidence of clinical benefits, the main risk is of exposing patients unnecessarily to the well-known adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine, with a possibly increased risk in the specific setting of COVID-19. In addition, widespread use outside of any recommendation risks compromising the completion of good quality clinical trials. The chloroquine hype, fueled by low-quality studies and media announcements, has yielded to the implementation of more than 150 studies worldwide. This represents a waste of resources and a loss of opportunity for other drugs to be properly evaluated. In the context of emergency, rigorous trials are more than ever needed in order to have, as soon as possible, reliable data on drugs that are possibly effective against the disease.

The case report concerns a 22-year-old patient with perfect pitch with untreated left temporal partial epilepsy. Following a generalized seizure, the introduction of CBZ prolonged release (200mg twice a day) is decided. As soon as CBZ is introduced, the patient notices a change in pitch perception, about a semitone lower. This adverse effect persisted despite a gradual decrease in doses. The patient reported a total recovery of his perfect pitch when CBZ stopped completely 11 years later. In the French pharmacovigilance database, only one other case of pitch perception modification under CBZ was recorded (no cases were found with oxcarbazepine, lacosamide, sodium valproate, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, ethosuximide, vigabatrine, felbamate, gabapentin, tiagabine and topiramate).

This collaboration leads to highlight more and more drug-induced rare diseases. Through several historical examples (eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome due to L-tryptophan, type 1 narcolepsy with H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine, capillary leak syndrome, acquired von Willebrand syndrome), it remains clear that pharmacovigilance is the cornerstone of the alert system. Clinicians from the rare disease reference centres can easily report adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to pharmacologists from their regional pharmacovigilance centre. Through experience, collaboration between countries, large database, and sometimes pharmacoepidemiological studies, an alert can then be raised. This collaboration underlines also similarities between the two disciplines, through the frequency of ADRs and diseases, the difficulty of the diagnosis in front of scarce data, and through the unusual worsening symptoms. Patients and associations of patients play also a proactive role as research partners at different steps, to quantify and qualify symptoms and ADRs, and also to develop orphan drugs. These several collaborations are a precious tool to improve patients' outcomes. These close contacts between the different actors are important to make earlier diagnosis of rare diseases and severe ADRs. Rare disease does not have to mean overlooked diseases.","244":"There are few areas in medicine in which patient-parent advocacy groups play such a central and prominent role as in the field of rare diseases. As illustrated by the French Association of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (LMC France), its contribution is not only focused on its role as participants or key informant related to clinical studies but also on drug information and drug safety. The discovery of tyrosine kinase inhibitors against the BCR-ABL1 oncogenic fusion protein has revolutionized the management of CML, becoming a chronic illness rather than a life-threatening disease. Because ensuring ongoing well-being requires some knowledge, LMC France has built, in synergy with healthcare professionals from its scientific council, a CML-specific, patient-friendly knowledge base including resources and knowledge related to drug information (drug development, generics, pharmacovigilance) and drug safety using several educational tools such as videos, CML support, and CML drug sheets. To disseminate more largely, an e-university learning for regional key informants from LMC France and also CML patients and their caregivers was launched, including a large resources related to drug information and drug safety in synergy with hematologists and clinical pharmacologists.","245":"","246":"","247":"Single-arm studies are sometimes used as pivotal studies but they have methodological limitations which prevent them from obtaining the high level of reliability as for a randomised controlled study which remains the gold standard in the evaluation of new treatments. The objective of this roundtable was to discuss the limitations of these single-arm studies, to analyse available and acceptable solutions in order to propose guidelines for their conduct and assessment. Single-arm studies themselves are intrinsically inappropriate for demonstrating the benefit of a new treatment because it is impossible to infer the benefit from a value obtained under treatment without knowing what it would have been in the absence of the new treatment. The implication is that comparison with other data is necessary. However this comparison has limitations due to (1) the post hoc choice of the reference used for comparison, (2) the confusion bias for which an adjustment approach is imperative and, (3) the other biases, measure and attrition among others. When these limitations are taken into account this should, first and foremost, lead to the conduct of externally controlled trials instead of single-arm trials as is proposed by the latest version of ICH E10. Moreover, the external control must be formalised in the study protocol with a priori selection of both the reference control and the formal method of comparison: test in relation to a standard, adjustment on individual data, a synthetic control group or matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAIC). Lastly, externally controlled studies must be restricted to situations where randomisation is infeasible. To be acceptable, these studies must be able to guarantee freedom from residual confusion bias, which is only truly acceptable if the observed effect is dramatic and the usual course of the disease is highly predicable.","248":null,"249":"Medical telemonitoring could be a significant lever for improving access to care and the cost-effectiveness of patient management, particularly for chronic conditions, by reducing hospital admissions. It also appears to be an opportunity to redesign the healthcare pathway and its organisation in a way that is suited to the demographic, economic, and technical challenges that our healthcare system must address. In order to prepare for the future of socialised financing of telemonitoring at the end of the ETAPES programme, participants at the round table worked on nine recommendations, based on an analysis of international literature and the French healthcare system. The main stance endorsed is the implementation of a fixed rate fee associated with the creation of generic guidelines for the diseases currently involved in the ETAPES trials. Similarly, the implementation of an evaluation that is appropriate for telemonitoring devices and of incentives for quality of care seems necessary for the sustainable deployment of telemonitoring in France. Further studies will be required in addition to the points discussed by the round table in order to delve deeper into certain topics, such as therapeutic support for patients.","250":"","251":"","252":"","253":null,"254":"","255":"The rising emergence of bacterial resistances has led to a crisis which threatens human, animal and environmental health.

Moreover, it is necessary to develop tools\/indicators to define effective interventions against antibiotic resistance. The work of the think-tank reported in this article concentrated on two aspects of translational research: - prevention and the impact on health of the antibiotic resistance issue, and - the specific requirements of clinical research leading to innovation in the fight against antibiotic resistance.

Therefore, the aim of the roundtable discussion was to optimize the interface between those businesses and institutions. Several institutions have successfully implemented teams and procedures which aim to facilitate this interface, with regard to assessments of technology, services provided, the transfer of biological material, R&amp;D collaboration, and licensing agreements. However, there is still a notable absence of entrepreneurial culture among hospital and academic research practitioners; their training regarding innovation remains insufficient and business-related value-creation is non-existent in their career evolution. Pharmaceutical companies, and particularly startups, often lack knowledge about hospital environments and their constraints. As a result, the recommendations of the roundtable participants are as follows: (1) promote reciprocal acculturation between public health institutions and startups through multidisciplinary training in innovation, promoting project development and staff recognition within the institution, and improving pharmaceutical companies' understanding regarding the health care system; (2) provide those involved with means and resources dedicated to innovation by reserving time for innovation at work, securing the status of the staff involved, and aiding in the search for funding; (3) develop and use standard methodologies and tools; and (4) co-design and co-construct innovative health solutions, encouraging the emergence of participatory and interdisciplinary creative spaces. All of these recommendations should help to make the interface between startups\/companies and public health institutions more fluid and attractive for those in the health sector.","258":null,"259":"It has become a major challenge not only to retain but also to attract medical professionals to a career in the healthcare products field whether in the public or private sector. There is no denying that France has a shortage of doctors qualified to work in these fields and that public or private organisations alike are experiencing great difficulty in filling vacancies. Unlike elsewhere in Europe, and with the exception of complex pathways imposed on university hospital professors, French training courses do not really provide doctors with specialised training in healthcare products. Many and varied careers nevertheless do exist. However, these careers are not sufficiently visible to future doctors or to the general public. A more dedicated specialist curriculum is called for to meet the many needs of public institutions and private companies. Any such curriculum should be underpinned by solid initial clinical training as an indispensable foundation regardless of future career path. To improve visibility, specialty training in Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics must be set up with the support and assistance of the various national bodies. Against a backdrop of activities with a largely globalised reach, the availability in France of healthcare product specialists is key to maintaining national control of activities that exert a significant impact on the economy and on public health.","260":"","261":null,"262":"","263":"","264":"We report cases, registered in the French national pharmacovigilance database, of fetal death and intrauterine growth retardation in women exposed to triptans during pregnancy.

In the absence of more specific information sources, these have resulted in the discovery of many new adverse reactions, altering drug information. It has led to the withdrawal from the market of many drugs, but its use for risk quantification remains fraught with uncertainty. The recent access to population-wide claims or electronic health records databases have confirmed for spontaneous reporting a predominant role in hypothesis generation for serious adverse drug reactions, notably those that result in hospital admission or death. In these cases, the events are identifiable at the population level, and can be quantified precisely using the tools of modern pharmacoepidemiology, to generate specific benefit-risk analyses.

The study reported 580 calls for 590 ME and 583 patients. ME mostly affected the ambulatory\/domicile sector (76%), the medico-social sector (14%) and the healthcare facilities sector (7%). It usually was about dose errors, medication errors and patient errors with a different profile in each sector. The majority of errors (85%) occurred at the administration step.

In the future, the implementation of responsive international networks may be the keystones of drug evaluation in pregnancy.","325":"In psychiatry, drug evaluation using pharmacoepidemiological methods has been of growing interest in recent decades. Studies based on observational databases are particularly useful for psychotropic drugs due to their important prevalence in populations, and their use over long period. The authors discussed the specific interest of pharmacoepidemiological studies in the field of psychiatry through two examples: first, the use of antidepressants, and, second, the risks associated with antipsychotics.","326":null,"327":null,"328":"New regulations have come into force in Europe and the US establishing the pediatric development as an integral part of the early development of medicinal products. Parallel to the advances in pediatric clinical research, it became obvious that all available sources and research tools to gather valuable information for the safe and efficacious prescription of medicines in children should be used. Real-life, pharmacoepidemiological studies provide information that contribute to the better knowledge of drug utilization, effects and safety in the pediatric population and thereby, a better prescribing in children. In this paper, we suggest some possible applications, provide examples of impact of pharmacoepidemiological and pharmacovigilance studies and expose future perspectives in pediatric pharmacoepidemiology.","329":"Case-non-case studies are among the methods used to assess drug safety by analyzing the disproportionality of adverse drug reaction reports in pharmacovigilance databases. First used in the 1980s, the last few decades have seen a significant increase in the use of this study design. The principle of case-non-case studies is to compare the drug exposure of cases of an adverse reaction of interest with that of cases with other reported reactions and called \"non-cases\". Their results are presented in the form of reporting odds ratio (ROR), the interpretation of which makes it possible to highlight pharmacovigilance signals. This article describes the principle of case-non-case studies, the calculation method of the ROR and its confidence interval, the different analytical modalities and how to interpret its results with regard to the advantages and limitations of this type of study.","330":"Knowledge of the benefit\/risk ratio of drugs in older adults is essential to optimise medication use. While randomised controlled trials are fundamental to the process of drug development and bringing new drugs to the market, they often exclude older adults, especially those suffering from frailty, multimorbidity and\/or receiving polypharmacy. Therefore, it is generally unknown whether the benefits and harms of drugs established through pre-marketing clinical trials are translatable to the real-word population of older adults. Pharmacoepidemiology can provide real-world data on drug utilisation and drug effects in older people with multiple comorbidities and polypharmacy and can greatly contribute towards the goal of high quality use of drugs and well-being in older adults. A wide variety of pharmacoepidemiology studies can be used and exciting progress is being made with the use of novel and advanced statistical methods to improve the robustness of data. Coordinated and strategic initiatives are required internationally in order for this field to reach its full potential of optimising drug use in older adults so as to improve health care outcomes.","331":null,"332":"","333":"","334":null,"335":"The evaluation of the real-life benefits and risks of statins in population is a major pharmacoepidemiological issue, given their widespread use for cardiovascular prevention. The purpose of this review was not to be exhaustive but to show the contributions of pharmacoepidemiology for various aspects of the evaluation of statins such as real-life drug use, effectiveness and risk. Statins are among the most used drugs in the world, but recent data show a slight decrease in use. Actual statin users are older, and have more comorbidities than those studied in clinical trials, but this does not seem to compromise their effectiveness, unlike the compliance issues that are common with these drugs. Beyond the known adverse reactions of statins from the clinical trials, risks of statins can be varied and sometimes difficult to evaluate, considering the ubiquity of cholesterol throughout the body, from drug or endogenous molecule metabolism to the construction of cell membranes or cell activities.","336":null,"337":"Artificial intelligence (AI), beyond the concrete applications that have already become part of our daily lives, makes it possible to process numerous and heterogeneous data and knowledge, and to understand potentially complex and abstract rules in a manner human intelligence can but without human intervention. AI combines two properties, self-learning by the successive and repetitive processing of data as well as the capacity to adapt, that is to say the possibility for a scripted program to deal with multiple situations likely to vary over time. Roundtable experts confirmed the potential contribution and theoretical benefit of AI in clinical research and in improving the efficiency of patient care. Experts also measured, as is the case for any new process that people need to get accustomed to, its impact on practices and mindset. To maximize the benefits of AI, four critical points have been identified. The careful consideration of these four points conditions the technical integration and the appropriation by all actors of the life science spectrum: researchers, regulators, drug developers, care establishments, medical practitioners and, above all, patients and the civil society. 1st critical point: produce tangible demonstrations of the contributions of AI in clinical research by quantifying its benefits. 2nd critical point: build trust to foster dissemination and acceptability of AI in healthcare thanks to an adapted regulatory framework. 3rd critical point: ensure the availability of technical skills, which implies an investment in training, the attractiveness of the health sector relative to tech-heavy sectors and the development of ergonomic data collection tools for all health operators. 4th critical point: organize a system of governance for a distributed and secure model at the national level to aggregate the information and services existing at the local level. Thirty-seven concrete recommendations have been formulated which should pave the way for a widespread adoption of AI in clinical research. In this context, the French \"Health data hub\" initiative constitutes an ideal opportunity.","338":"","339":"","340":"Article 51 of the French social security financing act for 2018 creates a derogatory funding system to support experimentation with new ways of organizing care pathways.

In order to sustain this dynamic movement and favor the success of these experimental projects, our work focused on clarifying the roles and responsibilities of project leaders and the need for a specific evaluation system that takes into account the evolving nature of these projects and the need for operational adaptability. We propose three levels of evaluation (feasibility, intermediary results and impact assessment) needed to decide on generalizing a given experiment based on its intermediary results, or on the contrary, terminating projects not meeting feasibility expectations.

With the ageing population in the West countries, and the consequent increase in the frequency of thrombogenic heart diseases oral anticoagulants represent a not insignificant portion of drug consumption. Over the past few years, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been marketed because they are easier to use than vitamine K antagonists (VKAs). The introduction of these drugs has raised two main issues: (1) progress of the switch from VKAs to DOACs; (2) the comparison of adverse drug reactions (primarily hemorrhagic) on DOACs compared to indirect oral anticoagulants (IOAs). This article is confined to discussing oral anticoagulants, focusing on the two issues outlined above, and the potential answers that may be found in pharmacoepidemiology studies.","342":"Antibiotics (ABs) exposure of population is known as the main driving force for the emergence and spread of bacterial resistance in the community. Pharmacoepidemiology is the study of interactions between drugs and human populations, investigating, in real conditions of life, benefits, risks and use of drugs. Thus, pharmacoepidemiology is particularly of interest to monitor ABs use in both hospital and community settings. This can help to better understanding determinants of ABs use and to evaluate their impact. ABs use can also be a marker of an infection, which can be an ADR of other drugs.

A roundtable was organized in Giens, France in October 2018 to identify problem areas, the need for clarification and streamlining, and to make recommendations to promote clinical research while ensuring a high level of patient protection. After details were given about these developments, the roundtable participants were able to propose recommendations, primarily (1) to clarify: what is considered anonymized data, and what is \"public interest\" within the meaning of the GDPR; (2) for the French data protection authority (CNIL) to continue preparing reference methodologies to simplify the approval system; (3) to promote the secondary use of data by making it easier to inform patients and obtain broad patient consent, by specifying the circumstances under which their withdrawal and opposition rights apply, so as to limit the risk of bias; (4) to facilitate access to data warehouses by providing technological and methodological aids. The roundtable also recommends increasing discussions between authorities in Europe on research topics, encouraging French authorities to contribute to the preparation of codes of conduct and setting up a voluntary harmonization procedure to coordinate the opinions of data protection authorities, while ensuring that key documents are available in English.","347":"Fifteen years after the completion of first human genome sequencing, the technique is almost a commodity but there is still little evidence of its usefulness as a diagnostic, prognostic or therapeutic tool. In France, the France genomics plan 2025 was launched in 2015 with the goal of integrating genomic tests into clinical practice and developing a National genomics network including industrial partnerships. Reflection on scientific applications and operational or societal issues is needed to make recommendations to help better associate Genomics and the medicine of tomorrow. In the perspective of personalized Evidence-based Medicine, studies with an appropriate methodological level to improve the definition of evidence should be promoted. The many operational challenges require the implementation of organisations and means to streamline the process of results reporting, and regulatory adaptations concerning the status of professions involved, the management of data generated, and the consent of patients. In parallel, genetic training for healthcare professionals and raising awareness on genetic tests for the public should be considered. The ethical stake should also be taken into account, especially on the participation of the patient in decisions concerning them and integrating the notion of uncertainty into the information given. The sociological effects on the experience and expectations of patients and the general population towards genomic medicine should also be evaluated to improve information, prevention and support for people. Finally, medico-economic studies must be conducted to inform policy-makers on the cost-effectiveness of complete genome sequencing for population health.","348":"","349":"","350":"","351":"","352":"The European regulation governing the placing on the market of medical devices (MD) provides for the gradual and mandatory phasing-in, within the European Union, of a unique device identification (UDI) system and a European database (EUDAMED) aimed at improving traceability and transparency of the market. The deployment of these tools will have a significant impact on the stakeholders of the medical device world (companies, health institutions, healthcare professionals, competent authorities, etc.). A strengths\/weaknesses\/opportunities\/threats (SWOT) analysis conducted among the think tank participants shows real support for the objectives but also distinguishes a great deal of issues relating to the implementation of these tools. An inventory of the current traceability tools and databases used in France was then carried out to measure the gaps between the requirements of the European regulation and the current situation revealing that EUDAMED and the UDI system will ultimately have to slot into a complex and poorly interoperable ecosystem. An essential first step to facilitate this integration will be to increase the number of educational, awareness-raising and information initiatives for the stakeholders concerned.

We will conclude on the respective place of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational approaches, which are obviously complementary, but not interchangeable.","356":null,"357":"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are reversible inhibitors of cyclo-oxygenase (COX), mainly used for the symptomatic relief of pain, whether traumatic, infectious, episodic or rheumatologic. Use for the long-term relief of inflammation is waning with the emergence of specific biotherapies. Their effects are related to potency, dosage, and pharmacokinetic or galenic considerations. Adverse reactions are mostly related to COX inhibition, and to the relative COX1 and COX2 inhibition. Over the years have resulted in the withdrawal of some NSAIDs. The most common adverse reactions are: gastrointestinal (COX1) which have declined over time with the emergence of more COX1 sparing drugs and gastroprotection; renal, with an impact on renal function and sodium extraction that is associated with hypertension, heart failure exacerbation, and stress-related renal failure; allergic skin reactions; increased transaminases and acute liver injury which may be idiosyncratic or immunoallergic; increased risk of acute coronary syndromes, initially associated with high-dose long-term use of COX2 specific inhibitors in controlled clinical trials, though more recently there have been indications from poorly controlled observational studies that they could occur with most NSAIDs. Event rates in patients with no overt coronary heart disease are vanishingly low, and the real magnitude of the issue in the treatment of common pain is still unknown. Considering their purely symptomatic effects, they should be used at the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible time, based on the symptomatic relief of pain or fever.","358":"To identify criteria used by French health authorities to assess the clinical added value (ASMR) of drugs seeking reimbursement. We conducted a systematic review of the opinions of the transparency committee (TC) of the French national authority for health (HAS) between March, 2014 and October, 2016 in ten therapeutic areas. TC opinions content was coded and analysed using descriptive statistics and logistic models. The database comprised 160 opinion texts, which included ASMR assessments using a 5 level scale (1=highest ASMR 5=no ASMR). Main elements that were linked with ASMR 1,2,3,4 as compared to ASMR 5 were appraisal of the medical need, population size (&lt;5000 patients), and clinical relevance of the evaluated results. The factors associated with ASMR 4 as compared to ASMR 1-3 were the safety profile and clinical relevance of the results. However, the factors associated with ASMR level varied according to the therapeutic area considered. The assessment of the drug ASMR conducted by the French transparency commission of the HAS appears to be at least in part determined by criteria (medical need, population size) which reflect the burden of the disease but not reflect the ASMR of the medicine assessed. Other criteria used for the assessment of ASMR are not clearly defined and depend on the therapeutic domain. The lack of sufficient clarity and consistency in assessment of ASMR complicate the decision making process for drug development. Moreover, this situation can be a barrier for a harmonized process of ASMR assessment at European level.

This advent of pharmacoepidemiology resulted from a long period where the actual target of medicines, i.e., patients in real-life settings, was not considered, the truth being provided solely by pre-approval or peri-approval clinical trials. The methodological advances made during the last three decades are unprecedented.

However, the reporting of cases of abuse\/dependence is insufficient. In an attempt to overcome this under-reporting, data from the medical information systems program (PMSI) is regularly used to identify cases. Since addictions are frequently associated with psychiatric comorbidities, a pilot study was conducted for the first time in a psychiatric hospital. It aims, through a PMSI request, to identify the sociodemographic characteristics and psychiatric diagnoses of patients consuming psychoactive substances (PAS) and the PAS types consumed. This is a retrospective observational study conducted over a nine-month period at the psychotherapeutic center of Nancy (CPN). The codes used for the PMSI request are those of the international classification of diseases, tenth revision (ICD-10), codes F10 to F19 that characterize mental and behavioral disorders associated with the use of PAS. Cases presenting the four criteria necessary for an addictovigilance notification: (1) identified notifier, (2) identified patient, (3) known consumed product (s) and (4) presence of an effect related to the abuse\/dependence of PAS; were retained and analyzed. On an initial number of 252 cases, 82 cases of abuse\/dependence were retained. The selected sample is predominantly male (67%). Cannabis (29%) and heroin (15%) are the most common illicit PAS. Regarding drugs, the consumption of benzodiazepines, a predominantly female phenomenon, is observed in 34% of subjects. Sixty-four per cent of the subjects were diagnosed \"disorders related to the use of PAS\", 14% as neurotic disorders, 9% as schizophrenia and 5% as of the mood disorders.

Fifteen studies found a statistically significant association with a deleterious effect, two a protective effect and eight did not find any association. The most recent studies using a longer delay to take into account a protopathic bias did not find any association or any dose-effect relationship. The majority of studies suggest impaired cognitive functions for contemporary consumption or those closest to the event being studied. Finally, the biological plausibility remains discussed.

We hypothesized that polymorphisms in the transforming growth factor-beta 1 gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with anti-tuberculosis drug-induced liver injury (ATLI). In a prospective study, 280 newly diagnosed tuberculosis patients were followed up for three months after initiating anti-tuberculosis therapy. Tag-SNPs of transforming growth factor-beta 1 were genotyped with the MassARRAY platform. The associations between SNPs and ATLI were analyzed by logistic regression analysis adjusting for confounding factors. Of the 280 patients recruited in this study, 33 were excluded during the three months of follow-up, and 24 were diagnosed with ATLI and were considered as the ATLI group. The remaining 223 subjects without ATLI were considered as the non-ATLI group. After correction for potential confounding factors using a multivariate logistic regression analysis, we found that the frequencies of polymorphisms and haplotypes of transforming growth factor-beta 1 were similar in patients with ATLI and without ATLI.

Between 2004 and 2013, 3397 cases of hyponatremia were. All antidepressants were associated with hyponatremia among these cases, with the exception of: milnacipran, amoxapine, dosulepine, doxepine, trimipramine, iproniazide. The effect was predominant for the class of selective inhibitors of serotonin reuptake (SSRIs), inhibitors of serotonin reuptake and noradrenaline (SNRIs) and other antidepressants; it seemed more doubtful for tricyclic and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Contrary to the literature, we found an association between hyponatremia and exposure to agomelatine (ROR=4.1, 95% CI [2.2 to 7.7]), mianserine (ROR=2.7, 95% CI [2.0 to 3.7]) and tianeptine (ROR=6.1, 95% CI [4.7 to 7.9]).

Several scales, developed from biological and\/or clinical criteria, allow to classify anticholinergic drugs according to their atropinic potency and to assign to them an atropinic burden. Total atropinic burden of patient drug exposure can be calculated as the sum of atropinic score of each drug. Other tools include drug daily doses to better estimate the atropinic risk. These different methods are a precious help to decrease atropinic exposure in the elderly.

The prevalence of pharmaceutical cognitive doping among students has been reported from 1.3% to 33% across studies, with variations depending on country and definition of pharmaceutical cognitive doping. The therapeutic classes most frequently cited as being diverted for doping purposes are psychostimulants and nootropics (methylphenidate, modafinil, piracetam), corticosteroids, sedative drugs and beta-blockers. Some illegal substances such as cannabis, amphetamines and cocaine are also consumed in order to boost mental function. Finally, over-the-counter products, such as caffeine-based tablets or energy drinks, or alcohol, are also widely used by students whose motivations involve enhanced performance, concentration, memory, and staying awake during the revision and exam period. However, the expected (often fantasized) effectiveness of these products does not correspond to the reality of a modest controversial impact on cognitive performance. There appears to be an emerging profile of the student more inclined to doping behavior. Cognitive doping thus raises the question of its regulation, opening a debate opposing, on one hand, individual freedom and supposed collective benefits and, on the other hand, health consequences, educational (in)equality, and the risk of tarnished academic success.

Population approaches to define pharmacokinetics and pharmacokinetic\/pharmacodynamics are now more currently used to define dosing regimens, adapted to the different paediatric and neonatal age groups, that allow to increase efficacy and reduce toxicity, by taking into account factors explaining variability in drug response.

This is due to the specific constraints of paediatric clinical research leading to a lack of safety and efficacy data in children. Extrapolation frameworks for drug development have been proposed by several regulatory agencies. Using a meta-epidemiological approach, we explored the similarities and differences of the benefit, the benefit risk ratio and the perceived placebo effect between adults and children from meta-analyses including randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trials evaluating a drug intervention in an indication in adults and children with separate data for both populations. We also explored the use of the effect model using adult data to predict the treatment effect in children and to calibrate future paediatric clinical trials. Our research highlights the importance of using all available evidence and quantitative methods before extrapolating the benefit risk ratio from adults to children and carrying out new studies in the context of the existing evidence.

At the time of marketing a medicinal product intended for children, the product's safety profile is sometimes less well known than for adults due to fewer or small sample clinical trials. Furthermore, the frequent off-labeled drug use, the use of unsuitable dosage forms and the need for continuous dose adjustments increase the risk of medication errors and thus lead to avoidable adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The occurrence of child-specific ADRs (such as growth disorders) or ADRs more commonly occurring in children than in adults make it necessary to monitor the safety of child-specific drugs. Pediatric pharmacovigilance includes also the consequences of in utero exposure, whether manifestations are present from birth or occur in early childhood (such as neurodevelopmental disorders). The incidence of ADRs varies with age, setting of medical care (in- or out-patients, pediatric specialties) and by country in which the study was carried out. The drugs most frequently reported with ADRs are those most commonly used in the pediatric age group, i.e. antibiotics and vaccines.

In pediatrics, physiological changes can also influence the disposition of drugs in infants, children and adolescents. The importance of ontogeny translates into different responses to the same drug in children and adults.

In France, the systematic participation of patients in these processes is one of the targets to be met in terms of healthcare democracy. Although, on an international level, patient involvement in these assessments is constantly growing, it is difficult to define due to the presence of unstabilised elements in terms of both terminology and assessment methods. As a result, patient and public involvement in health technology assessments varies considerably from one country to the next, from one field to the next and even from one type of technology to the next. Several types of involvement exist, ranging from studies conducted to collect patient \"insight\" (experience, perception, needs, preferences, attitudes to treatment and health, etc.) to processes aimed at including patients in assessments (as individuals, as representatives of associations, etc.). Given the scope and complexity of the subject, and the difficulty involved in understanding all the different aspects of health technologies and innovations, the members of the Round Table chose to concentrate on health technology assessments (medicinal products and medical devices) to develop national recommendations on all possible types of patient involvement in the health technology assessment processes conducted by the health authorities in France.","420":"Connected objects (CO), whether medical devices or not, are used in clinical research for data collection, a specific activity (communication, diagnosis, effector, etc.), or several functions combined. Their validation should be based on three approaches: technical and clinical reliability, data protection and cybersecurity. Consequently, the round table recommends that the typology of COs, their uses and limitations, be known and shared by all, particularly for implementing precise specifications. COs are used in clinical research during observational studies (assessment of the device itself or data collection), randomized studies, where only one group has a CO (assessment of its impact on patient follow-up or management), or randomized studies where both groups have a CO, which is then used as a tool to help with assessment. The benefits of using COs in clinical research includes: improved collection and quality of data, compliance of patients and pharmacovigilance, easier implementation of e-cohorts and a better representative balance of patients. The societal limits and risks identified relate to the sometimes intrusive nature of certain collected parameters and the possible misuse of data. The round table recommends the following on this last point: anticipation, by securing transmission methods, the qualification of data hosts, and assessment of the object's vulnerability. For this, a risk analysis appears necessary for each project. It is also necessary to accurately document the data flow, in order to inform both patients and healthcare professionals and to ensure adequate security. Anticipating regulatory changes and involving users starting from the study design stage are also recommended.","421":"While physicians increasingly recognize nicorandil-related mucocutaneous ulcerations, there are still misdiagnoses, particularly in the case of unusual location and late onset ulceration after nicorandil introduction. The goal of our study was to remind clinicians about the link between nicorandil use and the development of cutaneous ulcerations and to highlight the risk of misdiagnosis. We describe five reports diagnosed by the same dermatologist, complemented by an analysis of the French pharmacovigilance database (FPVD) from 1 January 1994 to 5 January 2017. During this period, 28 reports of strict cutaneous ulcerations due to nicorandil, in addition to our five reports, were registered in the FPVD. For those 28 reports, the time to onset between nicorandil introduction and cutaneous ulcerations was quite long and exceeded one year in 16 reports (information specified in 25 reports). The delay between ulcerations observation and nicorandil discontinuation was variable, with immediate diagnosis in seven reports, but ranged from fifteen days to twelve years in 21 reports. The main locations were lower limbs, thorax and face. Ulcerations could be localized on surgery or trauma scars. Regression after nicorandil discontinuation was observed in all but two reports and ranged from three days to three months. Characteristics were comparable in our five patient's series. All patients exposed to nicorandil and healthcare practitioners prescribing nicorandil should be aware of the risk of cutaneous ulcerations to enable early diagnosis and drug withdrawal. The risk of misdiagnosis of this serious adverse drug reaction, along with the risk of sequelae, the costs of unnecessary additional investigations and the recent update on nicorandil as second-line treatment for stable angina, with existing alternative drugs, question about the benefit\/risk balance of nicorandil.","422":"The development and the access to collections of human biological samples is one of the major challenges for health research. In recent years, biological resource centres (BRCs) have developed in such a way that they provide all activities relating to the handling of samples. In this context, France is undoubtedly a pioneering country, because most of the biological collections available were created on the basis of themed research projects, which involved a particular donor phenotype. The round table was an opportunity to emphasise the persistence of some pitfalls particularly in relation to ensuring the consistency of different regulatory pathways. It also gave the opportunity to question and make recommendations on aspects of governance of biological collections and the BRCs, to state the challenges linked to scientific and economic valorisation and to consider the place of patients and the general public. The development of specific education in public health and research is essential to underline that these initiatives are necessary for developing new diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.","423":"","424":"","425":"In our clinical research center, a 27 multiple-choice and 3 verbatim questions satisfaction questionnaire has been used since 2008 in order to assess the satisfaction of the volunteers participating in our studies.

Our changing system, the development and increasingly chronic nature of diseases, the scale of technological breakthroughs, these are all factors driving this topic forward. The object of this work, after a necessary study of the semantics of the term \"pathway\" and even \"funding\", was to identify all prerequisites and good practices for the stakeholders to develop a pilot pathway and then its relevant implementation in France. To do so, the members of the Round Table have relied on the presentation of examples of care pathways in order to identify triggers to a progressive, adapted extension to the whole territory.

At the statistical level, obtaining a P&lt;0.05 allows to claim the effectiveness of the new studied treatment.

With \"P&lt;0.05\", the probability that the treatment is effective may vary depending on other statistical parameters which are the alpha level of risk, the power of the study and especially the a priori probability of the existence of treatment effect. A \"P&lt;0.05\" does not always produce the same degree of certainty. Thus there exist situations where the risk of a result \"P&lt;0.05\" is in reality a false positive is very high. This is the case if the power is low, if there is an inflation of the alpha risk or if the result is exploratory or chance discoveries.

One index of its success is the increasing speed with which serious adverse drug reactions are discovered after marketing of a medicinal product. However, the speed with which products have subsequently been withdrawn as a result of the discovery of serious adverse reactions has not consistently changed. This highlights problems that regulators and manufacturers face when serious reactions are discovered, with difficulties in deciding which of several consequent actions to take: to add specific warnings (cautions) or contraindications to the product label; to issue a Direct Healthcare Professional Communication; to allow informed patients to decide whether they will take the drug; or, in the most serious cases, to withdraw the product or revoke the licence. Conflicts of interest may inhibit decision-making. Recommendations that arise from these observations are that: health professionals and patients should be more vigorously encouraged to report suspected adverse drug reactions; regulatory authorities and drug manufacturers should take quicker confirmatory action when serious suspected adverse drug reactions are reported, even anecdotally, with formal studies to test for causality conducted sooner rather than later, applying lower than usual thresholds for suspicion; temporary suspensions or restrictions could be considered during such assessments; universal guidelines are needed for determining when a drug should be withdrawn if serious adverse drug reactions are suspected; there should be more rigorous monitoring and verification of deaths and reporting of reasons for drop-outs during clinical trials, with more transparency in reporting adverse events and ready access to premarketing clinical study reports; post-marketing drug monitoring systems and medicines regulation in low-to-middle income economies, especially in Africa, where withdrawals are fewer than elsewhere, should be strengthened.","477":null,"478":null,"479":"Lysergic acid amide (LSA) is a natural psychoactive substance consumed as a psychedelic drug.

Several scales exist to evaluate the potential anticholinergic effect of prescribed drugs but: (i) they are validated in the elderly and mainly assess the cognitive side effect of treatments; (ii) they do not concern some of the drugs frequently used in clinical psychiatry in France. The aim of our study is to develop a new scale, the anticholinergic impregnation scale (AIS), with drugs used in France and based on an assessment of the drugs used against peripheral anticholinergic adverse effects. We assigned a score, ranging from 1 to 3, to a list of 128 drugs with a consensus approach obtained via literature data and expert opinions. We collected data from 7278 prescriptions in 34 French psychiatric facilities: age, sex, atropinic drugs, laxatives and treatments of xerophthalmia and xerostomia, in order to evaluate the association between AIS score and the prescription of drugs aiming to reduce peripheral anticholinergic side effects. The most frequently prescribed drugs were cyamemazine (n=1429; 20%) and tropatepine (n=1403; 19%), two drugs marketed almost exclusively in France and with a score of 3. The frequency of patients with a high AIS score, greater than 5, was significantly higher in patients who received laxatives and treatments of xerostomia. AIS score represents the first validated solution to evaluate anticholinergic load in psychiatry settings in France. The anticholinergic problem remains underevaluated in mental health settings. In order to rule out the confounding factor of mental disease, assessment of peripheral side effects can be considered more objective than the evaluation of cognitive function in psychiatric patients.

Accordingly, PTSD and addiction to drug of abuse might by considered as memory pathologies, underlined by the same physiological process. We propose that these two pathologies rely on an uncoupling of the monoaminergic systems. According to this hypothesis, exposure to extreme conditions, either negative (trauma) or positive (drugs) induced a loss of the reciprocal control that one system usually exerts on the other monoaminergic system, resulting to an uncoupling between the noradrenergic and the serotonergic systems. Results obtained in our laboratory, using animal models of these pathologies, demonstrate that after a trauma, such as after repeated drug injections, rats developed both a behavioral sensitization (increases of the locomotion in response to a stimulation of the monoaminergic systems) and a pharmacological sensitization (increases of noradrenergic release within the prefrontal cortex). These results support our hypothesis and led us to propose new and innovative therapeutic approaches consisting either to induce a re-coupling of the monoaminergic systems, or to modify the pathological memories by using an emotional memory remodeling.

The incidence of cancers was not increased, in particular for breast, uterus and ovary. Our results confirmed a transgenerational transmission of defects in male genital tract. With caution due to possible bias associated with this method, our data suggest an increase of defects for esophagus, lip or palate, musculoskeletal and circulatory system in children of exposed women.

Impregnated dressings with amikacin or colistin could be a good alternative to obtain effective concentration directly at the infected site. Therapeutic drug monitoring for these antibiotics is currently recommended after an intravenous administration to obtain effective and non-toxic plasmatic concentrations. However, data are lacking about systemic exposition and risk of toxicity after an administration with impregnated dressings. We report the case of a severe burned patient with cutaneous infection treated with amikacin and colistin impregnated dressings, for which plasmatic pharmacokinetic profiles were performed.","609":null,"610":"Pharmacovigilance should become a well-thought-out reflex for each of us, for any drugs taken on prescription or by self-medication. The issue of pharmacovigilance should naturally take its place in the dialogue between patients and health professionals, through advice given before medication is taken. Patients need to be told the importance of notifying any adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Pharmacovigilance would then become a post-hoc way of protecting patients. The importance of using pharmacovigilance should be promoted by emphasizing the fact that the life of a drug really starts after its marketing. This state of mind could be reinforced by a wider advertising campaign on the possibility of notifying the relevant authorities of any ADRs. Patient associations should encourage and help their members to do this. Notifying any ADRs should become a concern for all medical and paramedical staff: those who prescribe drugs, those who dispense them (pharmacists or pharmacy assistants), those who administer them (nurses), but also the consumers (patients) whose place is becoming more and more prominent. ","611":"Internet is changing the way people learn about health and illness. Health websites are among the most popular resources on the web. The sharing of patient experiences on a website could be an interesting source of information about adverse drug reactions (ADRs) or could generate \"signals\". Three examples of the use of patient forums in pharmacovigilance are discussed: (1) analysis of perceptions of risk by patients before and after withdrawal of benfluorex, and then following media coverage; (2) comparison of oral antineoplasic-induced ADRs collected on patient websites with those registered in the French pharmacovigilance database; (3) analysis of data found in the social media about drugs and pregnancy. ","612":"Since the beginning of this century, information on pharmacogenetics appears in the summary of product characteristics (SPC) of drugs. Pharmacogenetic tests particularly concern the enzymes involved in the metabolism of drugs, among which P450 cytochromes. Some patients known as poor metabolisers eliminate some drugs more slowly, causing overdoses and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The best-known examples are AVK and VKORC1-CYP2C9 or clopidogrel and CYP2C19. In the USA, the tests are recommended before the introduction of these drugs to prevent the occurrence of ADRs. Other tests are also commonly performed to address the toxicity of certain anticancer drugs (DPYD-capecitabine, UGT1A1-irinotecan, TPMT 6-mercaptopurine). Pharmacogenetic testing is also available to identify HLA loci that are very strongly associated with the occurrence of immuno-allergic reactions to a specific drug. The best-known example is HLA-B*5701, strongly associated with hypersensitivity to abacavir, and this test is now always prescribed before the instatement of this drug. ","613":"The aim of this article is to discuss the contribution of pharmacoepidemiology to pharmacovigilance in the context of drug safety monitoring. Because this contribution requires a comparison of the approaches and a presentation of their respective merits, we have tried to show that this comparison did not necessarily mean opposing these methods, which would not serve any useful purpose. We wanted to underline the fact that the notion of contribution of one to the other implied a complementarity that we propose to demonstrate. Pharmacovigilance is essentially based on the study of spontaneous reports and the clinical and pharmaceutical analysis of the implication of given drugs in adverse drug reactions. It yields performances that are unequalled to this day when safety warning signs relate to rare adverse events or to drugs that are rarely used, or when the drug-related event has specificities that are not found for other aetiologies. Pharmacoepidemiology for its part, through its population-related studies and the possible use of a comparison group, enables a quantification of risks that is impossible to carry out using spontaneous reporting alone. It also enables the highlighting and quantification of safety signals for events that are frequent and multifactorial, where the role of a drug in individual cases can be difficult to detect, and therefore difficult to identify from spontaneous reporting. All in all, this is the major contribution of pharmacoepidemiology to pharmacovigilance, where it can be said that it complements pharmacovigilance in drug safety monitoring but in no way could replace it. ","614":"In recent years, the preventability of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) has gradually gained ground as an additional criterion for assessing drug-related risk, alongside seriousness, causality mechanism of action or frequency. However, the definition of preventability itself remains a concept that needs to be defined clearly so as to compare study results. After an overview of the current methods of measuring preventability, which include a French instrument, this work proposes a synthesis of the French studies assessing the preventability of ADRs over the last 30 years. Measuring preventability is important to classify ADRs as preventable\/not preventable, but the ultimate aim remains to characterize these preventable ADRs, highlighting the clinical situations and drug classes related to the risk. It is then possible to provide targeted clinical actions to correct these situations and improve the clinical use of these drugs. Thus, assessing medical preventability should address the causes of ADRs and not the responsibility of healthcare professionals. Finally, certain ideas are proposed to improve the French scale and pursue its validation. ","615":"The methods for causality assessment of adverse drug reactions were developed in the 1970s and 1980s, alongside the development of pharmacovigilance. The French method is one of the earlier of these, following on from the pioneering works by Irey and Karch and Lasagna. Initially published in 1978, it was updated in 1985, and again in 2011. The main alterations to the original method are presented in tables annexed to this paper. The successive versions improved the presentation, provided more formalised definitions of the criteria for assessing causality, while at the same time ensuring the method remained easy to use. Causality assessment enables the causal link between a drug and the occurrence of an adverse reaction to be formalised and explained. It contributes to diagnosis, and to determining the action to be taken in case of an adverse drug reaction. It can contribute to the quality and the relevance of the data stored in pharmacovigilance databases. ","616":"The new European legislation that came into force in July 2012 reinforced the organisation of pharmacovigilance by setting up a committee in charge of risk assessment for medicines, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC). The PRAC has a remit covering the assessment of all aspects of the safety and the risk management of medicinal products for human use in the European Union. It deals with issues regarding pharmacovigilance signals, the periodic evaluation of benefit\/risk reports from marketing authorization holders (MAH), risk management plans, post-marketing studies, variations or renewals of marketing authorisations, management of under surveillance drugs lists, inspections for pharmacovigilance reasons and audits of pharmacovigilance systems. The PRAC works with the pharmacovigilance systems of the European Member States, which draw up evaluation reports. These evaluations are circulated and discussed by Member States so as to issue recommendations, which serve as a basis for other European medicines committees, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) or the Coordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures-Human (CMDh) which then give their opinion. The final decision, which applies to all Member States and to the concerned MAH, lies with the European Commission (EC). This decisional procedure thus rests on coordination involving the PRAC, the CHMP, the CMDh, the EC, the Member States and the pharmaceutical companies. In the 3 years from July 2012, the PRAC has processed nearly 4500 procedures and is still facing an increasing workload. ","617":"Pharmacovigilance aims to identify unknown adverse drug reactions once clinical development is complete, in order to promote improved use of drugs, and thus a reduction in risk for every exposed patient. We describe in this article the missions of French pharmacovigilance system, including French drug agency, Regional Centers of Pharmacovigilance, health professionals, pharmaceutical companies, patients and their associations. We also develop the French pharmacovigilance organization, its perspectives and challenges, both in French and European levels.

Coupled with advances in computer technology, the field of \"big data\" appears promising, allowing us to better understand the natural history of diseases, to follow-up new technologies (devices, drugs) implementation and to participate in precision medicine, etc. Data sources are multiple (medical and administrative data, electronic medical records, data from rapidly developing technologies such as DNA sequencing, connected devices, etc.) and heterogeneous while their use requires complex methods for accurate analysis. Moreover, faced with this new paradigm, we must determine who could (or should) have access to which data, how to combine collective interest and protection of personal data and how to finance in the long-term both operating costs and databases interrogation. This article analyses the opportunities and challenges related to the use of open and\/or \"big data\", from the viewpoint of pharmacologists and representatives of the pharmaceutical and medical device industry. ","621":"Health technology assessment (HTA) is a rapidly developing area and the value of taking non-clinical fields into consideration is growing. Although the health-economic aspect is commonly recognised, evaluating organisational impact has not been studied nearly as much. The goal of this work was to provide a definition of organisational impact in the sector of medical devices by defining its contours and exploring the evaluation methods specific to this field. Following an analysis of the literature concerning the impact of technologies on organisations as well as the medical literature, and also after reviewing the regulatory texts in this respect, the group of experts identified 12 types of organisational impact. A number of medical devices were carefully screened using the criteria grid, which proved to be operational and to differentiate properly. From the analysis of the practice and of the methods described, the group was then able to derive a few guidelines to successfully evaluate organisational impact. This work shows that taking organisational impact into consideration may be critical alongside of the other criteria currently in favour (clinically and economically). What remains is to confer a role in the decision-making process on this factor and one that meets the economic efficiency principle. ","622":"","623":"The Giens 2015 Workshop Round Table entitled \"What specifications for a centre or network of excellence in clinical research?\" took a viewpoint distinct from earlier work and studies on changes in clinical research activities in France. The purpose of the present work was to identify, starting from concrete examples, the main strengths and advantages of clinical research activity in France related, in part, to the background environment and also to the specific characteristics of the investigation centres considered to be among the most high-performance units in activity. The criteria retained were grouped into a set of specifications that could be used to establish a \"label of excellence\" upon which the different teams and clinical research centres could model themselves. It was thus considered that belonging to a centre or structured network with at least a national configuration, when this is possible for the medial topic in question, constitutes a real advantage. Four benchmarks were identified: the scientific and clinical expertise of the head investigator, as well as the qualification and operational capacity of the centre's team; definition and measurement of performance using clearly displayed indicators and evaluation procedures; the quality of the overall trial \"process\" and of each of its component steps; communication, because know-how and promotion go hand in hand, with the main objective of informing the professional and general public about the value of the research centre meeting the above-mentioned criteria, about its networks of competencies, and more generally, about the important assets of the background of clinical research in France. This sector of research is funded by the public authorities via calls for public grants, financial aids for structures supporting clinical research in the University Hospital Centres and other healthcare institutions allowing for a professionalization of the research occupations, and the national public health plans (cancer, rare disease, HIV). ","624":"In a randomised clinical trial, when the result of the primary endpoint shows a significant benefit, the secondary endpoints are scrutinised to identify additional effects of the treatment. However, this approach entails a risk of concluding that there is a benefit for one of these endpoints when such benefit does not exist (inflation of type I error risk). There are mainly two methods used to control the risk of drawing erroneous conclusions for secondary endpoints. The first method consists of distributing the risk over several co-primary endpoints, so as to maintain an overall risk of 5%. The second is the hierarchical test procedure, which consists of first establishing a hierarchy of the endpoints, then evaluating each endpoint in succession according to this hierarchy while the endpoints continue to show statistical significance. This simple method makes it possible to show the additional advantages of treatments and to identify the factors that differentiate them. ","625":"The important medical and social burden of nervous system diseases contrasts with the currently limited therapeutic armamentarium and with the difficulty encountered in developing new therapeutic options. These failures can be explained by the conjunction of various phenomena related to the limitations of animal models, the narrow focus of research on precise pathophysiological mechanisms, and methodological issues in clinical trials. It is perhaps the paradigm itself of the way research is conducted that may be the real reason for our incapacity to find effective strategies. The purpose of this workshop was to define overall lines of research that could lead to the development of effective novel therapeutic solutions. Research has long focused on diseases per se rather than on cognitive and behavioural dimensions common to several diseases. Their expression is often partial and variable, but can today be well-characterised using neurophysiological or imaging methods. This dimensional or syndromic vision should enable a new insight to the question, taking a transnosographic approach to re-position research and to propose: translational models exploring the same functions in animal models and in humans; identification of homogeneous groups of patients defined according to the clinical, anatomico-functional and molecular characteristics; and preclinical and clinical developments enriched by the use of cognitive-behavioural, biological neurological, and imaging biomarkers. For this mutation to be successful, it must be accompanied by synchronised action from the public authorities and by ad hoc measures from the regulatory agencies. ","626":"The risk of cardiovascular disease in elderly is significantly higher than in young subjects; paradoxically some treatments that have proven their efficacy in reducing cardiovascular risk are often under prescribed in this age group. The benefits of statins in secondary cardiovascular prevention are well established in patients &lt;80 years. In primary prevention, these drugs reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke, but their effects on cardiovascular mortality remain uncertain. In very elderly patients, there are no randomized trials relative to the impact of statins on morbi-mortality in primary prevention as well in secondary prevention. Adverse effects in the elderly seem to be statistically similar to those occurring in young people , but the prescription in very old people should be individualized, taking into account the life expectancy, the life quality, the comorbidities, and especially the risk of drug interactions.","627":"","628":null,"629":"Assess the validity and reproducibility of the updated version of the French causality assessment method in conditions approaching real-life use.

To test the inter- and intra-rater reproducibility, two seniors and two juniors from a PhVC and a pharmaceutical company assessed the pairs twice with the updated method. A weighted kappa coefficient was used to measure the agreement of the two causality assessment methods with the consensual expert judgement (validity) as well as the agreement of the updated causality assessment over time (intra-rater reproducibility) and between evaluators (inter-rater reproducibility). Agreement between the current method and consensual expert judgement was fair for the PhVC team (weighted kappa [Kw] 0.33) and moderate for the pharmaceutical company team (Kw 0.41). For the updated method, agreement was better for both the PhVC (Kw 0.58) and the pharmaceutical company (Kw 0.52) teams. The inter- and intra-rater reproducibility of the updated method based on the intrinsic imputability was satisfactory overall (Kw 0.30-0.91).

This qualitative study in participant observation listed the different sources of confusion and the adaptations applied on prescriptions on a daily basis by eight practitioners and three intermediators who worked in six care cent ers for Deaf people. Interviews with deaf patients aimed to ascertain the encountered difficulties. These adaptations were presented, for a three-way correlation, during a national meeting attended by professional workers in care centers for Deaf people. They were subjected to a review by all attendees in order to generate a more consensual report. The sources of the identified misunderstandings turned out to be connected with time representation, the use of unknown words or words with double meaning, and the issuing of several documents. To reduce the risk of error, professional signers would use charts, calendars, drawings, replace durations by dates. Some of them requested that the patient would rephrase the understood information.

Over the study period, the proportion of patients using benzodiazepines or antidepressants was 6-9% (p &lt; 0.001) higher for capsule users than for syrup users. On average over the study period, 18% of subjects had at least one concurrent issue of the two forms. The study has shown the rapid spread of the capsule formulation among methadone users. This may suggest that the capsule is well accepted by patients and the medical community.

Comparison of the data from spontaneous reports with surveys in specific populations and with evaluations of indicators of diverted uses does not highlight a major problem of tramadol abuse and dependence in terms of public health, but stresses the importance of paying attention to the signal. This example of addiction monitoring of tramadol illustrates the interest of comparing results obtained from different validated sources. The implementation of repeated observational programs of abuse of and dependence on psychoactive drugs is an important aid to health authorities to define the content of the information to be delivered or regulatory decisions to reduce these problematic uses.

At the European level, this monitoring is based on activities controlled by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) for substance abuse in general and by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for marketed drugs, in the context of pharmacovigilance. If France has set up in the early 1990s an original system to assess potential for abuse of psychoactive substances, with specific tools combining both the evaluation of the use of these substances (illicit substances or diverted drugs), and the consequences of that use in terms of morbidity and mortality, there is no equivalent in other European countries. Indeed, unlike the USA, who, for several decades, organized this type of surveillance, with a multisource approach (sentinel systems, databases, medical and administrative data, databases for seeking care in relation abuse), we have not found in other European countries integrated system for identifying a signal of drug abuse, or to assess the impact of measures for minimizing the risk of abuse. However, some recent examples show a growing concern about drug addiction, based on a pharmacoepidemiological approach using pharmacovigilance databases or medical administrative data.

The substances used in this way are constantly renewing, warranting health surveillance and particular vigilance towards the addictive risk, given its major medical and social impact. This surveillance and vigilance requires detailed, accurate knowledge of the pharmacological and physio-pathological models involved in the emergence of the process of addiction, in particular disturbances of the systems regulating dopaminergic transfer; it also requires knowledge of the means to identify individual risk factors linked to genetic or psycho-behavioural susceptibilities. ","665":"The French addictovigilance network (addictovigilance: surveillance of addiction), composed of 13 Addictovigilance Centres, was set up in 1990 in order to achieve reliable surveillance and evaluation of abuse and dependence cases due to psychoactive substances (alcohol and tobacco excepted). The detection of safety signals is one of the roles of the addictovigilance centres. Signals from spontaneous reports need to be analyzed before further communication. In addictovigilance, signals may be linked to adverse effects (deaths, pathological signs), to products (new psychoactive substances with potentially dangerous effects) or to practices (new administration routes, new contexts of use). These signals are provided by numerous partners among whom the addictovigilance network has to raise awareness about information that may possibly be an alert signal. The watchful attitude of all partners will make it possible that signals will be, after analyze, considered as true alerts. The addictovigilance network collects data, assess the potential for addiction of psychoactive drugs to provide information on the risk of addiction and give opinions for public health decisions (harm reduction or prevention programs, psychoactive substances control, health alerts).

Stratified medicine is a component of personalized medicine employing biomarkers and companion diagnostics to target the patients likely to present the best benefit-risk balance for a given active compound. The concept of targeted therapy, mostly used in cancer treatment, relies on the existence of a defined molecular target, involved or not in the pathological process, and\/or on the existence of a biomarker able to identify the target population, which should logically be small as compared to the population presenting the disease considered. Targeted therapies and biomarkers represent important stakes for the pharmaceutical industry, in terms of market access, of return on investment and of image among the prescribers.

In this paper, we propose to highlight some aspects of this controversy by exploring the mutual influence of psychopharmacology and trial methodologies. Indeed, antidepressant efficacy, if not proved, was accepted before antidepressant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were run. While RCTs became a gold standard to meet the requirements of the regulatory bodies, methodological tools were required to measure outcomes and to test whether antidepressants provide statistically significant benefits as compared with a placebo. All these methodological options have nonetheless introduced fuzziness in our interpretation of study results, in terms of clinical meaningfulness and in terms of transposability to a real life settings. Additionally, selective publication raises concerns about the published literature, and results in many paradoxes. Instead of providing easy answers, the application of the RCT paradigm in MDD raises numerous questions. This is probably in the nature of all scientific studies, but it can be in contradiction with clinicians' expectations, who want to be sure that the treatment will (or will not) work for their individual patients.

Using CPRD data it is possible to identify medical records indicative of pregnancy, including pregnancy losses. Data on prescriptions issued can be used to determine maternal exposure and for about 80% of pregnancies it is possible to link the mother's medical record to the medical record of the child.

The objective of this work is to summarize the results of studies assessing the effects of regulatory measures successively implemented in France since 1996 to prevent foetal exposure to isotretinoin. The five pharmacovigilance studies have shown persistence of pregnancies exposed to isotretinoin, with an estimated incidence in the latter study, between 0.32 and 0.95 per 1000 treated women of childbearing age. The strengthening of the prevention plan of pregnancies, established in France in March 2010, seems to have resulted in a decrease in the incidence of pregnancies exposed, but this trend needs to be confirmed. However, these pregnancies are almost preventable, because most of them are explained by the non-compliance with the conditions of prescribing and dispensing.

In this review, we describe six principal teratogenic mechanisms suspected to be associated with medication use: folate antagonism, neural crest cell disruption, endocrine disruption, oxidative stress, vascular disruption, and specific receptor- or enzyme-mediated teratogenesis. Knowledge about these mechanisms, for some of which evidence is mainly derived from animal models, may not only be relevant for etiologic and post-marketing research, but may also have implications for prescribing behavior for women of reproductive age. Since combinations of seemingly unrelated medications may have effects through similar teratogenic mechanisms, the risk of birth defects may be strongly increased in multi-therapy.

The human placenta is the interface between mother and fetus and remains difficult to study for ethical reasons. Placental transfer of drugs from mother to fetus is dependent on their physicochemical properties, maternal and fetal factors and placental factors. The human placental perfusion model is the only experimental model to study human placental transfer of drugs in organized placental tissue. In vitro models utilizing cell cultures are mostly limited to the investigation of cellular toxicity along pregnancy or specific transfer mechanisms, such as their interaction with transporters. Taking advantage of the complementarity of these models, it will be possible to develop a rational use of drugs during this period.","779":"To quantify and characterize the use of the Internet to search for information about medicines.

The working hypothesis was that the available data-set was sufficient for and compatible with scientific evaluation with clinical benefit. Post-registration studies, although contributing to the continuity of assessment, were not dealt with. Moreover, the focus was restricted to devices used in health establishments, where the association between devices and technical medical procedures is optimally representative. An update of the multiple regulatory protocols governing medical devices and procedures is provided. Issues more specifically related to procedures as such, to non-implantable devices and to innovative devices are then dealt with, and the proposals and discussion points raised at the round-table for each of these three areas are presented.

Most frequently reported cancers were lymphomas (22.7%), b asal or squamous cell carcinomas (16.4%) and leukemias (13.8%). Immunosuppressants (37.6%) were ranked in the first position followed by corticosteroids (9.3%). Potential drug-cancer associations, previously described in the literature (immunosuppressants, hydroxycarbamide, mitoxantrone, cyproterone and hormone replacement therapy) were found in the database. Other potential drug-cancer associations (leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma after exposition to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors or interferon) were also identified. Cancer notifications in a PV database, although usually considered as poorly generalizable to the general population, appears to be useful in the surveillance of cancer risk associated to drugs.

Among the 31 infants having electrophysiologics explorations, 4 had suggestive signs of retinal toxicity at the preclinical stage. This could probably be explained by a low cumulative dose, the immaturity of the fetal retina and the low light stimulation in utero.

Several studies evaluated interest of biomarkers in RA patients treated with biologics:           1- to optimize doses and frequency of drug administration; 2- to predict response to           treatment; 3- to predict tolerance of biologics; 4- to monitor patient who stopped           treatment and are in remission, and predict new RA flare.","967":"The definition of clinical pharmacology in arthritis includes different levels of measures of the clinical activity and the anatomical. The clinical measure of osteoarthritis (OA) is well validated and includes the measures of pain, disability and quality of life. Those measures should be adapted to each localisation of osteoarthritis. The measure of structural evolution of OA could be approached by the dosage in the serum of biomarkers. Several have shown some interests but none is validated in clinical practice.","968":"According to international recommendations, acetaminophen should be used as a first-line therapy in patients with osteoarthritis, because of its safety and effectiveness. NSAIDs should be considered in patients unresponsive to acetaminophen, and should be prescribed at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration. The use of stronger analgesics, such as weak opioids and narcotic analgesics, is only indicated when other drugs, such as NSAIDs, have been ineffective or are contraindicated. Symptomatic slow acting drugs (avocado soybean unsaponifiable, chondroitin sulphate, diacerein, glucosamine sulphate, hyaluronan injections) have mild symptomatic effects and may reduce the consumption of NSAIDs. Intra-articular injections of glucocorticoids are indicated for flare of knee pain, especially if accompanied by effusion.","969":"Inflammatory rheumatic disorders are related to different pathophysiological mechanisms           and, hence, their therapeutic management varies according to the underlying disease.           Crystal-induced arthritis is characterized by its almost specific responsiveness to           colchicine. Regarding ankylosing spondylitis, non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs           (NSAIDs) and TNF blockers are the cornerstones of pharmacological intervention whereas           oral corticosteroids at conventional doses are of little value, if any. Conversely,           corticosteroids are the drug of choice to treat polymyalgia rheumatica. Furthermore,           low-dose corticosteroids were shown to be more effective than NSAIDs in patients with           rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the main goal being to achieve remission,           disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, either synthetic, especially methotrexate, and\/or           biologic, such as TNF inhibitors, have a major role in the management of RA. Finally,           enhanced understanding of molecular pathogenesis of inflammatory disorders may help to           find out how to best target available drugs to right individuals in the future.","970":"Disulfiram is a relatively old molecule, which today remains marginal in the treatment of alcoholics diseases. Using this type of treatment is the subject of ethical debate. The prescription of this therapeutic requires clinical and biological rigorous evaluations before treatment. Its main action in treatment of alcoholism is related to the restraint of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase action causing the antabuse reaction. Prescription of disulfiram, supported by specialized programs of compartmental integrated care, brings significant benefit for alcoholic patients. Recently, following the discovery of its action on dopamine metabolism, disulfiram has been a renewed interest in the treatment of addictions to cocaine and pathological gambling. Although current data are insufficient to generalize its use in routine practice, they constitute a line of research interest for the future.","971":"","972":"This study aims at evaluating trends in the consumption of opioids over the last years to assess the impact of public health measures on the management of pain and opiate addiction in France. The evolution of opioids consumption was analysed by using the national database of the General Health Insurance System in France between 2004 and 2008. During the study period, the reimbursed quantities of opioids used for pain management have increased by 13%, except for dextropropoxyphene that has decreased by 9%. The reimbursed quantities of opioids used for substitution maintenance treatments for opioid dependence have increased by 34%, with a 116% increase for methadone. This study suggests that consumption of opioids is globally increasing in France and reveals discrepancies concerning the evolution of the different drugs. It allows to analyse switches of consumption between different opioids and constitutes the first step for further studies targetting signals of diversion and abuse. ","973":"We aimed to investigate patients' educational wishes and patients' perception of their knowledge of anticoagulants. One thousand patients were randomly sampled from a list of patients living within the Brest district (France) affiliated to the National Health Insurance System and who had been reimbursed after the delivery of vitamin K antagonists in May 2007. A 56-item questionnaire has been mailed along with an information letter and a reply-paid envelope enclosed. Some 647 questionnaires were received; 82% of responders declared having been informed. Information was globally perceived as complete although alleged as being insufficient as regards bleeding management. Management of oral anticoagulants appears correct; however, only 28% of responders stated having a surveillance booklet; 63% of responders would like information and elicited oral information from their general practitioner. Our study highlighted the importance of general practitioners in the French health system when thinking about implementing an educational program on anticoagulation. ","974":"Studies conducted after the marketing authorisation with the objective of identification, characterization or quantification of one or more risks (called PASS \"Post-Authorisation Safety Studies\"), have been strengthened in the past years with the implementation of the concept of risk management plans (RMPs), established in 2005 in the European regulatory framework and recently amended as part of the community revision. These safety studies, interventional or not, are related to a marketed drug, whether or not the drug is used within the market authorisation conditions. Apart from these safety studies, other studies whose primary objective is not risk assessment, including assessment of efficacy, description of prescription data and use in real life, pharmacokinetics, public health impact ... can complete available safety data.The Giens Round Table examined PASS from the risk management plans of a sample of marketing authorisation holders (participants to the Round Table) and identified the main characteristics of proposed actions. Concerning the specifications and the choice of methodology, only a general outline has been sketched in view of the complexity and diversity of drug risks situations.","975":"The aim of this Round Table was to perform an initial assessment of the state of play of the impact of drugs on the environment. Demographic growth throughout the world and drug consumption which is constantly on the increase result in an ever increasing presence of medicinal substances in the various compartments (air, water, soil) with potential repercussions on the environment and on health. For the first time, the Giens pharmacology workshop have scheduled this topic outside the conventional sphere of action of Giens. A very high level of interest in this topic came forward both from the members of the round table and the listeners and it is certain that the round table opens the door to new initiatives for a subject about which there is still little knowledge. The following issues were therefore successively addressed: the fragmentation of the knowledge about the subject and its deficiencies concerning the impact on health, both of the wastes as a whole and that of specific drugs, the performances of the water treatment methods, the sources of pollution, the environmental impact, the lines of regulatory development, the impact on the environment and health and the training programmes to be set up among all protagonists, both professional and in the general public.","976":"Based on the observation that over the last 30 years the cost of development has risen regularly as the number of new chemical entities reaching the market has fallen, how can \"savings\" be made in terms of clinical development, the objective being more rapid access to a drug for medical needs that are not covered? Several instruments exist to enable innovative products to be made available more quickly: temporary use authorisations, which are not concerned by this work (ATUs), conditional marketing authorisations (MAs) and MAs under exceptional circumstances. These aspects have been taken up in the European medicines agency (EMA)'s \"Road Map\", which states \"A key issue for Regulators will be if a more \"staggered\" approval should be envisaged, characterised by a better defined\/more restricted population of good responders, followed by a broadening of the population post-authorisation when more \"real life\" data are available. In addition, maximising the value of information generated in the post-authorisation phase should be developed through the use of cohorts and other prospectively collected use data, especially in the case of conditional marketing authorisations.\" The rules of procedure of the Transparency Commission for their part provide for the notion of preliminary examination: in order to prepare as best as possible the examination of dossiers of products assumed to be innovative and to limit delays, the office can undertake a preliminary study as soon as the dossier has been filed at the Committee for medicinal products for human use (CHMP). It may, at this time, request the firm to provide further information and may call on external experts. The implementation of this preliminary study does not exonerate the firm of the obligation of filing a complete dossier. The post inscription studies requested by the Transparency Commission (ISPEP - public health benefit and post-marketing studies) are usually requested in the case of hesitations regarding the level of improvement of the medical benefit (ASMR) [level II\/III or IV\/V]. Such requests mainly concern uncertainties regarding the transposability, the patient profile or correct usage in real life. Among the studies whose results were provided, in 15 cases the results were in line with expectations, in 6 cases they resulted in downward re-evaluations and the final 3 cases were inconclusive. The final recommendations of the round table were: Defining the medical need that is not covered by working in consultation (Industry and Health Authorities); Providing a Complementary Investigations Plan (PIC) after the MA at a very early stage to reinforce the early MA, and\/or HTA (health technology assessment) preparation and monitoring (possible constraining actions); Enhanced use of modelling techniques and their transposability; \"Intussusception\" of phases to optimise the development of a complete dossier; Early \"scientific opinions\" (EMA, French Health Products Safety Agency [Afssaps], French Health Authority [HAS]); Raising the awareness of the authorities, industry, doctors and patients with regard to controlled observational studies; Developing the use of public data bases.","977":"Adaptive clinical trial designs are defined as designs that use data cumulated during trial to possibly modify certain aspects without compromising the validity and integrity of the said trial. Compared to more traditional trials, in theory, adaptive designs allow the same information to be generated but in a more efficient manner. The advantages and limits of this type of design together with the weight of the constraints, in particular of a logistic nature, that their use implies, differ depending on whether the trial is exploratory or confirmatory with a view to registration. One of the key elements ensuring trial integrity is the involvement of an independent committee to determine adaptations in terms of experimental design during the study. Adaptive methods for clinical trials are appealing and may be accepted by the relevant authorities. However, the constraints that they impose must be determined well in advance.","978":"","979":null,"980":"Drugs affecting the central nervous system form a unique group of products for surveillance because they could be misused, abused or diverted.

These programs are based on adverse effect notifications, medical or legal consequences of abuse, general or specific population-based survey, professional networks or medication databases. Some programs use simultaneously several information sources.

Global immunological response is similar between \"nevirapine group\" and \"efavirenz group\" but the model showed an internal variation of this response in each group. In the both groups, some variables presented a significant variation between classes: average CD4, CD4 Nadir, CD4 peak and average gain of CD4. In \"nevirapine group\", these following parameters vary significantly between classes: mean weight, mean haemoglobin count and mean increase in haemoglobin count and sex.

We identified consumer profiles with a hierarchical ascendant classification as statistical method. We underlined five profiles associated with psychoactive substance consumption: (1) alcohol consumers in the workplace were sales engineers satisfied with their employment, (2) alcohol consumers after their work were not satisfied with their lives, (3) cannabis consumers were men professionally satisfied but suffering from job insecurity, (4) smokers were workers with professional responsibilities under time pressure, and finally (5) poly-consumers had strong professional constraints.

Its mechanism of action is different as aripiprazole is a partial dopamine D(2) and serotonin 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist and 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist. Therefore, aripiprazole is thought to have an antagonistic action in the mesolimbic pathway but an agonistic action in the mesocortical pathway, tending to normalize the dopaminergic transmission regardless of the type of imbalance. Clinical trials involving children and adolescents have demonstrated the efficacy of aripiprazole in bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, mood disorders associated with pervasive developmental disorders, in tics and Tourette's. The most frequent side effects are extrapyramidal symptoms and sleepiness and are dose-dependent. Nevertheless, contrary to other second-generation antipsychotics available in France, it induces little weight gain, does not modify lipid and glucidic profiles, does not increase prolactin levels, or induce QTc lengthening. The main advantage of aripiprazole is its good safety profile, with different toxicity targets to other second-generation antipsychotics available in France. Aripiprazole appears to be an alternative for children and adolescents who are vulnerable to these side effects and are having trouble coping with them.","1000":"Posaconazole, systemic antifungal marketed in France since 2006, is indicated as second line in curative treatment of invasive fungal infections (IFI) (aspergillosis...) and prophylaxis of IFI in patients receiving chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

","1043":"Level of Evidence for Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Vancomycin. Vancomycin is an antibiotic for exclusive hospital use administrated in intravenous infusion to treat systemic infections. It is mainly eliminated by kidneys and potentially nephrotoxic. Data available show that Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) of vancomycin is highly recommended. It aims to ensure efficacy and avoid resistance by maintaining trough plasma concentrations above the MIC. Secondary, vancomycine TDM may be indicated to prevent nephrotoxicity in high risk patients. TDM is often underwent at steady state (48 to 72 h after the treatment initiation) unless in case of renal impairment (24 h). While compared with intermittent administration, continuous infusion did not result in prognosis improvement; however it resulted in lower pharmacokinetic variability and better cost-efficiency. Targeted trough concentrations for intermittent infusion are between 15 and 20 mg\/L (up to 25-30 mg\/L for GISA). In case of continuous infusion, targets are higher (25 to 40 mg\/L).

In order to do it, we tried to answer the following questions: (1) Are the role and the mission of the nursing body well acquired in Lebanon? (2) Are there international and national norms which govern the accomplishment of this mission? (3) At what point does the mission accomplished by the nursing body procure the patient's safety? (4) What are the factors that modify the performance of the nursing body in Lebanon? And, (5) What are the challenges of a good-quality nursing performance? We conducted a double arm survey. The first one is made on 160 nurses working in 19 hospitals that succeeded to establish until July 2008 (end of study) at least an ethical committee for medical care. The second one was conducted on the heads of the nursing departments in 49 private institutes, 34 public institutes and 16 universities. The investigated nurses don't know very well the medical and nursing ethics' principles that are very well highlighted in the Husted decisional model and expressed by justice, autonomy, confidentiality, beneficience, veracity and fidelity. This result underlines a fact that affects the nurse's mission and so on the patients' safety. Ninety-four per cent of the nurses think that the education and the communication with the patient is not a priority during their daily work, which hinders the three essential times (analysis, communication and assessment) required to elaborate a freely informed decision. Ethics don't have a solid basis in education. We must be concerned by this diagnostic, but it leads to the hope of being able to find together, through a common reflection, the essential characteristics to assume our responsibilities whether in the medical or nursing domain.

We carried a retrospective study including all DRESS cases notified to the Pharmacovigilance Unit of Monastir. Our cohort of eleven patients had a median age of 40 years. Clinical examination revealed skin eruption and fever among all patients. Laboratory findings showed marked eosinophilia among all patients, hepatic cytolysis among eight patients and creatinin serum level increase among four patients. An interstitial pulmonary syndrome was noted among two patients. After culprit-drug withdrawal, outcomes were favorable for all patients. Skin tests were positive with carbamazepin and cefotaxim and negative with sulfasalazine, allopurinol and terbinafine. Throughout this paper, we point out the contribution of skin tests to identify implicated drug in inducing DRESS and to testify cross reactivity and we point out the possibility of neosensitisation to a non related chemical drug after DRESS syndrome.

The aim of this paper is to assess the safety in using these adjuvants and preservative reviewing data of clinical trials relative to which formulation includes these compounds. In the current state of knowledge, these vaccines have proved to be effective even though they more frequently give local adverse events than non-adjuvanted influenza vaccines. Systemic side effects are generally not serious. In the studies, adjuvanted vaccines do not increase neither the risk of Guillain Barre syndrome nor auto-immune diseases. There is no convincing evidence that exposure to thimerosal in vaccines had any deletorious effect on physiological outcome.","1053":"Drugs delivery by subcutaneous injection is often the last resort\/appeal for a doctor anxious to limit the aggressive and invasive treatments, particularly within palliative care. A review was made to list the drugs which can be administered by this route. Concerned antibiotics are teicoplanin, netilmicin and gentamicin with a risk of skin necrosis for aminoglycosids. Midazolam is useful in various indications and can be associated with morphine in case of dyspnoea. Data about subcutaneous injection of dexamethasone, clonazepam, haloperidol and levomepromazine are published; it is the same for fentanyl, nefopam, ondansetron and metoclopramide.

They also describe negative effects such as increased dependence towards the drug itself and larger craving for tobacco and alcohol. The numerous and various described adverse effects include psychoactive, digestive, cardiovascular... effects. Some fatality cases have been reported in scientific literature or in press and attributed to mephedrone often in association with other substances. Mephedrone has been listed as narcotic in several European countries and more recently in France.","1055":"Baclofen is an anti-spastic drug that acts as an agonist of GABA-B receptors. It also seems to decrease the appetence for alcohol (anti-craving effect), although this effect has not been certified by Authorities for drug approval in France (AMM). However, baclofen receives a great deal of demand by patients hoping to reduce their alcohol consumption. Nonetheless, the lack of AMM and the high doses of baclofen supposed to exert an anti-craving effect often discourage practitioners from prescribing this drug in current medical practice. Therefore, it is preferable for a drug like baclofen to be prescribed under specific regulations. As such, certain criteria similar to those required in clinical trials are necessary to protect patients as well as the prescribing doctors. The criteria that are proposed here are: the use of drugs without AMM approval as a last resort (all other treatments must have failed), the collegiate decision for the drug prescription, good knowledge of the potency of the drug as well as good record keeping of patients and proper supervision. The departments of addiction, pharmacology and pharmacovigilance of the University Hospital of Lille, France present here a medical process named \"multidisciplinary consultations for resort treatments of addictions\" (CAMTEA). This process is designed to meet all the above mentioned criteria and to allow the use of baclofen as an anti-craving drug in safest conditions. If this proves to be successful with baclofen, it is possible to extend the use of CAMTEA to other drugs without AMM approval in addictologic pathologies.","1056":null,"1057":"The present paper reviews clinical evidence underlining the role of ivabradine in the management of patient with ischemic heart disease.

Moreover combination therapy with ivabradine provides substantial benefit in patients already receiving beta-blocker. Prognostic efficacy of ivabradine is evaluated in a large program of studies, among which BEAUTIFUL in coronary patients with left ventricular dysfunction.

This route of delivery could represent an interesting alternative for systemic drugs with low digestive absorption. The nasal mucosa acts as an anatomical obstacle hard to get over, except for compounds with low molecular weight or highly lipophilic. Among morphinic drugs, fentanyl, very lipophilic, is rapidly absorbed via intranasal administration with a bioavailability close to 90%. This route of delivery for fentanyl is a new alternative for the treatment of breakthrough pain and gives the opportunity to discuss on the interest and the limits of nasal route administration of drugs, particularly of opioids.","1059":"The aim of this study is to determine the safety of commonly prescribed antirheumatic drugs at childbearing age, in pregnancy and lactation, through systematic literature review.

Among, the disease-modifying agents, antimalarial agents, sulfasalazine, azathioprine and ciclosporin are compatible with pregnancy, and can be administered until birth. Paracetamol, prednison, antimalarial agents, sulfasalazine and most NSAIDs can safely be used by lactating mothers.

Progress in the patho-physiology of the disease offers some hope of new treatments acting on the cerebral lesions. The amyloid hypothesis allowed the emergence of active or passive immunotherapies, and of secretase inhibitors or modulators. Recent studies have targeted the P tau protein.

The therapeutic which we have actually are symptomatic treatments which do not modify the evolution of the disease. A clinical and cognitive evaluation is sufficient mostly to estimate the efficiency of these symptomatic treatments. The development of treatments to modify the natural evolution of AD (disease modifying) requires the implementation of innovative therapeutic tries with a significant number of subjects, a long period of observation and where the only clinical criteria of evaluation seem insufficient. The use of biomarkers of plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, or neuro-imaging could play an important role to estimate their efficiency. However, at present no biomarker is validated as surrogate endpoint. It seems today indispensable to use them in the therapeutic tries so as to validate and standardize their methods of acquisition, measure and analysis.","1065":"The central effects of histamine are mediated by H(1), H(2) and H(3) receptors. The H(3) receptor inhibits histamine release in brain. Therefore, H(3) receptor inverse agonists, by suppressing this brake, enhance histamine neuron activity. The histaminergic system plays a major role in cognition and H(3) receptor inverse agonists are expected to be a potential therapeutics for cognitive deficits of Alzheimer's disease (AD). They are eagerly awaited inasmuch as other treatments of the disease, such as tacrine or memantine, also enhance, through different mechanisms, histaminergic neurotransmission. An important loss of histaminergic neurons has been observed in AD. In contrast, levels of the histamine metabolite in the CSF of AD patients show that their global activity is decreased by only 25%. This indicates that activating histamine neurons in AD can be envisaged.","1066":null,"1067":"Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by neuropathological lesions: amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary degeneration.

However, the terminology used to describe them in subsequent articles and abstracts vary greatly and thus lead to a problem of identification during bibliograhic research or during the process of indexation in medline. In this article we have fixed the terminology used and proposed both a terminology and appropriate MeSH terms for indexation for the futur. Fifty-six published studies were included. At least six different root terms were found to define the French health insurance system, 64.3% of the publications mentioned the term \"database\", and 30.4% mentioned the term \"reimbursement\". We propose that abstracts of future articles contain the three terms: database, reimbursement, and health insurance. We also propose to include in the keywords of an article the MeSH terms that are most appropriate to define these three concepts: Insurance, Health, Reimbursement and Databases, Factual.","1074":"Reimbursement is assessed by the Transparency Commission from the Health Authority (HAS) using a medical benefit (SMR) score that gives access to reimbursement, an \"improvement of medical service rendered\" (ASMR) that determines the added therapeutic value, and the target population. Assessing cancer drugs for reimbursement raises the same issues as other therapeutic classes, with some key differences. Overall survival (OS) is considered by the Transparency Commission as the endpoint for assessing clinical benefit, and yet it is not an applicable primary endpoint in all types of cancer. Later lines of treatment, particularly during the development process, may make it difficult to interpret OS as the primary endpoint. Therefore, progression-free survival (PFS) for metastatic situations and disease-free survival (DFS) in adjuvant situations are wholly relevant endpoints for decisions on the reimbursement of a new cancer drug. Effect size is assessed using actuarial survival curves of the product versus the comparator, and it is difficult to summarise them into one single parameter. Results are generally interpreted based on median survival, which is fragmented because it only measures one point of the curve. The hazard ratio measures the effect of treatment throughout the duration of survival and is therefore more comprehensive in quantifying clinical benefit. Determining an effect size threshold for granting reimbursement is difficult given the diversity of cancer settings and the level of medical need, which influences assessment of the clinical relevance of the observed difference. Rapid progress in comparators (700 molecules in development) and the identification of predictive factors of efficacy (biomarkers, histology, etc.) during development may lead to different ASMR scores per population, or to the restriction of the target population to a subgroup of the marketing authorisation (MA) population in which the expected effect size is greater. To address these issues, the roundtable recommends the possibility of early scientific opinions by the office of the Transparency Commission in order to discuss comparators and the relevance of responder subgroups. It also recommends the possibility of granting a temporary ASMR, on condition of subsequent confirmation by production of data, when reimbursement appears justified in a subpopulation of the MA for which only subgroup analysis is available.","1075":"In a context where a number of vaccinations have recently been recommended in France, and where a large number of vaccines are under development, the Round Table has reviewed the specific features of vaccines in France, namely clinical development, medico-economic modelling, evaluation and communication.

The main strategic challenges are to promote the development of vaccines in France by access to the large-scale monitoring of populations, to look ahead and coordinate the evaluation of vaccines by the various parties involved, to widen communication about vaccination strategies, in order to improve the perception of vaccines and the acceptability of vaccinations, and to increase vaccination coverage. The Round Table has also proposed the creation of a working group to be responsible for pursuing, monitoring and implementing the proposals formulated.","1076":"The target population of a medicine may include different populations that may partially overlap including the population that has been evaluated in the clinical trials, the population for which the medicine provides an actual benefit (SMR), that for which the drug provides an improvement of the actual benefit (ASMR), etc. The definition of the target population in both qualitative and quantitative terms has key public health and economic implications. Recommendations are made to shed light on the definitions, to clarify the requests of the public decision makers and to improve the methods and the sources allowing the quantification of target populations.","1077":null,"1078":"Within the last few years, new technology has come to play an important part in our professional and private daily environment. Healthcare has not escaped this progressive mutation with computers reaching the bedside. Clinical research has also shown growing interest in these new tools available to the clinical investigator, the patient, as well as to specialist departments for diagnosis and follow-up of patients, and to the different professions in clinical research. If the use of new technology seems to make life easier, by centralizing data or by simplifying data-sharing between different teams, it is still a matter of private data which must remain reliable, confidential and secure, whether it is being used in ordinary healthcare or in academic or industrial research. The aim of the round table was to estimate the impact of new information technology applied to clinical trials (including source data-medical records) and to human and drug research. First, an inventory was made of the development of these new technologies in the healthcare system. The second point developed was identification of expected benefits in order to issue guidelines for their good use and hazard warnings in clinical trials. Finally, the impact of these new technologies on the investigator as well as the project manager was analysed.","1079":"The aim of the Round Table was to make recommendations with regard to the imminent revision of the European Directive on clinical drug trials (2001\/20\/CE). While recognising the importance of compliance with this Directive, which is not optimal in some member states of the European Union, it would be constructive to simplify further and harmonise its application in every country. Without necessarily resorting to a revision, some of the Directive's dispositions could be improved, such as the definition of \"investigational medicinal products\" (IMP) and what should be considered as \"substantial amendements\", as well as harmonising and improving the way in which Ethics Committees are run, either on a European Commission level, or by relying more on the European Network of Research Ethics Committees (EUREC) which already exists in several European member states. Other points in the Directive do require revision, especially those relating to: the definition of the respective roles of Ethics Committees and Competent Authorities, the simplification of safety information to Ethics Committees (giving them access to the Eudravigilance database for adverse reactions occurring during clinical trials and providing them with only new safety issues or with a summary of the Annual Safety Report), the possibility of one single European authorisation for the trial, centralised and\/or decentralised, when the trial is multinational. The recommended changes could be made within the scope of a European Regulation, avoiding the need to transpose it at a later date into each country's regulations, which is a source of possible lack of harmonisation. More specifically, for trials with institutional sponsors and\/or investigator driven trials such as \"drug therapy strategy trials\", modulating restrictions according to the \"risk added by the research\" would enable the trial's organisation to be simplified regarding monitoring, adverse reactions reporting and study drugs labelling.","1080":"As the failure of several recent Phase III drug development programmes bears witness, the clinical development of \"disease-modifying\" drugs in Alzheimer's disease has been confronted with challenging methodological difficulties. Taking into account the financial stakes involved taking drug candidates to the Phase III stage of development, and the risk of investing time and resources fruitlessly in the evaluation of poor candidate drugs, the crucial decision remains whether to proceed from Phase II to Phase III (Go\/Nogo). The aim of Phase II studies is to select a molecule likely to be effective in Phase III, but also to eliminate candidate-drugs with an inadequate effect. No consensus currently exists on the best possible design of Phase II studies to inform the Go\/Nogo decision optimally. The challenges in choosing the best study design relate to the target population, the end-point criteria used, in particular the use of biomarkers, the experimental protocol, and the study duration. The objective of the Round Table (RT) was to gather the opinions of French experts from the academic, industrial, and regulatory world in order to arrive at a consensus recommendation for the best possible design to be used in Phase II studies in Alzheimer's disease.","1081":"To analyse drugs inducing hyperglycemia by using data reported to the French spontaneous reporting system and recorded in the French PharmacoVigilance Database (FPVD).

Identifying the preventability part of a side effect of a drug needs an adapted and reliable tool. Although different methods of assessment of preventability have been developed, none of them is unquestionable. For the needs of our study, we built a scale of measure adapted from a scale of preventability already published by defining more accurately some items and by reducing the subjective part of the interpretation. We were able to confirm the relevance of our revised scale by testing it by two experts. After consensus on the conflicting data, two thirds of the severe bleedings were considered as \"potentially or totally preventable\". These data are in agreement with published data. Indeed the data found in the literature are concordant to consider that an important part of VKA bleedings events can be prevented by a better management of the treatment.","1085":"Since donepezil and memantine are currently used for treating Alzheimer's disease, it is interesting to analyse, reassess and compare their safety profile in order to promote a better use.

The most frequent adverse drug reactions with donepezil alone and memantine alone were respectively: bradycardia (10% versus 7%), weakness (5% versus 6%) and convulsions (4% versus 3%). The most adverse drug events with donepezil and with memantine are associated with elderly people, even if they do not receive any other treatment. Donepezil and memantine have an acceptable safety profile but physicians should take special care when they prescribe any drug known to cause bradycardia or to reduce the epileptogenic threshold.

In this study, we classified colitis according to the main responsible drug with a focus on clinical symptomatology, physiopathology, evolution, and complications. We describe colitis due to antibiotics, NSAIDS, laxatives, vasoconstrictive agents, oestroprogestatives, chemotherapy and drugs induced microscopic colitis. The last one represents a particular case; it can be idiopathic, infectious or drugs induced. Its physiopathology is not well known and its diagnosis is based only on histologic criterion. Drug responsibility is easy to determine only for pseudomembranous colitis. In the other cases, chronology is very variable and the clinical, endoscopic and histological elements are rarely specific. Because of the large number of drugs that may induce colitis, it is necessary to search for potentially responsible drugs, especially if there is no obvious cause of the colitis.","1087":"To describe the evolution of buprenorphine prescription form characteristics before and after the application of a measure of the French Social Security system aimed to encourage the use of generic drugs. All buprenorphine prescription forms issued to sixty-two patients subjected to follow-up in 6 community pharmacies were analysed between October 2007 and February 2008. Patients maintained on Subutex during the whole follow-up were more numerous (n=39), younger, and received a higher daily dose of buprenorphine (10.5 mg versus 7.8 mg), compared to patients maintained on generic (n=13). For patients receiving again Subutex after have been treated by a generic (n=10), daily doses remained unchanged. It seems that the patients stabilized on generic present less serious pharmacodependence and less psychiatric comorbidity than those maintained on Subutex. Substituting a buprenorphine speciality with another should not induce any treatment unsettlement. ","1088":"Valproic acid is an anticonvulsant drug available in France since 1967. It is a broad spectrum molecule indicated in various forms of epilepsy of the adult and the child, but it is also prescribed in the treatment of different other pathologies of nervous system. The divalproate sodium is indicated in the treatment of bipolar disorders. The valproic acid is marketed under various pharmaceutical forms, with different corresponding tmax values. But, whatever the administered preparation, the circulating active molecule is the ion valproate. Elimination half-life is from 11 to 20 h. Metabolization of valproate is important and represents its main route of elimination. Valpromide is comparable to a prodrug which metabolizes in valproate. The inter and intraindividual variability of the plasma concentrations are important. Several studies show a concentration-effect relationship, but two interventional trials ended in the lack of interest of the Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM), although it is of current practice. However, numerous drug interactions may modify the plasma concentrations of valproate. The therapeutic range is from 50 to 100 mg\/L (346-693 micromol\/L). The level of proof of the interest of the TDM for this molecule was estimated in: recommended.","1089":"Clobazam is a 1,5 benzodiazepine available in France since 1975, used in add-on with the other anticonvulsant drugs in the treatment of refractory epilepsies of child and adult and for the treatment of anxiety of adult. It is mainly metabolized in desmethylclobazam, or norclobazam, active metabolite, present in a concentration approximately eight times superior to that of the parent drug, but with an activity of the order of 20 to 40% of that of clobazam. Elimination half-life of clobazam is of 18 h while that of norclobazam is from 40 to 50 h. There is a large interindividual variability in the plasma concentrations. Furthermore, clobazam being prescribed in add-on with the other anticonvulsant drugs in resistant epilepsies, concentration-effect relationship is difficult to bring to light, since, in many studies, the patients who did not answer received the highest doses. Adverse reactions are moderated, appearing more often for the highest concentrations; also the phenomenon of tolerance seems more frequent in high concentrations. However, because of the kinetic interactions, a dosage of clobazam and norclobazam can be useful in certain cases. There is no validated therapeutic range, but the usual concentrations are in the range of 100-300 microg\/L for the parent drug and about ten times more for the metabolite. The level of proof of the interest of the Therapeutic Drug Monitoring for this molecule is estimated in: rather useless.","1090":"Clonazepam is a 1-4 benzodiazepine mainly used to treat epilepsy and epileptiform convulsion state. Rapidly absorbed after oral administration, it is widely distributed in the organism and is extensively converted in metabolites, poorly or not active, eliminated mainly in urine (70%) and feces. Elimination half-life is long, around 40 h. In adult and child, several studies showed a concentration-effect relation. Meanwhile, a large inter-individual variability in the dose-concentration relation was observed. A 15-50 microg\/L range of clonazepam blood concentrations appears to be retained as an acceptable target to control a majority of epileptic seizures. The Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) of clonazepam can be considered as possibly useful in case of association with CYP450 inducers or inhibitors, suspicion of poor observance, or toxicity signs.","1091":"During the last decade, imatinib was current gold standard treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), showing a great effectiveness. Thus, the Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM), rarely applied in clinical oncology practice, did not appear necessary at the moment. However, the absence of response among patients and the metabolic profile of imatinib (involving the CYP3A4) suggested the existence of a great interindividual variability. During the last 4 years, studies about the pharmacokinetic\/pharmacodynamic relationship have confirmed this variability and highlighted a relation between the trough concentrations of imatinib and the clinical response. An effectiveness threshold, close to 1000 ng\/mL, seems to be correlated with better cytogenetic and molecular responses. Consequently, TDM could assist in investigation of the observance, the absence of response, the drug-drug interactions, but the proof of its utility requires complementary studies. In conclusion, the level of proof of imatinib TDM in LMC varies between levels \"recommended\" and \"potentially useful\".","1092":"Oral etoposide displays high inter- and intra-variability. Convincing relationships were observed between hematological toxicities and exposure of which total etoposide area under the curve seems the more relevant in routine practice.

This enzyme displays important inter subject variability linked to a genetic polymorphism: when treated with standard doses of thiopurine, TPMT-deficient and heterozygous patients are at great risk for developing severe and potentially life-threatening toxicity (hematopoietic, hepatic, mucositis...) but show a better survival rate while patients with high TPMT activity (wild type) present lower peripheral red blood cells 6-TGN concentrations and a higher risk of leukemia relapse. Genotyping remains crucial before 6-MP administration at diagnosis to identify patients with homozygous mutant TPMT genotype and therefore prevent severe and life-threatening toxicity, and to individualize therapy according to TMPT genotype. Follow-up of ALL treatment should preferentially be based on repeated determinations of intracellular active metabolites (6-thioguanine nucleotides) and methylated metabolites in addition to haematological surveillance.","1096":"Azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, and 6-thioguanine are immunosuppressive drugs indicated in the prevention of graft rejection, and treatment of auto-immune disease or inflammatory bowel disease. Their anti-nucleotidic properties are also used for the treatment of acute leukaemia. Their metabolism involves thiopurine methyl transferase, which activity varies according to genetic polymorphisms. In inflammatory bowel disease patients, there is no recommended therapeutic range of intra-erythrocyte 6-thioguanine nucleotide concentration, the active metabolite. Therapeutic drug monitoring of 6-thioguanine nucleotide concentrations is however proposed in the following clinical situations: to check the observance, to try to explain therapeutic failure, to manage patients with limited thiopurine methyl transferase activity or patients treated with associated drugs that can modify thiopurine methyl transferase activity. The literature review shows that high concentrations of 6-thioguanine nucleotides and methylated metabolites are associated with an increased risk of bone marrow toxicity. In addition, high concentrations of methylated metabolite might increase the risk of hepatic toxicity. These major side-effects can be prevented by the use of pre-treatment screening for thiopurine methyl transferase activity or genotype in inflammatory bowel disease patients in order to propose an adapted dosing.","1097":"Therapeutic drug monitoring is currently investigated in patients receiving the drug by prolonged continuous infusion, either alone or associated with other chemotherapy agents.

Literature data indicate that threshold levels of exposure, as assessed by the area under the concentration-time curve, are associated with an increased risk of toxicity in patients treated for either a colorectal or a head and neck cancer. Kinetically guided dose adjustment may thus be proposed for the ongoing or the next cycle of chemotherapy. Historical comparisons and the results of a phase III multicenter randomized study in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer showed that dose-adapted fluorouracil resulted in significantly improved objective response rate, a trend to higher survival rate and fewer grade III-IV toxicities. Real-time fluorouracil monitoring may also help identifying patients with higher than expected exposure, thus providing a basis for intensifying supportive care in these patients.","1098":"After HD-MTX infusions, i.e. at a dose&gt;1 g\/m2, monitoring of serum MTX concentrations is a standard practice which helps reducing the incidence of toxicity in patients with decreased clearance by guiding dose adjustment of leucovorin.

This practice is supported by numerous observations of exposure-related toxicity as well as some clinical studies comparing drug exposure between patients with and without toxicity. Despite no prospective clinical study has clearly demonstrated the usefulness of methotrexate TDM, historical comparison reveals a huge reduction of toxicity-related events over past decades.

It is indicated in association in the treatment of partial epilepsy with or without secondary generalization. Zonisamide is well absorbed with maximum concentration achieved in 2 to 5h. It is partly metabolized by the CYP3A4. Its elimination half-life is very long, around 60h. Studies in adults and children show low concentration-efficacy and concentration-toxicity correlations, but a therapeutic range has been determined between 10 and 40 mg\/L. Zonisamide is sensitive to the inductive molecules of CYP which will increase its clearance and decrease its half-life. A specific monitoring of patient is recommended in renal impairment. For this molecule, the interest of TDM has been evaluated: possibly useful. ","1155":null,"1156":"Topiramate, a second generation anticonvulsant drug, is marketed in France since 1997. It is also indicated in the prophylaxis of headache and is used, except legal notices, in the treatment of neuropathic pains and bipolar disorders. The efficiency and the risk of adverse reactions are dose dependent. However, the good correlation between the dosage and the plasmatic concentrations, and the relatively low interindividual variability, when we take into account the age and the association with an enzyme inducer, are not in favour of the interest of a dosage. Furthermore, there is a covering range between the effective and not effective concentrations, and levels susceptible or not to facilitate the appearance of an adverse event. There is no validated therapeutic range, but to the usual dosages the plasma concentrations are included between 5 and 20 mg\/L(15-60 |imo]\/L), mostly in the low part of this interval. For this molecule, the level of proof of the interest of the TDM was estimated in: possibly useful.

Only certain antihistaminic H1 have the marketing authorization for treatment of childhood insomnia. Very few studies have been made in children about the hypnotics that are most widely used in adult patients: zopiclone, zolpidem and the hypnotic benzodiazepines. However, melatonin has recently become the most studied hypnotic drug in children since the marketing of a sustained-released form gave it the status of a drug and improved its pharmacokinetic properties. In child psychiatry, pharmacological treatment of insomnia should be considered in patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in which sleep disturbances can be aggravated by psycho stimulant treatment, in autism spectrum disorders, and in the anxiety\/depression. ","1159":"To describe the characteristics and the management of migraine. Data on headaches, drug consumption and life habits of 762 patients were collected using questionnaires and pharmacy records. The migraine attack was characterized by a severe pain for more than 80% of the patients. The frequency was more than 2 attacks a week in 16% of the cases. Eighty four per cent of the patients had triptans and 45% had a long-term migraine treatment. Nonspecific analgesics were prescribed for 55%. The frequency of over-consumption of treatments of migraine attacks was 46%. The management of migraine still remains inadequate. The pharmacist could contribute to its improvement. ","1160":"PUVA therapy and narrowband UVB therapy (NBUVB) constitute a widely used first line therapy in mycosis fungoides (MF). It is a retrospective study dealing with 7 patients with MF treated by phototherapy [3 with PUVA (III, IV, V phototype) and 4 with NBUVB (III-IV phototype)]. One patient had both treatments (PUVA then NBUVB for a relapse). Complete response (CR) was achieved in 2 of the 3 patients treated with PUVA (they had stage IB-MF). Both had relapsed after 40 sessions and 7 months later, respectively. Relapses were treated by PUVA maintenance treatment (2 sessions\/2 weeks) and NBUVB leading to CR. The third patient (stage IIA) did not respond to PUVA. CR was obtained in the 5 patients treated with NBUVB (stage IA-IB), after a mean cumulative dose of 58.3 J\/cm(2). No relapse was noted with NBUVB after a mean follow-up period of 13.2 months (extremes: 2 -31 months). NBUVB is only effective on non-infiltrated plaques independently of phototype. PUVA therapy is effective even on infiltrated plaques. Both treatments do not prevent relapses. ","1161":"The influence of co-administration of zinc (10 mg\/kg, intraperitoneal [ip]) and ascorbic acid (10, 20 and 30 mg\/kg, ip) against lead (lead acetate; 35 mg\/kg, ip for 3 days) induced biochemical alterations was studied in young albino rats. The results revealed significant fall in hemoglobin content, on the other hand significant raise in the activity of serum transaminases and serum alkaline phosphatase after lead administration. Significant increase in lipid peroxidation and decreased level of reduced glutathione in liver showed oxidative stress due to lead exposure. Total protein content in liver and kidney were diminished after lead exposure. Activity of acid phosphatase in liver and kidney and alkaline phosphatase in kidney was increased significantly. Zinc and ascorbic acid treatment showed moderate therapeutic efficacy when administered individually, whereas more pronounced protective effects were observed after combined therapy of zinc and different doses of ascorbic acid. The results thus, suggested that co-administration of zinc and ascorbic acid may be useful in restoration of lead induced biochemical alterations.","1162":"The article attempts to construct a typology to the use of psychoactive drugs and the study of the various factors linked to their use, whether heavy or regular. The results draw on the exploitation of databases containing medicines presented for reimbursement by medical insurance in the Nord - Pas-de-Calais region. In 2007 and 2008, 20.7% of the insured population (764,650 people) benefited from reimbursements for this type of medication. Among the beneficiaries, about a third (30.5%) had an intense consummation. Age, the CMUs benefits and the fact that a person is or not followed by a psychiatrist are the most influential variables on the intensity and the regularity of intake. The observed regularity of the recourse to benzodiazepines does not conform with the current recommendations.","1163":"The aim of this meeting was to describe the news trends about abuse and addiction of anxiolytics and hypnotics. The part II of this meeting reviewed several aspects of the withdrawing benzodiazepines focusing in particular on clinical symptoms, biological patterns, and strategies for discontinuation. The discontinuation is usually beneficial due to the importance of adverse effects induced by long-term use of benzodiazepines. Several clinicals options have been described including gradual tapering of the current benzodiazepine, substitution with a long acting benzodiazepines or treating the symptoms of withdrawal. Psychological interventions range from a simple support through counselling to expert cognitive-behavioural therapy. However more controlled clinical trials are needed to promote adequate and optimal patient care in management of benzodiazepine withdrawing.","1164":null,"1165":null,"1166":"","1167":"Diagnostic and interventional radiology of patients is nowadays crucial with increasing requirement for iodinated contrast agents infusion. Besides adverse reactions after administration of the iodinated contrast agents due to their toxicity, immediate hypersensitivity reactions and reactions resembling delayed hypersensitivity appearing from 1 hour to several days later, have been reported. Patients at high risk to develop such adverse events have to be detected on the basis of their risk factors in order to prevent or limit serious outcomes. Previous reactions to contrast media, asthma, atopy and cardiovascular disorders are risk factors for anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions. Female gender, age and beta-blockers increase the severity. This article aims to summarize the risk of allergic reactions related to the use of iodinated contrast agents and to suggest a way for diagnosis, treatment and prevention according to each clinical situation.","1168":"A 33-year-old man was hospitalized unconscious on suspicion of acute diazepam and hexobarbital intoxication, a barbiturate not marketed in France. Its quantification was developed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry detection and validated on one-hundred microL of plasma extracted by a liquid\/liquid method. Hexobarbital and diazepam concentrations in initial plasma samples were at toxic levels, respectively 15 900 ng\/mL and 13 800 ng\/mL. Hexobarbital toxicokinetic was studied during 175 h and analysed with a non-compartmental model. Half-life value of 61,8 h was found, being much longer than already published hexobarbital half-lives (between 3.2 h and 6.9 h). The reasons of this long half-life were discussed according to metabolism and pharmacogenetic.","1169":"Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is characterized by a specific pharmacological sensitivity. JME is controlled by certain antiepileptic drugs but may be aggravated by others. Valproate is the treatment of choice of this epilepsy. Among the \"newer\" antiepileptic drugs those that appear to be useful are lamotrigine, topiramate, zonisamide and levetiracetam. We present a patient with JME who experienced myoclonic status epilepticus every months not controlled with lamotrigine monotherapy (200 mg\/d), not controlled with levetiracetam monotherapy (1000 mg\/d). Addition of valproate (500 mg\/d) to levetiracetam fully controlled the seizures and levetiracetam was reduced to 500 mg\/d. The patient is presently seizure free.","1170":"To evaluate occurrence of the inappropriate prescriptions in a psychiatric department. In this prospective survey over a two-month period, the medical orders were analysed. Inappropriate prescription was defined as any discrepancy with summary of product characteristics (SPC) or our hospital treatment guidelines. One hundred inpatients (72 women, mean age 37.5+\/-15 years) were included. We reviewed 495 medication orders, which represent 1875 prescribed drugs. We found 2636 discrepancies with SPC or our hospital treatment guidelines. The proportion of discrepancies related to legal informations was 21.28% and them related to pharmacotherapy was 55.04%. The proportion of discrepancy per patient was estimated to 4.93%. Our study shows a high proportion of inappropriate prescriptions, none of them having induced adverse-drug effects. ","1171":"Failures may occur in each part of the medication use process. This study aimed to evaluate the barriers existing in hospital pharmacies in order to prevent medication errors and to help institutions to make improvement actions. Within the framework of the SECURIMED project, risk assessment visit (interviews, observations, analysis of adverse event scenario by professionals...) were conducted in volunteer hospital pharmacies. A restitution meeting, after visit in each pharmacy permitted exchanges between visitors and professionals on barriers and weaknesses and then on solutions to reduce identified risks. Twenty-one hospital pharmacies participated. Despite presence of safeguards in some pharmacies, many weaknesses were retrieved (multiplicity of process, lack of resources...) and clinical pharmacy was not enough developed. This project has led to an overview of the situation in Aquitaine, and created a regional dynamic to improve the medication system safety. ","1172":"To evaluate in real conditions the role of drugs in heat-related adverse effects. We performed a multicentric case-control study in 3 university hospitals in France, including 36 cases (patients older than 65 years hospitalized with hyperthermia or dehydration between 1st July and 31st August 2007) and 51 controls. We compared drugs and changes in drug dosage according to the values of renal function. At inclusion, clearance creatinine was available for only 12 patients (mean = 31.6 ml\/min), and three-fold higher in controls (p &lt; 0.001). Cases took more drugs than controls (4.3 vs. 3.9; p &lt; 0.001), particularly neuroleptic drugs (3.6% vs. 0.5%; p = 0.007). Despite its small size, our study shows that patients suffering from dehydration in summer are those with more severe renal impairment, taking more drugs (particularly neuroleptics). This pilot work could allow to improve methodology of further studies on drugs during heat waves. ","1173":"Publication of case reports describing suspected adverse effects of drugs and medical products that include herbal and complementary medicines, vaccines and other biologicals and devices is important for postmarketing surveillance. Publication lends credence to important signals raised in these adverse event reports. Unfortunately, deficiencies in vital information in published cases can often limit the value of such reports by failing to provide enough details for either (i) a differential diagnosis or provisional assessment of cause-effect association, or (ii) a reasonable pharmacological or biological explanation. Properly described, a published report of one or more adverse events can provide a useful signal of possible risks associated with the use of a drug or medical product which might warrant further exploration. A review conducted by the Task Force authors found that many major journals have minimal requirements for publishing adverse event reports and some have none at all. Based on a literature review and our collective experience in reviewing adverse event case reports in regulatory, academic and industry settings, we have identified information that we propose should always be considered for inclusion in a report submitted for publication. These guidelines have been endorsed by the International Society for Pharmacoepidemiology (ISPE) and the International Society of Pharmacovigilance (ISoP) and are freely available on the societies' web sites. Their widespread distribution is encouraged. ISPE and ISoP urge biomedical journals to adopt these guidelines and apply them to case reports submitted for publication. They also encourage schools of medicine, pharmacy, and nursing to incorporate them into the relevant curricula that address the detection, evaluation and reporting of suspected drug or other medical product adverse events.","1174":"The prescriptions for psychoactive drugs presented to the Health Insurance system for reimbursement of charges are a source of information about some psychological illnesses and disorders in the context of the overuse of these drugs in France. In Nord - Pas-de-Calais Region, out of a total of 5 070 160 prescriptions in 2007, 576 493 individuals benefited from at least one such drug. Over the period of the study, 15.6% of the population of the region covered took at least one psychotropic medication. The rate of use was 11.7% for benzodiazepines, 7.6% for anti-depressants, 1.8% for anti-psychotics, 0.5% for treatment of alcohol dependence and 0.3% for opiate substitution therapy (OST). For the first three of these classes rate of use increased steadily with age. It was invariably much higher in women than in men. Men were treated more frequently for alcoholism and heroin dependency; the proportion taking medication initially increased with age (up to 40-49 years for alcohol dependency and 30-39 years for OST), before falling thereafter.","1175":"In this feasibility study of an observational nature, we used the protocol 'AnalyTox-Op' to compare analytical data with anamnestic reports gathered from specialized drug addiction treatment centers. These data were collected from 32 drug addicts who were patients undergoing treatment with addictive drug substitutes or prescribed psychotropic drugs. Urine toxicology screens were performed using immunological methods followed by confirmation with more specific techniques, i.e. gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography with diode array detection (HPLC-DB). While complete agreement between patient reports of drug consumption (obtained from a questionnaire) and analytical data was only observed in 13 out of the 32 cases, a very good concordance was seen with opiate substitutes (88% with methadone and high-dosage buprenorphine, combined) and legally prescribed psychotropic drugs. Of note, however, was the omission of illicit drug use in patient questionnaires, especially with cocaine (22%) and recreational opiates (22%), causing discordance in the comparison. This study is currently being expanded to include a large number of participants across the country with the aim of obtaining data under homogeneous conditions, verifying the discordance we found and determining its significance.","1176":"The collection of human biological samples is of major importance for future research in France and Europe. In recent years, new regulatory procedures have been designed to monitor these activities; but they are somewhat complex and some clarifications are needed. The law needs also to be amended. The definition of biobanking activities should be clarified, and regulatory procedures, including consultation of the Ethics Committee, declarations to the Ministry of Research and the protection of personal data, should be simplified. It is also of great importance to correctly define the modalities in which Biobanks are granted their authorisations. The role of Ethics Committees regarding the evaluation of information and the consent procedures should also be clarified, particularly when samples from children are used, or when the samples are used for genetic analyses. As well as scientific and public health aspects, the storage of human biological samples may also have important economic consequences. It is hence crucial to adapt the procedure for submitting patents, particularly when several public or private partners are working together. The possible changes to both French and European laws planned in the next months would be an ideal time to introduce these changes.","1177":"Venous thromboembolism is a serious disease that can be life-threatening in case of pulmonary embolism or induce major sequelae. Patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery represent a population at high risk of venous thromboembolism. Recently Pradaxa has demonstrated its efficacy and safety versus enoxaparin in 2 pivotal trials. Beyond these clinical benefits on the treatment duration observed, the budget impact model's objective was to assess, from the French Sickness Funds perspective for retail market, the consequence of the introduction of this new drug on French setting for a theoretical, representative sample of 1,000 patients in each indication. The cost saving estimated by the model was in excess of 36,000 Euros per 1,000 procedures for total hip replacements. A univariate sensitivity analysis showed that the budget impact was robust and remained positive with the utilisation of Pradaxa in all cases tested.","1178":"Treatment of hypertension increasingly requires association of drugs. Among them, the association of calcium antagonists with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors is a new tempting approach since the two pharmaceutical classes have synergistic effects on blood pressure lowering and target organ protection whereas their effect is antagonistic for adverse events. Numerous large randomized clinical trials have validated this treatment strategy, and new fixed association are being developed. They apply to hypertensive patients, but also to coronary artery disease patients and more generally speaking to high cardiovascular risk subjects.","1179":"Apelin is a recently identified peptide which plays an important role in cardiovascular function and in water metabolism. Apelin and its receptor APJ (apelin system) are involved in zebra fish and xenopus cardiovascular development. Apelin is a pro-angiogenic factor. Apelin is a potent cardiac inotropic agent and exerts a vasodilatory effect in arterial and venous territories. Apelin decreases vasopressin production and its plasma level is conversely related to plasma vasopressin. Several effects of the apelin system counteract those of the renin angiotensin system. It may represent a new and promising therapeutic opportunity for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.","1180":"","1181":"","1182":"","1183":"","1184":"","1185":"","1186":null,"1187":"Frequently, in data packages submitted for Marketing Approval to the CHMP, there is a lack of relevant head-to-head comparisons of medicinal products that could enable national authorities responsible for the approval of reimbursement to assess the Added Therapeutic Value (ASMR) of new clinical entities or line extensions of existing therapies.Indirect or mixed treatment comparisons (MTC) are methods stemming from the field of meta-analysis that have been designed to tackle this problem. Adjusted indirect comparisons, meta-regressions, mixed models, Bayesian network analyses pool results of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), enabling a quantitative synthesis.The REAL procedure, recently developed by the HAS (French National Authority for Health), is a mixture of an MTC and effect model based on expert opinions.

The results of these studies are used in particular for re-evaluation, re-registration or in applications for reimbursement. Since 1997, 134 requests for post-registration studies have been made either by the French Transparency Committee (CT) and\/or the Committee for Pricing of Healthcare Products (CEPS) and the results of these studies were taken into account in the re-evaluation of Actual Benefit (AB) or Improvement in Actual Benefit (IAB). During the roundtable discussion on this subject at the National Clinical Pharmacology Meeting held at Giens (France), the difficulties in performing such studies were identified and proposals were made to predict and anticipate requests for these studies but also for the training of physicians.","1190":"The term \"theranostics\" characterizes a particular combination of the coupled use of a drug therapy with a diagnostic test (called \"companion diagnostics\"). The diagnostic test marks out the technical means used to identify a biomarker which allows for adjusting the use of the new drug.Theranostics promise a significant step forward for the use of personalized medicine, better tailored for patients in terms of efficacy and tolerance. The development process of theranostics is complex since it requires a proper phasing from development to reimbursement, through a collaborative and controlled approach.The task force's recommendations should form the basis for reflection and action amongst the different players in the field of the development of theranostics.All stages of the system meeting heterogeneous and asynchronous rules should be harmonized to allow for simultaneous availability of, and access to the drug and test. Nevertheless, it is necessary to simplify the regulations to enable a better adaptation of theranostics to the speed of innovation.","1191":null,"1192":"The working group focused on defining exploratory trials on medicinal products and developing recommendations for their implementation in France (notably concerning non-clinical requirements, the pharmaceutical quality of the investigational medical product and the conditions under which this type of clinical trial may be performed).To this end, the working group took account of existing guidelines (notably those in the USA and Belgium) and a draft revision of the ICH M3 guideline.Exploratory trials are clinical trials performed early in Phase I, prior to dose escalation and safety and tolerability trials. These trials are de facto first-in-man studies but lack a therapeutic or diagnostic goal and do not seek to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The objective is to answer precise questions which condition the continuation or suspension of the drug's development program. Exploratory trials include a small number of patients or healthy subjects and expose them (over a short period of time) to a low dose of an investigational medicinal product.The draft revision of M3 describes five approaches (two involving microdoses and three with pharmacological doses).The group's main recommendations can be summarized as follows:An exploratory trial may be performed when it is (i) justified, (ii) useful for product development and (iii) consistent with prerequisites. The pharmaceutical dossier should take account of the low quantity of product available, the short period of product administration and the low doses used. Good Manufacturing Practices can be adapted accordingly. The non-clinical dossier should also be adapted to suit the development phase and particular features of product use. In this respect, the group has commented on the recommendations in the draft revision of M3. The protocol must be designed to provide answers to a set of specific, pertinent questions concerning this administration phase - particularly on choice of the initial dose, the size of the dose escalation and the rules for subject withdrawal and trial suspension. In general, so-called \"vulnerable\" populations should not be involved in this type of trial, apart from duly justified exceptions. The group considered that approaches 3 to 5 should only apply to a medicinal product intended for treatment of a severe or rare disease or a condition with significant unmet medical needs. Pre-filing at the Afssaps (the French Agency for Healthcare Product Safety) is recommended, notably for approaches using pharmacological doses.","1193":"The roundtable 1 \"Relevance of the evaluation criteria used in clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease\" made reference to the guideline published by the EMEA (European Medicines Agency) in July 2008 on the development of new treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias, and addressed principally two of the three indications listed in the guideline: symptomatic improvement and disease-modification (primary prevention was hardly discussed). The discussions focussed on two main aspects: improvement of the selection of patients in clinical trials and clinical evaluation and biomarkers. The following suggestions were made:Reinforce the interest for clinical trials at the early stages of AD (including prodromal stage), particularly for disease-modifiers. Strengthen the research centers' expertise with biomarkers, in a perspective of subsequent use in clinical trials, either for the description of the patients included, or as part of selection criteria. Furthermore, ongoing intercenter validation studies, in France, of neuro-imaging and biomarker assays in CSF, are essential for preparing multicenter clinical trials. Facilitate the conduct of ancillary studies with biomarkers, grafted on clinical studies. Further develop the training and experience of raters with functional scales, which are now required as one of the two primary endpoints in pivotal clinical trials, and with the additional items of ADAS-cog (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment scale, Cognitive sub scale), which are useful for the early stages of AD. Improve knowledge of functional clinical scales by in depth analysis of available databases, through public\/private collaborations. Improve knowledge of relationship between rating scales used in clinical trials and tools used in clinical practice (which are usually different), in order to provide supporting evidence for the interpretation of the clinical relevance of clinical trials results. Consider the potential needs of adaptation of rating scales to the societal changes, in particular for the evaluation of cognitive performance. Discuss the possibility of measures for extending data protection for candidate disease-modifiers, considering the negative impact for all players of the constraints of duration and the difficulties of clinical trials. Further discuss the ethics and acceptability of placebo-controlled monotherapy studies on durations of 6-9 months.","1194":null,"1195":"Extracts of Withania adpressa Coss.

The bioassay-guided fractionation of this plant extracts results a novel withanolide 14alpha,15alpha,17beta ,20beta-tetrahydroxy-1-oxo-(22R)-witha-2,5,24-trienolide and the already identified withanolides F and J extract, semi-purified fractions and pure compounds exhibits potent cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines tested, in dose-dependent manner. Morphological features of treated Hep2 cells with the novel withanolide and characteristic DNA fragmentation revealed that the cytotoxicity was due to induction of apoptosis. Taken together, the results suggest that withanolides from W. adpressa Coss. hold potential as antiproliferative agents.","1196":"Treatment of patients with both atrial fibrillation and heart failure remains uneasy. In theory maintenance of sinus rhythm is desirable but the only pharmacological intervention able to do it safely is amiodarone. A trial of strategy randomisation, restoration of sinus rhythm or slowing of atrial fibrillation, has been done in patients with both atrial fibrillation and heart failure. This trial, named AF-CHF has shown neutral results, the 2 strategies, rhythm control or simple rate control were similar in terms of mortality. Dronedarone is an innovative drug bringing new possibilities in the treatment of atrial fibrillation but it is contra-indicated in case of severe heart failure. Another possible approach is that of non pharmacological techniques. Sinus rhythm maintenance may be obtained by pulmonary vein isolation. The other possibility is the ablation of atrio-ventricular node with implantation of a pacemaker, technique which is reserved to selected patients.","1197":"Ivabradine is an I(f) current inhibitor, that has documented antianginal efficacy. The BEAUTIFUL trial tested ivabradine against placebo in a large population of 10,917 patients in sinus rhythm, with coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction, defined as left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; or =35%. Overall, there was no impact of ivabradine on the primary end-point of the trial (cardiovascular mortality, hospitalisation for myocardial infarction, new onset or worsening heart failure). In the placebo arm of the trial, baseline heart rate &gt; or = 70 bpm was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, heart failure and coronary revascularisation. In the subgroup of patients with a baseline heart rate &gt; or =70 bpm, treatment with ivabradine resulted in a significant, 36% reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction and a 20% reduction in the need for coronary revascularisation. Ivabradine was well tolerated, with an increased rate of treatment discontinuation, mainly due to bradycardia, compared with placebo. Because of its safety and efficacy to control angina, ivabradine should be considered first-line antianginal treatment in coronary artery disease patients with left ventricular dysfunction and increased heart rate, already receiving beta-blocker therapy or in whom these medications are not tolerated.","1198":"The concept of heart failure with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction has replaced that of diastolic heart failure. It is today the most frequent presentation of heart failure because of the progressive aging of the population. Its prognosis appears to be similar to that of heart failure with reduced systolic function. B type natriuretic peptide dosing as well as doppler-echocardiography are useful for the diagnosis. Today, no treatment has revealed effective but clinical trials have been scarce. Renin-angiotensin system antagonists have promising properties but haven't shown efficacy. This article reviews the epidemiologic, diagnostic, pathophysiologic and therapeutic aspects of the disease.","1199":"Heart failure is associated with endothelial dysfunction, characterized especially by a decreased nitric oxide (NO) production. The main consequences of this dysfunction appear to be: 1) at the coronary level, an altered myocardial perfusion associated with increased cardiac metabolic demand and, 2) at the peripheral level, an increased arterial resistance leading to increased afterload and cardiac work. Such an endothelial dysfunction may thus contribute to aggravate heart failure and represents an important pharmacological target in this disease. Indeed, these endothelial alterations may be reduced by \"classic\" treatments of heart failure (e.g. inhibitors of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system), as well as more recent approaches (e.g. ivabradine). Moreover, new approaches have been recently developed to specifically target the endothelial NO production, for example via inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, that may ultimately lead to new treatment of heart failure based on endothelial protection.","1200":"Heart rate (HR) is an independent predicting factor of cardiovascular events in patients with advanced heart failure. Clinical trials conducted with beta-blockers have demonstrated that reduction of HR is a fundamental mechanism to explain the reduction of morbidity-mortality in such a disease. Trials conducted with ivabradine, the first selective inhibitor of the I(f) current in cardiac pacemaker cells, have also clearly confirmed that reduction of HR lead to powerful and sustained favourable effects in patients with cardiac failure and post-infarcted myocardial diseases. These effects are not only due to the reduction of the risk factors associated with myocardial ischemia but also to the reduction of cardiac and perivascular fibrosis associated with the remodelling process at the ventricular level. Although the mechanisms associated with reduction of HR following administration of beta-blockers and ivabradine are to a large extent similar, others like their effects on post-systolic contraction are totally opposed. So, new clinical trials are necessary to know whether it is possible to substitute these drugs or conversely to associate them for an optimal therapeutic strategy in patients with advanced heart failure and post-infarcted myocardium.","1201":"Heart failure is a complex illness with multiple etiologies. Therapeutic targets are numerous such as neurohormonal blockade (adrenergic and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems). Progress in therapeutic strategy and efficacy could be expected from individual treatment taking into account biomarkers so called \"theragnostic\". Animal models, classical or genetically modified, have conducted to a better identification and validation of signal pathways in heart failure. Furthermore these models allow testing of new hypothesis and therapeutic approaches, although cardiovascular physiology and physiopathological patterns are far different in animals than in humans (haemodynamic conditions, kinetic development of the illness, old age, ...). Last, identification of putative theragnostic biomarkers is easier (i.e. free access, homogeneity of experimental cohorts). Genetically modified models by classical additive transgenesis techniques or gene targeting have an important role in discovery of new pharmacological targets in heart failure. Study of the role of aldosterone and of its receptor (mineralocorticosteroid receptor) in the physiopathology of heart failure and as a new therapeutic target will be used as an Ariane's clew to demonstrate that translational bidirectional research (from integrated experimental model to bedside and from clinical results to bench) has allowed from these 15 last years: i) to propose changes in therapeutic strategies and ii) to stimulate research of new targets and new mineralocorticosteroid receptor antagonists.","1202":"Epidemiological studies have pointed out the continuous and significant increase of heart failure prevalence as well as the change of the patients profile in relation to therapeutic and technological improvement in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. A new entity has thus been identified especially among the elderly: heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. This pathology is still not well identified, although its clinical specifications and its prognosis have been specified, as some uncertainties concerning the disease-modifying drug remain. Concerning systolic heart failure, progress in pharmacological treatments and in medical devices has lead to a decrease in sudden death and to a lengthening of survival duration, while both advanced heart failure and hospitalization for acute heart failure rates are increasing. Progress in cardiac surgery, and interventional cardiology partly explains these evolutions. At the same time, pharmacological treatments such as diuretics and digitalics have been replaced by neurohormonal antagonists with an obvious impact on survival and quality of life. Size reduction and performance improvements of pace makers and defibrillators have been determining for this progress.Angiography, echography, RMN (Resonnance Magnetic Nuclear) and BNP (Brain Natriuretic Peptide) dosage have modified daily therapeutic recommendations, improved pathophysiological understanding and pointed out the major role of cardiac and vascular remodelling. Unfortunately, patients are still confronted with an initial or chronic treatment failure. Heart failure management programmes, taking into account patient observance and guidelines implementation, allows the improvement of the quality of life, survival and the decrease of the major costs related to this chronic illness. New pharmacological approaches, especially inotropic drugs(myosin activators, energetic metabolism modulators), new aquaretic and diuretic drugs and even new left ventricular assistance devices or implantable artificial heart are thus essential.","1203":"","1204":"","1205":"The efficacy of lithium in the prevention of bipolar disorders is now well established. However, acute lithium intoxications still occur, often after suicide attempts. Symptoms are often different from one patient to the other, and long lasting neurologic sequelae may happen.

We report cases quoted in the department of intensive care of Tours University Hospital over the last three years and compared them with the literature. Lithium level and treatment of these intoxications were analysed. Although new medicines are available for the treatment of bipolar disorders, lithium is still an important drug in this disease, therefore, the prescribers have to be aware of the consequences of acute lithium intoxications.","1206":"The use of amikacin is difficult because of its toxicity and its pharmacokinetic variability. This variability is almost ignored in adult standard dosage regimens since only the weight is used in the dose calculation. Our objective is to test if the pharmacokinetic of amikacin can be regarded as homogenous, and if the method for calculating the dose according to patients' weight is appropriate. From a cohort of 580 patients, five groups of patients were created by statistical data partitioning. A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed in each group. The adult population is not homogeneous in term of pharmacokinetics. The doses required to achieve a maximum concentration of 60 mg\/L are strongly different (585 to 1507 mg) between groups. The exclusive use of the weight to calculate the dose of amikacine appears inappropriate for 80% of the patients, showing the limits of the formulae for calculating doses of aminoglycosides.","1207":"The European Clinical Research Infrastructures Network (ECRIN) is designed to improve the capacity and quality of the clinical research in Europe and promote innovative pharmaceutical development. The regulation of the company-sponsored clinical trials is functionally acceptable, but other type of investigations (investigator initiated trials, trials of psychology, food supplements, devices, etc.) needs further harmonisation. Hungary joined ECRIN in 2005 and performed a lot of queries in regulation, legislation, monitoring, safety, pharmacovigilance, data management, quality assurance, etc., which are presently summarized in this paper in order to show the present situation of the complicated issues of clinical research in Hungary. This \"country report\" summarizes the present legislative and regulatory frames including the necessary issues being attached: organizing and setting-up the first representatives of clinical study centres into a network, which will facilitate the organisation and performance of multinational studies in various research areas.","1208":"Make it possible to spot falsified prescriptions which were delivered and reimbursed. 1- Use health insurance administration data bases to single patients liable to suspicion of fraud (repeated presentations of the same prescription to several pharmacies the same day) 2- Attribution of a diagnosis of fraud, by the CEIP (Center of Evaluation and Information about Pharmacodependence) based on transferred data, and by the medical department analysis of the complete file, and convocation when applicable 3- Calculation of quantitative performance of the tool. We have singled 2030 patients. Among them 25 were able to get 553 deliveries out of 288 pharmacies from 114 prescriptions in one year. Our tool specificity is 99.5% and its sensitivity 69.4%. Creating this tool which can become automatic and used on a large scale, brings a new light in the evaluation, by making hindsight fraud detection possible.

Prospective, open-label, multicenter, single-arm study of epoetin beta 30 000 I.U. once-weekly in anemic patients with solid tumors receiving chemotherapy (n = 365). Epoetin beta increased mean haemoglobin (Hb) levels from 10.3 +\/- 0.9 g\/dL at baseline to 12.3+\/-2.0 g\/dL at week 12. The response rate was achieved in 61% (CI 95%: 55-68) of the patients. The mean Hb level increased was 1.8 g\/dL (CI 95%: 1.5-2,0); in lung cancer patients (n = 102) Hb increase was 2.7 g\/dL. Treatment with epoetin beta was well tolerated; only 1.4 % patients had thrombotic events.

Maraviroc (Celsentri is a small molecule that specifically inhibits CCR5 and thereby blocks HIV entry into its target cells. Viral tropism testing is mandatory before prescribing maraviroc, due to its unique mode of action limited to CCR5-tropic viruses. Maraviroc is administered orally, twice daily. Daily dose must be adapted in case of association with a cytochrome P450 inducer or inhibitor. Efficacy of maraviroc has been demonstrated in patients failing other antiretroviral classes. Its potential for first line or switch therapy has to be proven in future trials.","1211":"Starting in the eighties, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies have profoundly modified the treatment of a number of diseases, such as cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases. The first monoclonal antibodies were of murine origin and had several drawbacks, notably low efficacy and immunogenicity. However, they initiated a breakthrough in therapeutics. Thanks to the development of biotechnology, the human part of the antibody was indeed progressively increased, leading to chimeric, humanized and, finally, fully human monoclonal antibodies. Even if the development of monoclonal antibodies is a complex process, and if some of them may trigger worrying adverse effects, their contribution to therapeutics is major. At present, about twenty monoclonal antibodies are on the market, and a large number is under development.","1212":"","1213":"","1214":"","1215":"","1216":"","1217":"","1218":"The concept of heart failure with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction has replaced that of diastolic heart failure.

A 35-year-old patient was hospitalized after the involuntary intra-radial injection of a crushed tablet of zolpidem. As the initial treatment with heparin and vasodilators was inefficient, iloprost injections were proposed. A recovery of most lesions was obtained, but the middle finger distal phalange had to be amputated. Iloprost has already been used successfully in the treatment of lesions caused by the intra-arterial injections of drugs of abuse. It can limit ischemia and even lead to necrosis healing, thus being an alternative to conventional treatments when they are ineffective.","1220":"the study was to describe the performance-enhancing behavior with licit or illicit substances in working environment, by distinguishing them from dependence behavior. in 2007, 663 workers without dependence at nicotine and alcohol was questioned by anonymous self-questionnaire during the periodic consultation of occupational medicine.

The choice of the right antiepileptic drug is not always easy. It depends on its efficacy in specific seizure types and epilepsies, and on its tolerability in individual patients. When using antiepileptic drugs, the clinician should be aware of their potential for aggravating specific forms of epilepsy, especially idiopathic generalized epilepsy. The characteristics of \"older\" and \"newer\" antiepileptic drugs are reviewed here. We report their individual characteristics including mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, dosage, indications, side effects, interactions and give some practical advices for their use.

We also conducted a review of literature to determine if aspirin was beneficial to treat human victims of DCS. Prospective observational study investigating French hyperbaric centers' prescription of aspirin to DCS' divers victims. The question we asked by mail or phone to French hyperbaric centers was: Do you give some aspirin to a diver with DCS if this treatment has not been given yet (on the site of accident). A large majority of French hyperbaric centers (77.5%) consider aspirin in DCS treatment. However this practice is not consensual. There is no evidence from the literature to support the efficiency of aspirin in DCS. Although aspirin is widely used for DCS treatment in France, more research is needed to determine if aspirin is useful.

To determinate, for older subjects, specific factors of imbalance of the oral anticoagulant treatments. Method. We conducted an epidemiological and analytical case-control study, during 18 months, in 2 geriatrics centers. Each patient with excessive anticoagulation (INR&gt;4.5) was matched with 2 controls under anticoagulant, whom the INR (international normalized ratio) had stayed in the therapeutic range. Results. One-hundred fifty nine subjects (53 cases and 106 controls) were included. Haemorrhagic complications has been observed in 19.2% of cases, versus 3.9% of the controls. Some medicines frequently prescribed to the old subjects were correlated at a risk of excessive anticoagulation: amiodarone (9.4% versus 0, p&lt;0.004), acetaminophen (18.9% versus 0.9%, p&lt;0.001), tramadol (5.6% versus 0, p&lt;0.04), ofloxacine (11.3% versus 1.9%, p&lt;0.001), and lactulose (11.3% versus 0, p&lt;0.001).

According to the analysis of the first 200 reports, received from June 2006 to August 2007, the reported adverse events are mostly serious in terms of consequences on patients' quality of life and expected. The quality of information shows that the proposed tools are adequate and could be used in case of a future change in legislation allowing patient reporting of adverse events. The patient, eventually helped by his association, may provide contributory safety information, especially regarding side effects affecting daily life.

All the patients undergoing cardiac surgery were included in the study. The end points were medical (blood transfusion) and economic (duration and cost of the stay in hospital). There were 2 groups: treated or not by glues. T Student tests. Among 154 patients, the 2 principal indications were valvular replacement (48%) and coronary artery bypass grafting (37%). Fifty seven (37%) patients received a glue. The number of transfused globular units and the duration of the stay in the intensive care unit were significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) by treated patients. Not only the use of glues did not decrease the post-operative bleedings but it increased also the cost of the stay in hospital. Guidelines were validated by the hospital Commission on drugs.

We have done a review of the literature on the effectiveness and the cautions for prescription of risperidone, a second generation antipsychotic drug. Risperidone has proved helpful in treating children and adolescents with autism spectrum, conduct and bipolar disorders, Tourette's syndrome, and schizophrenia. The principal side effects are sedation, weight gain, and metabolic disturbances. Extrapyramidal symptoms, QTc prolongation, and hyperprolactemia with clinical signs are infrequent and not clinically significant.

France (400 patients\/million inhabitants) ranked among the best European recruiters in second position behind Scandinavia. Since 2006, France has improved administrative processes and reduced deadlines for hospital contracts. Protocols are now to be given the go-ahead by French Authorities (Afssaps and CPP) within 60 days, in accordance with European directive.

This expression of HLA-G and its receptors in immunity cells confer to it a major role in immune responses. Good issues were described in organ transplantation when HLA-G was expressed. But, HLA-G transcripts and\/or proteins expression in tumor tissues was associated with tumor genesis and cancer progression.

Recommendations are given according to the compliance of research with laws and regulations in effect in France. Twenty eight projects were submitted to the CRCEC during a 18 months period, mainly observation studies in a hospital setting. Four projects were redirected towards a formal French Ethic Committees (CPP) submission. Requests of modifications concerned a lack of information relative to data confidentiality.

","1237":"The use of generics results in savings for the budget of the health insurance, and no player of health could question seriously the principle. The generic drug of a reference medicinal product defines itself as a drug having the same qualitative and quantitative composition in active ingredients, the same dosage form and the bioequivalence with this reference medicinal product was demonstrated by appropriate studies of bioavailability. It is the right to switch granted to the pharmacists in 1999 that is at the origin of the real development of these specialties on the French pharmaceutical market. Nevertheless, about 10 years later, it seems that the system in place does not offer all the necessary securities with regard to pharmacovigilance, notably for the products with narrow therapeutic margin. By strengthening and\/or by completing the role played by the health care professionals and the public institutions concerned, it is highly possible to improve the robustness of the system. Also, the recent arrival in Europe of the biosimilars, similar molecules but not bioequivalent to biological products, cause an even more tricky specific situation than that of the generics because of their nature, of the difficulty to manufacture them, and of the risk of immunogenicity. If the substitution is not permitted in several European countries including France, the other issues can appear especially in case of interchangeability requiring also, the reinforcement of certain measures.The various aspects are described in this article with concrete proposals on how the current system can be made safer, both for the generics and the biosimilars.","1238":"The general objective of this study was to proceed an inventory of measures which could help to improve the efficiency of clinical research in France. Thanks to the discussion between the members of the round-table conference (composed of medical doctors (MD)\/investigators; hospital managers; representatives of industrial promoters; general practitioners...), we have looked over the difficulties that meets clinical research in France nowadays. We identified four fields of action: 1) availability of resources for carrying out the trials in time and in quality; 2) feasibility of the clinical trials, in their design and for the recruitment which depends on both of the investigation centers and patients (what is the image of human testing in the society?); 3) skills and motivation of all the elements of staffs in charge of clinical trials (MD; nurses; and the new jobs in medical research); 4) promptness and efficiency of the administrative organisation for a fast starting up of the trials.

All the infliximab, etanercept and adalimumab prescriptions were studied over the first six month period of each year between 2004 and 2007. The indications were compared with the guidelines for therapeutic use. One thousand one hundred and ninety nine prescriptions were analysed. The number of validated prescriptions increased each year. The percentage of \"good use\" infliximab prescriptions increased from 68.4% to 98.5% from 2004 to 2007. All etanercept prescriptions corresponded to the validated indication group whereas the adalimumab prescriptions fluctuated from 100% to 75%. Few indications were prescribed apart from the guidelines (sarcoidosis, acute graft versus host disease and histiocytosis). The use of anti-TNFalpha drugs has progressed over the last 4 years, in accordance with the \"contrat de bon usage\". This is due to a better knowledge of these drugs, a good evolution of guidelines and the active participation of the medical team in the \"contrat de bon usage\" plan. ","1240":"Proper use of drugs can be defined as the use of the right product, in a correct dosage, during an adequate length of time, for a given patient and provided he has no serious side effects.It is virtually impossible, with such a number of drugs, such a number of clinical situations to prescribe adequately without using references or guidelines. References may lead to a unique choice, when the diagnosis is certain and the drug to be given is unique. With a good initial and continuous medical education, doctors can take easily this type of decision. The Summary of Products Characteristics (SPC) helps them; by sticking to this fundamental reference, prescription might be more precise and safe. In a lot of clinical situations the choice between a large numbers of therapeutic strategies necessitates use of a guideline based on scientific knowledge. Finally, a given therapeutic strategy can be as effective as and considerably less expensive than another. In such cases, payers can drive doctors to the prescription of the less expensive strategy.Some difficulties are common to all references and guidelines: 1. A lot of clinical situations are not covered by guidelines. 2. Guidelines should be updated each time there is a modification of knowledge: it is extremely difficult to do. 3. A great number of guidelines exist, issued by scientific community, health authorities or the payers. Sometime you can find a proposition in a guideline and the reverse in another guideline. It could be confusing. 4. Guidelines should be evaluated rigorously to know if they fulfil their goals. 5. Some of those guidelines simply cannot help doctors. They are too complex or do not take into account practical situations.We have made an inventory of those various guidelines and their weaknesses and we propose some solutions to increase their utility. We propose an analysis of the situation and some solutions to improve the quality and the relevance of the guidelines: to create groups of coordination to choose the aims and the elaboration methods, to initiate a register of guidelines, to list the rules for any new guideline with quality control, to propose a continue medical education for all the health workers.

The goal of these recommendations is to improve global quality of health.","1241":"","1242":"","1243":null,"1244":"The treatment of psychotic disorders has been dramatically changed by the discovery, in 1952, of antipsychotic activity of chlorpromazine and the definition of criteria for a new therapeutic class. Since then, although major improvements were done in terms of neurological tolerance and easiness to handle, today's antipsychotics are highly similar to former ones. Those treatments do not answer to all expectations of patients or practitioners, in particular regarding their metabolic or cardiologic side effects and potency to reduce cognitive deficit. Moreover, despite increasing understanding of the pathophysiology of schizophrenic disorders, this new knowledge is not or very little used in the field of therapeutics, justifying to resume research efforts to improve therapeutics in psychotic disorders. The development of a new medication follows several steps, based on precise strategies and regulations. The main streams of research concern compounds that act on dopaminergic, serotoninergic or peptidergic systems.","1245":"Functional consequences of schizophrenia are important. According to this, prevention has been developed using various approaches. The strategy based on the neuro-developmental hypothesis of the illness is not useful at the time. Identification of ultra high risk groups is an interesting way to develop possibilities of intervention which goal is to reduce the possibility of transition to psychosis in those samples. But the lack of specificity of the definition of those groups, make this strategy difficult to use in general population. Increasing the permeability of the different filters along the pathway to mental health care can be more promising in general population. By now, prevention strategies have to be improved in the filed of schizophrenia, and make the proof of ther interest beyond the research perspectives.","1246":"First and second generation antipsychotic drugs have led to major therapeutic advances in the field of schizophrenia. Since the 50ties, they have enable schizophrenic patients to be treated as out-patients, contributing to the birth of a modern psychiatry. However, several therapeutic targets have not yet been reached. This paper will focus on mortality of schizophrenic patients, mortality due to suicide or mortality due to somatic conditions. In the future, therapeutic research in the field of psychotropic drugs should focus not only on improving efficacy on psychic targets and a better profile of tolerance, but also on improvement of mortality of schizophrenic patients treated with antipsychotics, which should decrease.","1247":"There are no objective criterion of choice between the various antipsychotic treatments available in schizophrenia today. The final aim of the pharmacogenetic study of the efficacy and the tolerance of these treatments is the individual optimization of the drug treatments. Research in progress did not make it possible yet to highlight criteria usable in daily clinical practice. The assessment of larger cohorts, genetically homogeneous and prospectively evaluated should in the future make it possible to better predict the response to the treatment in particular in term of tolerance, to highlight new therapeutic targets and to better understand the mechanism of action of the current treatments.","1248":"Positrons Emission Tomography (PET) allows to evaluate the dopaminergic activity of antipsychotic, by measuring post synaptic D(2) dopaminergic receptors occupancy. A good correlation was brought forward between a rate of occupancy of 80% of striatal D(2) receptors and the occurrence of extrapyramidal effects. These PET studies have also established that at least 60% D(2) receptors occupancy was predictive of clinical antipsychotic response. The PET studies in healthy volunteers can then be used to help choose doses to be tested during the clinical trials of new antipsychotic drugs. The increase in prolactin level is one other of the markers of the antagonist dopaminergic activity which concerns D(2) receptors of the pituitary gland. The example of S 33138, a potential antipsychotic, preferential D(3) versus D(2) receptor antagonist will be given to illustrate these data. The results of two PET studies as well as the effects on prolactin and extrapyramidal signs will be presented.","1249":"Someone is called \"schizophrenic\" when suffering from a disorder described in 1911, for the first time by a Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler in a book entitled \"Dementia Praecox oder Gruppe der Schizophrenien\". In this book, Bleuler proposes a two-faced approach: one centered on the disease, the other on the person. Bleuler's main contribution was to show the importance of the latter in the determinism of clinical pictures and illness course, thus opening the way to more anthropological approaches to the schizophrenic self. Taking these approaches into account, at a time when naturalistic models of the illness are prevailing, is far from being of no consequence, as far as the effectiveness of our therapeutic actions is at issue.","1250":"In vivo animal models are indispensable both for clarifying the pathological bases of schizophrenia, and for evaluating the potential benefits and disadvantages of novel therapy. Procedures that model mnemonic impairment are of particular interest since currently-available drugs do little to improve cognitive symptoms: this is hardly surprising, in fact, since most of them potently antagonise histamine H(1), muscarinic, and\/or alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors. Further, their blockade of D(2) receptors likewise compromises cognitive performance. By contrast, D(3) receptor antagonism improves certain cognitive domains, suggesting that preferential antagonism of D(3) vs. D(2) receptors may permit enhanced effectiveness against cognitive dysfunction. The novel agent, S33138, possesses such an \"optimised\" profile and shows a unique and broad-based pattern of pro-cognitive properties in rodents and primates, in the absence of extrapyramidal and metabolic side-effects. The present article surveys the preclinical pharmacology of S33138. It also reviews developmental and genetic risk factors for schizophrenia and their experimental modeling in rodents, with a particular emphasis on sensorimotor gating and cognitive deficits.","1251":"Psychiatric disorders have a high prevalence in all countries and cultures and have a high cost in socio-economic terms. The participation of dopaminergic neurotransmission in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia is well known. However, until recently, the nature of dopaminergic dysfunctions had not been elucidated. Several recent lines of evidence show that (i) the phasic dopaminerginergic neurotransmission (as opposed to the tonic) is altered in schizophrenia and (ii) such dysfunction does not participate in the aetiology of the disease, but is rather the consequence of other dysfunctions. Although the role of serotonergic neurotransmission in mood disorders is well known, its involvement in schizophrenia is not well documented and is supported only by indirect evidence. Finally, the role of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, previously hindered by the lack of selective tools, has been supported by recent studies, but needs to be confirmed by further works before definite conclusions can be reached.","1252":"It is well established that we have to consider 3 patterns of psychotic symptoms: positive (hallucinations, delusion...), negative (affective flatness, autism...) symptoms and disorganization (ambivalence, incoherence...). In the past, ECT (electroconvulsivotherapy) was the first effective treatment in psychiatry. Conventionnal neuroleptics have been determinant in the significant evolution of care to psychotic patients. ECT use is now better defined in terms of practise and indications. Assessment of new antipsychotic medications is mainly focused on efficacy on positive symptoms. Atypical antipsychotics brought improvement in treating psychotic syndromes: they are better tolerated and more effective on the whole spectrum of psychotic syndromes including emotional symptoms than conventional neuroleptics. Atypical antipsychotics have raised questions about metabolic and cardiac risks. Compliance remains a cause of failure of many antipsychotic treatments. Treating a psychotic syndrome requires complementary strategies to medications: conditions of assistance and rehabilitation, choice of psychotherapy.

Most of the hallucinations are described as pleasant with a frequent \"sexual connotation\", uninhibited behavior or a verbal expression of patient's intimate thoughts.

However, the prescription behaviours of spa physicians remain largely unknown. A postal questionnaire concerning drug prescriptions during spa therapy and occurrence of adverse reactions to spa therapy was sent to the 95 spa physicians of South West of France. Seventy physicians answered to the survey. During spa period, most of them (67%) could associate drug prescription in complement of spa therapy. Drugs most often prescribed were analgesic (80%), non steroidal anti-inflammatory (57%) and antiinfectious (37%) drugs. Fifty nine per cent of the spa physicians could suppress part of the usual drug treatment of the patients. Spa related drugs which were the most often suppressed were anti-arthrosic and veinotonic drugs. Spa physicians could also modify or suppress drugs unrelated to the purpose of spa therapy, mainly psychotropics (anxiolytics or hypnotics), statins, diuretics or hypoglycemics (in case of inefficacy or adverse drug reactions). Spa physicians modified more drug prescriptions related to spa therapy than those unrelated to the purpose of spa therapy. Most of the spa physicians (77%) did observe adverse reactions to spa treatments. For 53% of the physicians, these adverse reactions could be \"serious\". The 2007 results were compared to those obtained during a similar survey performed 20 years before (1987). Spa therapy is often associated with change in drug prescriptions, with mainly a decrease in the number of prescribed drugs. Adverse reactions to spa therapy are rare and mainly \"unserious\". However, their imputability remains difficult to establish, thus justifying the need of a specific vigilance in spa therapy (\"SpaVigilance\").

These data related to the sales with only the pharmacies and were expressed as daily defined dose (DDD)\/1000 inhabitant-days. The consumption of the antihypertensive drugs increased from 2 to 10 DDD\/1000 between 1991 and 2005. The family of diuretics drugs was the most consumed (3.5 DDD\/1000) followed by nonassociated beta-blockers (2 DDD\/1000) in 2005.

IAB is based on two parameters, efficacy and safety of the product, in a defined target population, either as compared to one or more other drugs with similar indications, or within therapeutic strategy. The items used for evaluation, including the level of clinical effect, the relevance of the comparator, the choice of comparison criteria and the methodology used (indirect comparison, non-inferiority studies, etc.), have been reviewed by the working group in Giens with regard to an analysis of the opinion on TC issued between 2004 and 2007 in several therapeutic areas First of all, this attempt at rationalisation based on the criteria used to assess the relative added value demonstrated the rareness of direct comparative data, and was followed by a discussion on the possible broadening of the evaluation criteria. The group discussed taking into account the Public Health Impact (PHI), which has now been incorporated into the assessment of Actual Benefit (AB). The group believes that PHI seems to be more related to the notion of IAB than to that of AB. Indeed, it is frequently the relative added value of a new drug that produces an impact in public health. Conversely, considering the comparative evaluation criteria of PHI, which are not systematically taken into account in IMSR (such as improvement in the health of the population, meeting a public health need or impact on the healthcare system), PHI could legitimately be included in the assessment of the relative added value of a drug. Other parameters such as compliance or impact on professional practice have been considered. Thus, the notion of relative added value, evaluated at initial registration, could be based on an expected improvement in medical service. The notion of expected medical service leads to the requirement of producing additional data in real life (post-registration studies), which would support the definitive notion of improvement in actual benefit at the time of renewed registration, while taking into account the place occupied by the drug in the therapeutic strategy.","1269":"Non-interventional research is an essential approach to gathering data in different situations and it often complements other research methodologies, such as biomedical research and research aimed at evaluating usual care. Yet the legislative framework for this type of research is nonexistent, and this void poses a number of problems for non-interventional researchers, including an absence of any guarantee of quality and therefore of reliability, a limited recognition of the research beyond our borders, cumbersome administrative procedures, and a lack of visibility. In light of the growing demand for data, particularly in post marketing authorisation for drugs, which largely relies on non-interventional methods, the Round Table participants have issued a set of proposals for a future legislative framework for this type of research.","1270":"The general objective of this study was to agree an inventory of fixtures of clinical trials done in Dakar, in order to make recommendations to improve the quality of clinical trials in Senegal.

Despite the prophylactic treatment, 3 patients developed severe oral mucositis. Moreover, in 3 patients, palifermin was found to be responsible for the onset of severe toxidermia, which required, in 2 cases, interruption of the treatment.

However, this additive model can be questioned in the event of statistical interactions between the pharmacological and the placebo effects. Evidence in different domains has shown that the placebo effect can influence the effect of the active principle. This article evaluates the methodological, clinical and epistemological consequences of this phenomenon.

The rescue agent carboxypeptidase rapidly hydrolyses MTX to inactive metabolites. However, current criteria for carboxypeptidase use are not well defined. We retrospectively evaluated the number of patients how should have received the drug if the criteria were applied, but who didn't receive it, and analysed their toxicities. Patients treated at our institution in 2004 and 2005 and presenting the following criteria: concentrations of MTX at H48 &gt;or= 3 microM, or impaired renal function, were considered. Post-course tolerance was recorded and graded. Recovery of renal function was followed-up periodically up to the 3rd month following the end of treatment. Twenty courses over 301 (7%) and 18 patients over 120 exhibited at least one criterion. Grade 3-4 toxicity was observed in 30% of the courses, including 2 severe acute renal impairment. Renal function decreased in most patients but had recovered upon the 3rd month in all but 2 patients. Despite a higher rate of toxicity than in general population, most of the patients recovered from it.

Patient in retirement home more frequently refused substitution. Elderly patients (75 and more) were wrong with generics definition compared with others patients, and observed more adverse effects after switching (20% versus 9%--p=0.027); patients made more mistake using generics than brand-name drugs (15.5% versus 7%--p&lt;0.005); two thirds of the patients (72%) were satisfied with switching, and 57% reported to want more information and 85% of them that it comes from their GPs. Most of the patients are satisfied with generics. GPs are in an ideal position to inform their patients adequately about the equivalence of brand-name and generic drugs.

We compared a reference historic group (in which ketamine line was connected to perfusion line) to a second prospective group (in which ketamine line was connected to the venous catheter via an unidirectional valve). Psychodysleptic experiences occurrence decreased from 4 patients of 26 (15%) to 2 of 116 (2%, p = 0.01). Moreover, these experiences were no longer associated with severe anxious symptoms like near death experiences.

In order to validate this approach, we compared our data to a population of patients with diabetes identified from the French Health Insurance System claims database in one French area. The estimation of prevalence of diabetes was very close in the sources: 2.7% in the French Pharmacovigilance Database and 3.2% in the French Health Insurance System claims database.

","1303":"The Public Health Benefit (PHB) of new medicines is a recent and French-specific criterion (October 1999 decree) which is often only partially documented in the transparency files due to a lack of timely information. At the time of the first reimbursement application for a new medicine to the \"Transparency Committee\", the file is exclusively based on data from randomised clinical trials. These data are generated from a global clinical development plan which was designed a long time before the new medicine's submission for reimbursement. And this plan does not systematically provide the data needed to assess the PHB. Thus, one easily understands the difficulty to anticipate and document this recent French criterion. In France, the PHB is both one of the necessary criteria for the reimbursement submission and an indicator for the national health policy management. Its assessment also helps to identify the needs and objectives of the post-registration studies (nowadays in the scope of responsibilities of the \"Drug Economics Committee\"). The assessment of the PHB criterion is carried through after the marketing authorization process and is an addition to it. To understand how to anticipate the assessment of the new medicines' PHB, one needs to consider how it differs from the preliminary step of the marketing authorization process. Whereas the evaluation for marketing authorization seeks to determine if the new medicine could be useful in a specific indication, the PHB assessment aims at quantifying the therapeutic benefit in a population, taking into account the reference treatments in this population. A new medicine receives a marketing authorization based on the data of the registration file which provides information on the clinical benefit of the new medicine in the populations of the trials and in the context of the trials. On the other side, the PHB looks at the effects of the new medicine at the scale of the general population, in real practice. The PHB components of a new medicine at first submission are the expected response of this new medicine to a public health need, the expected benefit on the health status of the population and ultimately the expected impact on the health care system. The benefit of a new medicine on the health status of a population is based on public health criteria which can be morbi-mortality or quality of life criteria. However, few registration files contain these public health criteria from the beginning and the predictive value of the surrogate criteria used in the trials is not always precisely assessed. It is, thus, difficult to quantify the expected benefit on these public health criteria. Moreover, the data that enable to quantify the new medicine's effects according to the various characteristics of the target population, are rarely available. Similarly, the French population epidemiological data related to the indication of the new medicine are often not available at the time of the assessment. Therefore it is difficult to evaluate the expected number of events that could be avoided if the new medicine reached the market. The authors suggest to adapt the clinical development plan for a better documentation of the PHB. They specifically recommend to integrate to the judgment criteria (endpoints) of the trials, criteria that are relevant in terms of public health, and to check for a good heterogeneity of the trial populations. They also suggest to start early enough collecting reliable national epidemiological data and the necessary elements for the assessment of the transposability of the trial results to the French population (ability to target the patients to be treated, adaptation of the healthcare system...). About the epidemiological data, the authors consider that the needs are covered in various ways depending on the diseases. To meet the needs of evaluation of the new medicines' target populations in specific indications, they recommend to use ad hoc studies as much as needed. In addition, epidemiological studies designed for market purpose with an acceptable methodology should not be systematically rejected but deserve to be presented. To be able to assess the importance of the expected theoretical benefit of a new medicine in a population, the authors underline the necessity to have access to study results with criteria related to this objective. They suggest to first define and list the criteria by disease. Regarding the representativity of the populations, it comes out that it would be advisable, but unrealistic to include in trials a population 100% representative of the population to be treated. Therefore the effect of the new medicine must be modelised (the \"effect model\") to be evaluated in the general population. Yet to obtain a reliable effect model, the study population must be sufficiently heterogeneous, which legitimates the demand to ensure a good population heterogeneity at the time of decision-making about trials methodology. When the criteria assessed during the development plan does not correspond to the PHB criteria, the only way to evaluate the number of events related to the PHB criterion is, again, to use modelisation. However, modelisation is only possible when the scientific literature has established a reliable correlation between the two types of criteria. In this case, the new model should be applied to a French target population to assess the expected benefit. As a conclusion, the possibilities to estimate the expected benefit of a new medicine on the health status of a specific population are currently limited. These limitations are regrettable because such an estimate is feasible without disrupting the development plans. The authors' general recommendations to update the development plans seem especially appropriate as the additions should not only be beneficial to France but to all the health authorities who would wish to assess the expected benefit of a new medicine on their territories. Anticipating the lack of clinical and epidemiological data and the lack of data that enable to evaluate the transposability of the trials results to real clinical practice is a sine qua none condition to improve the PHB assessment. The anticipation of these needs should be planned early enough by the pharmaceutical companies which could in this purpose meet the health authorities and the heads of the French public health policy in a consultation.Finally, because of the PHB's universal dimension, it is suggested that the necessary actions and publications be initiated so that the PHB can be acknowledged at the European level.","1304":"","1305":"Leem (French Pharmaceutical Companies) realized an inventory of unmet medical needs in 2006 in France for 12 pathologies.

Many of these products were orphan drugs and\/or biotechnology products.","1307":"The attention paid to endocriniens modulators for purpose micropolluants (endocrine disrupters) has been increasingly studied these last years particularly on animals. The results of this study raised big concerns from Doctors and Biologists on the eventual risks human health can face. Indeed, endocrine systems of the body play an essential and pervasive role in both the short- and long-term regulation of metabolic processes. Nutritional, behavioural, and reproductive processes are intricately regulated by endocrine systems, as are growth (including bone growth\/remodelling), gut, cardiovascular, and kidney function and responses to all forms of stress. Disorders of any of the endocrine system, involving both over- and under-active hormone secretion, result inevitably in disease, the effects of which may extend to many different organs and functions and are often debilitating or life-threatening. Viewed from this general perspective, the threat posed from environmental chemicals with endocrine activity (either agonist or antagonistic) is potentially serious. However, the fact that humans and wildlife are exposed to such chemicals does not necessarily mean that clinically manifest disturbance of the relevant endocrine system will result, because much depends on the level and duration of exposure and on the timing of exposure. Indeed, a large numbers of environmental estrogens are suspected of altering human health as well as the marine ecosystem balance. The objective of this review is to study the different molecular mechanisms of these xenoestrogenes micropolluants, in order to emphasize their potential risk and to present some of the different experimental methods for their detection.","1308":"","1309":"Local Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunotherapy is an effective and widely used treatment for superficial bladder carcinoma. Local side effects are frequent, whereas systemic side effects are rare, but more serious. We report four cases of systemic BCG reaction.

The best approach to minimize this complication is a strict compliance with precautions and a close and rigorous surveillance of this drug.

However, the increased life expectancy associated with the management of opportunistic infections might favour the onset of severe organic failure that could require organ transplantation. The use of immunosuppressive drugs in association with antiretroviral therapy will generate pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions. In this context, therapeutic drug monitoring is of great importance to improve therapeutic management of patients.","1317":"Cardiovascular disease is significantly increased in patients with the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. A clustering of risk factors, including dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, hypertension, inflammation and coagulation disorders are likely to promote cardiovascular events in these patients. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) represent one important pathway that influence vascular function both directly and indirectly by altering gene expression. Indeed, PPAR activation induces beneficial effects not only on glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism but also on endothelial function and vessel wall inflammation. PPAR agonists such as fibrates (PPARalpha) and insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinediones (PPARgamma) are in clinical use and may alter the process of atherosclerosis, especially in subjects with the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. This review will highlight the emerging evidence for the beneficial effects of PPAR agonists in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis in such high-risk patients.","1318":"Insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity interact in concert to maintain glucose homeostasis. Various pathologies, especially type 2 diabetes, are characterized by defects in secretion and\/or action of insulin and numerous drugs are able to partially correct these two defects. Therefore, the assessment of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity is of interest to guide the choice of pharmacological treatments and to evaluate their efficacy. It could be performed by studying the couple of fasting insulin\/glucose plasma concentrations or by performing dynamic tests, which mainly use the administration of glucose. The intimate relationship between insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity requires either appropriate tests that open the homeostatic feedback loop (\"glucose clamp\"), or sophisticated modeling approaches (\"HOMA\", \"minimal model\"). Insulin secretion should ideally be measured according to the corresponding insulin sensitivity. Dynamic tests are generally more informative than static measurements in the fasting state.","1319":"Type 2 diabetes is an endocrine\/metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia. It is now well established that insulin resistance and pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction\/failure are the two major components of the physiopathology of the disease. Current available therapies do not successfully enable patients with type 2 diabetes to reach glycemic goals. Even with intensive treatment type 2 diabetic patients may face spikes in blood glucose after meals, weight gain, and a loss of effectiveness of their treatments over time. The novel agents recently developed by the Pharmaceutical Industry may either provide an alternative therapeutic strategy or offer useful adjuncts to existing therapies. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), produced in the small intestine and amylin, produced by beta cells in the pancreas, also have glucose lowering effects. Amylin is an hormone secreted after a meal, having a complementary action to insulin. GLP-1, also released in a post-prandial manner, promotes insulin production and secretion, reduces glucagon secretion, delays gastric emptying and induces a feeling of fullness. The most promising effect of GLP-1 is its ability to increase beta-cell mass by stimulating neogenesis and reducing apoptosis in rodents. However the fact that GLP-1 is rapidly degraded by dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPPIV) in vivo reduces its usefulness. Thus, in order to improve therapeutic efficacy, two approaches have been investigated: the development of GLP-1 analogs resistant to degradation or the development of DPP-IV inhibitors. Synthetic analogs of amylin (pramlintide), GLP-1 (exenatide) and inhibitors of the degradation of GLP-1 (sitagliptin, DPP-IV inhibitor) are now available for clinical use. Promising biological targets being investigated include those leading to insulin sensitization (11beta-HSD-1 inhibitors and antagonists of glucocorticoids receptor), reducing hepatic glucose output (antagonist of glucagon receptor, inhibitors of glycogen phosphorylase and fructose-1,6-biphosphatase) and finally increasing urinary elimination of excess glucose (SGLT inhibitors). A particular role is played by glucokinase activators (GKA) which can both increase insulin secretion and improve hepatic glucose metabolism. In this review, we present a summary of the data available on newly approved treatments (amylin and GLP-1 analogs as well as DPP-IV inhibitors) and give an overview of the targets currently being studied for the treatment of type 2 diabetes with an emphasis on the small molecule drug design.","1320":"Adipose tissue is now recognized as an endocrine organ involved in regulating physiologic and pathologic processes including inflammation. It synthesizes and secretes hormones such as leptin and adiponectin. It can secrete other products namely adipokines including cytokines and chemokines. The release of adipokines by either adipocytes or adipose tissue-infiltrated macrophages leads to a chronic sub-inflammatory state that likely plays a major role in cardiovascular complications linked to obesity and insulin resistance.","1321":"Insulin controls carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Among other things, it stimulates glucose storage as glycogen and lipid storage as triglycerides. Insulin acts through a membrane receptor which is a tyrosine kinase. When activated by insulin binding, the tyrosine kinase will recruit and phosphorylate intracellular substrates called IRS (insulin receptor substrate). Phosphorylated IRS will be used as docking sites for proteins which will transmit the insulin signal through several systems (e.g. PI3-kinase). The insulin resistance which is concomitant with type 2 diabetes and obesity is linked to an increased intracellular availability of fatty acids which are precursors of lipid mediators inducing a decreased efficiency of insulin signal transmission. Therapies aimed at improving insulin sensitivity could then target proteins involved in the regulation of intacellular fatty acid availibility.","1322":"The increased incidence of dementia on the aging population makes this disease a major public health problem. Among known causes of dementia, drug etiology is under considered. We investigated the relationship between exposure to drug therapy and dementia with a case\/non-case study using reports of the French Pharmacovigilance database. Among 263 962 adverse effects recorded between 1985 and 2005, 79 (0.03%) are dementia. Median age is 66 (range 3-91). There was 41 women and 37 men. The therapeutic drug class associated with dementia were anticonvulsants, antiparkinsonians, antidepressants, anxiolytics, hypnotics, antipsychotics and morphinics. An association between reporting of dementia and non neurotropic drugs were also found, i.e. interferon alfa-2B, vancomycin and allopurinol. The term \"Dementia\" is only mentioned in the summary of the characteristics of valproate, but it may concern other drugs. Drug etiology for dementia is a reality but is not necessarily attributed as a cause in aging population, in particular.

Dietary intake, nutrition knowledge and eating attitudes, food choices and preferences, body composition, biochemical, physical activity and fitness and genotype (to analyse gene-nutrient and gene-environment interactions) assessment will provide the full information about the nutritional and lifestyle status of the European adolescents. The requirements for health promoting foods will be also identified, and three sensory acceptable products for adolescents will be developed. Harmonization and standardisation of the assessments for both scientific and technological objectives should result in reliable and comparable data of a representative sample of European adolescents. This will contribute to understand why health-related messages are not being as effective as expected in the adolescent population.

Forty two per cent of the antidotes missed to all structures, the rest (47%) had a variable availability according to the structures. The list of the missing antidotes is long and contains classified vital products of group A of the recommendations of the IPCS (International Program on Chemical Safety) like the specific antibodies of the digoxine and the methylene blue.

They should be evaluated by the usual methods of clinical pharmacology and pharmacovigilance, taking into account certain specificities (mechanism of action, manufacture, frequent administration to healthy subjects, particular recommendations, etc.). Experience from some vaccination campaigns have revealed insufficiencies notably in data collection allowing evaluation of the interest of a vaccine to public health, its relevance to the recent epidemiology of the disease in question and long-term security. The absence of data can generate fear in the general population that is broadcast by anti-vaccination lobby. For a more optimal pharmacovigilance of vaccines, it is necessary to: (i) improve the coherence between the evaluating authorities; (ii) set up, in addition to the usual risk management plan, an active microbiological and epidemiological surveillance and to follow up exposed populations; (iii) have programmes of education of the medical community regarding vaccination and health education for the general public.","1330":"\"Biotherapies\" include both biopharmaceuticals and cell and gene therapies. Biopharmaceuticals are macromolecules created by biotechnologies. In the case of monoclonal antibodies, the starting dose to be given to Humans is difficult to select because there may be no relevant animal model. At the time of registration, the knowledge of the mechanism of action of monoclonal antibodies is insufficient and cohort follow up studies are needed. Genetic predisposition and pharmacokinetics are interindividual sources of variability. Some of the adverse drug reactions are predictable but others are unexpected or even paradoxical. Cell and \"ex vivo\" gene therapies consist in the manipulation of collected cells and their infusion in autologous or allogenic clinical settings. The methodology of the clinical development of drugs cannot be readily applied to these therapies. On the other hand, \"in vivo\" gene therapy uses vectors or macromolecules which can be considered as biopharmaceuticals.","1331":"On the basis of a review of current clinical research conditions in developing countries, guidelines have been formulated to ensure scientific validity as well as adherence to universal ethical principles.

Fraud involves an active decision to cheat, and ranges from trying to hide incompetence to wholesale invention of data, patients or studies. Its frequency is difficult to evaluate but might be as high as 1% of all studies or publications. Fraud can involve ethics (post-hoc IRB [institutional review board] approval, IRB requests not applied, lack of consent), or any of the steps from realisation to interpretation of studies or trials. Identification of fraud is made harder by the usual risk for the whistle-blowers, who must be protected. Seeking fraud is implicit in Good Clinical Practices (GCP) that all industry sponsors must apply, but that are less often applied by institutional sponsors. It might be useful to install procedures to detect fraud in studies, especially institutional. Various statistical methods can be used to identify unusual data patterns that could suggest fraud. Once fraud is identified, its management is often not foreseen. Here again, clear procedures or recommendations would be of help.","1333":"The purpose of the clinical trial guidelines is to harmonise legislation in order to ensure consistency within Europe and thereby promote Europe's attractiveness for clinical research while maintaining or improving the protection of subjects who agree to participate. The French administrative system has hitherto been relatively favourable (with simple notification to a single Ethics Committee per study); it is thus important to maintain competitiveness in these respects, given that, in other areas (the time it takes to establish agreements, recruitment, etc.), other countries have the advantage. At the moment, this Directive has not been entirely transposed into French law. The pilot period established by the Afssaps (French drug agency) has made it possible to determine very quickly how to set things up. For Ethics Committees, the situation is more critical in that many points remain that need to be finalised (selection of members, internal rules, Competent Authority\/Ethics Committee relationship, etc.).

Gadodiamide, a linear gadolinium chelate appears to be particularly at risk. During renal failure, gadodiamide accumulation may explain the development of NSF.

Medical doctors filled in the questionnaire which focused on the main benzodiazepines' indications, those prescribed and their rules of prescription. The main indications were anxiety, convulsions, epilepsy and insomnia and the benzodiazepines prescribed in first intention were prazepam against anxiety and insomnia and diazepam against convulsions and epilepsy. Practically 17% of medical doctors ignored the existence of limited period of benzodiazepine use and 70.9% of medical doctors considered their training on benzodiazepines insufficient.

All the prescribers indicated they adapted the treatment to clinical objectives and blood pressure, and 77.5% to hourly urine flow. Initial NE concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 2 mg\/ml, diluted in saline or dextrose. Initial prescribed dose ranged from 0.1 to 1 microg\/kg\/min.

The clinical superiority of these drugs compared to traditional treatments is proven, but can one make the assumption that the cost of these innovative treatments is partially compensated by a reduction of consumption of other health resources? A retrospective observational study was carried out in the Midi-Pyrenees area, from the point of view of health insurance, to compare the consumed health resources between two cohorts of patients, one treated by etanercept (Enbrel) and the other by leflunomide (Arava). Two hundred and fifty three patients were included in the etanercept cohort and 539 in the leflunomide cohort. The average annual PR cost for a patient treated with etanercept is 13 936 euro and 5 764 euro for a patient treated with leflunomide.

The possibility to predict the clearance of compounds eliminated by the kidneys (and then to control their interindividual variability) was evaluated for two cytotoxic drugs (carboplatin and topotecan) in adults and EDTA (ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid), a compound used to determine the glomerular filtration rate in children. The population pharmacokinetic approach based on NONMEM program was used. For each of the three compounds, the cystatin C serum level was better predictive of clearance than that of creatinine. Moreover, for carboplatin and EDTA, the best equation between clearance and patients' characteristics included both cystatin C and creatinine level. A generalisation of cystatin C assay would contribute to standardise the clinical practices in Oncology.","1346":"","1347":"During last years, irinotecan has become registered as a major cytotoxic drug in several tumor types. Since the metabolism of this drug is predominantly made in the liver, administration to patients with liver dysfunctions remains a major problem.

However, studies are still required to optimise the use of irinotecan in patients with liver dysfunctions.","1348":"5-fluorouracil, (5-FU) is an antimetabolite used in many types of cancers. It has a narrow therapeutic index. More than 80% of administered 5-FU is detoxified in 5-fluoro-5,6-dihydrouracil (5-FUH2) by an enzyme: dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD). Half life increased with DPD deficiency. Thus, patients presenting a partial or profound DPD deficiency have an increased risk of severe or lethal toxicity. DPD deficiency was estimated between 3 to 5% in the normal population. Different approaches have been developed: Pharmacogenetic on the DPD gene or pharmacologic measuring DPD activity. More than 30 mutations have been reported on this gene. The more common mutation is the slice-site mutation IVS14+1G&gt;A. Analysis of the various mutations allowed to identify a population at risk with a DPD deficiency. DPD activity is determined in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. This assay offers the capability of identifying individuals who are completely deficient in DPD activity and those who are partially deficient. Assays to detect DPD deficiency are not used as a screening test to prevent 5-FU toxicity.","1349":"Numerous toxic side-effects, sometimes severe, are regularly reported in patients treated with 5-fluorouracil, and oral fluoropyrimidines, UFT and capecitabine, in metastatic and adjuvant setting. These toxic effects are due to a large interindividual variability of the metabolism, mainly depending on dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase activity (DPD), the major enzyme of the catabolism of fluoropyrimidines. Thus, the patients with a DPD deficiency are at high risk of early severe acute toxicity, with this kind of drug. These toxic side-effects are potentially lethal. DPD deficiency frequencies, partial or complete, are about 3-5% and 0.2% respectively. They are most often due to a gene polymorphism. Different techniques for the detection of DPD deficiency before treatment have been reported: phenotypic, such as the plasma ratio of dihydrouracil\/uracil, or genotypic, such as the detection of DPD gene variants, deleterious for enzyme activity. The pretherapeutic detection of DPD deficiency would permit to avoid almost every early acute toxic side-effects. We must emphasize that it is not merely a genetic result, since the detection of a deficiency most often does not contra-indicate the use of a fluoropyrimidine, but it must be combined with therapeutic advice.","1350":"","1351":"There are a number of factors relating to the clinical pharmacology of 13-cis-Retinoic Acid (13-cisRA) which, taken together, provide a strong case for the potential benefit of a therapeutic monitoring approach to ensure that uniform plasma concentrations of 13-cisRA are achieved in all patients. Firstly, low dose, continuous use of 13-cisRA has been shown to provide limited or no clinical benefit in neuroblastoma patients, whereas a high-dose, intermittent regimen resulted in a significant improvement in event-free survival. This suggests that dose levels and therefore plasma concentrations of drug are important determinants of 13-cisRA efficacy. Secondly, the currently used 13-cisRA dosing regimen of 160 mg\/m(2)\/day results in a &gt;10-fold variation in plasma concentrations, with plasma concentrations observed in a significant percentage of patients below those required for activity in neuroblastoma cells in vitro. Importantly, there would appear to be limited intra-patient variation in 13-cisRA plasma concentrations, i.e. those patients with lower 13-cisRA plasma concentrations following a single dose of 13-cisRA are likely to have similarly low concentrations following all doses of 13-cisRA on subsequent courses. As 13-cisRA is given as chronic treatment, those patients experiencing lower plasma concentrations on the current dosing regimen will potentially be exposed to sub-therapeutic concentrations of drug for the entire 6 month treatment period. While this type of pharmacokinetic monitoring approach may prove to be beneficial in the short term, an increased knowledge of pharmacogenetic factors influencing to the metabolism of 13-cisRA may ultimately allow us to identify patients who may be less likely to benefit from treatment due to an increased rate of parent drug metabolism. In this respect, pharmacogenetic studies assessing the relative expression levels or mutations in enzymes such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) and particularly CYP26 are needed to assess any potential association with rate of metabolism in vivo.","1352":"Imatinib (Glivec) is a specific inhibitor of tyrosine kinase receptor, in particular of the proto-oncogene c-kit.

But this relatively new route of administration in oncology drives to new problems in treatment management and particularly to non-compliance, i.e. the deviance of the actual way patients take their treatment with the prescription. Population PK-PD models and Monte-Carlo simulations allow to study the impact of non-compliance on toxicities. After a brief review on recent developments about oral chemotherapies, this work presents a simulation where non-compliance, modelled with a two state Markov chain defining four compliance profiles from excellent to poor, is linked to two dose-toxicity (continuous or categorical) population models. Simulated patients with the lowest compliance level were less exposed to treatment and therefore experienced less toxicity with shorter events. Nevertheless treatment efficacy is also lower, and this loss of efficacy may compromise patient's outcome. These results foresee the necessity of global simulations, combining compliance, toxicity and efficacy modelling.","1354":"","1355":"","1356":"","1357":"Vaccines are not separate health products but anti-infectious medicines administered for the large part prophylactically and for which the effect is immunological and not pharmacological.

Prescription switch can be considered at two different levels: global (drug market changes) or individual (description of patient's treatments patterns). The objective of this article is to describe the different types of prescription switch studies, according to this distinction. Objectives, type of data needed, and limits of each type of prescription switch study are presented.","1372":"Several therapeutic effects including anti-asthma and dyspnea have been described for the seeds of Carum copticum. In previous studies the relaxant and anticholinergic (functional antagonism) effects, histamine H(1) inhibitory and beta(2) stimulatory effects of Carum copticum have been demonstrated on guinea pig tracheal chains. In the present study, the bronchodilatory effect of boiled extract from Carum copticum in the airways of asthmatic patients was examined. The bronchodilatory effects of 0.125 and 0.25 ml\/kg of 10 g% boiled extract in comparison with 6 mg\/kg theophylline and placebo were studied by measuring pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and specific airway conductance (sGaw). Pulmonary function tests were measured before administration and repeated 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 min after administration of the oral extract and theophylline. The results showed that the boiled extract of Carum copticum caused significant increases in all PFT values, in most time intervals, (p&lt;0.05 to p&lt;0.001). However, the increase in most PFT values due to the both doses of boiled extract were significantly lower than those of theophylline in most time intervals (p&lt;0.05 to p&lt;0.001). The onset of brochodilatory effect of extract was similar to that of theophylline beginning 30 min, its maximum effect on PFTs (23 to 32% increase) was seen in 90-120 min and the effect of extract decline after 150 min following administration similar to the effect of theophylline. In addition the placebo did not cause any significant increase in PFT values. In conclusion, the results of the present study showed that Carum copticum has a relatively bronchodilatory effect on asthmatic airways which was comparable with the effect of theophylline at concentrations used.

In addition, we studied whether there is a correlation between information readability and density. Fifteen informed consent forms, 6 articles from \"Sciences et Avenir\" and 6 articles from \"Sciences et Vie Junior\" were analyzed. The lexicosyntactic readability was calculated using the Flesh score, and the information density using the number of information bits related to the number of words. The lexicosyntactic readability was lower in the informed consent forms (25, 17-32) compared with \"Sciences et Avenir\" (32, 29-38), but even higher in \"Sciences et Vie Junior\" (42, 38-57). Conversely, the information density was similar in \"Sciences et Vie Junior\" (0.24, [0.21-0.27]) and the informed consent forms (0.24, [0.22-0.26]), but higher in \"Sciences et Avenir\" (0.32, [0.26-0.38]).

These informations are mostly available on the Internet. Eighteen orphan drugs were marketed in France in November 2005, with restricted prescription and dispensing conditions. Four of them were available before registration for compassional use. Eight will be reassessed soon, with complementary data requested by health authorities. Informations about orphan drugs are scattered on different French or European websites, which complicate access for health professionals.

Two recent epidemiological studies could support this hypothesis. In 597 patients treated by a beta-blocker and followed for 3 years after a myocardial infarction or an acute coronary syndrome, the death rate was 5.4 times higher in homozygous Arg 16 and Gln 27 B2AR genotypes than in heterozygous or homozygous Gly 16 and Glu 27 B2AR genotypes. The beta-1 adrenergic receptor (B1AR) genetic polymorphism did not modify mortality.

Its subjective effects are similar to those of amphetamines. However, drug-users allot few positive subjective effects. Reported cases of intoxication are generally not serious but the risks of psychiatric disorders and serotoninergic syndrome must be taken into account. Risk factors of the intoxication to mCPP are the existence of predisposing psychiatric pathologies and pharmacodynamic or metabolic interactions. mCPP does not exhibit reinforcing effects. mCPP is not the subject of any international regulation: procedures of medical and social risk assessment were implemented in European and the national levels.","1385":"In France, the Afssaps is the body in charge of the evaluation of pharmacodependance. In order to fulfil its mission, the Afssaps has created a network of 10 Centres for Evaluation and Information on Pharmacodependance (CEIP), coordinated by the Drugs and Psychotropics Unit. Pharmacodependence notifications issued by professionals are collected by each Centre which evaluates them: it is therefore necessary to harmonize case reporting and make it possible to homogeneously evaluate the seriousness of pharmacodependence cases. Nantes CEIP has developed and has been routinely using a tool which evaluates pharmacodependence seriousness by quantifying patient consumption behaviour: the corresponding calculation, interpretation related to 3 patients is presented in this article. The association of clinical data generated by the tool, and official data coming from CEIP's, represents a powerful combination which is now available for pharmacodependence and abuse diagnosis.","1386":"Evaluate triptan prescriptions in ambulatory medicine. Collection of medical data from 301 patients treated with triptans reimbursed by the French National Health Fund in the region of Midi-Pyrenees. Ninety-five per cent of selected patients suffered from migraine condition according to the International Headache Society diagnosis criteria [Confidence interval (CI) 95%: 93-98]. Co-morbidity factors contra-indicating triptan therapy were present in 6% of patients (CI 95%: 3-9). 2% of patients were prescribed other medicinal products contra-indicated with their triptan therapy (CI 95%: 0-4). Twenty-six per cent of patients were taking triptan medicines more than 8 times per month over a period of three months (CI 95%: 21-31) and 8% were taking this treatment more than 12 times per month (CI 95%: 5-1 I). Eleven per cent kept written information of their migraine crises (CI 95%: 7-15). Thirty-nine per cent benefited from dedicated prophylactic treatments (CI 95%: 33-45). In a context of sustained increase in prescriptions of migraine treatments, it appears necessary to remain cautious about clinical and pharmacological contra-indications. Prevention of abuse of medicines is based on a better use of crises agendas and introduction of prophylactic therapies.

Fifty-nine patients (median age, 58 years), mainly stage IV Non Small Cell LC (n = 40) were included. Before treatment, 47 patients presented with moderate\/severe pain which moderately\/severely impacts on daily activities. Patients were mainly satisfied with their GP. Fifty-six GP were questioned (35 answered, 62.5%). Twenty-four known guidelines but no one had a specific training for pain management. Twenty-five used visual analogical scales for pain evaluation but morphine's prescription largely varies when compared with guidelines.

The results of these studies are more or less difficult to transpose to French practice. These difficulties generate varying degrees of uncertainty concerning the effect to be expected of a drug. A more or less extensive loss of effect is sometimes even predictable. Some of the difficulties in transposition are discussed in this article and proposals for action are made in order to allow one, in the long term, to predict in the most precise manner possible the effects to be expected from a drug in the French population and be able to verify this prediction at an interval from its eligibility for reimbursement.","1389":"We report the first survey on French physicians and patients participating to assess motivations prior enrolment and benefits and constraints perceived after participation. Twenty physicians were interviewed and 37 patients completed a questionnaire during clinical study participation. If the main patient's motivation is altruistic, physician wish their own patient feel better. After participation, patient is satisfied with being part of a research effort and contributing to medical science. Effect of trial treatment on physical well-being seems less pronounced. Main constraint is the randomisation to placebo group. For physicians, the main benefit is getting research experience and training. Main constraints are logistical. Otherwise, perceptions on the same clinical trial depend on participant. In fact, physician usually overestimates constraints of clinical trial for patient. The knowledge of patients and physicians perceptions of clinical trials and its taking into account should probably reduce difficulties in the recruitment in France.

But this transposition actually came into effect on 27 August 2006 by the implementation of decree no. 2006-477 of 26 April 2006 which has been followed subsequently by numerous statutory orders. A reading of these regulatory texts shows that the new provisions go far beyond the framework of the directive as they have been notably extended by the French legislator to encompass all the health products within the competence of the French Agency for Sanitary Safety in Health Products (Afssaps) as well as to other studies that do not involve health products. In addition, all research undertaken is from now subject to the prior, and jointly favourable, reasoned opinion of a CPP (Ethic Committee) and authorisation by Afssaps. These new regulations for biomedical research in France substantially modify and reinforce the previous provisions defined by the Huriet law of 1988, for safety, vigilance and traceability.","1391":"The mission of medical pharmacology in the CHU (University Medical Centres) is to contribute, through research, instruction and treatment, to the development and optimal utilization of drugs. With a progressive development, medical pharmacology is now present in all CHUs, where its responsibilities are both hospital-related and university-related. This progressive development also explains why medical pharmacologists, regardless of their initial training, are recognized as drug experts. Continued growth of the discipline, in the context of changes in the hospital and university environment, should reinforce its position in the evaluation and proper use of drugs.","1392":"","1393":"","1394":"","1395":"The global extracts of Nepeta atlantica Ball and Nepeta tuberosa L. ssp. reticulata (Desf.)

An open questionnaire was sent to 37 pharmacological teams with a 100% response rate. The results of this survey showed that the national mean number of TH is 67.6 per student, i.e. a mean of 11.3 TH per year per student during the 6 year training program. There was a wide dispersion of TH between universities with extremes ranging from 141 to 24. BCP of major classes of drugs was the leading subject (mean 35% of total) followed by general principles of pharmacology (33%), pre-clinical and clinical pharmacology (15%), pharmacology of mediator systems (9%) and miscellaneous subjects (8%). The time allotted to BCP teaching program is considered as insufficient in most of medical schools where it is less than 100 TH. New methods of active learning for students should be developed in the near future (integrated problem-base learning), and students should be trained to construct their knowledge-base via an access to pharmacological data-bases. Major changes in teaching BCP represent an important challenge for pharmacologists.","1397":"OBJECTIVE - METHOD: The purpose of this review is to explore the expectations of patients and physicians prior to participate to a clinical trial and their positive or negative experiences after participating. A systematic review of Medline database from 1966 to 2005 identified 79 papers reported patients and physicians perceptions of clinical trials (only 3 in French), whom 27 English surveys conducted on patients and physicians. If primary patients' motivation for enrolment was altruistic, physicians wish to help their patient. After enrolment, the most perceived positive benefit for patients and physicians are, respectively, the emotional improvement and the greater opportunity for personal benefit offered to enrolled patients. Most physicians' negative experience included logistical difficulties while patients are unease with randomisation and often uncomfortable with medical procedures. Unlike patients, all physicians' expectations seem to be fulfilled. The knowledge of patients' and physicians' perception of participation may improve recruitment in clinical trials. ","1398":"Within the context of a quality initiative for a clinical research unit, participants' opinions relative to participation conditions allows the identification and quantification of certain dysfunctions in the unit or more widely of the site. An initial satisfaction survey of users of the Grenoble Clinical Research Center showed that the management of volunteers by a staff dedicated to, and in an environment adapted to, clinical research protocols is associated with elevated participant satisfaction. Corrective action has been taken relative to points of dissatisfaction. We conducted a second participant survey from June 1st, 2004, to May 31st, 2005, to measure the impact of our corrective actions. Eighty five percent of the persons contacted responded, and 90.4% of completed questionnaires were valid. The global satisfaction level on a scale of ten was 8.53 +\/- 1.16 in 2005 (n = 292) versus 8.61 +\/- 1.16 in 2004 (n = 144) (Not Significant = NS). Scores for each dimension of care (comprising 1-6 questions each) were not statistically different between the two years. An improvement was noted for the frequency of physician visits, the communication of results, and the explication of aftercare. On the other hand, there was a moderate decline of the satisfaction score relative to concern for personal needs, the swiftness of check in at arrival and the unit's peace and quiet. Globally, the participation of a subject in clinical research in the context of a Clinical Research Center is associated with a high satisfaction score. Nevertheless, the practice of annual satisfaction surveys permits the sensitisation of staff to certain specifics points, and to observe the effect of corrective action. It serves as an important element in the context of a quality initiative.","1399":"In order to evaluate the attractiveness of France for conducting international clinical trials, a survey is performed every two years among pharmaceutical companies that are based in France or have affiliates in France. Initiated in 2006, the current survey was much more representative than the previous ones with 20 companies accounting for 61% of the French market. This survey included 352 international phase II and III clinical studies carried out in 2004 and 2005, 74 countries, 17 345 centres and 137 989 patients. France has participated to half of the overall number of international clinical trials. France ranked among the best European recruiters (0,19 patient\/1000 inhabitants) at the second position behind Scandinavian countries, taking in account numbers of inhabitants. Protocols are now to be given the go-ahead by Ethics Committee (CCPPRB) within 60 days. With a high productivity in phase IIb and in oncology, France is still an attractive place to locate clinical research.","1400":"Stroke patients are at very high risk of recurrent vascular events. Antiplatelet agents (AAP) substantially decrease this risk but still 1 over 5 patients will have an other vascular event. Recent studies didn't show any benefit of AAP association (aspirin, clopidogrel) but other studies targetting higher risk patients are needed. Studies with new AAP are ongoing. Beside vascular risk reduction, other antithrombotic agents are used as thrombolytics in the acute phase of stroke. The rt-PA (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) administered in the first 3 hours dissolves the clot, preventing death and handicap due to ischemic brain lesion. But time window is short and rt-PA increase the risk of hemorragic stroke. Combination of new thrombolytic agents and new imaging technics should permit to rise the number of treated patients.","1401":"Assessment of platelet function was primarily designed to explore patients with hemostatic disorders, but is becoming important for the monitoring of anti platelet agents, mostly aspirin and clopidogrel. Beside platelet counting, morphological analysis and bleeding time, a number of dedicated platelet function instruments are now available, generally allowing a rapid evaluation of platelet function in whole blood. The other tests including aggregometry and ELISA measurement of activation markers are generally restricted to specialized laboratories. Although aggregometry is still considered as the \"gold standard\", the recently developed flow cytometric-based platelet function analysis provides a wide choice of tests that assess the number of surface receptors, the measure of secretion and aggregation, the quantification of microparticules and leukocyte-platelet aggregates. It also allows the measure of the function of the ADP receptor P2Y12 by the phosphorylation level of the VASP protein, method currently under evaluation to monitor the platelet response to clopidogrel treatment.","1402":"The transposition of experimental models to clinical situations in the atherothrombosis field will be illustrated by two examples: in one hand, the steps of the discovery of drugs such as ticlopidine and clopidogrel, the identification of their molecular targets on blood platelets and the pharmacological consequences of these developments; on the other hand, the setting up of a model of localized arterial thrombosis in mice, with two degrees of severity which react differentially to antithrombotic drugs. The main features of these models will be compared to clinical situations such as unstable angina and myocardial infarction.","1403":"Atherothrombosis is a complex disease which includes two different pathologies: atherosclerosis, the process of plaque formation in the arterial wall and thrombosis, the formation of a blood clot mostly at the site of a ruptured atherosclerotic lesion. Animal models for both pathologies have been useful to understand their aetiology and their evolution and they were used to evaluate the efficacy of new treatments. Numerous models to study venous and arterial thrombosis have been described. Thus in the rat, venous thrombosis induced by lesion\/stasis, e.g. in the vena cava, and arterial thrombosis by lesioning of the vessel wall are frequently used. The resulting blood clot formation is measured either directly (weight of the thrombus) or indirectly (reduction in blood flow). More complex models have been developed in large animals such as dogs and pigs in order to examine coronary thrombosis; the principle always being the arterial lesion that causes the thrombus formation. The effect of the TP-receptor antagonist terutroban (S 18886) on different thrombosis models has been evaluated and this has allowed to conclude on the powerful anti-thrombotic effects of this agent and has contributed to its progression into clinical development. In the past the most frequently used model of atherosclerosis was the hypercholesterolemic rabbit; both plaque formation and its consequences on vascular, endothelial, function have been largely studied in this model. More recently genetically engineered mouse models of atherosclerosis have been introduced and they are now largely studied to characterize the disease and to evaluate new drugs. The two models mostly used are the ApoE(-\/-) and the LDL receptor(-\/-) mice. Studies with terutroban have illustrated that this TP-receptor antagonist prevents lesion formation in mouse and rabbit models illustrating its interesting anti-atherosclerotic properties and demonstrating the role played by endothelial TP-receptors in atherogenesis. In conclusion, experimental models to study atherosclerosis and thrombosis have been developed and used to study the etiology and the evolution of atherothrombotic disease. They have also been of great value to predict anti-thrombotic and\/or anti-atherosclerotic properties of new substances such as terutroban, that may become novel treatments for this complex cardiovascular disease.","1404":"The vascular endothelium is a thromboresistant surface, allowing the free flowing of blood cell elements. Platelets are predominantly involved in the rapid response to a vascular lesion, exposing the underlying thrombogenic subendothelium and leading to initiation of thrombus formation. Thrombus growth requires on the one hand, the recruitment of circulating platelets to the luminal side of the thrombus and on the other hand, the assembly of the proteins of the blood coagulation cascade on the platelet catalytic surface leading to thrombin formation. High shear forces are necessary for the dual role of von Willebrand factor (VWF) in the initiation of platelet thrombus formation and in its growth and stabilization. In hemodynamic conditions, platelet adhesion depends on the interaction between VWF and the platelet receptor glycoprotein Ib (GPIb). This interaction is the only one able to resist to the high shear rates that prevail in arterioles, the microcirculation or stenosed arteries. Thereafter, the interaction between VWF and the alphaIIbbeta3 integrin allows the definitive arrest of platelets and induces thrombus formation. Thus, high shear forces by themselves are able to induce platelet activation\/aggregation, without added exogenous agonist. VWF is synthesised by endothelial cells as a series of multimers of different sizes. The multimers with the highest molecular weight, the so-called ultra-large multimers, are strongly thrombogenic by their increased ability to bind platelet GPIb and to induce the formation of circulating aggregates. These ultra-large multimers are normally cleaved by the ADAMTS13 metalloprotease into smaller multimers which are also less thrombogenic. The in vivo proteolysis of VWF by ADAMTS13 depends on the high shear rates, which increase the opening of multimers anchored to the endothelial cell layer and the exposure of the cleavage site of VWF by ADAMTS13. An ADAMTS13 deficiency thus likely would result in the accumulation of ultra-large multimers on the endothelial surface, which retains platelets on the activated endothelium and results in micro-thrombi formation, as seen in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Platelet-VWF interactions are also involved in inflammation. Activation of endothelial cells induces the release of VWF from the Weibel-Palade bodies as well as the surface expression of VWF and P-selectin. These molecules allow leukocyte and platelet rolling on endothelial cells, and expression of E-selectin, VCAM-1 and other adhesion molecules. Recently, it has been shown that activated platelets allow transient activation of intact, non stimulated endothelial cells, thus increasing the inflammation process. VWF and platelet P-selectin have been shown to be essential to this process. Thus, platelet--vessel wall interactions are involved in thrombosis and inflammation essentially via VWF.","1405":"","1406":"","1407":"","1408":"","1409":"Flavonoids are polyphenols derivatives of plant origin that possesses a broad range of pharmacological properties, including protection of cells and tissues against the deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species. Their antioxidant activity results from scavenging of free radicals and other oxidizing intermediates, from the chelation of iron or copper ions and from inhibition of oxidases. But a number of studies have found both anti and prooxidant effects for many of these compounds. These reasons prompted us to investigate whether flavonoids compounds alone or combined flavonoids had antioxidant, free radical scavenger and antiapoptotic properties. The investigation was carried in vitro using rat hepatic mitochondria. Respiratory control ratio (RCR), oxygen consumption, adenosine tri phosphate (ATP) synthesis, scavenging action, enzymatic activities of involved complexes, superoxide anion and the release of cytochrome C were measured to assess the mechanisms of action of these drugs. Our data showed that the decrease of RCR induced by high concentrations (0.1 mM and 0.01 mM) of all flavonoids tested was due to a common inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation (State 4) and activation of state 3. At the opposite mitochondrial swelling was slightly induced only by low concentrations (10(-8) and 10(-9) M) of the flavonoids. They had no effects on the mitochondrial complexes (I to V) activity. Furthermore the mitochondrial membrane potential was not affected by any flavonoids. The effect of flavonoids on superoxide anion generation was variable. All the flavonoids studied acted between 10(-4) M and 10(-6) M with no effects at lower concentrations. These effects were similar on lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde [MDA] levels). We remarked a concentration-dependent in the effect of flavonoids since they acted as antioxidant and also as uncoupler at high concentrations, which is a risk for the cells. We conclude that flavonoids extracted from algerian plants have some protecting effects against oxidative stress by protecting the mitochondria.","1410":"In clinical trials, long-term use of a specific chondroitin sulphate, Chondrosult 400 (CS400) has demonstrated symptomatic efficacy in osteoarthritis comparable to that of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with significantly fewer side-effects. CS400 could therefore reduce the use of and risks associated with NSAIDs. A cross-sectional observational study was therefore devised in 199 randomly selected pharmacies in France to verify the concomitant use of analgesic and NSAIDs medication in patients prescribed CS400. Consecutive patients filling a prescription for CS400 were prospectively recruited and classified into recent users (3 months or less of continuous use) and long-term users (more than 3 months of continuous use) of CS400. The main outcome measure was current and long-term use of analgesics and NSAIDs. The 844 participating patients included 623 (73.8%) women and 221 (26.2%) men. Mean age was 65.9 years. Ninety eight (11.6%) patients did not use any analgesic or NSAIDs for osteoarthritis: 746 (88.4%) reported the use of at least one of these drugs. Compared to recent users, long-term users of CS400 had a significantly lower current (44.4 versus 52.5%, p &lt; 0.05) and long-term use of NSAIDs (11.8% versus 18.5%, p &lt; 0.05), and of analgesics (70.3 versus 79.3%, p &lt; 0.01).","1411":"This paper shows the eventual benefits of treatment with beta-blockers in post-myocardial infarction. An overview of main clinical trials that have been conducted to test this therapeutic in acute coronary syndrome. In patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction, the early use of intravenous beta-blockers had shown a modest and non significant reduction in mortality. Substantial reductions in mortality and reinfarction have been demonstrated when beta-blockers have been used soon after an acute myocardial infarction and continued long-term. However, these benefits were observed in randomised clinical trials conducted in the 1970s and 1980s, prior to the widespread use of reperfusion therapies and antiplatelet agents. It appears obvious that the long-term use of beta-blockers may be questionable after any acute coronary syndrome especially if complete reperfusion has been achieved and left ventricular function is preserved.","1412":"The workshop entitled \"Public-Private partnerships models in Europe-- comparison between France and European countries\" brought together representatives of academia and industry, of national or European health research programs, of regional or national public-private partnership (PPP) initiatives, and of biotechnology with the following objectives: sharing a common vision on the needs, expectations and challenges of public-private partnership, based on the analysis of actual and original cases, and of new initiatives on public-private partnership, drawing conclusions and identifying key success factors, identifying trails for progress and drawing recommendations. The major event in this field is a European public-private partnership initiative between pharmaceutical industry (European Federation of Pharmaceultical Industry and Associations, EFPIA) and the European Commission (DG Research--health priority) resulting in the European Technology Platform project \"Innovative Medicines Initiative\" (IMI). Its architecture is based on the identification of the main bottlenecks to the development of innovative treatments (predictive pharmacology and toxicology, identification and validation of biomarkers, patients' recruitment, risk evaluation, and cooperation with the regulatory authorities). Simultaneously, initiatives both at the national and regional levels also foster PPP in the therapeutic field. Regional competitivity clusters acting in the biomedical sector, and national PPP calls such as the ANR (National Research Agency) RIB (Research and Innovation in Biotechnology) call are incentives for PPP projects. These regional and national PPP levels help public and private partners to further build consortia able to compete for EU-level calls, thus acting as incubators for EU PPP projects. In spite of incentives and of the regional and national structuring of PPP, weaknesses in the French system are linked to its fragmentation--multiple transfer agencies, multiple research organisations (operator or funding agency)--making contracts more difficult. This requires a simplified organisation, with a single referent per area (health, technology...). Improvement may also result from adaptation in the carreer, recruitment and mobility, from support to scientists in the management of projects, and from consistent support (without maintaining them artificially alive) to emerging companies from concept through clinical development. Pathways have been proposed to improve the efficiency of clinical research in France and Europe, involving the public hospital sector, and this requires the connection of disease-oriented networks and integrated infrastructures in Europe. As stated in the IMI strategic research agenda on efficacy, the quality of public infrastructures in Europe will be a key factor for its competitiveness and attractiveness for both academic and industry projects.","1413":null,"1414":"Data required to asses the risk of a new drug regarding the normal course of pregnancy as well as embryo, fetal and neonate development, are often missing when a new product is launched.

The objective of the round table was to develop reasonable recommendations for the implementation of GCP according to the type of research and taking in account the risks and challenges related to this research. Two types of risks have been identified: those related to the characteristics of the research and those related to the impact of the study results. The group designed an evaluation table of these risks. The round table focused its investigations on 3 main themes: monitoring, the investigational medicinal product and undesirable effects. Three methods of monitoring adaptation were analysed in terms of advantages and disadvantages: the gradual approach, the central monitoring, monitoring on the basis of sampling. Examination of the investigational medicinal product focused on the medicinal product circuit. The group recommends using the following 'basic' decision-making tree, which takes three elements into account: 1) is it an investigational medicinal product?, 2) do the trial objectives and design require packaging specific to the research?, 3) is the risk of use higher than that in standard practice? Finally, adaptation of the implementation of GCP in terms of pharmacovigilance appeared very limited and could possibly be considered for the medicinal product, the subject of the research, which already holds a marketing authorisation, and for which the safety profile is well known; in this case, only simplified collection of non-serious adverse events may be envisaged, which may be implemented by designing and using a standard collection listing. The adaptation of the implementation of GCP is possible. This firstly takes into account the characteristics of the research: which objectives\/which risks\/which challenges. The options in terms of adaptation must be pre-defined, documented and justified; if necessary, they will also be re-assessed in the course of analysis.","1416":"","1417":"Evaluate triptan prescriptions in ambulatory medicine. Collection of medical data from 301 patients treated with triptans reimbursed by the French National Health Fund in the region of Midi-Pyrenees. Ninety-five per cent of selected patients suffered from migraine condition according to the International Headache Society diagnosis criteria [Confidence interval (CI) 95%: 93-98]. Co-morbidity factors contra-indicating triptan therapy were present in 6% of patients (CI 95%: 3-9). 2% of patients were prescribed other medicinal products contra-indicated with their triptan therapy (CI 95%: 0-4). Twenty-six per cent of patients were taking triptan medicines more than 8 times per month over a period of three months (CI 95%: 21-31) and 8% were taking this treatment more than 12 times per month (CI 95%: 5-11). Eleven per cent kept written information of their migraine crises (CI 95%: 7-15). Thirty-nine per cent benefited from dedicated prophylactic treatments (CI 95%: 33-45). In a context of sustained increase in prescriptions of migraine treatments, it appears necessary to remain cautious about clinical and pharmacological contra-indications. Prevention of abuse of medicines is based on a better use of crises agendas and introduction of prophylactic therapies. ","1418":"More and more frequently, the health authorities and the French assessment agencies are led to issue Marketing Authorizations (MAs), give opinions on the eligibility for reimbursement of drugs or to draft recommendations for clinical practice based on the results of foreign studies. The results of these studies are more or less difficult to transpose to French practice. These difficulties generate varying degrees of uncertainty concerning the effect to be expected of a drug. A more or less extensive loss of effect is sometimes even predictable. Some of the difficulties in transposition are discussed in this article and proposals for action are made in order to allow one, in the long term, to predict in the most precise manner possible the effects to be expected from a drug in the French population and be able to verify this prediction at an interval from its eligibility for reimbursement. ","1419":"","1420":"The EC 2001\/20 directive relating to the clinical trials of medicinal products was transposed into French law in 2004 by means of a public health law. But this transposition actually came into effect on 27 August 2006 by the implementation of decree no. 2006-477 of 26 April 2006 which has been followed subsequently by numerous statutory orders. A reading of these regulatory texts shows that the new provisions go far beyond the framework of the directive as they have been notably extended by the French legislator to encompass all the health products within the competence of the French Agency for Sanitary Safety in Health Products (Afssaps) as well as to other studies that do not involve health products. In addition, all research undertaken is from now subject to the prior, and jointly favourable, reasoned opinion of a CPP (Ethic Committee) and authorisation by Afssaps. These new regulations for biomedical research in France substantially modify and reinforce the previous provisions defined by the Huriet law of 1988, for safety, vigilance and traceability. ","1421":"The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) especially the arylcarboxylic, are widely prescribed for their different properties. The renal adverse events are rare but often serious. We have reviewed the French experience for the following eight years period: January 1995 to December 2002. Three hundred and nine cases have been reported to the French Pharmacovigilance system during that period including 275 adults, 29 children and 5 new-born babies. In 247 cases (80%), the presentation was an acute renal failure occurring few days after treatment onset but not always of the prerenal type. Overall 34 patients needed one or more dialysis session; the majority recovered either completely or partially, but nevertheless, we had to deplore 5 deaths. These major renal complications were observed with all available NSAID on the French market, including ibuprofen which was often prescribe as pain-reliever. With this data together with international information, the French Drug Agency decided to modify the summary of products characteristics of these NSAID.","1422":"Topical antifungal agents are not absorbed when given orally. They act by direct contact on the fungus, this type of action requires the simultaneous presence of antifungal and fungus for a minimum of time. There are a large number of compounds belonging to different families of antifungals: polyens, azoles, allylamine and morpholine and antiseptic substances. The treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis is based on topical antifungal agents: amphotericin B or nystatin, imidazoles such as clotrimazole or miconazole. Systemic antifungal agents are indicated in case or poor compliance to topical agents, in prophylaxis of highly relapsing disease, in oesophageal candidiasis and in Candida onychomycosis. A topical antifungal agent is the first choice to treat Candida intertrigo. In any case predisposing factors should be eradicated or amended. Infection to Malassezia spp. are treated topically with azoles or selenium sulphur. Oral ketoconazole is an alternative in severe cases. Dermatophytosis requires a systemic antifungal treatment such as terbinafine in chronic, dry, moccassin type palmoplantar infection and for onychomycosis. Intertrigo and tinea corporis are treated with topical agents such as azoles, terbinafine or tolnaftate. Tinea capitis responds to oral griseofulvine, however a topical antifungal must be added to eradicate contagious conidia. Whatever the localisation is, an other superficial site of infection must be looked for and a source of infection should be investigated and eradicated.","1423":"","1424":"Specificity of antifungals use in paediatric patients is linked to mycoses epidemiology in this population. Pharmacokinetics vary with patient age. Although studies are in progress, pharmacokinetic data in children are limited in number for most antifungals. Among antifungal agents, those approved in France for use in children are rare. Adverse event frequency can differ in children, as compared to frequency in adults, and drug interaction should be a major worry. Relative interest and cost of available forms in the paediatric population in not always taken into account. For each different situation, an optimal strategy of antifungals use in children should be determined.","1425":"Three lipid formulations of amphotericin B have been developed: amphotericin B colloidal dispersion, amphotericin B lipid complex, and liposomal amphotericin B. These three compounds differ by their lipid composition and therefore by their physical characteristics, their pharmacokinetics, and their safety and efficacy profile. There is a consensus to accept reduced toxicity of these formulations, especially reduced, but not absence of, renal toxicity as compared to amphotericin B deoxycholate. Few well-designed studies have been conducted and none of them demonstrated convincingly superiority in term of efficacy of any of the lipid preparations over amphotericin B deoxycholate. Recently a double blind randomized study compared a standard dose of 3 mg\/kg\/d of liposomal amphotericin B and a loading dose (10 mg\/kg\/d for 14 days and then the standard dose) in primary therapy of invasive filamentous fungal infections, mainly aspergillosis. Response rate at end of randomized therapy as well as survival at 12 weeks was numerically superior in the standard dose arm but this difference was not statistically significant. Lack of benefit of high dose liposomal amphotericin B in aspergillosis cannot yet be extrapolated to other filamentous fungal infections. Nephrotoxicity was substantially higher in the loading dose arm and this contraindicates its use in clinical practice.","1426":"Azoles have maintained a key role in the treatment of invasive fungal infections which have a growing importance, especially in immunocompromised patients. Because of its good activity and safety, fluconazole has becoming the treatment of choice for invasive candidiasis, except those caused by Candida glabrata and C. krusei. In contrast, itraconazole which is active against Aspergillus sp has limited use for the treatment of invasive mould infections due to the high variability of its bioavailibility. Voriconazole is active against a broad range of fungal pathogens including Aspergillus sp and other molds, except Zygomycetes. Voriconazole is used as first-line therapy for invasive aspergillosis and for infections caused by Fusarium and Scedosporium. It is available in both oral and intravenous administration. Posaconazole has similar in vitro activity but currently only the oral form is available. Its main indication is refractory aspergillosis or intolerance to previous treatment. Posaconzole will be very useful for long-term therapy of zygomycetes infections.","1427":null,"1428":"Despite pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships were clearly evidenced for antifungal drugs by the use of experimental models, few target plasma concentrations could be determined from studies performed in patients. The main causes explaining this lack of data are reviewed and the possible use in humans of the parameters obtained from animal models is discussed.","1429":"During the last years, a large amount of work has been completed to improve the methods used for in vitro antifungal susceptibility testing. Reference techniques are currently available both for yeasts and filamentous fungi, but in some instances, technical improvement are needed. Etest is another well standardized method that can be used as an alternative on a routine basis in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Studies of in vitro-in vivo correlations have led to the definition of susceptibility breakpoints for yeasts for fluconazole, itraconazole, and flucytosine.","1430":"Antifungals of systemic use for the treatment of invasive fungal infections belong to four main chemical families which have globally three cellular targets in fungal cells: fluorinated pyrimidines act on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication and protein synthesis; polyenes and azoles are toxic for ergosterol and its biosynthetic pathway; lipopeptides inhibit the synthesis of cell wall beta glucans. The resistance mechanisms that are developed by some fungi begin to be well understood particularly in Candida yeasts. The underlying bases of these mechanisms are either mutations that modify the antifungal target, or that block access to the target, and, on the other hand, the overexpression of genes encoding the target, or some membrane proteins involved in the active efflux of antifungal drugs.","1431":"The purpose of this paper is to examine the eventual benefits of treatment with calcium channel blockers in post-myocardial infarction, through an overview of main placebo-controlled trials that have been conducted to test this therapeutic in acute coronary syndromes. It appears obvious that the vast majority of these trials was conducted in the pre-reperfusion era and failed to demonstrate a reduction in mortality. To conclude, the superiority of a therapy with calcium antagonists over a placebo in the management of post-myocardial infarction remains unknown. In contrast, adverse effects associated with the prescription of calcium antagonists are well known.","1432":"The use of placebos within controlled clinical trials for the placebo effect; last 50 years suggests that psycho-physiological effects can be objectified and measured. These are related to the therapeutic measurement; results covered by the term \"placebo effect\". Since Beecher's pioneer article in 1955, this effect is recognised and cited in randomised clinical trial; medical articles as being on average 35% effective on the majority of symptoms. However, the meaning of these measurement artefact is questionable. For example, it does not take into account the spontaneous evolution of symptoms and diseases. In fact, the placebo effect is not the effect measured in the group treated by the placebo. The clinical trial drug controlled against placebo does not make it possible to measure what is thus wrongly called \"the placebo effect\". Is it possible then to measure and to objectify what is called the placebo effect? And if that is possible, how? This article calls into question the extent of the placebo effect evaluated by means of controlled clinical trials, without denying its importance in medical practice. Firstly it raises the epistemological problem of the real possibility, via experimentation, of objectifying psychological therapeutic effects. And secondly, the question is also raised of the interest for medical care of objectifying those effects.","1433":null,"1434":"In order to evaluate the attractiveness of France for conducting international clinical trials, a survey is performed every two years among pharmaceutical companies that are based in France or have affiliates in France. Initiated in 2006, the current survey was much more representative than the previous ones with 20 companies accounting for 61% of the French market. This survey included 352 international phase II and III clinical studies carried out in 2004 and 2005, 74 countries, 17 345 centres and 137 989 patients. France has participated to half of the overall number of international clinical trials. France ranked among the best European recruiters (0,19 patient\/1000 inhabitants) at the second position behind Scandinavian countries, taking in account numbers of inhabitants.

From November 1999 to April 2003, a resident of pharmacovigilance collected ADRs reported with antiretroviral drugs during 2 weekly medical consultations. A total of 613 ADRs corresponding to 428 patients were reported, classified as \"non serious\" in 88.6% of cases and required the withdrawal of suspected drugs in 57% of cases. Our data show an improvement of antiretroviral drug-induced ADRs reporting.","1437":"The therapeutic use of cortisol and its derivatives, anti-inflammatory corticoids, sets delicate problems to resolve because of cortisol's physiological roles and its circadian rhythms. Cortisol and the majority of its derivatives have desirable and undesirable effects that are time-related administration. The chronotherapeutic optimisation to increase desirable effects and safety of corticoids is shown in the treatment of adrenocortical failure, congenital adrenal hyperplasia and asthma. The knowledge of physiological and physiopathological rhythms of asthma permitted to realize oral treatment optimisation by using a number of corticoids. This knowledge puts in a prominent position the advantages of ciclesonide: a new inhaled corticoid. A chronobiologic approach could be used in a classic optimisation which involves a molecule modification and inhalation like routes of administration.","1438":"Because of the adverse effects associated with aspirin, especially Reye's syndrome in children, practitioners currently use as first line therapy drugs such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Their pharmacokinetic characteristics are not quite identical: both are absorbed rapidly and have high bioavailability, however, unlike acetaminophen, ibuprofen is characterized by high plasma protein binding and a limited distribution volume. Both drugs are metabolized essentially in the liver into inactive hydroxylated or glucoronidated metabolites by conjugation but acetaminophen is also transformed into an oxidation compound--normally reduced by glutathione--which, in the case of acute overdosing with depletion of endogenous glutathione stores, may lead to severe hepatotoxicity. Old age and light to moderate renal or hepatic failure do not significantly modify their pharmacokinetic parameters, and thus do not call for dose adjustment. Clinical trials have shown both drugs to have comparable efficacy on pain and fever, with perhaps a slight advantage for ibuprofen. In practice, the choice will depend on the prescription habits of the practitioner, patient's (or parents') preferences and, above all, the pathological context and possible contra-indications.","1439":"The aim of this review is to describe the present knowledge about chemical submission. The number of scientific publications on this phenomenon has increased over the last 10 years. Perpetrators choose drugs which act rapidly, produce desinhibition, sedation, and anterograde amnesia during the abuse. Ethanol and benzodiazepines are the most frequently used. A few drugs, including flunitrazepam and gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), have received widespread media coverage. Toxicological investigations on blood, urine or hair samples allow to detect the substance used. Every effort should be made to collect appropriate specimens as quickly as possible. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry is at present the most appropriate analytical method to detect these drugs in a biological specimen.","1440":"Given many data about the stability of antibiotics in portable pump (elastomer) are lacking, this study was designed to make a point about available data and to evaluate the stability of antibiotics when exposed to temperature within 35 degrees C (average temperature measured in real conditions of use). First, to collect information about the stability of antibiotics in portable pump and to confront them with the local antibiotics protocols dedicated to the treatment of bronchial superinfection in patients with cystic fibrosis; second, to evaluate the stability of piperacillin associated with tazobactam at 35 degrees C. While measured concentrations in tazobactam did not show significant variation during the study, piperacillin measurements showed a major reduction of concentration (up to 33%), both time and concentration related to. Such information must be pointed out to prescribers and patients to ensure a cold accumulator is placed in the pump carrying-bag and to limit the duration of infusion to 24 h with a single pump. This experimental program will keep on going with the stability study of both ticarcillin and cefsulodin in portable pump.

In some pathological conditions, such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes, there is an abnormal glycosylation of acute phase serum proteins. As most serum proteins are produced in the liver, we have examined glycoprotein metabolism in diabetic condition. To induce non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) a single dose of streptozotocin (100 mg\/kg body weight) was injected into two day old rats. After 10-12 weeks, rats weighing above 150 g were selected for NIDDM model. In these rat, blood glucose and plasma glycoproteins were significantly increased whereas plasma insulin was significantly decreased. There was a significant decrease in the level of sialic acid and elevated levels of hexose, hexosamine and fucose in tissues. Oral administration of NBDP and metformin to diabetic rats decreased blood glucose and plasma glycoproteins. Plasma insulin and tissue sialic acid were increased whereas tissue concentrations of hexose, hexosamine and fucose were near normal. Our study suggests that NBDP and metformin possess a significant beneficial effect on glycoproteins in addition to their antidiabetic effect.","1443":"Clinical trials have a fundamental role in promoting an evidence based use of drugs in adults and in children. However, it is often difficult to identify the few paediatric studies carried out and to thus implement knowledge derived from them. Furthermore, studies that are stopped prematurely or that have insignificant or negative results often remain unpublished, leading to duplication of effort by researchers, waste of resources and concealment of potentially toxic risks. The European Community decided to support the development of a European register of clinical trials in children as part of the Fifth Framework Thematic Programme \"Quality of Life\" in 2002. The project DEC-net is coordinated by the Laboratory of Mother and Child Health of the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmaceutical Research in Milan and currently involves members of four countries; France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. It is unique in that it is the first population oriented clinical trial register. Such a register represents a useful source for planning new studies, promoting communications and collaborations between researchers, facilitating patient access and recruitment into trials, preventing trial duplication and inappropriate funding and identifying the therapeutic needs of children that remain neglected. It will also allow for active monitoring of new or evolved knowledge of drug therapies.","1444":"The prognostic value of heart rate (HR) was analysed based on the reports from the literature in the general population and in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Multivariate analyses showed that elevated resting HR was found to be an independent predictor of total and cardiovascular mortality. The behaviour of HR during exercise testing was predictive of sudden death. The beneficial effects of betablockers in post-infarction patients are well established. Calcium channel blockers that increase resting HR are associated with a deleterious effect on mortality. Therefore, resting HR should not be overlooked in risk stratification of CAD patients. Reduction of resting HR should be viewed as an attractive therapeutic target in CAD patients.","1445":"The aim of this study was to discuss the patterns of non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use in general population. We identified NSAID's users from the French Health Insurance System claims database covering more of the population in the Midi-Pyrenees area (southwest of France), if they have received at least one NSAID in June 2003. We discussed this population according to the NSAID used, to their demographic characteristics and to other drugs delivered in the period. Our study shows different patterns of use according to each NSAID. For example, users of ibuprofen or tiaprofenic acid were younger and less frequently exposed to \"gastroprotective\" drugs, users of coxibs were older and more frequently exposed to drugs increasing the risk of bleeding. This study confirms the wide use of NSAIDs and describes their target population. It underlines the interest of Health Insurance System Database for better knowledge of drug use in ambulatory care in France.","1446":"Our objective was to analyse economic consequences modifying first line chemotherapy in treatment non small cell lung cancer IIIB-IV.

Resources consumption were collected in a Pneumology department for 21 patients receiving previously mitomycine-ifosfamide-platin and for the 21 first patients receiving vinorelbine-platin, new patients diagnosed during year 2001. Costs were derived from hospital accounting system, economic analysis performed from the hospital and from the health French system points of view. Activity Synthetic Index point decrease of 2.9% per patient in vinorelbine-platin versus mitomycine-ifosfamide-platin, as an increase of 64.6% of hospital drug spending is registered (1,893 Euro versus 1,150 Euro) and an over cost of 15.7% for health French system (14179 Euro versus 12,257 Euro).

Direct medical costs were analysed retrospectively, over a 6-month period, from the health care payer's perspective. Eighty-eight patients (9.1%) out of 971 parkinsonian also received antihypotensive drugs. Direct medical costs were significantly higher in OH than in control group (4.425 vs. 3.074 Euro\/patient\/6 months, p &lt; 0.05). Beside hospitalisation and ancillary cares, drugs accounted for highest expenses (989 vs. 781 Euro\/patient\/6 months in control group) since use of controlled-release levodopa formulations or dopamine agonists was higher in OH group.

Since 1986, we could find several signals using classic pharmacovigilance techniques with case reports registered in our pharmacovigilance regional centre. From this dataset 3,324 cases were related to spontaneous reporting. Drug-ADR associations were generated by using a Data Mining Algorithm (DMA) proposed by Evans et al. Potential signals were evaluated by reviewing case reports related to the unlabelled associations. The DMA generated 523 associations of which 107 were not described in the SPC. Most potential signals were false positives. Although the DMA generated little additional knowledge compared to signals already detected using classic techniques, the whole process helped us to focus our case review on a very small subset of the whole dataset (9.6%).","1464":"This paper reviews recent data on the pharmacovigilance of antiparkinsonian drugs and drugs inducing parkinsonian syndroms. Sudden sleep attacks were first described in 1999 with dopamine agonists. In fact, they can be induced by all the dopaminergic antiparkinsonian drugs. Favorising factors are duration of the disease, dose of dopaminergic drugs, daytime somnolence or dysautonomia. This adverse drug reaction can be serious leading, for example, to road accidents. Cardiac valvulopathies were more recently (end of 2002) described with pergolide. Thus, this dopamine agonist should now be prescribed as a last choice among dopamine agonists. Dopamine drugs (levodopa as well as dopamine agonists) can induce hypersexual behaviours or pathological gambling. Among the long list of drugs inducing parkinsonian syndroms, recent data suggest the involvement of serotoninergic antidepressants, valproic acid and trimetazidine. Finally, these data on pharmacovigilance allow to precise the physiological role of dopamine: beside its motor and psychic effects, dopamine is also involved in the sleep-arousal control. It is also an important mediator for pleasure, hedonic regulations and sexual behaviour. This review also underlines the major role of spontaneous reports to the pharmacovigilance systems to identify new adverse drug reactions.","1465":"The aim of this study was to evaluate if the prescriptions of anticholinesterase drugs took into account some diseases and drugs which could interfere with them, in 58 inpatients (82 years old). The anticholinesterase drugs were respectively at admission and discharge: donepezil (n = 27 and 34), galantamine (n = 12 and 19) and rivastigmine (n = 3 and 1). Nineteen patients received a combination of anticholinesterase drug with an anticholinergic drug (muscarinic antipsychotic 15 times). Twelve patients had a medical history which interfered with the anticholinesterase drug: uretroprostatic obstacle, chronic renal failure and auriculo-ventricular block. Thirty-five adverse drug reactions, mainly in digestive track, were recorded in 26 patients. The treatment with anticholinesterase drug was modified only in 18 patients and the combination of anticholinesterase drug and antipsychotic agent was stopped in 5 patients. In conclusion, inappropriated prescriptions of anticholinesterase drugs seem frequent, with a more important prevalence of adverse drug reactions than in prospective studies. These results incite to develop studies of evaluation of prescriptions of anticholinesterase drugs.","1466":"Pharmacoepidemiological studies exploring utilisation of psychotropic medications in real-life conditions are required to identify extension of indications, since the risk of gap between the theoretical target population and the population actually treated is especially marked for this class of drugs. A large proportion of subjects from the general population are exposed to psychotropic medications, so even a small increase in the risk of adverse effect may have major deleterious consequences for the health of the general population. Hence, pharmacoepidemiological studies are also required to explore the risk\/benefit ratio of these drugs in real-life conditions. These studies may provide answers to currently unsolved public health questions, such as the long-term cognitive impact of exposure to benzodiazepines, the impact of antidepressant on suicidal behaviour, or the risks associated with enlarged use of antipsychotics. Only findings obtained by such studies may allow risk management and elaboration of guidelines based upon factual data.","1467":"In France the role of the French National Medicines Assessment Committee, which is a part of the French National Authority for Health (HAS), is to evaluate the expected performance of new drugs in comparison with that of existing drug or non-drug treatments. This process includes evaluation of degree of innovation generally based on whether the drug can be considered as possibly, likely or certain to represent a factor of progress. However innovation and progress are not always synonymous. Progress is defined in terms of improvement in efficacy or tolerance determined by estimating the impact of the new product in comparison with existing modalities on the health of a subgroup of patients that can be readily defined, identified and studied. In general the committee considers any originality as positive since a new chemical or pharmacological class or a new mechanism of action may allow treatment of patients that did not respond to or tolerate existing products. However, when confronted with a concept without clear clinical benefits, the committee must distinguish between true and false innovation so that deliberation focuses more on recognition and quantification of progress than on systematic evaluation of innovation.","1468":"Nasal obstruction, a prominent feature of rhinitis, may be quantified in humans by haemodynamic techniques (measuring local blood flux), static methods (measuring the geometry of nasal cavities) and dynamic methods (assessing the patency of nasal airways through the measure of resistance to air flow).

Controlled double-blind studies established the clinical efficacy of xylometazoline in infectious and allergic (seasonal and perennial) rhinitis versus placebo and in comparison with various reference substances. The effects on nasal epithelium ciliary activity which are observed in vitro are modest and even less pronounced in vivo owing to dilution in situ and protective physiological processes.","1469":"","1470":"The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) especially the arylcarboxylic, are widely prescribed for their different properties.

Is it possible then to measure and to objectify what is called the placebo effect? And if that is possible, how? This article calls into question the extent of the placebo effect evaluated by means of controlled clinical trials, without denying its importance in medical practice. Firstly it raises the epistemological problem of the real possibility, via experimentation, of objectifying psychological therapeutic effects. And secondly, the question is also raised of the interest for medical care of objectifying those effects.

Physicians are still waiting for good criteria to select which antidepressant has more chances of being effective in certain patients. Nevertheless, guidelines for antidepressant prescription could improve the rate of success in treating depression. All antidepressant medications share the same indication: a major depressive episode. Some compounds have indications other than a major depressive episode, which may be taken into account by the prescribing physician. Many researchers have tried to identify predictive criteria of response to antidepressants. The predictive clinical criteria include: endogeneity, early response, severity and duration of depression, pathological personality traits, quality of the environment, and co-morbid organic abnormalities. Paraclinical criteria have also been studied: levels of monoamines, neuro-endocrinological parameters, enzymatic activities, polysomnography, and brain imaging. Different recommendations have been proposed to guide therapeutic strategies from the acute period to the post-acute period, but three items have been mentioned most often: risk of negative side effects, patient expectations, and level of proof of efficacy of the compounds. Mild to moderate major depressive episodes raise a difficult question: can psychotherapy be an alternative option to antidepressant medication?","1500":"Assessing depressive symptomatology in antidepressant drug trials is limited by the absence of external validators of depression. Moreover, a high level of standardisation is required by regulatory authorities for registering new drugs. Consequently, the methods used are relatively old, and recent improvements have been minor. Methods used to assess new antidepressants appear highly standardised and lack objectivity. Improvements to these methods may emerge from the discovery of external validators of depression on the one hand and of drugs with new mechanisms of action on the other.","1501":"To improve the management of depressive states, it is essential to develop preclinical behavioural models for the characterisation of both conventional and new antidepressant agents. This need is illustrated in this article with two very different classes of antidepressant agents, serotonin and\/or noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and neurokinin NK1 receptor antagonists. Their effects are evaluated in rodent models of (i) the detection of potential antidepressant activity via marble-burying behaviour in mice; (ii) drug discrimination procedures in rats (mechanistic); and (iii) the evaluation of potential activity on co-morbid symptoms, such as anxiety, via the social recognition test in rats and gerbils. It is concluded that behavioural assays offer a palette of techniques for the characterisation of clinically active antidepressants as well as for innovative (acting on new targets) or improved (multi-target) antidepressants. Nevertheless, for antidepressants of the future, as for established antidepressants, feedback from clinical trials are awaited to confirm the predictive value of these models.","1502":"The main hypothesis regarding the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs is monoaminergic and mainly involves two neurotransmitters, serotonin and noradrenaline. Despite the well-recognized therapeutic efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), some disadvantages still occur. For example, they often require 4-6 weeks to achieve clinical benefits in depressed patients. In the past, some molecules that could shorten this long delay of action have been identified. The role of presynaptic autoreceptors - the activation of which leads to an inhibitory feedback control on neurotransmitter synthesis and release - has been extensively studied for antidepressant effects. In our laboratory, we studied the combined effects of an SSRI and a serotonin autoreceptor antagonist of the 5-HT1B subtype using intracerebral in vivo microdialysis in awake, freely moving mice. Important information on SSRIs has been obtained by applying this technique to genetically modified animals, such as constitutive knockout (KO) mice lacking 5-HT1B receptors (5-HT1B KO) generated by homologous recombination: we compared the effects of a combined treatment on extracellular\/intrasynaptic levels of serotonin in various nerve terminals area in wild-type control and KO mice. Thus, we found that indirect activation of 5-HT1B autoreceptors limits the effects of SSRIs on dialysate 5-HT levels at serotonergic nerve terminals such as the ventral hippocampus. The study of substance P (neurokinin 1 receptor [R-NK1]) offers another example of the use of KO mice in the development of a new class of antidepressant drugs. NK1 receptor antagonists may display anxiolytic\/antidepressant-like properties. The lack of selective compounds for each tachykinin receptor subtype (R-NK 1, R-NK2 or R-NK3) and differences in their affinity between animal species have made R-NK1 KO mice a very useful experimental tool. In collaborative work we found that genetic (R-NK1 KO mice) or pharmacological (GR205171) blockade of R-NK1 is associated with several changes: the increase in cortical 5-HT outflow caused by systemic injection of paroxetine was 4- to 6-fold higher in freely moving R-NK1 KO mice than in wild-type controls. The constitutive lack of NK1 receptors is associated with a functional desensitization of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors, resembling that induced by chronic treatment with SSRI antidepressants. These results highlight the link between a neurotransmitter (serotonin) and a neuropeptide (substance P). This genetic strategy allowed us to point out that multiple targets participate to the effects of classical antidepressant drugs within the brain. We hope that, soon, some mice lines (constitutive or tissue specific, conditional rescue mice having alterations of sleep\/wakefulness and\/or food intake, altered central serotonin and\/or noradrenaline neurotransmission, deficit in neurotrophic factors, but increases in intrasynaptic concentrations of substance P) could be a relevant model of the physiopathology of depressive disorders, and could help us understand the appearance of some symptoms. These recent findings suggest that instead of being rejected, the monoaminergic hypothesis of depression should be improved, corrected and completed by studying the role of other neurotransmitter, neuromodulatory compounds (substance P, BDNF [brain-derived neurotrophic factor]). By doing so, it thus could be possible to improve antidepressant drug treatment, i.e. shorten their long delay of action and\/or to decrease treatment resistance or improve its tolerance.","1503":"Neuroplasticity contributes to both normal and pathological brain function. A recent hypothesis links depression to lack of adaptive responses to stress or other aversive stimuli, and effects of antidepressant treatments on adult neurogenesis are more and more extensively studied because of the structural changes involved in the pathophysiology of depression. Indeed, neuronal remodelling in hippocampal formation is associated with chronic stress and is reversed by antidepressant treatments in animals. Decrease in hippocampal volume has also been associated to cognitive deficits in patients with major depression. Interestingly, serotonergic (5-HT) systems play a major role both as antidepressants and by increasing hippocampal neurogenesis through various receptor subtypes. Recently, we have also demonstrated that agomelatine, a new antidepressant drug having serotonergic and melatonergic properties, can increase proliferation and survival of newly formed hippocampal cells. Although the mechanisms underlying such effects are still unknown, these data reinforce the view that changes in hippocampal neurogenesis might belong to the cellular correlates of mood disorders.","1504":"Serotonin (5-HT)2C receptors play an important role in the modulation of monoaminergic transmission, mood, motor behaviour, appetite and endocrine secretion, and alterations in their functional status have been detected in anxiodepressive states. Further, 5-HT2C sites are involved in the actions of several classes of antidepressant. At the onset of treatment, indirect activation of 5-HT2C receptors participates in the anxiogenic effects of selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) as well as their inhibition of sleep, sexual behaviour and appetite. Conversely, progressive down-regulation of 5-HT2C receptors parallels the gradual onset of clinical efficacy of SSRIs. Other antidepressants, such as nefazodone or mirtazapine, act as direct antagonists of 5-HT2C receptors. These observations underpin interest in 5-HT2C receptor blockade as a strategy for treating depressive and anxious states. This notion is supported by findings that 5-HT2C receptor antagonists stimulate dopaminergic and adrenergic pathways, exert antidepressant and anxiolytic actions in behavioural paradigms, and favour sleep and sexual function. In addition to selective antagonists, novel strategies for exploitation of 5-HT2C receptors embrace inverse agonists, allosteric modulators, ligands of homo\/heterodimers, modulators of interactions with 'postsynaptic proteins', dual melatonin agonists\/5-HT2C receptor antagonists and mixed 5-HT2C\/alpha2-adrenergic antagonists. Intriguingly, there is evidence that stimulation of regionally discrete populations of 5-HT2C receptors is effective in certain behavioural models of antidepressant activity, and promotes neurogenesis in the hippocampus. This article explains how these ostensibly paradoxical actions of 5-HT2C antagonists and agonists can be reconciled and discusses both established and innovative strategies for the exploitation of 5-HT2C receptors in the improved management of depressed and anxious states.","1505":"Monoaminergic systems, and in particular serotoninergic neurons of the raphe system, have been involved in the physiopathology and treatment of major depression in a great number of studies. One of the most reproducible effects of antidepressant treatment is the increase of central 5-HT (serotonin) tone. However, the identification of novel potential therapeutic targets (neurohormones, neuropeptides) for treating depression has led to elaborating novel cellular and molecular concepts accounting for stress-related mood disorders. In particular, recent studies have demonstrated that chronic administration of all classes of antidepressants up-regulates neurogenesis in adult rodent hippocampus. The possibility that structural remodelling may contribute to the physiopathology of mood disorders provides new avenues of research toward understanding the cellular basis of mood disorders.","1506":"Depressive thoughts have been apparent since the origins of humanity. References to depressive thoughts can be found in philosophical writings and other literature since antiquity. They were always approached in a religious or medical way, with arguments for a mix of psychological and mystical origins. With the advent of psychiatry as a medical discipline, depressive syndromes were integrated into classifications of mental disorders. The definition of depression is multifactorial, integrating psychosocial, social and biological factors. In this article we use an historical perspective to describe the sociological, psychopathological and biological concepts relating to depressive illness. Over one century, the sociology of mental illness has evolved from the Durkheimian position to psychosocial models which incorporate environmental stressors, social support and coping mechanisms. Psychology encompasses psychoanalytical, cognitive-behavioural and phenomenological theories. Finally, biological psychiatry suggests various approaches--genetic, biochemical, neurophysiological, neuroanatomical.... The therapeutic directions are central to these concepts, just like public health, which seeks to promote the concept of mental health rather than to limit itself to the definition of the various psychiatric disorders.","1507":"","1508":"Pharmacoepidemiological studies exploring utilisation of psychotropic medications in real-life conditions are required to identify extension of indications, since the risk of gap between the theoretical target population and the population actually treated is especially marked for this class of drugs.

Hence, pharmacoepidemiological studies are also required to explore the risk\/benefit ratio of these drugs in real-life conditions. These studies may provide answers to currently unsolved public health questions, such as the long-term cognitive impact of exposure to benzodiazepines, the impact of antidepressant on suicidal behaviour, or the risks associated with enlarged use of antipsychotics.

Most were carried out in developed countries. Standard methodological principles were applied in almost all the trials: randomisation (85.4%), comparison (87.5%) versus placebo (95.2%), and blinded design (81.3%). The duration of the studies was short. Sample sizes were generally small, ranging from 30 to 99 subjects; statistical tests were used in 90% of the trials.

A protocol for measuring errors in the preparation and administration of medication has been developed and used in an internal medicine department at the University Hospital of Dijon. This protocol has enabled several different rates of medication errors to be determined depending on the calculation approach used: 15.1% with respect to interventions by nurses, 41% relating to the total number of opportunities for error, and 8.8% with respect to a methodological problem analysed in the study. The potential clinical significance, incidence and causes of errors during the medication process were also analysed.

First, the level of expected therapeutic progress must be established. This first stage requires the determination of therapeutic needs and the comparison of these against the results of the clinical studies that will form the basis of the marketing authorisation of the drug. This determination helps anticipate the therapeutic progress that is attributable to the approved use of the new drug. The second stage of the process, the evaluation of the actual therapeutic progress, involves therapeutic drug monitoring and bases itself on observation. Since such observational data are intended to challenge the initial hypotheses and uncertainties (in terms of benefits and risks), goals and methods must be laid out before the drug becomes available to the general public.","1519":"Continuing advances in life sciences and medical research are the result of the remarkable achievements of cell and molecular biology.

A randomised, controlled, double-blind study is the best method of estimating the efficacy of a treatment. It provides the least biased and most robust estimate of the causal relationship. In certain situations and on the basis of certain criteria, observational studies can have a proof-of-efficacy value. Randomised, controlled, pre- and postmarketing authorisation (MA) clinical studies identify the rarer adverse effects and compare them with those resulting from the reference treatment. Before the MA, the pooled safety data from different controlled trials can provide an estimation of relatively frequent adverse events and subjects at risk. However, an observational study is the most appropriate method of evaluating the safety of a drug in the currently used conditions. By definition, a drug influences the health of a population if it directly or indirectly improves its health. A drug would have a major role in public health if it reduced mortality or morbidity related to a particular disease or if it improved the quality of life of patients with this disease. Prior to marketing a product, modelling is the approach of choice to quantify the expected effect. Pragmatic, postmarketing trials and observational studies are the reference methods used to define the population affected, the efficacy and safety of the drug in a real situation and its usefulness for public health. In conclusion, randomised clinical trials remain the reference approach for evaluating efficacy, while observational studies have a confirmatory value. Observational studies are the most appropriate way of evaluating safety in the currently used conditions, as the clinical trial has limited indications.

The mean (+\/- SD) age and weight of the subjects in group A were 27.52 +\/- 3.48 years and 65.60 +\/- 8.06kg, respectively, while the mean (+\/- SD) values for the individuals in group B were 30.75 +\/- 3.78 years and 68.55 +\/- 6.59kg. Recombinant and plasma pooled vaccines were administered as single 20 microg and 3 microg intramuscular injections to the respective groups of volunteers on days 1, 30, and 180. An automated system (AxSYM, based on microparticle enzyme immunoassay) was used to measure the seroconversion rate in serum harvested from an 8 mL blood sample collected within 1 month of the third dose (i.e., on day 210), from each volunteer. Both of the vaccines were well tolerated by all individuals and no adverse reaction was reported or observed during the study. The subject seroconversion rate corrected with reference to the cut-off rate after vaccination with DNA-derived vaccine was significantly greater (p &lt; 0.05) than that observed after the administration of plasma pooled-derived vaccine (51.64 +\/- 17.00 versus 22.96 +\/- 12.04). The vaccine response, as indicated by the seroconversion rate (concentration of anti-HBs in mIU\/mL) in the group vaccinated with genetically derived vaccine was observed to be better (p &lt; 0.01) when matched with the International Antibody Standard. ","1524":"Statin- and especially cerivastatin-induced muscle effects reported by patients and doctors to the Limoges centre of pharmacovigilance during the years 2000 and 2001 were compared. In both instances, only reports with complaints of muscle pain or modification of creatine phospokinase (CPK) values and cases with one statin or one statin-fibrate association were selected. In the reports of 28 patients (21 involving cerivastatin), 80 % of the patients complained of diffuse myalgia. The dose was normal. The CPK value (six cases) was 1.7 +\/- 0.9 N (upper limit of normal) [1-3.2 N]. Thirteen medical reports were received at the pharmacovigilance centre during the years 2000 and 2001: eight myalgias and five increases in CPK without muscle pain (9 +\/- 9 N [1-20 N]). No common cases were identified among patients' and doctors' reports. Doctors tended to declare more severe effects, not necessarily associated with clinical signs. Patients' reports were at times inaccurate. Before including patients' reports in the present pharmacovigilance database, a thorough reconsideration is necessary. ","1525":"After the withdrawal of cerivastatin from the market, a survey was performed concerning severe muscular disorders associated with statin treatments that were notified to the French national and pharmaceutical industry pharmacovigilance systems up to February 2002. Among the 238 cases analysed, 69 were related to cerivastatin, 86 to simvastatin, 49 to pravastatin, 23 to atorvastatin and 9 to fluvastatin. The reporting rate was six- to ten-times higher for cerivastatin than for other statins. A major risk factor for rhabdomyolysis with cerivastatin was its association with gemfibrozil. Postmarketing surveillance appears to be a major tool for early detection of safety problems with a new drug. ","1526":"The present study investigates the frequency of reports of muscular pain in cardiological outpatients. During 2003, 510 outpatients were included in this descriptive cross-sectional study. Of these, 49 (9.6%) reported muscular pain (regardless of the drug received). Among patients treated with hypolipidaemic drugs, 11.3% reported muscular pain (i.e. 12% of patients receiving statins and 8.2% of those receiving fibrates). In this study, there was no significant relationship in the frequency of muscular pain between patients receiving and those not receiving a hypolipidaemic drug. ","1527":"Neisseria meningitidis can cause asymptomatic carriage, followed by acquired immunity, or septicaemia, meningitis, septic arthritis or pericarditis. Vaccination induces protective bactericidal antibodies to invasive diseases. Meningococcal capsular polysaccharides are immunoprotective antigens from which vaccines are produced against serogroups A, C, Y and W135, including conjugate vaccines against serogroup C. There is no available vaccine against serogroup B, but outermembrane protein-based vaccines against this serogroup are currently being evaluated. Polysaccharide meningococcal vaccines are effective, but their strictly serogroup-specific efficacy raises concerns about the possible selection of escape variants. Therefore, meningococcal polysaccharide vaccines, either plain or conjugated, are indicated against the clonal expansion of strains whose serogroup has been properly identified and corresponds to the vaccine valence.","1528":"Two vaccines against varicella are now being licensed in France, both deriving from the Oka strain. Seroconversion has been obtained in almost 100% of the cases after one dose in toddlers and children, and two doses in adolescents and adults. Efficacy has been mainly established from the US experience, where a universal immunisation programme of children aged &gt; 12 months with a catch-up for susceptible adolescents and adults was begun in 1995. The incidence of varicella has decreased by about 85% over all age groups. The safety of the vaccine is good, and most adverse events are represented by fever, reactions at the injection site and varicella-like rashes. For the time being, France has adopted restrictive recommendations for the use of this vaccine because of uncertainties with respect to the duration of protection, a shift of the disease towards older age and the potential increase of the incidence of herpes-zoster.","1529":"Human papillomaviruses (HPV) have an epithelial tropism and numerous oncogenic HPV are responsible for uterine cervical cancer. Here we analyse the published studies concerning both prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines against HPV.","1530":"","1531":"Chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma associated with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are among the most serious human health problems in highly endemic regions. Despite the existence for many years of effective vaccines against HBV, more than 370 million people remain persistently infected with HBV today. Currently available therapies fail to provide long-term control of viral replication in most patients. Viral persistence has been associated with a defect in the development of HBV-specific cell-mediated immunity. Strategies to boost or to broaden the weak virus-specific T-cell response of patients with chronic hepatitis B have been proposed as a means of terminating this persistent infection. The immunogenicity of HBV envelope- or capsid-based vaccines, new formulations for recombinant vaccines as well as DNA-based vaccines are currently under investigation in clinical trials. Although improvements are still required, vaccination would be the therapeutic procedure with the lowest cost and the potentially greatest benefit.","1532":"Encapsulated bacterial pathogens (e.g. Haemophilus influenzae type b [Hib], Neisseria meningitidis, or Streptococcus pneumoniae) target infants and young children who have lost any protective anti-capsular antibodies supplied maternally and whose immune systems are ineffective against T-independent antigens such as the polysaccharides of the capsule. The polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines overcome this limitation by converting the polysaccharide to a T-dependent antigen, which allows a vaccinated infant to mount a protective immune response. Where conjugated vaccines have been introduced into paediatric vaccination schedules, the incidence of invasive diseases caused by Hib, the group C meningococcus, or the pneumococcus has plummeted by at least 80%, a major public health success. Furthermore, surveillance has demonstrated that the conjugate vaccines provide 'herd protection' through their beneficial impact on nasopharyngeal colonisation among vaccinated children. Promising future approaches include enhancement of the number of capsular serogroups targeted by the meningococcal or pneumococcal conjugate vaccines.","1533":"The HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)\/AIDS epidemic is of unprecedented gravity and is spreading rapidly, notably in the most disadvantaged regions of the world. The search for a preventive vaccine is thus an absolute priority. For over 10 years the ANRS (Agence Nationale de Recherches sur le SIDA) has been committed to an original programme combining basic science and clinical research. The HIV preventive vaccine research programme includes upstream research for the definition of immunogens, animal models, and clinical research to evaluate candidate vaccines. In 2004, most researchers believed that it should be possible to obtain partial vaccine protection through the induction of a strong and multiepitopic cellular response. Since 1992, 15 phase I and II clinical trials have been established with the aim of evaluating the safety of candidate vaccines and their capacity to induce cellular immune responses. The candidate vaccines tested were recombinant canarypox viruses (ALVAC) containing sequences coding for certain viral proteins, utilised alone or combined with other immunogens (whole or truncated envelope proteins). An original strategy, based on the use of lipopeptides, is also under development. These vaccines comprise synthetic fragments of HIV proteins associated with lipids that facilitate the induction of a cellular immune response. These approaches have within a short time allowed the assessment of a prime-boost strategy combining a viral vector and lipopeptides.","1534":"Developing efficient adjuvants for human vaccines, in order to elicit broad and sustained immune responses at systemic or mucosal levels, remains a challenge for the vaccine industry. Conventional approaches in the past have been largely empirical and partially successful. Selection was based on the balance between toxicity and adjuvanticity, first in an animal model, and then in clinical trials. The advent of improved biochemical techniques has allowed for the purification or construction of new and well characterised adjuvants. In addition, recent advances in our understanding of the immune system, most particularly with respect to early proinflammatory signals, have led to the identification of new biological targets for vaccine adjuvants. In particular, one can now choose adjuvants able to selectively induce T helper (Th)-1 and\/or Th2 responses, according to the vaccine target and the desired immune response. As our knowledge of the cell types and cytokines interacting in the immune responses increases, so does our understanding of the mode of action of adjuvants, as well as the way in which they produce adverse effects.","1535":"Live attenuated RNA viruses make highly efficient vaccines. Among them, measles virus (MV) vaccine has been given to a very large number of children and shown to be highly effective and safe. MV vaccine induces a life-long immunity after a single or two low-dose injections. It is easily produced on a large scale in most countries and can be distributed at low cost. Reversion to pathogenicity has never been observed with this vaccine. Because of all these characteristics, MV vaccine might be a very promising vector to immunise children against both measles and other infectious agents, such as HIV or flaviviruses, in the developing world. In this article, we describe recent data that we obtained showing the capacity of recombinant Schwarz MVs to express proteins from human immunodeficiency or West Nile viruses, and to induce specific immune responses able, in the case of West Nile virus, to protect from an experimental challenge.","1536":"The dramatic decrease in the incidence of hepatitis A in France renders routine vaccination unecessary. However, the main problem concerns prophylaxis for persons exposed to an index case, because nonspecific immunoglobulins are recommended but unavailable in France for this indication. The vaccination of persons who come into contact with an index case is possible in the days following exposure. Some data relating to exposure within the household and in small communities, including nursery schools, have been reported: immunisation in such situations is effective and recommended by the British Advisory Board in the 7 days following exposure, but not in France. The availability of this form of protection and active individual prophylaxis should be suggested to families by clinicians.","1537":null,"1538":"Pharmacoepidemiological studies are essential in the post-licensing surveillance of vaccines in order to evaluate the potential benefits and risks of vaccines used in common practice. Surveillance is required to detect rare or unanticipated vaccine adverse events and to ensure confidence in vaccination. Epidemiological studies provide data on the long-term protection conferred by vaccination, and the incidence and associated mortality of, and population susceptibility to, diseases preventable by vaccine. These studies also allow verification of the compatibility between strains contained in the vaccine as well as circulating strains.","1539":"The publication of the European Directive 2001\/20\/EC on the implementation of good clinical practice in trials has far-reaching consequences on the type of data to be submitted for evaluation by the competent authorities and ethics committees, in order to initiate a clinical trial with one or more site(s) in Europe. The ensuing commission guidelines and guidance provided by Member States at the time of national implementation describe the content of an application for a 'clinical trial authorisation' and its maintenance.

An observational study was conducted in real-life conditions, during a 6-month period, in 107 HIV patients receiving tenofovir. Mild-to-moderate hypophosphataemia (&lt;0.77 mmol\/L) occurred during follow-up, at least once in 43% of patients and at least twice in 27%. Antiretroviral therapy including ritonavir + lopinavir was significantly associated with the occurrence of hypophosphataemia (relative risk = 2.6; p = 0.03). Frequency of abnormal proteinuria was 22%. Creatinine clearance, phosphataemia, proteinuria and glycosuria should be closely monitored in patients receiving tenofovir therapy. ","1543":"The bioequivalence of aspirin from two enteric-coated brands, Nu-seals and Loprin, identified as the reference (R) and test (T) products, respectively, was assessed. A two-period randomised crossover design with a washout interval of 15 days was used in this study. The study results were determined in 16 healthy volunteers, all males with ages ranging from 19-28 (23.33 +\/- 3.74) years and bodyweights of 52-92 (65.89 +\/- 11.39) kg. After oral ingestion of 150mg of the either brand with 200 mL of water, serial blood samples were obtained over a period of 24 hours. Plasma, harvested from blood was analysed for the concentration of salicylic acid, a deacetylated metabolite of aspirin, by a validated high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for both formulations by an interactive computer-assisted PK II procedure. A general linear model for repeated measures and 90% confidence intervals (CI) was employed to assess the sequence of treatment effects and to exclude differences between the parameters due to the product and period of administration, respectively. The observed 90% CI ratios (Loprin\/Nu-seals) for peak concentration, time to reach the peak and area under the plasma-concentration time curve from zero to infinity of 1.03,1.08; 1.04,1.05 and 1.01,1.15, respectively, were within the bioequivalence range (0.80,1.25) stipulated by the US Food and Drug Administration. On the basis of the findings, the test (Loprin) and reference drug (Nu-seals) were deemed bioequivalent. ","1544":null,"1545":"Excessive or insufficient anticoagulation therapy and its associated risks are of major concern in patients receiving oral anticoagulants. Such complications can be avoided by more rigorous management. The aim of our study was to evaluate those patients receiving oral anticoagulant therapy on the day of hospitalisation among all patients admitted to the Amiens University Hospital during 14 days. We evaluated the quality of management of the treatment in these patients, taking into account the international normalised ratio (INR), as well as important parameters such as the summary of the product characteristics (SPCs), drug interactions, and the level of knowledge of anticoagulant treatment by the patients themselves (questionnaire). Of the 2498 adult patients hospitalised, 86 patients (30 female and 56 male aged between 26 and 95 years [mean 70 years]) treated with oral anticoagulants were evaluated. At admission, seven cases of haemorrhage and two of thrombosis were registered. One drug-related death occurred and one patient had sequelae. In 17.5% of the cases, the prescription was not fully in agreement with the SPCs. This percentage increased to 67% for patients with adverse effects. In 41% of the patients, the INR was outside the therapeutic zone. The dosage regimen was too complex in 11% of cases. Six drug combinations were labelled as not recommended in the SPCs: four with aspirin &lt;3 g\/day and two with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The analysis of questionnaires showed that patients had insufficient knowledge of their treatment: only 16 of 66 knew the risks resulting from overdose or an insufficient dose of the anticoagulant drug, 25 of 66 knew that anticoagulation induced by the treatment can be influenced by food, 10 of 66 knew the therapeutic range of the INR appropriate for them, and 8 of 66 knew that intramuscular injections were prohibited. These data confirm that anticoagulant treatment needs to be more strictly controlled in order to avoid adverse effects. Risks are probably underestimated by physicians. Information given to patients seems insufficient or unsuitable (too complex). ","1546":"Most cardiovascular events result from a thrombotic complication of atherosclerotic lesions. In arterial vessels such as the coronary bed, an interrelationship of haemostatic, coagulation and fibrinolytic factors is implicated. While it can be demonstrated that fibrinogen is a risk factor\/marker, the role of other factors is not well established. Under arterial flow conditions, platelets are predominantly involved in the thrombotic reaction. Yet, apart from a large increase in the platelet count, the involvement of platelet parameters in cardiovascular risk is not clearly evident. The lack of definitive platelet markers is at least partly due to the difficulty of studying platelet function ex vivo. Several polymorphisms of platelet glycoproteins carrying a moderate increase in risk have been reported, but only in younger patients. One potentially important factor for coagulation is the fibrin structure, which is dependent on fibrinogen, the rate of thrombin generation, the activity of factor XIII and the interrelationship of the cells concerned, all of which act on its sensitivity to thrombosis. Coagulation factors largely affect the rate of thrombin generation. The activity of the fibrinolytic system (and principally any deficiency) has a role in the cardiovascular risk. General markers of cardiovascular risk such as D-dimers are potentially useful, but they increase with thrombin generation and are decreased by a deficiency in fibrinolysis. Furthermore, possibly because they are not indicative of the fibrin structure, they are poorly correlated with clinical events. The poor significance of the available haemostatic, coagulation and\/or fibrinolytic parameters is probably due to their lack of representativeness, since haemostatic, coagulation and fibrinolytic systems are all involved in the thrombotic response (and some in atherogenesis itself). Atherogenesis is a multifactorial process and numerous moderate risk factors act in association. Better predictability of the haemostatic tests would probably result from both the design of more representative tests and the evaluation of multiple parameters, and would lead to the definition of a risk score. Technological advances will make this possible.","1547":"Most cardiovascular events result from a thrombotic complication of an atherosclerotic lesion. Inflammation plays a central role in both the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and the progression of its complications (especially plaque rupture). Fibrinogen, on the one hand a marker of inflammation and on the other a major determinant in thrombosis and haemorrheology, plays a central role in atherosclerosis and its thrombotic complications. The clinical data are in agreement with epidemiological data, and show that increased plasma fibrinogen levels (compared with values in paired controls) are predictive of the risk of cardiovascular events - both primary cardiovascular events in the general population and recurrence in patients. Determining the plasma fibrinogen level in terms of genetic predisposition and environmental factors provides a good example of the interrelationship between genes and the environment. It must be recognised that a minimal increase in the fibrinogen level (within the plasma reference values) is an indicator of a significantly increased risk. This shows why epidemiological data are not useful for determining cardiovascular risk in individual patients in daily clinical practice (with the exception of the very high levels that are infrequently observed).","1548":"A medical order is a medical and legal document; careful writing of this document enables the reduction of many therapeutic errors. The objective of this study was to evaluate the quality of order writing in Tunisian primary healthcare centres. This was a transversal descriptive survey of 2586 medical orders. The quality of the writing was assessed using two parameters: its legibility and the information delivered in it. Among the main results, 36% of orders contained at least 50% of the items retained, 25% of orders were completely illegible, and the quality of writing was considered good in 14% of cases. The study showed that hand-written orders in primary healthcare are far from complying with the medico-legal requirements. The teaching of order-writing technique and its computerisation are needed to improve the quality of medical prescribing. ","1549":"Very elderly subjects (aged &gt; or =80 years) and polypathological elderly subjects experience frequent and serious adverse drug effects. They are nevertheless still excluded from clinical research. We questioned geriatricians through a questionnaire about the usefulness and feasibility of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in this population. Forty-eight percent of geriatricians questioned did participate in RCTs, but 96.8% considered that RCTs including very elderly subjects were scientifically necessary. Among geriatricians who never participated in RCTs, 36% were never contacted regarding participation in such clinical research. The most important difficulties in developing RCTs in very elderly subjects were methodological difficulties (narrow eligibility criteria incompatible with patient heterogeneity) and those associated with patient consent. For 38.2% of the geriatricians, the fact that pharmaceutical companies are under no obligation to promote RCTs in very elderly subjects represents a major obstacle in the development of such RCTs. The development of RCTs involving very elderly subjects depends first on a political choice, together with an adapted regulatory framework. ","1550":"Ten years after the introduction of the first drug for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, tacrine, it seems appropriate to reappraise the pharmacological processes of innovation in the field of research in dementia. The aim of this review is to pinpoint concrete improvements achieved in this field, in terms of experimental methods and clinical evaluation of the compounds, as well as the neurochemistry of the disease and cellular targets deserving of initial consideration. * The article first considers the use of animal models of Alzheimer's disease, which are classified according to two categories: animals with lesions of some neuronal pathways specifically implicated in clinical symptoms (i.e. lesions of the nucleus basalis of Meynert, the origin of cholinergic projections to the cortex underlying memory processes); and transgenic models, which are intended to reproduce some of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Drugs can be tested in animals with such alterations for their effect on neuropathology, neurochemistry and behavioural disturbances. More recently, in silico models have been developed, which offer the possibility of simulating the pharmacodynamic effects of drugs in specific areas of the brain. These experiments are helpful in distinguishing purely symptomatic effects from disease-modifying effects, the latter being the ultimate goal of the modern pharmacology of dementia. * The second breakthrough considered in this article is the codification and standardisation of clinical methods for obtaining a more accurate and earlier diagnosis (the recent introduction of the concept of \"Mild Cognitive Impairment\", which includes patients who will later develop a true clinical dementia syndrome). In that respect, the determination of the biological markers of Alzheimer's disease (apolipoprotein E, amyloid substance, protein-tau, isoprostane) as well as progress in neuroimaging (functional positron emission tomography [fPET]-scan, single photon emission-computed tomography [SPECT], functional nuclear magnetic resonance [fNMR]) are discussed in terms of their potential as new tools in the early stages of drug development (surrogate markers). The methods used during the comparative clinical trials (phase III) have been elaborated and internationally standardised during the assessment of the different acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChE-I), with the knowledge that, since 1994, four of these have been officially approved: tacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine; the same methods have been used for developing memantine, a recently-launched modulator of glutamatergic neurotransmission. The validated scales now take into consideration not only the cognitive dimensions of Alzheimer's disease but also the behavioural symptoms, with the introduction of the concept of BPSD (behavioural psychological symptoms of dementia). Some proposals to improve this clinical assessment of anti-dementia drugs are presented here. * The section of this article dealing with prospective issues considers the main pathways of interest in drug innovation and the elucidation of new targets for the future compounds. As well as their symptomatic effects on the different components of cognition, drugs should be neuroprotective and limit the lesions documented in Alzheimer's disease, with the aim of progressing far beyond the amyloid hypothesis (immunisation, beta-sheet breakers, secretase inhibitors). The field of excitotoxicity (which is mainly glutamate dependent) appears fruitful, because of the possibility of pharmacological intervention at the different steps in the excitotoxic process. All the new directions presented in this article support the concept of true disease-modifying agents. In conclusion, this prospective review should be considered as a guide in fostering drug innovation in Alzheimer's disease and related disorders and should help to decrease the gap existing between neuroscience and therapeutics.","1551":"","1552":"","1553":"The aim of our experimental study was to determine the effect of exogenic nitrates on certain biological parameters in relation to renal insufficiency. Chronic treatment of rats for 5 months with varying nitrate concentrations (50, 100, 150 and 500 mg\/L) induced a dose-dependent reduction in plasma concentrations of total proteins and a dose-dependent increase in plasma urea concentrations and creatinine. This histological study of the kidney shows that nitrates at doses of 150 and 500 mg\/L cause a deterioration in the epithelia of the renal tubules. In conclusion, a high nitrate intake induces morphofunctional disturbances of the kidney and could thus be regarded as a causative factor in renal insufficiency.

We analysed the adverse effects associated with antidepressants in subjects aged &gt; or =75 years reported to the pharmacovigilance centres in France. Among the 2381 cases recorded between 1985 and 2001, the distribution of adverse effects may reflect sales figures: 1040 for SSRIs (44%), 586 for tricyclic and related antidepressants (25%), 46 for monoamine oxidase inhibitors (2%) and 654 for other antidepressants (27%). Adverse effect patterns differed according to antidepressant class. For SSRIs, hyponatraemia was predominant (30%), followed by psychiatric (13%) and nervous system (10%) effects. For tricyclic antidepressants, psychiatric effects (confusion, agitation) [21%] were the most frequent followed by cardiovascular effects (15%). However, the consequences of adverse effects such as hyponatraemia are far from negligible in the elderly.","1556":"Hiccup is a sudden contraction of the inspiratory muscles, followed by an abrupt closure of the glottis, thus producing a characteristic sound. In the literature, some drugs have been reported to induce hiccup. We discuss three case reports after administration of benzodiazepine to healthy young subjects during two clinical trials. In the first study (a bioequivalence trial of two forms of lormetazepam, tablets and oral solution), 12 subjects were included in an open controlled crossover study with two periods separated by a washout of 7 days. Two subjects presented with hiccup after administration of lormetazepam (2mg oral solution). The symptom resolved in 10 and 40 minutes, respectively. In one subject, rechallenge with a tablet of lormetazepam was positive. The aim of the second study was to assess the effect of sleep deprivation and lorazepam-induced sedation on saccadic eye movements in 12 healthy subjects. Hiccup occurred in one subject 3h 15 after administration of a single oral dose of lorazepam (2mg) and resolved in 45 minutes. All cases were evaluated according to the French imputation method. These observations are discussed with regard to the drug classes mentioned most frequently in the literature.","1557":null,"1558":"Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) have been recognised as an important cause of hospital admission. Most of these drug-related admissions were expected ADRs and, thus, partly preventable. However, as far as we know, the assessment of the preventability of ADRs was addressed in only two studies performed in France. In contrast, several other studies have been performed, mainly in the USA, and using different methods of assessing preventability. None of these methods were clearly evaluated with regard to reproducibility, validity or relevance. The purpose of this study was to initiate the validation of a French preventability scale. Here, we propose the first two phases of validation: the content validity and reliability of the scale. A working group of pharmacovigilance experts has been specifically established for this purpose. The content validity was assessed by collecting items representative of preventability. The choice and the formulation of items and a proposal of a score (global and for each item) were adopted after the consensus of the experts. A definitive version of the ADR preventability scale was used for the assessment of reliability. During the second phase, experts independently tested the new scale from observations of ADRs (49 central nervous system haemorrhages with antivitamine K). The concordance of the experts' judgements was calculated using two statistical methods (Kappa statistic and correlation coefficient). The content validity phase was performed during several workshops where experts discussed the choice and formulation of the best items. We decided to construct a scale with a small number of items, allowing a rapid evaluation of the preventability of ADRs. On the basis of a global score, four categories of preventability of ADRs (\"preventable\", \"potentially preventable\", \"unclassable\", \"not preventable\" ADRs) were proposed. The agreement of experts regarding the global score was low, with a poor correlation coefficient value (coefficient interclass = 0.491). Classification of ADRs in the four categories by the experts showed discrepancies (Kappa = 0.1136). The preventability assessment using this scale was feasible, although poor concordance between the judges has raised some questions. Several experts found use of this scale difficult in terms of a clear understanding of the items, and found that two of them were redundant. We have oversimplified some items and revision of their formulation will be necessary. Moreover, most of ADR notifications were poorly documented, resulting in a frequent choice of an \"unevaluable\" item. This represented an important bias in the calculation of the global score. This experience suggests the need for further studies to improve this French ADR preventability scale and validate it in differing circumstances, in order to provide a useful tool to enhance the rational use of drugs.","1559":"The purpose of this survey in 50 healthy volunteers from a single-centre study was to assess from a questionnaire filled in by the participants, their comprehension and evaluation of the written and oral information and the legal framework, as well as their uncertainty regarding participation, in terms of age, gender and profession. Overall satisfaction with regard to comprehension and oral information was recorded, but 42% of volunteers considered the informed consent form too long and one-quarter of them did not read it completely. Knowledge of the legal framework (20%) did not influence either their understanding or hesitation to participate. The hesitant individuals (26%) more often judged this framework to be reassuring than the non-hesitant individuals (77% versus 38%; p = 0.015). These findings concerned females, medics or paramedics and younger individuals (&lt; or =35 years).

Progress in genomics and proteomics, and the resulting extraordinary increase in knowledge with regard to interactions between gene expression, the environment and behaviour, the customisation of risk factors and the need to combine therapies that individually have minimal though well documented efficacy, has led doctors to raise new questions: how to optimise choice and the application of therapeutic strategies at the individual rather than the group level, while taking into account all the available evidence? This is essentially a problem of complexity with dimensions similar to the previous ones: multiple parameters with nonlinear relationships between them, varying time scales that cannot be ignored etc. Numerical modelling and simulation (in silico investigations) have the potential to meet these challenges. Such approaches are considered in drug innovation and development. They require a multidisciplinary approach, and this will involve modification of the way research in pharmacology is conducted.","1563":"","1564":"","1565":"","1566":"","1567":"","1568":"","1569":"Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common endocrine disorders. A large number of studies are in progress to identify natural substances that are effective in reducing the severity of diabetes. Although a number of drugs are currently marketed, their long-term use can cause a number of adverse effects. In the present study, we examined the effect of photo-irradiated curcumin on experimental diabetes in order to evaluate the antihyperglycaemic effects of this compound on streptozotocin (40 mg\/kg bodyweight)-induced diabetes. Photo-irradiated curcumin was given at a dose of 10, 30 and 80 mg\/kg bodyweight. The level of blood glucose was elevated in the diabetic animals. The liver, kidney and brain were assayed for the degree of lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione content and the activity of enzymic and levels of non-enzymic antioxidants. Antioxidant status decreased in the diabetic animals. Oral administration of photo-irradiated curcumin for 45 days resulted in a significant decrease in the levels of blood glucose, together with near normalisation of enzymic activity and the markers of lipid peroxidation. The best results were obtained in rats treated with 30 mg\/kg bodyweight of photo-irradiated curcumin. ","1570":"In order to evaluate the attractiveness of France for conducting international clinical trials, a survey was performed among pharmaceutical companies that are based in France or that have affiliates in France. The survey concerned international phase II and III clinical studies carried out in 2002 and 2003. Ten pharmaceutical companies representing 36% of the French market completed the survey. 134 trials were analysed in total. France recruited 8.3% of the overall number of patients recruited, and 15.0% of those recruited within Europe. France was within the overall mean with regard to the percentage of active centres (78.5% versus 79.5%) and the percentage of patients evaluable according to protocol (86.8% versus 87.3%). In contrast, France ranked within the last third of analysed countries with respect to the speed of recruitment (1.5 versus 1.9 patients\/centre\/month), and the number of queries per observation (16.8 versus 10.9). The analysis of the qualitative indicators of performance showed that, although the perception of pharmaceutical companies towards the quality of French medicine and administrative authorities is positive, France notably needs to improve the productivity of its clinical research in order to enhance its attractiveness for the pharmaceutical sponsors of clinical trials.","1571":"The chirality of drugs has emerged as a major theme in drug design, discovery, development and intellectual property. Single enantiomers offer some advantages and two options are available: the switch from an existing racemic drug to the single enantiomer or the development of an enantiomerically pure chiral drug. At present, the second possibility is systematically considered. The possibility of chiral switch has led to innovative drugs. However, this opportunity may be limited by several factors: the spontaneous interconversion of the two enantiomers, the pharmacokinetic profile or the selective toxicity of the most active enantiomer, and the difficulty of demonstrating the clinical superiority of one enantiomer over the racemate. Finally, the small size of the market, the policies of the drug agencies and\/or the patent problem also limit the development of enantiomers. All these factors have led the pharmaceutical industry to develop new galenic forms rather than enantiomers when the patent of the racemate is expiring.","1572":"The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency and characteristics of \"supportive\" drug use and addictive behaviour in the working environment. In May 2000, 2106 workers were asked to complete an anonymous self-questionnaire during their annual compulsory examination to assess their aptitude for work. Data collected concerned socioprofessional characteristics, perceived stress, job satisfaction and satisfaction outside of the workplace, and the use of licit psychoactive substances (alcohol, coffee, drugs) to face up to job strain. One-third of workers used drugs in the context of work: 20% used drugs to be in good form at work, 12% used drugs at the workplace for an awkward symptom, and 18% used drugs to relax after a difficult day's work. This use concerned mainly psycholeptic drugs, which were combined with caffeine and alcohol. This behaviour and nicotine dependence were more frequent in employees and manual workers. Apart from alcohol use, psychological distress and female gender were associated with such behaviour. The use of medications or other licit psychoactive substances in order to face up to work difficulties is a frequent phenomenom, which concerned one-third of this sample of the French working population. Our results give an initial estimation of this little known \"doping\" behaviour. ","1573":"A regional survey was performed between June and September 2002, to evaluate knowledge and attitudes of emergency physicians regarding adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting in a French district. 100 questionnaires completed by physicians working in emergency departments and\/or mobile intensive care units were analysed. The frequency of ADRs encountered by emergency practitioners was estimated at &gt; or = 0.73 per year and per physician. The ADR notification rate in emergency medicine was estimated at &lt; or = 6%. A minority of physicians were responsible for the majority of ADR reporting. Sixty-four percent of emergency physicians underestimated the conditions required for ADR notification: 28% thought that certain causality was an absolute necessary condition for notification, while 37% considered that notification was required only for ADRs that were both severe and unexpected. Interventions focused on advertising ADR reporting procedures could help to improve the notification rate in emergency medicine. ","1574":"A new antipsychotic compound induced unexpected red cell hypoplasia (reticulocytopenia, red marrow hypoplasia) in rats dosed orally for 7 days. Since an erythropoietin-mediated pathogenesis was excluded, in vitro tests on rat and human bone marrow cells were performed with measurement of formation of late erythroid (CFU-E) and granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) colony-forming units after incubation with the drug. CFU-E together with growth factors were cultured for 2 days (rat) or 7 days (human) and CFU-GM was cultured for 7 days (rat) or 10 days (human). The drug induced inhibition of erythroid progenitors and myeloid progenitors for both species from 3 x 10(-5) mol\/L, with the concentration inhibiting the growth of 50% (IC50) consistent with drug plasma levels measured in rats. These cloning assays on rat bone-marrow cells were shown to be adequate models for determining the haematotoxicity of the agent and to be predictive of human toxicity. With only a small amount of compound required, they can be used as screening tools to detect haematotoxic potential of candidate drugs. ","1575":"In France, the regional pharmacovigilance centres manage drug overdose as adverse drug reactions (ADRs) using the French ADR causality assessment method, and some poison control centres (e.g. in Paris) do likewise for the most serious cases. The aim of the study was to analyse and compare the chronological and semiological scores calculated with this method, in cases of drug overdose and ADRs in children recorded in the French pharmacovigilance ADR database. In total, 7963 cases were analysed. The distribution of semiological criteria in drug overdose and ADR cases differed significantly (G-test), with a similar result for chronological criteria (but to a lesser degree). The distinction of two types of criteria in the French ADR causality assessment method appears useful for analysing cases of drug overdose in children. This finding triggers a renewed interest in the use of this method of causality assessment of drug overdose in children, and possibly in adults.

The 0- to 3-year age group accounted for 71.7% of cases of childhood poisoning. Accidental poisoning was predominant up to 12 years, while from 13 to 18 years poisoning was essentially deliberate. The principal route of exposure was oral and involved liquids for babies and solid products for older children. The toxic agents most often implicated were pharmaceuticals and domestic products. The place of poisoning was mainly the home. A 'no-risk' evaluation was performed, and varied between 41.6% before the age of 3 years to 18.0% for the 13- to 18-year age group. The oldest children were more often managed in medical facilities. Fortunately, most of these poisoning cases were not serious (death rate: 0.026%). The poison control centres' information system is continuing to expand: it will allow an improvement in medical health monitoring associated with poisoning.

In order to assist this commission, several centres for evaluation and information on pharmacodependence (CEIP) were created throughout in France. Recently, in order to complete their epidemiological tools, several centres have developed another pharmacoepidemiological approach using data for refunded prescriptions obtained from the local and regional French Health Insurance database. This article underlines the potential contribution of the Health Insurance database to improving knowledge of drug use in the real-life conditions based on studies performed by the CEIP. Several examples are given showing the extent of the possibilities (population-based studies, cohort studies, development of misuse indicators). In spite of their limitations (e.g. the difference between consumption and delivery), these examples confirm that these database may be a novel tool for CEIP to assess a potential abuse of a medication.","1580":"The EPIGRAM pharmacoepidemiological study was conducted in general practitioners prescribing orlistat (Xenical) in order to describe, under real clinical conditions, the management of obese or overweight patients. A 1-year follow-up of a patient cohort treated with orlistat was also conducted. Quality criteria specific to the study were defined to ensure the scientific validity of the results; these criteria mainly involved the following items: independent scientific committee, sampling investigator's recruitment, study organisation and quality control of the collected data. On-site control visits of a sample of 13% of participating GPs revealed that 75% of the controlled data were documented in a source file of which 85% were consistent with the source data. Only 1% of the 130 000 controlled data (data were controlled only on visits for which information was available) gave rise to correction requests.

Reimbursement patterns of NSAIDs and analgesics were studied in a cohort of 232 users, half selected from authorisations of reimbursed spa cures, and the other half - strictly matched according to age and gender - who had redeemed at study onset at least one prescription for NSAIDs, analgesics or other antirheumatic drugs. Drug utilisation was measured as the total number of defined daily doses (DDD) bought over the 9-month study period. Over this time, the patients bought a median 45 DDD of NSAIDs out of the 270 needed to cover the whole period. Only two patients bought 270 DDD or more. Median paracetamol use (alone or combined) was 26 days. This study shows that patients use NSAIDs either intermittently or at lower than recommended doses, which is consistent with a primarily symptomatic use. Intermittent or on-demand use of NSAIDs, or at doses lower than full, could partly explain the lower rates of gastrointestinal bleeding and other ulcer complications in postmarketing epidemiological studies than could be expected from the findings of clinical trials.","1588":"This French pharmacoepidemiological study describes triptan use in general practice for triptan 'naive' (never treated by a triptan before study inclusion) and 'non-naive' (already treated by a triptan) patients. Data from 1774 patients were analysed (81% women). The mean age of the patients was 41 years (+\/-12.8). This study showed that 95% of the patients had a diagnosis of migraine according to the International Headache Society (IHS) criteria. This result confirmed the effective use of triptans by general practitioners. Migraines in patients treated with triptans in the present study were more severe than in subjects reporting migraine in the general population. 'Naive' and 'non-naive' patients had similar IHS diagnoses and severity profiles but, for 'non-naive' patients, the migraine history was longer and the disability (quality of life) reported was worse than for the 'naive' patients. The reasons for the treatment switch were the need for improved efficacy, a faster onset of action, fewer recurrences and better tolerability.","1589":"The official regulatory recommendations for drug development and the granting of marketing authorisations are intended for use by pharmaceutical companies and the regulatory agencies. These recommendations are particularly useful in Europe, and allow harmonisation of the regulatory requirements between the different member states, thus facilitating further evaluation of the submission file and the registration process. The European guidelines are issued by the Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Pharmaceutical Products (EMEA). The key points of the current guidelines regarding applications for phase III trials in coronary heart disease (stable angina, acute coronary syndromes) and chronic heart failure are presented. They are as follows: the definition of selected populations, the choice of criteria for evaluating efficacy and safety, the choice of comparators, and study duration etc.","1590":"Although beta-blockers have been classically contraindicated in heart failure patients, their administration at progressively increasing doses provides long-term benefit in such patients with altered left ventricular function, and prevents the direct and indirect deleterious cardiac effects of catecholamines. By improving left ventricular function and preventing severe arrhythmias, beta-blockade improves survival, reduces the occurrence of sudden death and hospital admissions for worsening heart failure. The degree of benefit is dose dependent, although few prospective data confirm this fact. Among tested compounds, bisoprolol, metoprolol and carvedilol have produced similar improvements in survival with a 34% reduction in mortality in large-scale clinical trials. Bucindolol, however, did not significantly improve survival in the BEST trial. Different hypotheses may explain such results. In terms of therapeutic strategy, beta-blocker treatment must be initiated in stabilised patients already receiving diuretics and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Ongoing studies are evaluating the potential benefit of starting treatment first with beta-blockers in order to better prevent sudden death, particularly as this most often occurs in the early stages of the disease.","1591":"Because most of myocardial perfusion takes place during diastole, reducing the heart rate is likely to have anti-ischaemic effects. The present paper reviews the role of heart rate in relation to coronary artery disease outcome, as well as ways to reduce heart rate in the clinical setting. Nonpharmacological intervention, and particularly exercise training, has a definite effect on both heart rate reduction and the prevention of myocardial ischaemia. The protective role of beta-blockers after acute myocardial infarction is amply documented; their anti-ischaemic efficacy appears to be attributable to their effect on heart rate, but also to their role in cardiac inotropism. Recently, the If (funny) current inhibitor ivabradine, which has a potent heart rate reduction effect without any haemodynamic effect has demonstrated anti-ischaemic efficacy in a randomised trial versus placebo, as well as in trials where it showed an effect similar to that of the conventional anti-ischaemic agents amlodipine and atenolol. In addition, such an agent, which does not influence myocardial contractility, might be particularly valuable in the setting of myocardial stunning or acute left ventricular failure at the acute stage of myocardial infarction. However, only future studies will determine whether isolated heart rate reduction will have the same protective efficacy as that of beta-blocking agents in secondary prevention after myocardial infarction.","1592":"Every increase in heart rate represents a poor prognostic factor in cardiology, and multiple arguments have now led to the belief that reducing heart rate is a major therapeutic challenge. A comparison of the pharmacological effects of If current inhibitors such as zatebradine, and more recently ivabradine (Procoralan) and beta-blockers, have demonstrated experimentally that reductions in heart rate and myocardial contractile force contribute equally to the reduction in myocardial oxygen consumption in the normal heart. Conversely, at a similar level of reduction in heart rate, the lack of a concomitant negative inotropic effect with ivabradine affords longer diastolic perfusion times than beta-blockers. In other words, a negative inotropic effect is deleterious when an increase in coronary blood flow is required. Hence, if the anti-ischaemic effects afforded by an If current inhibitor and a beta-blocker are roughly comparable, the former are clearly of higher benefit than beta-blockers in the treatment of myocardial dysfunction accompanying cardiac ischaemia-reperfusion, especially myocardial stunning.","1593":"The screening of a series of benzocycloalkane derivatives led to the selection of Procoralan (ivabradine), the first selective inhibitor of the depolarizing If (funny) current of the sinus node, for the treament of myocardial ischaemia. In vitro, this compound reduces the spontaneous beating rate of isolated right rat atria and the firing rate of the action potential of rabbit sinus node preparations. This effect is explained by a reduction in the diastolic depolarisation slope of the action potential and underlies a selective inhibition of the pacemaker If current. In vivo, it induces a selective reduction in heart rate both at rest and during exercise. It preserves myocardial contractility, atrioventricular conduction and ventricular repolarisation duration. Ivabradine exerts a similar anti-ischaemic activity in exercise-induced myocardial ischaemia in pigs to that of a beta-blocker and, furthermore, it limits to a greater extent ischaemic myocardial contractile dysfunction.","1594":"The physiology of the sinus node is complex. Several currents are involved in spontaneous diastolic depolarisation, the genesis of automatism: the slow and transient calcium currents, the delayed potassium (K) current, and the If current or pacemaker current. In the cellular organisation of the sinus node, there are dominant and latent cells. An intrasinusal pacemaker shift of the dominant pacemaker may be observed under the effect of many extrinsic factors. Positive chronotropic stimuli induce a shift towards the cephalic part of the sinus node, while the negative chronotropic stimuli induce a shift towards the caudal part of the sinus node. All the channels involved are possible pharmacological targets. Sinus node activity may also be extrinsically modified by many pharmacological agents at the unicellular level or at the level of intercellular relationships, combining automatism and conduction.","1595":"The heart rate in sinus rhythm depends on If current-induced automaticity of sinus node cells. Such a current is activated by hyperpolarisation and is modulated by influences from sympathetic and para-sympathetic tones. There are established prognostic values for the baseline heart rate and its variability in coronary heart disease and heart failure. However, heart rate per se directly modulates myocardial oxygen consumption and cardiac contractility by interfering with the excitation-contraction coupling. The therapeutic implications of pharmacological modulation of the heart rate are important mainly for slowing the heart rate, as illustrated by the use of calcium antagonists in coronary heart disease and beta-blockers in both coronary heart disease and heart failure. The possibility of a direct action on sinusal automaticity by drugs such as ivabradine, an If channel blocker, reveals new therapeutic perspectives. Indeed, a benefit of combination therapy with these drugs and beta-blockers should be lower heart rate values than can be attained with maximally tolerated doses of beta-blockers.","1596":"","1597":"","1598":"","1599":"","1600":"The present study was undertaken to determine the effects of intake of inorganic nitrates in drinking water on thyroid gland activity and morphology in female rats. During 5 months of treatment, nitrates 50, 150 and 500 mg\/L induced a significant dose-dependent decrease in bodyweight gain, compared with the control rats. At the end of the experiment, nitrates 150 and 500 mg\/L induced hypertrophy of the thyroid gland, accompanied by an increase in the size of the thyroid follicles and hyposecretion of thyroid hormones T3 (triiodothyronine) and T4 (tetraiodothyronine). We concluded that a high nitrate intake in water influenced thyroid gland activity and morphology and might be considered to be a goitrogenic factor.","1601":"This article summarises the mechanisms responsible for the hyperlipidaemia observed after immunosuppressive treatment. Much progress has been achieved in the treatment of organ transplantation over the last 10 years, in particular because of the use of new immunosuppressive drugs with less nephrotoxicity. However, hypercholesterolaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia persist among many patients, who are thus more likely to develop cardiovascular diseases. We first reviewed the effects of immunosuppressive drugs on biliary acid biosynthesis, which is the main pathway of cholesterol degradation. The inhibition of this biosynthesis pathway, and especially of some key cytochrome P450s (CYP) such as CYP27A1, could contribute to the increased cholesterolaemia. Immunosuppressive drugs may also modify the activity of lipoprotein receptors or the expression of different apolipoproteins involved in cholesterol and triglyceride transport by lipoproteins. Finally, the fact that hypertriglyceridaemia is more frequently observed after certain immunosuppressive treatments may be partly caused by changes in the synthesis and elimination of triglycerides involving lipoprotein lipase or some apolipoproteins which serve as its cofactors (apoCII or apoCIII).","1602":"Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1 are major regulators of inflammation. TNFalpha inhibitors have been shown to be effective in treating some inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. TNFalpha inhibitors include soluble receptor antagonists (etanercept) and monoclonal antibodies (infliximab, adalimumab). IL-1 inhibitors (anakinra) were also developed, used in therapeutics and licensed in France. TNFalpha inhibitors can be added to background regimens of methotrexate in second-line treatments. Etanercept and adalimumab can be administered alone, especially to patients who have experienced methotrexate toxicity or who do not show clinical and\/or radiological improvement. The use of these new agents may optimise rheumatoid arthritis treatment and delay disease progression, particularly when first-line treatments are disappointing. This paper reviews recent data on biological therapies for rheumatoid arthritis: tolerance and their ability to modify the course of disease and prevent radiological damage.","1603":"From October 2001, the Australian healthcare system has made provision for, in predefined circumstances, a domiciliary medication review service.

The pharmacist is chosen by the outpatient. Doctor and pharmacist gather the relevant elements of his\/her medical file and work together, following procedures. After the consultation, the pharmacist passes his evaluation of the situation and his proposals to the doctor, who writes an action plan (shared with the pharmacist) and puts it into practice. This operational network is managed by the healthcare system. The 35000 consultations carried out confirm the interest in this service and make it possible to simplify the treatments. The cost of the operation is more than covered by the savings generated. This discussion proposes to specifically study the transposition of this service to France.","1604":"","1605":"The scientific goal of phase I clinical trials in oncology is to determine and optimise the drug dose and schedule on the basis of the toxicity profile.

The therapeutic relationship in this context must reconcile unreasonable hopes and anxiety regarding death and follow the same rules as in other doctor-patient relationships, with the triple requirement being that it should be genuine, therapeutic and empathetic.","1606":"","1607":"Since 1947 (the Nuremberg Code), the ethics of experimentation on human beings is based on the principle of the informed consent of the subjects participating in the research. In this context, research in paediatrics raised particular and difficult problems. International regulations have evolved in a way that has permitted paediatric research, within strict limits. However, recent studies have shown that the level of clinical paediatric research remains weak. There are economic reasons for this. But it also reveals the persistence of an ethical conflict: some people fear that a relativisation of the principle of consent (proxy consent) will lead to weakened protection for the most vulnerable subjects, including children. The ethics of responsibility requires a balance between the protection of the child as an individual (who should never become a medical guinea-pig) and the protection of children as a group (who should never be deprived of the benefits of the medical research).","1608":"The TRT-5 (Treatment and Therapeutic Research) group, created in 1992, is a coalition of eight advocacy and service-providing HIV\/AIDS nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) [originally five NGOs] working together on treatment and research issues in the field of HIV\/AIDS in France. After 11 years of work in the defending and advocating for the rights and the welfare of HIV+ individuals in the area of drug development and clinical research, we felt authorised to make comments and propose changes to the currently ongoing reform of the French Law (Loi Huriet) defining the legal framework of clinical research in France.

It represents a commitment for the ANRS partners from the North and the South. The most important principles of the Charter are as follows: an early integration of research in the national programmes of public health; a strong partnership between North and South at any step of the research; a clear definition of rules concerning evaluation and ethical follow-up of the research; enrolment of the subjects; healthcare; care for the patients; and management of the post-study.","1610":"The aim of this study was to analyse the way in which 19 committees for the protection of people participating in biomedical research (CCPPRBs) develop their opinions and to determine whether the legitimacy of the decisions taken is based on detailed discussion by the various members of the committee.

He investigated the functioning of the CCPPRBs both theoretically and in practice during the sessions, using a standardised data collection grid. The ethics of discussion are difficult to implement in these committees for four reasons: (i) a lack of training of the members; (ii) comments during sessions are rare (15% of all comments); (iii) too many dossiers are dealt with per session, resulting in some dossiers not being discussed in session; and (iv) there are too few nonscientific members, with the scientific members and the president playing a predominant role in the debates.

Such trials may be pre- or postmarketing studies. For the findings of a trial to result in a change in practice, they must be credible and fulfil the basic methodological criteria. It is nonetheless appropriate to complete that binary assessment by the use of an assessment checklist appropriate to each category of users, i.e. the Regulatory Agency, prescribing physicians and patients, who are sometimes informed directly by the media. The members of the round table proposed the 'Giens 2003 checklist'. It consists of an interpretative semi-quantitative assessment checklist based on simple messages relevant to practice. Critical assessment is a necessary prelude to the circulation of the results to the various parties involved (healthcare professionals, patients, patient associations, the media and the general public) and the process of informing those parties in readily understandable but accurate terms. The practical implementation of the results, with a change in behaviour and\/or the issuing of guidelines, are subsequent stages for which a certain lag time is inevitable. The assessment of implementation programmes, together with an accurate analysis of the obstacles to changing medical practice, should, in the future, improve and accelerate the implementation of important results in order to optimise patient management.","1618":"The topic of the round table being very broad, it was agreed with the participants that the discussion should be focused on autologous cell therapy (CT) used in tissue repair, immunomodulation or gene transduction. Autologous CT is actually comprised of both very innovative procedures as well as of products used in routine clinical practice. In France, the regulatory framework for CT has now been finalised, underlining the fact that a CT product (CTP) is intrinsically linked to the process used in its preparation. The objective of this round table was to define the essential prerequisites for the development of therapies involving ex vivo cell preparations and, more specifically, to address the issues associated with patient safety during the course of product development. The different stages of CTP development were considered: (i) requirements for CTP manufacturing in order to guarantee product quality; (ii) nonclinical development, and selection of appropriate animal models to provide the proof of the concept and support the definition of CTP specifications; and (iii) clinical development and methodological specificities of CTP development. The specific problems associated with the use of ancillary therapeutic products (ATPs) during the development of a CTP were discussed. Actions were proposed to ensure long-term supply of ATPs, which may be a significant bottleneck for the development of CT in France. Eventually, new regulatory provisions will come into force in the area of biovigilance, and it was deemed necessary for healthcare and industry professionals to be appropriately involved in the implementation phase.","1619":"The simulation of therapeutic models and clinical trial simulation have recently attracted attention as emerging techniques for developing new active molecules and the exploration of possible clinical trial results. Such approaches have benefited from fundamental progress in the development of 'in silico' models, as well as progress in nonlinear mixed-effect pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models. Mixing the two approaches allows simulation of 'virtual' patients, who receive virtual treatments or placebo. These have various uses, such as proof of concept, decision analysis or experimental design optimisation. Also, the effect of departures from protocol on clinical trial results can easily be evaluated by the use of simulation. This technique is now implemented by the pharmaceutical industry for optimising phase II and III experimental designs when a good biomarker or a clinical outcome model is available, but the use of an in silico therapeutic model as a proof of concept is only just beginning. In order to see such methodologies used more widely in drug development, multidisciplinary efforts need to be initiated, new modelling and simulation tools developed, and sound modelling and simulation practice documents need to be adopted. A reduction in the number of failed clinical development projects, the number of negative phase II and III clinical trials, or in just their cost and duration, are among the expected benefits of modelling and simulation in clinical drug development.","1620":"Small clinical trials are trials in which the number of patients does not enable the objective of the study to be appropriately met with the usual methodological rules.

The principal methodological problems are initially identified, and the classical methods (controlled, randomised, double-blind trial using parallel groups, crossover trial, factorial design, trial performed with several measures repeated over time, add-on design, randomised withdrawal design or early-escape design) and more uncommon methods (sequential approaches, meta-analyses, the 'N of 1' method and other methods that facilitate decision making or modelling) are then discussed.

Rofecoxib and celecoxib exhibit the same profile of adverse drug reactions as the other classical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Coxibs are currently prescribed and too often used outside the studied and approved indications, which clearly increases their cost (already high for society).

Compliance was significantly higher for anti-allergic eye drops without preservative than for those with a preservative (average number of instillations 3.5 vs 2.9\/day, p &lt; 0.001; number of instillations omitted 3.6 vs 4.2, p = 0.01). The proportion of patients experiencing at least one adverse drug reaction was 24% for eye drops with no preservative and 89% for eye drops with a preservative (p &lt; 0.001). The most frequently notified symptom was a sensation of prickling and burning (10% and 47%, respectively, for eye drops with no preservative and eye drops with a preservative; p &lt; 0.001). The prescription of eye drops with no preservative allows a significant decrease in ocular adverse drug reactions and a greater acceptance by the patient regarding his\/her anti-allergic treatment.

Thirty elderly institutionalised patients with malnutrition (group A, aged 88 +\/- 5 years) and 24 without (group B, aged 81 +\/- 9 years) were included. Malnutrition was defined as weight loss of &gt;10% over the previous 6 months and\/or a body mass index (BMI) &lt;21 kg\/m2 and albuminaemia &lt; or = 32 g\/L. CYP1A2 activity was evaluated by the plasma paraxanthine\/caffeine (PAX\/CAF) metabolic ratio.

The CYP1A2 metabolic ratio was not correlated to either BMI, serum albumin or renal clearance. CYPI A2 activity, as measured by the plasma PAX\/CAF ratio, was not influenced by nutritional status in elderly patients.","1628":"","1629":"","1630":"Premarketing trials contribute poorly to predicting drug-related iatrogenic effects in elderly patients. Since their main goal is the demonstration of drug efficacy, these trials are characterised by a simplistic design, they include a limited number of young participants (volunteers only), are of a short duration, and follow a strict protocol. Results of studies in young people cannot be extrapolated to elderly people. Although licensing authorities recommend the recruitment of a meaningful number of elderly people in clinical trials (with an age distribution comparable to that expected when the drug is in routine use), even in trials that are not devoted to geriatric illnesses, elderly people remain substantially under-represented in most instances for methodological reasons (to avoid increased variance introduced by a heterogenous population), safety reasons (at this stage of drug development, it could be deleterious to include patients with comorbid conditions and unfair with regard to the brand image of the products), and ethical reasons (the decision to participate could not be taken by the elderly people alone). Exclusion of elderly participants, who are particularly exposed to drug-related iatrogenic effects, influences the generalisability of study findings. The recruitment of elderly participants, a vulnerable population, is necessary to allow valid conclusions regarding elderly people, recommendations on the appropriate dosage adjustment for elderly individuals, the avoidance of prescribing decisions based on inadequate information (with respect to a more informative summary of the characteristics of the products), and the maximum benefit for elderly people from research.","1631":"The coexistence of several diseases, the loss of autonomy and certain social and behavioural factors lead to polymedication. It is important to reduce the number of drugs prescribed to prevent drug-drug interactions or interactions between drugs and a system weakened by age and comorbiditiy. Because of the limited number of therapeutic trials performed in individuals aged &gt;75 years, clinical consideration based on the consensus of experts is the primary way of establishing priorities and making rational choices.","1632":"Osteoporosis is an increase in bone fragility resulting from a decrease in bone mineral density and abnormalities in the bone micro-architecture. The frequency of osteoporosis is increasing with the aging of patients, and its clinical consequences, vertebral or peripheral fractures, are potentially extremely serious, especially in the very elderly. It is probable that osteoporosis is underdiagnosed--and when it is diagnosed it is often not well treated. It should be realised that a loss in bone mineral density is not the only risk factor for osteoporotic fractures: iatrogenic and environmental factors are also involved, and these are responsive to preventive intervention. Although elderly people usually take multiple drugs, drug treatment, initially calcium and vitamin D, but also bisphosphonates, should also be considered for osteoporosis.","1633":"Aging is a major factor in the over-consumption of drugs: although individuals aged &gt;65 years account for approximately 15% of the population, almost one-third of all prescriptions are made out for this age group. This over-consumption is responsible for a number of potential hazards, such as iatrogenic pathology, poor compliance and drug interactions; it is also an economic burden. Most studies report an average of five drugs prescribed per individual, regardless of outpatient or inpatient status. Cardiovascular and psychotropic drugs are the most widely prescribed classes. Analgesic and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are also very common. These are also the classes responsible for the highest number of adverse events in the elderly. There are numerous reasons for this over-consumption; in some cases, it is attributable to the patient himself (multiple diseases, deterioration of bodily functions, poor compliance, misuse, etc.), while in others, the prescribing physician, family or professional caregivers are at fault. The development of new drugs and the information made available regarding them can also be implicated. Studies comparing actual prescriptions with reference indications have shown that some are inappropriate: one meta-analysis showed that for 21.3% of patients in institutions and 40% of patients in convalescent homes, at least one prescription was inadequate; and in another analysis, the same applied to 12.5% of patients living at home. The potential seriousness of this over-consumption by elderly patients, even more so than in adults, calls for a detailed analysis of the situation and rational, regularly reviewed, realistic prescribing.","1634":"","1635":"","1636":"","1637":"","1638":"In contrast to other vascular beds, the endothelial cells in brain capillaries, which constitute the blood-brain barrier, are sealed together by continuous tight junctions and have little transcellular vesicular transport. In addition to these morphological properties, the presence of specific enzymes and proteins highly restricts the passage of molecules from the blood to the brain. To provide an in vitro system for studying brain capillary functions, we have developed a process of coculture that closely mimics the in vivo situation by culturing brain capillary endothelial cells on one side of a filter and glial cells on the other. In these culture conditions, endothelial cells retain all the endothelial cell markers and the characteristics of the blood-brain barrier, including gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and P-glycoprotein activities. Moreover, the close correlation between the results obtained in vitro with our model and in vivo allows us to conclude that our in vitro blood-brain barrier model is a relevant model for the screening of new molecules to the brain.","1639":"Accumulating evidence strongly suggests that apoptosis contributes to neuronal death in a variety of neurodegenerative contexts. Activation of the cysteine protease caspase 3 appears to be a key event in the execution of apoptosis in the central nervous system. As a result, mice null for caspase 3 display considerable neuronal expansion, usually resulting in death by the second week of life. Consistent with the proposal that apoptosis plays a central role in human neurodegenerative disease, caspase-3 activation has recently been observed in stroke, spinal cord trauma, head injury and Alzheimer's disease. Indeed, peptide-based caspase inhibitors prevent neuronal loss in animal models of head injury and stroke, suggesting that these compounds may be the forerunners of non-peptide small molecules that halt the apoptotic process implicated in these neurodegenerative disorders. The present review will summarise some of the recent data suggesting that apoptosis inhibitors may become a practical therapeutic approach for both acute and chronic neurodegenerative conditions.","1640":"Biomarkers are characteristics that are objectively measured and evaluated as indicators of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacological responses to a therapeutic intervention. Biomarkers of pharmacological responses allow pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling based on what is known of the mechanism of action of the drug. Characteristics predictive of the pharmacological response, such as a genotype, constitute a specific category of biomarkers and can be used as covariates in the model. In the case of \"classical\" immunosuppressive agents, the biomarkers of response most studied are lymphocyte calcineurin activity for ciclosporin and tacrolimus, and inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase activity for mycophenolate. Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis of monoclonal antibodies with immunosuppressive properties requires complex models and immunological biomarkers such as, for example, the number of circulating lymphocytes with a given surface antigen. Pharmacodynamic indirect response models are particularly relevant in this instance.","1641":"A short introduction to the principles of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) modelling and population approaches is provided in this article. The importance of implementing these techniques in the drug development process is illustrated by an example from experience at the Servier International Research Institute. This example demonstrates how the use of PK-PD modelling can rationalise the development process and save valuable time. Population approaches significantly contribute to the integration of PK-PD modelling into the different drug development phases by expanding the possibilities of application.","1642":"Pharmacokinetic studies can be performed before or after a drug is marketed. Indeed, extensive use of a new drug can uncover situations that it has not been possible to investigate before market application. Hospital departments of pharmacology are often involved in these complementary studies. They can design the study, initiate it in a clinical investigation centre, measure plasma concentrations, analyse the pharmacokinetic data, and write the report. If the extent of the scientific involvement of public pharmacology laboratories is strictly demarcated, financial support for nonsponsored studies by the pharmaceutical industry is problematical. Indeed, it is difficult to obtain funds to study the concentration-toxicity relationship or a drug-drug interaction for a compound for which the patent has expired. In addition, such studies have an excess cost, mainly because of the expense associated with drug measurements. Also, the medical time devoted to research is not rewarded by institutions. This situation will become more complicated because of the restrictive legislative framework imposed by the European directive.","1643":"The main clinical characteristics and aetiology of drug-induced tremor and acute movement disorders (myoclonus, chorea, athetosis, dyskinesia, dystonia, tics) are reviewed and discussed in this article. Tremor is the most frequent drug-induced acute movement disorder. Drug intake (and, initially, true or 'hidden' neuroleptic or psychoactive drugs) should be suspected as the cause of every abnormal movement. Drug-induced acute movement disorders usually disappear spontaneously after withdrawal of the suspected drug without any drug treatment. Drug-induced tremor and movement disorders are often poorly described in the Summary of Products Characteristics (SPC).","1644":null,"1645":"","1646":"In order to illustrate the significance of pharmacokinetic\/pharmacodynamic (PK\/PD) parameters of azithromycin (AZM) in tonsillar and respiratory tract infections, we developed original simulation software. As area under the curve over 24 hours divided by the minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC24\/MIC) and time over a 24-hour period that the drug concentration exceeds the MIC (t &gt; MIC) are important predictors of the clinical efficacy of macrolides, our software calculates these indices for plasma, tonsil, epithelial lining fluid (ELF), lung tissue (LT) and alveolar macrophages (AM). For an MIC of 0.5 microgram.mL-1, after administration of AZM 500 mg daily for 3 days (tonsillitis) or AZM 500 mg on day 1 and 250 mg daily for the next 4 days (respiratory tract infections) to a 70 kg subject, PK\/PD parameters are as follows: AUC24\/MIC (h): 9.5 (plasma); 439 (tonsil); 57.5 (ELF); 439 (LT); 1354 (AM); t &gt; MIC is 24 hours in all tissues. Our simulation model illustrates the following: (i) AUC24\/MIC values are above the 25-30-hour threshold in S. pneumoniae infection; and (ii) tissue concentrations exceed the MIC for 6 days after the last dose in ELF and for more than 2 weeks in tonsils, LT and AM.","1647":"On the basis of the interconnection of national networks of clinical research centres (CRCs) and clinical trials units (CTUs), the European Clinical Research Infrastructures Network (ECRIN) programme aims to develop an infrastructure allowing for bottom-up harmonisation of the support and training for, and practice of, clinical research, and to provide public sponsors for biotechnology small and medium-sized companies (SMEs) with support for translational research and multicentre clinical studies in Europe. This will be achieved through an application to the next FP6 'Integrated Infrastructure Initiatives' call. However, prior work is required to improve the reciprocal knowledge of partners in the ECRIN consortium and, as a first step, country-specific workshops will be organised by national networks in order to address the organisation of CRC\/CTUs and national networks, and their interaction with the national environment of clinical research; this will enable in-depth discussion addressing the bottlenecks hampering transnational studies.","1648":"","1649":"","1650":"","1651":"","1652":"The principal drugs implicated in or disclosing cardiac insufficiency are drawn from a review of the literature and observations by the French national pharmacovigilance database, from 1984 to April 2003. Several pharmacological classes are identified: in addition to antimitotic drugs, such as anthracyclines, many drugs are implicated in cardiac insufficiency, e.g. immunomodulators, anti-inflammatory drugs (including coxibs), antiarrhythmic drugs, anaesthetic drugs, antipsychotic drugs, and antidiabetic drugs (including glitazones). It is usual to classify these drugs according to three categories: (i) drugs likely to cause cardiac insufficiency de novo (such as cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, mitoxantrone, interferons, interleukin-2 etc.); (ii) drugs likely to worsen preexisting cardiac insufficiency (such as antiarrhythmics, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, nonsteroidal and steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, sympathomimetic drugs etc.); and (iii) drugs only occasionally causing cardiac insufficiency. This review shows that this classification is, in fact, artificial. If cardiac toxicity is a constant concern when using antimitotic drugs or some immunomodulator drugs, it is advisable to exercise caution in the use of many other drugs when treating patients with cardiac insufficiency, even if the clinical situation is well controlled. In particular, drug-drug interactions and patient medical history must be taken into account.","1653":"Anthracyclines are a class of highly potent antitumour agents utilised against haematological and solid tumours. However, their use has been limited by their cardiotoxic adverse effects, which may lead to congestive heart failure. Such cardiac toxicity is directly related to the cumulative (total) dose of anthracyclines received. At the cellular level, many of the molecular mechanisms of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity remain obscure. The present review summarises the current knowledge on the production of anthracycline-induced reactive oxygen species, metabolite generation or cell death, and focuses on the molecules used to prevent anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.","1654":"Persistent drug-induced movement disorders (tardive syndromes) remain an important clinical problem and consist of a variety of involuntary movements appearing in a patient exposed to a dopamine-blocking agent. The current state of knowledge on this topic is summarised in this article. Clinical aspects (tardive dyskinesia, tardive dystonia and other forms), prevalence, risk factors, prevention and management are discussed.","1655":"Parkinsonism is defined by the association of akinesia with one of the following symptoms: extrapyramidal rigidity, tremor at rest, or postural instability. A drug-induced aetiology must always be suspected when parkinsonian symptoms appear, or increase in a patient receiving drug treatment. Indeed drug-induced is the more frequent aetiology of secondary parkinsonism. The main treatments involved are antipsychotic and other neuroleptic drugs (accounting for up to two-thirds of drug-induced parkinsonism), and calcium-channel entry blockers. The risk associated with antipsychotics is often dose dependent and related to dopamine D2 striatal receptor occupancy induced by the antipsychotic drug. This risk is inferior for the second generation antipsychotics. The other treatments more rarely involved are antidepressants (tricyclic and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), lithium, valproic acid, and others. The main criterium for imputability is chronological, regression of symptoms being observed in 40-74% of cases, after a mean delay of 3 months from cessation of treatment. However, 15% of cases persist after drug withdrawal, leading to a diagnosis of underlying idiopathic Parkinson's disease.","1656":"The aim of this study was to present the clinical characteristics of and the evaluation methods for the motor complications sometimes observed in the early stages of Parkinson's disease, differentiating motor fluctuations and levodopa-induced dyskinesias. The most common forms of motor fluctuations are the predictable end-of-dose deterioration (wearing off), the early-morning akinesia, and the on-off phenomenon. Non-motor fluctuations are often associated with different symptoms: dysautonomia, pain, psychic or cognitive signs during off periods and sometimes also during on periods. Levodopa-induced dyskinesias are classified according to their temporal profile after drug administration, namely peak-dose dyskinesias (mainly choreic movements), biphasic dyskinesias--onset and end-of-dose--(mainly dystonic and ballic movements), and finally off-period dyskinesias (dystonic movements). Clinical evaluation of motor complications must be performed precisely to establish the best therapeutic strategy.","1657":"Probiotics may modulate intestinal flora and immunity and are therefore studied in an attempt to modulate experimental colitis or human inflammatory bowel disease. We analysed randomised controlled trials performed using probiotics in humans with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and pouchitis. Perspectives include the use of genetically modified micro-organisms to deliver anti-inflammatory agents to the gastrointestinal tract.","1658":"","1659":"Azathioprine is an immunosuppressive drug used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. It is a prodrug that is hydrolysed to 6-mercaptopurine, which represents the active form. Azathioprine is also used in the treatment of leukaemia in children and in organ transplantation. Azathioprine treatment is associated with adverse effects such as leukopenia and aplasia. These adverse effects are related to a single nucleotide polymorphism, including the inability of cells to synthesize thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT). TPMT is a detoxification enzyme that limits 6-thioguanine nucleotide production and thereby interferes with normal DNA and RNA synthesis. This review presents the different approaches used for azathioprine therapeutic monitoring in IBD treatment and discusses the discrepancies in recent clinical trials.","1660":"","1661":"","1662":"","1663":"The main families of psychotropic drugs have been almost fortuitously discovered, from investigations carried out directly in humans. The burst of studies triggered by these discoveries and the considerably strengthened ethical guidelines for clinical trials have allowed remarkable developments in preclinical studies performed in animals, and especially in rodents. The corresponding models may be classified as follows: homologous models mimicking the aetiology of the disease against which one attempts to develop drugs; isomorphic models mimicking specific symptoms of a disease but involving different aetiological mechanisms; predictive models, which assess the effect of a drug on behavioural or other functional signs\/symptoms unconnected to the psychiatric disease but involving the same type of biological targets as those affected by the disease; and theoretical or explanatory models that aim to elucidate the mechanism of action of agents producing psychotropic effects. Among the latter, the following can be cited: the knock out of genes coding for a specific biological target; the neutralisation of a specific ARNm by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, which also aims to prevent the synthesis of a specific biological target; use of controlled reproduction to achieve a concentration of genes, the association of which leads to the development of a disease. Each one of these approaches has been illustrated by an example developed within the Rouen Neuropsychopharmacology Unit: the psychobehavioural spectrum of mice with invalidation of the gene coding for adenosine A2A receptors; the abolition of either nociceptin ORL1 receptors or neurotensin NTR2 receptors in order to characterise their functions; the concentration, by controlled breeding in mice, of a phenotype corresponding to that of depression. These developments illustrate several recent developments in neuropsychopharmacology with the aim of emphasising the vitality of this discipline.","1664":"The pharmaceutical industry, with its well structured research, is now an area where the in vivo pharmacologist has a well recognised role. After a period of relative loss of interest related to the belief of the 'all in vitro', the impressive development of molecular biology, genomics, proteomics, and now metabonomics has surprisingly revived the absolute necessity for the pharmaceutical industry, within its R&amp;D (research and development) teams, to give the responsibility to in vivo pharmacologists for the following: validating new targets; phenotyping transgenic animals; determining the activity and potency of molecules, as well as exposing their potential unwanted pharmacological activities; contributing to the characterisation of pharmacokinetics and metabolism; participating in numerous other research and development activities such as the preparation of submission of files to authorities.","1665":"","1666":"During the past decade, a unifying hypothesis has been developed to explain the vascular changes that occur in septic shock on the basis of the effect of inflammatory mediators on the vascular endothelium. The vascular endothelium plays a central role in the control of microvascular flow, and it has been proposed that widespread vascular endothelial activation, dysfunction and eventually injury occur in septic shock, ultimately resulting in multiorgan failure. This has been characterised in various models of experimental septic shock. Now, direct and indirect evidence for endothelial cell alteration in humans during septic shock is emerging. The present review details recently published literature on this rapidly evolving topic.","1667":"Apart from their effects on lipid and glucose metabolism, the nuclear receptors PPARs (peroxysome proliferator-activated receptors) could also be involved in cellular protection. Indeed, an increasing body of literature provides arguments in favour of a protective role of PPAR alpha (fenofibrate, gemfibrozil) and PPAR gamma (ciglitazone, pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, troglitazone) agonists, particularly in myocardial or cerebral ischaemia as well as in neurodegenerative diseases. Such cellular protection could be the result of the modulation, at a molecular level, of inflammation pathways, oxidative stress and apoptosis. If these experimental results are confirmed by appropriate clinical trials, pharmacological modulation of the nuclear receptor PPARs, as well as the development of highly selective and more effective PPAR agonists, could become an important challenge in the field of cellular protection.","1668":"Since the launch of cholinomimetics on the Alzheimer market, large clinical trials have been performed with the aim of linking clinical scales to the pathology and pharmacology of the cholinergic neurotransmission system. However, given the additional mode of action of nicotinic receptor modulation in the case of galantamine, and of butyrylcholinesterase inhibition in the case of rivastigmine, it is of interest to study the link between this additional pharmacology and the specific clinical outcomes. This may be helpful in identifying new targets and optimising the clinical development of new compounds. One of the most appropriate and promising approaches is to use mathematical modelling to describe the complex pharmacology of these agents and their relationships with clinical outcomes. The virtual synapse is based upon the full integration of neuroanatomical and neuropharmacological datasets, to which complete pharmacological information on the drugs is added. Validation of this system is performed by predicting the outcome in a preclinical setting and subsequent testing of this hypothesis. Some examples of this model with regard to the prediction of clinical outcome are presented.","1669":"Renovascular hypertension is characterised by stenosis of the renal artery and high plasma renin levels due to the recruitment of renin-producing cells along the afferent arterioles. This increase in myoepithelioid cells is mainly a result of the differentiation of existing smooth muscle cells with acquisition of a secretory phenotype. To understand the molecular mechanisms involved in this recruitment, we used the model of renovascular hypertension known as the two-kidney, one-clip model in the Lewis rat. Renal arterioles were isolated using magnetised iron suspension. Differential proteomic analysis was performed using two-dimensional electrophoresis gel followed by mass spectrometry for identification. The most striking protein revealed by proteomics is troponin T, which is down-regulated in the afferent arterioles of the clipped kidney. Confocal microscopy showed that troponin T is specific to the smooth muscle phenotype and absent in the myoepithelioid phenotype.","1670":"Tricyclic antidepressants are all hydroxylated by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6, but the tertiary amines, amitriptyline, clomipramine and imipramine, are also N-demethylated to the active metabolites, nortriptyline, N-desmethylclomipramine and desipramine, by several CYPs, including the polymorphic CYP2C19, CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. The five selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine and sertraline are also oxidised by the CYP enzyme system. Thus, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and paroxetine are partially metabolised by CYP2D6, citalopram by CYP2C19 and sertraline by at least five different CYPs. Paroxetine and fluoxetine are very potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 while citalopram, fluvoxamine and sertraline are moderate inhibitors of this enzyme. Fluvoxamine is a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 and a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9. Since the termination of the human genome project, there is no longer a technical hindrance to the identification of all of the genes involved in the clinical response to antidepressants. Research in the future will involve modern technologies and new scientific disciplines, including DNA-micro-array technology and bioinformatics. The research ultimately aims at developing better and safer antidepressants and\/or better and safer use of currently available antidepressants.","1671":"","1672":"Since the publication of Directive 2001\/20\/EC in the Official Journal of the European Communities on May 1, 2001, the Member States have been preparing its transposition into national legislation for application no later than May 2004.

Thus, active extracts detected by screening methods are often subjected to more elaborate bioassays to determine their specific pharmacological activity. This paper aims to elucidate the biological, pharmacological and clinical approaches used in the screening of bioactive natural substances. In addition, a scientific process with the goal of finding substances with useful pharmacological activity in plant extracts is rigorously investigated.","1675":"Extracts from a new chemotype of Mentha longifolia, a mint species that grows spontaneously and widely in the Moroccan mountains, were tested against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). We observed that non-toxic concentrations (10 microg\/mL) of extracts from this plant, in particular methanol (Ext-1) and ethyl acetate (Ext-3) extracts, significantly inhibit (p &lt; 0.01) HIV-1BaL infection by about 40% and 55%, respectively. In addition, only Ext-3 shows significant (p &lt; 0.008) inhibitory activity (50% inhibition) against HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. It is noteworthy that chemical analysis of these extracts suggests that flavonoids, mainly flavones of M. longifolia, may be the major inhibitors of HIV infection. In conclusion, these in vitro data suggest that components of M. longifolia may represent potential anti-HIV agents; the identification of such components is in progress.","1676":"The aim of this study was to explore the frequency and type of adverse drug reactions between January and June 2001 in hospitalised patients. A prospective study was conducted in two pneumology departments of public hospitals in the Seine-Saint-Denis area. Adverse drug reactions were collected by hospital pharmacists after spontaneous notification by nurses and physicians, except for deliberate drug overdose. The drugs implicated, causality and the severity of each adverse drug reaction were analysed. The mean age of patients was 69 +\/- 15 years (63% male and 37% female). The total sample comprised 1598 patients. During the period of the study, 190 patients experienced at least one adverse drug reaction. This amounts to a prevalence of 12% (95% confidence interval [95% CI: 7.4-16.6%). The percentage of severe adverse effects was 28.4% (95% CI: 25.1-31.6%) and adverse reactions were rated avoidable in 35.8% of cases (95% CI: 32.3-39.3%). Antibiotics (23%), corticosteroids (15%), analgesics (13%) and anticoagulants (9%) were the drugs most frequently implicated in adverse effects. Preventable adverse drug events were more serious than non-preventable adverse events (p = 0.001). With regard to the level of severity, antibiotics, corticosteroids and bronchodilators were associated with a low severity level, whereas anticoagulants and antineoplastics were associated with a high severity level.","1677":"Antibiotics have long been used in the initial treatment of acute bronchitis (AB) and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB). However, their lack of value in AB has been clearly demonstrated and antibiotic therapy is justified in only a few cases of AECB. In parallel, although the value of mucoregulators in these diseases is still debated, their prescription remains important in general practice. In this context, our aim was to determine the prescribing behaviour of general practitioners (GPs) with regard to these drugs, as well as the beliefs of GPs concerning the place of mucoregulators in the treatment of AB in children and adult smokers, as well as in patients with non-obstructive AECB. A survey was carried out in 370 GPs, who were presented with three standardised and computerised medical cases: (i) rhinopharyngitis + AB in a child; (ii) AB in an adult smoker without a previous medical history; and (iii) a patient with non-obstructive AECB. The results showed that mucoregulators are frequently prescribed by GPs for children and adults with AB, or in AECB. This high prescribing rate is due to the belief of the GPs that these drugs are effective and well tolerated, which is confirmed by the literature. Their use avoids the frequent and unjustified prescription of antibiotics in situations where they are not recommended but where the patients request drug therapy.","1678":"Among the irrational factors involved in medical prescribing, few studies have investigated the problem of the 'pressure to prescribe'. The aim of the present work was to quantify this 'pressure to prescribe' and to investigate some potential predisposing factors. Each instance of a patient's behaviour suggesting 'pressure to prescribe' was registered for 599 outpatient general-practice clinics. 'Pressure to prescribe' was defined as each clear request by a patient that counteracted the diagnostic and\/or therapeutic strategy of physicians. The study included 246 men and 356 women (mean age: 45.4 years). 'Pressure to prescribe' was found in 142 patients, i.e. 23.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 20.7-27.4%). Among patients aged &gt;18 years, the percentage increased: 27.0% (CI 95%: 23.0-31.4%), i.e. 122 of 452 patients. 'Pressure to prescribe' was first observed with requests for drugs (17.3%), biological tests (2.5%), sick-leave from work (2.09%), radiological procedures (1.1%), medical certificates (1.0%), physiotherapy (0.8%), and referral to a medical specialist (0.3%). The drugs most often associated with 'pressure to prescribe' were analgesic (27.6%), nonsteroidal plus steroidal anti-inflammatory (17.1%), gastroenterological (16.2%), anti-infectious (14.3%) drugs followed by vitamins plus antiasthenic (11.4%), antiseptic (10.5%), nasal decongestant (9.5%), 'vasodilatory' plus 'veinotonic' (8.6%) drugs. Pressure to prescribe neuropsychiatric drugs involved only 7.5% of requests. Two predisposing factors were identified: age (with an increased 'pressure to prescribe' for older people) and, less importantly, female gender (women tended to exert more 'pressure to prescribe' than men). Analysis of 'pressure to prescribe' is an important topic in the area of Social Pharmacology.","1679":"The HIMAGE study, conducted in partnership with the principal Public Health Insurance Funds of the Loire region, analysed medicinal prescriptions during pregnancy on the basis of a representative sample of 911 pregnant women resident in this region of France. Altogether 93.5% received at least one prescription, with a mean of 10.9 different drugs per woman. The prescriptions were predominantly for drugs of the following Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classes: \"alimentary tract and metabolism\" (78%); \"genito-urinary system and sex hormones\" (62%); \"nervous system\" (62%); and \"blood and blood-forming organs\" (57%). Iron supplements, paracetamol, folic acid, magnesium, progesterone, oxaceprol, phloroglucinol, amoxicillin, domperidone and diosmine were the most frequently prescribed drugs. In total, 4.6% of the women were exposed to drugs involving a risk during pregnancy: principally nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) prescribed from the sixth month onwards. This study revealed a high frequency of prescription of drugs to pregnant women, largely motivated by non-rational and to some extent culture-specific considerations, and it also highlighted the prescription of drugs known to involve risk during pregnancy. These results provide a basis for advising clinicians on the rational and safe use of drugs during pregnancy.","1680":"The correct use of inhalation devices is an inclusion criterion in many comparative studies. However, patients can make errors, thus compromising the effectiveness of their own inhaler. The aim of the study is to evaluate inhaler use by patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [n = 984]. General practitioners assessed inhalation technique, using a specific checklist previously established for each inhaler model (Aerolizer, Autohaler, Diskus, a pressurised metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) or a Turbuhaler). A total of 24% of the patients using a pMDI did not make an error compared with 34-40% of those using breath-actuated devices. The frequency of critical errors varied according to the device: 11.5-14.9% of the subjects using an Aerolizer, Autohaler or Diskus versus 37.4% and 38.1% of the patients using a pMDI and a Turbuhaler, respectively. The proper use of the Turbuhaler is often overestimated (24.7%) compared with the pMDI (2.1%). The development of educational programmes for patients and prescribers is needed to improve the management of COPD.","1681":"","1682":"","1683":"","1684":"","1685":"","1686":"","1687":"Infliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody against human tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), and has received marketing authorization for the treatment of both rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Crohn's disease. The aim of the present survey was to assess retrospectively adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in patients treated with infliximab for RA in a rheumatology department of the Toulouse University Hospital (Rangueil Hospital). Among 32 patients included in 2000 and 2001, 43 \"expected\" ADRs occurred in 21 patients (65.6%) [mean age 51.4 +\/- 14.0 years]. In four patients (12.5%), ADRs were classified as \"serious\". In five other patients, they required the discontinuation of infliximab. We identified mainly infectious (n = 21), allergic (n = 3) and cardiovascular (n = 3) ADRs. Infectious ADRs were as follows: seven urinary infections, with a positive rechallenge (R+) in five; nine respiratory infections, with R+ in five; and five cutaneous infections. An acute rise in blood pressure occurred in three patients who had already been treated with antihypertensive drugs. The incidence of ADRs was as follows: respiratory 28.0%; urinary 22.0%; cutaneous 15.6%; allergic 9.4%; and cardiovascular 9.4%. In conclusion, our data allowed a quantitative and qualitative assessment of infliximab-induced ADRs. Further studies are required in order to improve knowledge regarding ADRs induced by long-term treatment with infliximab.","1688":"The number of elderly people aged &gt; 85 years will double by the year 2020. Helping the elderly to live independently at home is a major challenge for society. Physical exercise and protein energy intake might both be effective in preventing dependency. This paper describes the organisation of an ongoing study aimed at evaluating the preventive effect of such measures, involving 102 elderly persons randomised into two groups, one receiving preventive measures but not the other. The study organisation was based on representatives and selected workers from associations involved in home assistance for elderly. Their role consisted in recruiting persons for participation in the trial, encouraging them to perform exercises and take dietary supplements, and notifying the research team of all health-related events. This organisation has reached its objectives, even though the supervision of the domestic workers needs to be improved. This network, comprising stable workers (14 years of work experience on average in this study) offers the potential for future research in the community to evaluate preventive measures.","1689":"The aim of this work was to test the hypothesis that doctors consume products to help them in their professional practice. A telephone survey was conducted over a 12-month period among 402 general practitioners in France (using a 'quota method'). The 202 respondents consisted of 49 women and 153 men, with a mean age of 45.6 +\/- 5.6 years. Nineteen percent of these respondents said that they had taken products to help with stress (11% had used benzodiazepines), 24% had used products to help with fatigue, 33% had used tobacco, and 20% said that they had experimented with cannabis. Finally, 44% of the respondents said that they had used products to 'hold out' during their studies--especially those presently taking products to assist with stress. Two questions must therefore be raised: (i) what is the impact of this addiction on the types of products prescribed by these doctors? and (ii) what steps are taken to prevent doctors from using such products and becoming addicted in the first place?","1690":"Sesbania grandiflora, commonly known as 'sesbania', is widely used in Indian folk medicine for the treatment of liver disorders. Oral administration of an ethanolic extract of S. grandiflora leaves (200 mg\/kg\/day) for 15 days produced significant hepatoprotection against erythromycin estolate (800 mg\/kg\/day)-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. The increased level of serum enzymes (aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase), bilirubin, cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids, free fatty acids, plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and hydroperoxides observed in rats treated with erythromycin estolate were significantly decreased in rats treated concomitantly with sesbania extract and erythromycin estolate. The sesbania extract also restored the depressed levels of antioxidants to near normal. The results of the study reveal that sesbania could afford a significant protective effect against erythromycin estolate-induced hepatotoxicity. The effect of sesbania was compared with that of silymarin, a reference hepatoprotective drug.","1691":null,"1692":null,"1693":"Osteoporosis is a general disorder of the skeleton characterised by a decrease in bone mass, with damage to the microarchitecture leading to an increase in bone fragility and fracture risk. The incidence of this illness will increase in the future because of the aging of the population and increasing risk factors. Many guidelines have been proposed by qualified authorities--those of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) being the latest published. The aim of treatment of the osteoporosis is to increase, maintain or improve bone mass as well as its strength, with a view to decreasing the incidence of bone fractures. With regard to preclinical studies, in vitro studies--such as those using osteoblast or osteoclast cultures--allow a better understanding of the mechanism of action of drug treatment. The evaluation of bone quality should be performed in two species, such as the ovariectomised female rat model and larger animals (ewe, sow, primate etc.). Phase I studies are designed to enable determinations of pharmacokinetic profiles and bone diffusion and to offer indications of the putative clinical relevance of the dosages. For phase II studies (double-blind controlled studies versus placebo, ideally with a duration of 24 or sometimes 12 months), tests of three dosages are recommended, and the bone mass is considered as a relevant substitution criterion. The aim of secondary osteoporosis prevention studies (randomised double-blind and comparative controlled design versus placebo) is to avoid the occurrence of new bone fractures, and the main evaluation criterion is the number of patients with new fractures. The study length should not be less than 3 years. For evaluation of primary osteoporosis prevention, efficacy in the prevention of bone fracture is the prerequisite--before the use of bone mass as the main evaluation criterion. This criterion can be evaluated by alterations in bone mineral density at the rachis level. Reference drugs such as estrogens can be an alternative to placebo comparison. The tolerability of drugs for the treatment of osteoporosis requires evaluation in long-term studies and the collection of postmarketing data. The International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) could lead to uniform guidelines for the US, Europe and Japan.","1694":"The prevention and treatment of osteoporosis are now a necessary goal because of the aging of the population and the social and economic costs of fracture complications. The publication of guidelines by registration agencies during the last 10 years has provided precise rules for evaluating new drugs designed for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. The benefit of combination treatment with calcium and vitamin D in osteoporotic patients has clearly been proven, especially among the oldest patients, but results of prospective studies designed for the prevention of fracture risk are conflicting. In the Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT), treatment with alendronate 10 mg\/day reduces the risk of vertebral fracture by 48% and increases bone mineral density (BMD) in patients with vertebral fractures. In the Vertebral Efficacy with Risedronate Therapy Multi-National (VERT-MN) and VERT-NA (North America) studies, treatment with risedronate 5 mg\/day reduces the risk of vertebral fracture by 49% and 41%, respectively. Risedronate 5 mg daly for 3 years leads to an increase in BMD. The Prevent Recurrence Of Osteoporotic Fractures (PROOF) study has shown a significant decrease in the risk of vertebral fracture in patients treated with calcitonin 200 IU. However, numerous criticisms of the methodology of this study design have been identified. Selective estrogen receptor modulators could act as agonists or antagonists of estrogens, depending on the target tissue. In the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation (MORE) study, treatment with raloxifene reduces the risk of vertebral fracture by 50% in patients without prevalent vertebral fracture and by 30% in patients with prevalent vertebral fracture. PTH treatment leads to an increase in BMD and reduces the risk of vertebral fracture by 65%. Strontium ranelate has a novel mechanism of action (stimulation of bone synthesis and decrease in bone resorption), and administration of 2 g daily has a proven positive effect, leading to an increase in bone mass among women with osteoporosis. This effect was especially evident in the Spinal Osteoporosis Therapeutic Intervention phase III (SOTI) study, in which a significant decrease in the incidence of vertebral fracture of 41% over 3 years has been shown. Thus, effective therapeutic strategies now enable improved treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. However, this condition is still poorly diagnosed and not all patients are correctly treated. Preventing the occurrence of the first fracture should remain the prime concern.","1695":"After initial calcification in matrix vesicles or collagen fibrils, bones are continually modified by modelling then remodelling. In bone tissue, the degree of mineralisation of bone structural units is heterogeneous, reflects the rate of bone remodelling, and can be measured using microradiography. Our model is based on the fact that bone remodelling activity and thus the duration of the secondary mineralisation of bone tissue would influence its mineral status (mainly its degree of mineralisation or bone density at tissue level). When the bone remodelling rate increases (menopause, parathyroid hormone), the degree of mineralisation of bone tissue decreases. Conversely, after a diminution of the remodelling rate induced by antiresorptive treatments, the degree of mineralisation of bone tissue increases. Strontium ranelate (PROTELOS) has been tested to date as a potential therapeutic agent in patients suffering from postmenopausal osteoporosis. Recent phase III studies (the Spinal Osteoporosis Therapeutic Intervention [SOTI] study and the TReatment Of Peripheral Osteoporosis Study [TROPOS]) show a decrease in the vertebral and extravertebral fracture risk and an increase in bone mineral density measured at lumbar spine and femoral levels. Strontium ranelate has a unique mechanism of action, since it decreases bone resorption and increases bone formation ('decoupling' agent). Our preliminary observations in animal and man reveal that, because of this dual mechanism of action, the degree of mineralisation of bone tissue and the crystal characteristics of bone mineral are maintained at normal levels. More generally, these data indicate that the mineral status of bone tissue should be systematically taken into account during histomorphometric studies of bone.","1696":"Bone strength is determined by bone geometry, cortical thickness and porosity, trabecular bone morphology and the intrinsic properties of bony tissue. The major complication of osteoporosis, i.e. fracture, is due to a lower bone strength. Thus, any treatment of osteoporosis implies an improvement in bone strength. Bone strength is indirectly estimated by bone mineral density (BMD) using Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA). Since, DXA-measured BMD accounts for part of the variance in bone strength, some important factors are not captured by DXA, in terms of the effects of anti-osteoporotic treatment and the progression of osteoporosis. Geometry and trabecular microarchitecture have also to be taken into account. Thus, the assessment of the intrinsic mechanical quality of bony tissue should provide a better understanding of the role of tissue quality in determining bone strength. The careful investigation of all the determinants of bone strength (bone tissue included) should be considered in the pathophysiology of osteoporosis and in the mechanisms of action of anti-osteoporotic drugs.","1697":"The calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) belongs to family 3 of G-protein coupled receptors. The CaSR, expressed at the surface of the parathyroid cells, controls parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion and is the main regulator of calcium homeostasis. Its activity is regulated by small changes in the physiological concentrations of calcium and magnesium ions present in the serum and extracellular fluids, leading to the stimulation of the phospholipases C and A2. Molecules that potentiate the effect of extracellular calcium are called calcimimetics. They reduce the PTH level in vivo and have been proposed to be of therapeutic benefit for the treatment of both primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism. The blocking of CaSR by a calcilytic molecule results in the increase in serum PTH and might be of interest in the treatment of osteoporosis. The CaSR is also expressed in the thyroid, kidney, bone and in neuronal and glial cell populations, where it should be involved in the complex responses associated with calcium and magnesium ions present in the extracellular fluids.","1698":"The physiological maintenance of bone mass is ensured by bone tissue renewal, allowing old bone tissue to be replaced by an equivalent mass of bone matrix. After mechanical or hormonal stress activation, a phase of resorption by osteoclasts occurs, followed by a phase of bone formation by osteoblasts. Among the multiple factors involved in osteoblastic differentiation are the following: Cbfa1 (transcription factor); low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-5 (LRP-5), a membrane lipoprotein receptor and protein Wnt co-receptor, which plays an important role during development. It is possible that osteoblastic proliferation and differentiation are regulated by distinct pathways. Osteoclastic differentiation is also regulated by numerous factors: osteoprotegerin (OPG); RANK-L (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand, a transmembrane protein related to tumour necrosis factor [TNF], the binding of which to its RANK receptor induces osteoclastic differentiation); and soluble TNF receptors. Local regulation of the OPG\/RANK-L ratio could explain postmenopausal loss of bone mass. OPG could play a major role in myeloma and Paget disease. Osteolysis together with bone metastasis could also be related to the local production of RANK-L. OPG decreases osteolysis and offers an interesting therapeutic perspective for the treatment of osteoporosis and other diseases associated with bone hyper-resorption.","1699":"","1700":"","1701":"","1702":"","1703":"","1704":"Acamprosate, a stimulant of central inhibitory GABA neurotransmision and an antagonist of excitatory amino acids, is used in alcohol withdrawal and for the maintenance of abstinence. After identification of several cases of treatment discontinuation during alcohol abstinence because of acamprosate-induced adverse drug reactions (ADRs), a retrospective study was conducted in order to investigate and quantify acamprosate-induced ADRs. Up to July 2002, 472 patients were included for treatment of alcohol withdrawal: of these, 68% (n = 322) received acamprosate. At least one ADR occurred in 98 patients (30%). The mean age of the patients was 41.5 +\/- 8.8 years (range: 24-65) and 70% were male. All ADRs were classified as 'non serious'. However, ADRs required a dose decrease in 61 cases or acamprosate discontinuation in 76 cases (62.2% and 77.5%, respectively, of patients with an ADR). We identified mainly gastrointestinal ADRs in 67 patients (mean delay before occurrence: 7.6 days), i.e. 20.8% of patients treated with acamprosate (corresponding to 68.3% of ADRs), with a positive rechallenge in five cases. Moreover, cutaneous ADRs (pruritus) occurred in 29 patients (mean delay before occurrence: 9.0 days), and required acamprosate withdrawal in 22 patients (75.9%) with a prior dose decrease in 18 of these patients (62.1%). Our results show that a dose decrease or withdrawal of acamprosate was necessary in 18.9% and 23.6%, respectively, of patients because of the occurrence of ADRs. The present study shows the important role of acamprosate-induced ADRs among the various causes for failure of alcohol abstinence.","1705":"A retrospective study (1995-2000) of reports of cases of metoclopramide poisoning collected at the Lille poison control centre (184 phone calls) shows the frequent occurrence of acute dystonia in children (81 cases). These spectacular extrapyramidal symptoms consist of abnormal movements (31 cases), local hypertonia (30 cases), acute dyskinesia (17 cases), general hypertonia (16 cases) and oculogyric crisis (13 cases). There is no dose-effect correlation and sex has no influence on the occurrence of neurological symptoms. Medical management is simple surveillance or symptomatic therapy (a sedative drug and\/or anti-parkinsonian therapy and\/or a gastrointestinal adsorbent). Hospitalisation was needed in only 9.1% of cases. Providing better information to physicians about metoclopramide adverse effects and their medical management should allow a reduction in the number of unnecessary hospitalizations.","1706":"Remedies for coughs and colds often contain both an indirect sympathomimetic agent plus another drug (anti-inflammatory, analgesic or antibiotic, etc.). In France, oral sympathomimetics are available over the counter, and preparations for topical use (nasal sprays or drops) require a medical prescription. Using the French Pharmacovigilance database, we performed a retrospective study to identify cardiovascular and neurological adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with the use of nasal decongestants containing a sympathomimetic agent. Of a total of 165 ADRs. 15 were strokes or cerebral haemorrhages. We also found the following: 67 cases of arterial hypertension, 33 of convulsions, 28 of headaches and 24 of vasomotor symptoms involving the extremities. In most of these cases, misuse or a predisposing factor was found (such as a history of arterial hypertension or headache, the combination of two decongestants, long-term use, etc.). The incidence of cardiovascular or neurological ADRs with cold remedies seems 'very rare' but some of these reactions, mainly stroke, are 'serious'. However, there is no available clinical evidence showing the benefit of such agents after repeated use over several days. Since most of the nasal decongestants are freely available without prescription, drug information is needed to advise prescribers and also patients about risk of 'serious' ADRs with these drugs.","1707":"Excluding all other costs or benefits of participation in clinical trials, the objective of this study was to evaluate and analyse the cost avoidance represented by the free supply of the investigational drug in place of paying for a marketed drug. The cost avoided was defined as money that would most likely have been spent, but not because of inclusion of the patient in the clinical study. Only studies for which a marketed alternative drug was available with a standard dosage have been analysed. The numbers of delivered doses or the treatment durations were tabulated from pharmacy dispensing records for each study, and were used to calculate the medication cost avoided. No marketed alternative drug was available for 10 of 56 clinical studies. In total, in 2000, the cost avoidance was estimated between [symbol: see text] 585,492 and [symbol: see text] 603,674, with a wide variability between studies or between patients (CV: 120-520%). The two disease categories associated with the largest cost avoidance were multiple sclerosis and growth hormone deficiency. The cost avoidance was essentially of benefit to the medical insurance or the patient (98%) and was lower than [symbol: see text] 10,000 for the hospital, because 91% of patients are not hospitalised. So, why are clinical studies involving ambulatory patients performed in hospital? Of the 56 studies analysed, 46 could be shown to be non-innovative, because a marketed alternative drug was available. Few studies appeared to permit free access to treatment with non-reimbursable marketed drugs.","1708":"A randomised double-blind comparison of three treatment strategies in 533 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension over 6-9 months. The low-dose perindopril\/indapamide (PER\/IND) combination (2 mg and 0.625 mg, respectively) daily resulted in a significantly better blood pressure control and systolic blood pressure decrease. In addition, the low-dose PER\/IND combination showed superior efficacy\/safety criteria than the sequential strategy of atenolol (50 mg) then losartan (50 mg) then amlodipine (5 mg), and the step-by-step strategy of valsartan (40 mg then 80 mg then 80 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg).","1709":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are, at present, the cornerstone of therapy for congestive heart failure. Nevertheless, international literature and regional data have reported their underutilisation in the practice of cardiology. Despite the abundance of consensus conferences, none deal specifically with a therapeutic strategy using ACE inhibitors. In this context, clinical practice guidelines on the management of systolic heart failure with ACE inhibitors have been drafted in Lorraine by hospital cardiologists. The guidelines were formulated using a standardised procedure, combining a literature analysis and the opinions of experts. Seventeen guidelines were finally adopted, under four headings: indications and contraindications for ACE inhibitors; dosages and approaches to treatment monitoring; the management of adverse effects; and contraindications for concomitant therapy. The drafting of the clinical practice guidelines is the first step in a quality improvement programme, initiated in 1999 in the cardiology wards of the region.","1710":"Dihydropyridines are among the most widely used drugs for the management of cardiovascular disease. Introduced in the 1960s, dihydropyridines have undergone several changes to optimise their efficacy and safety. Four generations of dihydropyridines are now available. The first-generation (nicardipine) agents have proven efficacy against hypertension. However, because of their short duration and rapid onset of vasodilator action, these drugs were more likely to be associated with adverse effects. The pharmaceutical industry responded to this problem by designing slow-release preparations of the short-acting drugs. These new preparations (second generation) allowed better control of the therapeutic effect and a reduction in some adverse effects. Pharmacodynamic innovation with regard to the dihydropyridines began with the third-generation agents (amlodipine, nitrendipine). These drugs exhibit more stable pharmacokinetics, are less cardioselective and, consequently, well tolerated in patients with heart failure. Highly lipophilic dihydropyridines are now available (lercanidipine, lacidipine). These fourth-generation agents provide a real degree of therapeutic comfort in terms of stable activity, a reduction in adverse effects and a broad therapeutic spectrum, especially in myocardial ischaemia and potentially in congestive heart failure.","1711":"Venous thromboembolism occurs frequently in both medical and surgical units. Although we possess the therapeutic means to prevent this condition, the question is how to assess the benefit induced by a treatment in relation to the haemorrhagic risk? The primary evaluation criteria and the evaluation method must be correctly chosen. While phlebography is the reference method for diagnosing deep venous thrombosis, the limitations associated with this method have led to the promotion of other diagnostic techniques, and clinical criteria or composite criteria are increasingly used. These different approaches--with their respective advantages and limitations--will be developed.","1712":"The management of intractable migraine is not yet standardised. The first point in the emergency department is to eliminate severe cephalalgic non-migrainous disease, then to confirm the diagnosis of migraine. The second point is to determine trigger factors responsible for the refractory migraine--principally inadequate therapy, such as too low a dosage, inadequate treatment compared with intensity, and delayed treatment. Examples of inadequate classical treatments are presented for the following four main oral therapies: a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), analgesics, ergot derivatives, and triptans. When these drugs are ineffective, the following are used via injections: propacetamol, aspirin (lysine acetylsalicylate), injectable NSAIDs, and nefopam. These products differ from country-to-country. For example, morphinomimetics, phenothiazines and corticosteroids are widely prescribed in the US, while metamizole (dipyrone) is preferred in developing countries. The authors describe the different models of administration and the adverse effects of the substances. Finally, they describe the treatment of status migrainosus. Globally, triptans are underused in emergency departments. This review confirms the need for controlled trials of treatments for migraine in emergency departments in order to develop an international therapeutic consensus.","1713":"The use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) via spacers in childhood asthma is increasing. However, concern has been raised about its long-term impact. Hypercalciuria is a known adverse effect of treatment with systemic corticosteroids. The urinary calcium to creatinine ratio (UCa:Cr) is a simple, reliable and non-invasive tool for evaluation of hypercalciuria. To determine whether ICS can induce hypercalciuria in children with asthma. Outpatient clinic in a referral hospital. The UCa:Cr was determined in 25 children aged 3-6 years with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma before and after a 2-month course of inhaled budesonide 400 micrograms\/day via an aerochamber. Children who had received oral corticosteroids, diuretics, antibiotics or theophylline were excluded. Paired Student's t-test and Fisher's exact test. The mean UCa:Cr was similar in the children with asthma before and after 2 months' administration of budesonide (0.10 +\/- 0.10 and 0.11 +\/- 0.08, respectively; p = 0.601). The numbers of hypercalciuric children were two and five, respectively (p = 0.417). In 68% of patients, the UCa:Cr increased and in 16% the increase indicated hypercalciuria (UCa:Cr &gt; 0.2). Although the treatment of childhood asthma with budesonide 400 micrograms\/day via an aerochamber does not appear to be associated with hypercalciuria, the existence of a subgroup of patients in whom ICS may induce hypercalciuria is plausible. This needs to be further evaluated in a larger study. ","1714":"The analysis of the literature demonstrated that pharmacy counselling influenced patient outcome after transplantation. This was the reason we established pharmacy consultation in 1999. The aim of this study was to determine patient knowledge before and after pharmacy counselling. Twenty-nine patients were questioned about the identification, role and dosage of prescribed drugs. The mean duration of pharmacy counselling was 54 minutes. Before pharmacy consultation, the knowledge score was 53.7%. Afterwards, the mean score value reached 75% and seven patients had a score of 100%. The anti-rejection therapy was understood by 93% of patients. However, the associated drugs were poorly known: less than 15% of patients initially knew about the purpose of the antimicrobial agent, compared with 50-60% after counselling. During counselling, two women were identified as regularly using St John's Wort and were informed that this herbal medicine can endanger the success of organ transplantation. Five patients or family members called the pharmacist to obtain additional information. Among these, two medication errors, both with corticosteroid drugs, were reported by family members of patients of foreign origin who had difficulty in understanding and speaking French. Pharmacy counselling improved patient knowledge about therapy after transplantation.","1715":"This paper focuses on the methodology and behavioural results of the tryptophan depletion challenge. A Medline search (1985-2002) using the keywords 'tryptophan depletion' and 'mood' has been performed. Rapid depletion is obtained by morning intake under fasting condition of a tryptophan-free amino-acid mixture. Subjects with a family history of mood disorders and depressed patients receiving serotoninergic drugs demonstrate a mood-lowering effect. However, these effects are limited or absent in normal volunteers and naive depressed patients. The tryptophan depletion challenge has largely contributed to the understanding of the physiopathology of depression. However, the mood response to acute tryptophan depletion challenge in healthy volunteers is not as sensitive as a 'depression model'. ","1716":"Questions have been raised regarding the attractiveness of France versus other countries for performing clinical trials. A questionnaire was sent to pharmaceutical companies with offices in France to assess their level of activity and to get information on the pros and cons of performing phase I-IV international clinical trials in France. Eleven companies, of large to medium size and representing 44% of the shared market returned answers. In 2001, they spent 131 million euros on clinical trials--53% for phase I-III, with a staff of 1469 (not including Contact Research Organisations)--and involved 21,000 investigators recruiting 98,000 patients on local budgets, and 2257 investigators recruiting 10,270 patients on international budgets. France ranked well as regards size of market or resource availability, with an intermediate rank as regards costs, access to patients and disease prevalence, and was weak with regard to speed of recruitment and quality of investigators. Ways of improving France's attractiveness will be discussed.","1717":"The topics discussed in this article are concerned with studying genomic polymorphism and identifying new therapeutic targets, the role of genetics in preclinical and clinical drug development, and cultural, regulatory and logistical aspects of the development of pharmacogenetics in France. The conclusions are that from a physiological, biochemical or genomic point of view, the study of human genetic polymorphism has obvious potential value for drug development, because it can help to identify new therapeutic targets, and to predict drug efficacy and tolerability more effectively. There are already several examples of the latter approach, which relies on studying the genetic variability of enzymes involved in drug metabolism, and that of the effector molecules of the pharmacological activity. Pharmacogenetics could eventually make it possible to personalize drug treatments, as methods for analysing genes are simplified and their cost reduced. To help attain this still far-off goal, certain recommendations have been proposed.","1718":"The use of subjective outcome measures for assessing drug efficacy varies according to the disease in question. Subjective outcome measures used to complement an objective outcome measure can clearly claim the status of a main outcome measure. The validation of an instrument follows an appropriate methodology that focuses on two points: the methods used for its construction are set out and its performance is evaluated in a study. In drug evaluation, the importance of the subjective outcome measure should be discussed, depending on the aim and the disease. The methodology of the study obeys the same rules as when an objective outcome measure is used. The issue of the clinical significance of the results should be broached and discussed. Subjective outcome measures deserve to be considered in the evaluation of the drug because they provide a different and complementary perspective on the disease and the patient, both at the time of obtaining the marketing authorization or when reassessing a drug.","1719":"Although drugs are prescribed during pregnancy with some reluctance, they fulfill a real need in some circumstances. Adequate drug evaluation is thus essential, either based on efficacy and safety or mainly safety, using available data from non-pregnant women. Evaluation methodology is not fundamentally different during pregnancy. Recommendations for drug development are formulated on the basis of the most common situations as well as specific suggestions, thus raising the awareness of the different partners participating in healthcare (institutions, the pharmaceutical industry and prescribers). In particular, regulatory and economic incentives superimposed upon those recommendations adopted in Europe and the US for orphan diseases should be put into place to assist in the evaluation of drugs used in obstetrics. Medical needs in obstetrics should be better identified, and labelling of drugs for use during pregnancy should be better directed towards prescribers; a national registry of pregnancies should be established in France.","1720":"Childhood and adolescent cancers are rare diseases. Despite the progress in treatment (more than two-thirds of all cases are cured), cancer remains the leading cause of death by disease in children older than 1 year. Access to new drugs that are more efficacious or better tolerated is therefore an important public health priority. The objective of our round table was thus to take inventory of the situation and to propose recommendations aimed at facilitating coordinated, rational and more rapid access to new treatments. The active participation of paediatric oncologists, parents, pharmaceutical companies and regulatory authorities proved not only necessary but very constructive. Pharmaceutical companies have developed very few new anticancer agents for children during the past 10 years. The round table identified current trends that appear propitious: the mobilisation of parents and patients' associations; European initiatives to encourage companies to assess drugs in children; regulatory initiatives to guide drug development; and the existence of structured clinical research networks in paediatric oncology, including for the development of early treatment. The round table recommends the following measures to improve access to new treatments for children and adolescents with cancer: 1. Conduct preclinical paediatric evaluation of all anticancer agents that begin the development process for adults (research and validation of treatment targets; pharmacological evaluation in relevant experimental models) to help choose the agents to study in children. 2. Initiate paediatric clinical development before the first application for authorization for adults is filed, when sufficient safety and tolerability data are available, that is, after the phase I trials in adults and optimally during the phase II trials. 3. Optimise paediatric clinical evaluation by defining development plans early and by reducing the duration of studies (enlargement of the early treatment research network to ensure adequate recruitment; new evaluation methods; better extrapolation of pharmacological data from adults to children for dose-finding). 4. Improve information to and participation of parents and patients in clinical research for new treatments. The prerequisite for the success of this project became rapidly clear to all the round-table participants: cooperation and partnership between specialists and other scientists from academia, parent associations, pharmaceutical companies and regulatory authorities. Only with such cooperation can progress in treatment occur and new hopes for recovery be fulfilled.","1721":"Effective prevention of drug-induced risks depends on an accurate understanding of their triggering or predisposing factors, and the quality of information on these available to prescribing practitioners and users. All preclinical and clinical data available on the proprietary medicinal product concerned should facilitate identification of a risk, and these data should be compared with existing data on drugs sharing the same mode of action or therapeutic strategy. This information should be based on a communication plan adapted to the context of the disease under treatment, the therapeutic alternatives available and the benefits expected.","1722":"Round table no. 2 was devoted to the postmarketing evaluation of drugs. The debates involved both the questions posed by postmarketing evaluation and the methods for responding to them. The major categories of questions likely to be posed are as follows: efficacy in actual situations; safety in actual situations; prognostic factors and patients responding; place in the therapeutic strategy; impact on the healthcare care system; the 'joined' population (those who actually obtain benefit); and drug utilisation review. In addition, the methodological approaches have been divided into three categories: the experimental approach, the observational approach and the modelling approach. Each of these methodological approaches has been qualified with respect to each of the questions. The objective was neither to establish a classification of the methods according to the level of proof, nor to propose methodological formulae. Instead, the participants applied themselves to describe the strengths and the limits of the different methods for each of the questions in turn. The debates then focused on the process of identification of pertinent questions and appropriate methods. In this context, the round-table participants applied an analysis of the current system of postmarketing study projects and formulated some propositions for their improvement. Finally, the place of existing databases in the postmarketing evaluation was discussed and the participants emphasised the importance of initiating a very detailed assessment of the information that could be provided by such databases before instituting ad hoc studies.","1723":"Be it to restore the confused image of clinical research in relation to the lay public, or to develop new ways of accruing healthy volunteers or patients for clinical trials, there is a need to draft some guidance on how best to provide information on research. Although the French legal and regulatory armamentarium in this area is essentially liberal, there is currently little-justified reluctance among study sponsors to advertise publicly. A group of academic and pharmaceutical industry researchers, assembled for a workshop, together with regulators, journalists, representatives from ethics committees, social security, patient and health consumer groups and other French institutional bodies, has suggested the following series of recommendations: there is no need for additional legal or regulatory constraints; sponsors should be aware of and make use of direct public information on trials; a 'good practice charter' on public communication about clinical trials should be developed; all professionals should be involved in this communication platform; communication in the patient's immediate vicinity should be preferred (primary-care physician, local press); clinical databases and websites accessible to professionals, but also to patients and non-professionals, should be developed; genuine instruction on clinical trials for physicians and health professionals unfamiliar with such trials should be developed and disseminated; media groups should receive at least some training in the fundamentals of clinical research.","1724":"","1725":"","1726":"","1727":"","1728":"","1729":"","1730":"","1731":"Hyperprolactinaemia is a relatively common endocrine abnormality caused by an increased secretion of prolactin from the pituitary gland. There are many causes of hyperprolactinaemia; drug therapy is a common cause in clinical practice. The present pharmacoepidemiological study conducted an analysis of the French Pharmacovigilance Database from January 1, 1985, to December 2000. We investigated the rates of hyperprolactinaemia according to therapeutic drug class, particularly where the Summaries of Product Characteristics (SPC) did not mention hyperprolactinaemia, and estimated the risk of developing hyperprolactinaemia during treatment. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) of reports associated with hyperprolactinaemia for all drugs. Of the 182,836 spontaneous adverse drug reactions reported to the French Pharmacovigilance network, 159 were hyperprolactinaemia. The sex ratio was 5.9 (136 women and 29 men), and mean age was 40 (range 14-85) years. Of the total number of adverse reactions, 31% were associated with neuroleptics, 28% with neuroleptic-like drugs, 26% with antidepressants, 5% with H2-receptor antagonists, and 10% with other drugs. Neuroleptics are not the only class of drugs for which hyperprolactinaemia is reported. Some drugs are clearly associated with an increased risk of hyperprolactinaemia, particularly the following: veralipride (OR = 108.7; IC 95%: 51.82-228), indoramin (OR = 78.68; IC 95%: 33.93-182.48), sertraline (OR = 15.74; IC 95%: 5.80-42.75), and ranitidine (OR = 4.43; IC 95%: 1.82-10.81). All these drugs are reported in the literature as inducing hyperprolactinaemia, although this adverse effect is not mentioned in the SPC. It is thus necessary to harmonise the SPC and encourage health professionals to notify all adverse reactions to their pharmacovigilance centres.","1732":"Lactic acidosis is a serious complication of antiretroviral therapy. Symptomatic hyperlactataemia is a milder form of this syndrome, but its incidence is unclear. In this prospective ongoing observational study of a large cohort of HIV-infected adults, hyperlactataemia was diagnosed in 64 patients. Incidences were 18.3\/1000 person-years with antiretroviral therapy, and 35.8\/1000 person-years for stavudine (d4T) regimens. Ten of the 64 patients developed lactic acidosis during the first 13 months of treatment (incidence 2.9\/1000 treated person-years). In four of ten patients, symptoms were absent or mild. More patients on d4T first-line therapy developed lactic acidosis than patients previously treated with other drugs (p = 0.008). Despite the occurrence of one death, the subsequent outcome for the remaining patients was favourable after antiretroviral therapy was stopped and supportive treatment with vitamins and antioxidants initiated. The early diagnosis of cases was the result of great vigilance and, combined with routine measurements of the anion gap, might be the most crucial factor explaining the low mortality rate observed here.","1733":"The terms regular, excessive or intermittent consumption do not characterize type of consumption, the profile of the drug user, or the threshold of drug dependence. To characterize trajectories of consumption over a 5-year period and identify sociodemographic and medical characteristics, and modes of consumption associated with the types of trajectories. 286 drug users from the cohort SUVIMAX agreed to take part in our study. SUVIMAX is a controlled randomized primary prevention trial using nutritional doses of a combination of anti-oxidant vitamins and minerals to reduce cardiovascular diseases and cancers. The data came from the questionnaire that examined each psychotropic drug taken between 1994 and 1998, rates of consumption and the beliefs associated with the drug users' modes of consumption and their dependence profiles. A continuous trajectory is defined as uninterrupted consumption during the 5-year follow-up, and an occasional trajectory as an interruption of consumption for at least 1 month. Only 30% of the drug users with a continuous trajectory considered they could do without psychotropic agents. The consumption of psychotropic drugs is not in itself harmful, but the duration and regularity of drug intake registered over a 5-year period indicate the drug dependence profile. The trajectory is a relevant and operational tool for better adapting therapeutic follow-up. ","1734":"Biotechnology-derived products represent a class of increasingly numerous drugs. One of their major characteristics is extreme diversity, which requires specific approaches for the preclinical evaluation of their safety. The selection of relevant animal species is not easy, as most of these products are human-specific. Thus, only one species will often be used, i.e. primates. As most of these products are large molecules, they can be directly immunogenic. When they are human-specific, no animal model is available to predict the risk. Many biotechnology-derived products have an expected influence on the immune system. This must be taken into account in the preclinical strategy of immunotoxicity evaluation that is now required for every new drug. As conventional toxicity testing is generally limited, safety pharmacology studies should include more than the core battery of assays required by current guidelines in order to complement missing data as much as possible. Because of these particularities, a comprehensive investigation of metabolism and pharmacokinetics is not usually needed. Some products can cross-react with cellular components not intended as therapeutic targets. It is, therefore, essential to rule out the risk of possible cross-reactions that can result in adverse effects. Finally, viral safety is a crucial component of the preclinical safety evaluation of these products. Overall, biotechnology-derived products raise specific issues because of their innovative and original characteristics, and it is difficult to address all these issues if not by using a case-by-case approach.","1735":"This study examined the efficacy of virgin olive oil phenolic extract and other phenolic compounds (oleuropein, caffeic acid) in preventing oxidative modifications of human low density lipoprotein oxidised by CuCl2. The vasorelaxant effect of these compounds on rat aortic ring with and without functional endothelium is also discussed. Olive oil phenolic extract, caffeic acid and oleuropein increased the lag time of conjugated diene formation in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, phenolic extract produced a vasorelaxant effect that persisted in denuded aorta and after inhibition of nitric oxide synthase by NG-methyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) or methylene blue. Oleuropein did not produce a relaxant effect, whereas caffeic acid produced partial relaxation at concentration 0.5 g\/L.","1736":null,"1737":"Our goal was to establish new pharmacological criteria for a drug to be used in the treatment of opioid dependence. We propose the following six pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic criteria: (i) the same pharmacodynamic properties as the drug being substituted; (ii) a long duration of action (minimum 24 hours, not requiring several daily doses) in order to prevent fluctuations in effect and especially withdrawal symptoms; (iii) few euphoric effects together with a minimal reinforcing effect for the drug itself and other drugs; (iv) oral or sublingual administration without any special affinity for other routes, especially the intravenous; (v) a New Drug Application (NDA) in this indication, after submission of a dossier including both clinical randomised comparative trials and security data; and (vi) compatibility with a socially satisfying quality of life. These criteria were applied to methadone, buprenorphine and other drugs that were proposed in the treatment of opioid dependence (such as morphine or codeine).","1738":"Rosuvastatin is a new synthetic statin that produces a more potent and prolonged inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase than any of the other statins currently available. It is also characterised by a very low lipophilicity, which is close to that of pravastatin, and by a high hepatic selectivity. Rosuvastatin is not extensively metabolised, with little or no transformation by the different isoenzymes of cytochrome P450. It is mainly eliminated in the faeces, with an elimination half-life in humans of between 13 and 21 hours. In patients with hypercholesterolaemia, rosuvastatin was associated with large dose-dependent reductions in low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, by 50.5% at a dose of 10 mg\/day and up to 64.8% at a dose of 80 mg. Each doubling of the dose of rosuvastatin results in an additional 4.5% decrease in blood LDL-cholesterol. In phase III studies, rosuvastatin decreased LDL-cholesterol significantly more than atorvastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin. Compared with the other statins, the decrease in triglyceride levels was similar and the increase in high density lipoprotein-cholesterol was more marked, with a significant difference in most cases. To date, there has not been an excess of adverse reactions, especially liver or muscle problems, compared with the reference statins. The safety of rosuvastatin can only be definitively established in post-marketing surveys.","1739":"The field of new lipid-lowering drug research is very active, with researchers, looking to make the currently available drugs more powerful and safer, and to develop new classes of drugs. Among the statins, development has gone the farthest for rosuvastatin and pitavastatin. Colesevelam is a new bile acid sequestrant with a better digestive tolerance. Among the new classes of drugs, the most promising molecules are the cholesterol absorption inhibitors--with ezetimibe as the first in line--and the PPAR-alpha and PPAR-gamma activators. Among the other classes, the acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibitors, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) inhibitors, cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors, and ileal bile acid transporter inhibitors, have to be mentioned. In most of the cases, those new compounds are being developed mainly as a combined treatment with statins. However, these combination therapies differ depending on the lipid abnormalities of the patient. The statin-ezitimibe and the statin-bile acid sequestrant combinations have been the most studied treatments in pure hypercholesterolaemia. On another hand, the statin-PPAR-alpha and -gamma activator combination were the first to be developed for patients with combined hyperlipidaemia or type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the clinical benefit of ACAT or CETP inhibitors remains to be determined and the development of MTP inhibitors has been restricted so far, because of problems of digestive intolerance and hepatic steatosis. Finally, the discovery of new specific lipoprotein receptors, such as the ABCA1 and SRB1 receptors, means that we can work towards developing new potential targets for pharmacological intervention.","1740":"More than ten years after the statins became available in therapeutics, some questions remain unanswered. What would be the populational impact if the results of clinical trials were applied to a country such as France? Is the extrapolation licit? Does the benefit of the statins actually exceed the risk? What is the relevant target population? Are statins more effective than agents acting on other cardiovascular risk factors? How efficient are the statins really? Are the statins effective in non-hypercholesterolaemic patients? What is the overall cost of the statins? Despite the fact that the statins are the drug of choice in many situations, it is still important for these questions to be answered before we accept the widespread use of statins in the general population, such as the large numbers of patients that the drug may be prescribed for in France.","1741":"The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and fibrates have been associated with myotoxicity, which, in some cases, has been fatal. Rhabdomyolysis is frequently observed during drug interactions with elevated plasma concentrations. Statins have a low oral bioavailability because of their intense first-pass extraction. Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is responsible for the metabolism of atorvastatin and simvastatin which present the highest risk of drug interactions with CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as macrolides, antifungal agents, protease inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, amiodarone, and grapefruit juice. Fluvastatin has a low potential for drug interactions due to its CYP2C9-dependant metabolism. Pravastatin liver extraction does not involve CYPs and presents a low potential for drug interactions. Fibrates have a high oral bioavailability (approximately 100%), and this minimises the risk of drug interactions. However, fibrates alter the pharmacokinetics of some drugs, possibly via CYP2C9 and UDP-glucuronyltransferase (UGT) inhibition. Only three cholesterol-reducing agents have demonstrated their ability to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular death in long-term follow-up randomised trials among patients with atherosclerosis. Simvastatin exhibits the highest potential for drug interactions, pravastatin and gemfibrozil the lowest.","1742":"The safety of the hydroxymethyl glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) has been called into question following the recent withdrawal from the market of one of the class, cerivastatin. The withdrawal of cerivastatin highlighted concerns regarding the safety of the entire class. According to data from several large clinical trials, the statins (except cerivastatin) are well tolerated. The most important and clinically relevant adverse effect reported with statins is myopathy. Myopathy is a clinical diagnosis of elevated creatine phosphokinase and\/or myalgia along with fatigue. However, the severe from (i.e. statin-associated rhabdomyolysis) is an uncommon syndrome and occurs at a rate of approximately 1\/100,000 patients\/years. Statin-associated myopathy is related to statin doses, and often to drug\/drug interactions. Other clinically relevant adverse effects associated with statin therapy include liver transminases elevation, which is relatively mild and often self-limiting There is no evidence from clinical trials of a significant alteration of ophthalmological function with statins. The issue of statin-induced cancer remains inconclusive. Overall, the statins seem to exhibit a favourable risk\/benefit ratio, and this undoubtedly justifies life-long clinical use of statins for cardiovascular prevention.","1743":"Statins and fibrates have been demonstrated to prevent both cardiovascular events and stroke. While this preventive effect was initially thought to be related to their lipid-lowering effects, in particular hypocholesterolaemic effect, analysis of primary and secondary prevention trials suggest that these preventive effects could be partly independent of their effects on lipid disorders. The pleiotropic effects, such as vascular, anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidants effects, were described for both the statins and fibrates. In addition to the preventive effects, these pleiotropic effects could partially explain the decrease in myocardial or cerebral ischemia consequences in experimental models. These cellular protective effects may have a therapeutic interest to decrease severity of stroke or coronary acute syndrome. They could also explain the drugs' lipid-lowering preventive effects independent of the treatment of lipid disorders. Beyond vascular pathologies, the pleiotropic effects of lipid-lowering drugs could explain their potentially beneficial effect in different diseases, such as dementia or cancer.","1744":"The treatment of hypercholesterolaemia in children is often discussed as part of the primary prevention strategy for premature coronary disease in adults. Cholesterol-lowering drugs are appropriate in children with hereditary autosomal dominant diseases such as familial hypercholesterolaemia, familial Apo B100 deficiency, or combined familial dyslipidaemia. Indeed, these diseases are associated with a high risk of cardiovascular attacks in young adults. In children suffering from these diseases, cholesterol-lowering drugs are considered when the plasma low density-lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol concentration remains above 190 mg\/dL after a 6-month dietary treatment. The drug of first choice remains bile acid-binding resines (colestyramine) because their efficacy and safety are well documented in children. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can be used in children older than 8 or 9 years of age in cases of an altered observance of colestyramine treatment, but their long-term tolerance is unknown. Fibrates are also efficient, however, their safety has not been evaluated in controlled studies through in children.","1745":"Statin therapy significantly decreases the rate of clinical events in secondary prevention, however their use in patients with the acute phase of acute coronary syndromes remains controversial. Their pleiotropic effects on thrombosis, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction, might improve vascular healing. Although numerous observational studies have shown a significant reduction in mortality, one trial suggested that the statins may have a potentially harmful effect in patients with low cholesterol. However, randomised controlled trials have not demonstrated harmful effects. Of these trials, the Myocardial Ischemia Reduction with Aggressive Cholesterol Lowering (MIRACL) study is the only trial with adequate statistical power to show a significant reduction in ischemic events at 16 weeks with a high dose of once daily atorvastatin 80 mg.","1746":"An important issue for stroke prevention is the identification and treatment of risk factors such as hypercholesterolaemia. The 4 reasons to test if the statins have a role in stroke prevention are: (i) a statistical link between elevated low density lipoprotein-cholesterol or decreased high density lipoprotein-cholesterol and ischaemic stroke; (ii) a reduction in vascular risk with statins in randomised trials in patients with coronary heart disease; (iii) evidence of a decreased plaque progression under statins; and (iv) pooled analyses of primary and secondary prevention trials showing that reduction of total serum cholesterol reduces the incidence of stroke, especially with the highest rate of cholesterol reduction, and in patients with the highest risk of stroke (i.e. with statins in secondary prevention trials). The question of whether statins also have a neuroprotective effect in humans and reduce the risk of post-stroke dementia remains unsettled.","1747":"Previous overviews have suggested that the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), but not other lipid lowering therapies (LLTs), may reduce stroke incidence in coronary patients. Our objective was to investigate the amplitude and sources of heterogeneity of LLT effects on stroke prevention. A literature search was performed from 1966-2001 to identify all English-language published trials testing LLT. We then conducted a meta-analysis including randomised primary and secondary coronary heart disease prevention trials, which tested statins, nonstatins, diet or other interventions, and providing data on stroke incidence. The overall meta-analysis (38 individual trials, 83,161 patients, mean follow-up of 4.7 years) showed a significant relative risk reduction (RRR) of strokes by LLTs of 17% (p &lt; 0.001), without significant heterogeneity between trials and between subgroups according to either the type of prevention (primary or secondary prevention) or type of LLT. Most demonstrative effects was obtained however with statins (RRR = 26%). Effect model analysis showed that the treatment benefits appeared constant whatever the risk of stroke, suggesting that LLTs may be effective in a population with a higher risk of stroke. Weighted regression showed a significant correlation between the RRR of stroke and total cholesterol levels (baseline, final, and change). Only final cholesterol level allowed a clear separation between benefit (RRR &gt; 0) and no effect (RRR &lt; 0) of LLTs on stroke incidence, with a cut-off for benefit of 6.0 mmol\/L. LLTs reduce stroke incidence in coronary patients, especially when total cholesterol is under 6.0 mmol\/L, this explains the better results obtained with statins. ","1748":"Intermediate criteria will always be useful in the first phases of drug development, e.g. to confirm that the drug acts on lipid parameters as expected from pharmacological model, for they are easier and faster to obtain than clinical criteria such as cardiovascular events. However, their use in other contexts (medical practice, research, labelling) is based on a set of conditions, needed and sufficient for surrogacy: correlation, prediction, capture and universality conditions. The critical appraisal of available information, from epidemiological studies and clinical trials as well, shows that not one of these conditions is met. The consequences are: for practice, the questioning of the worth of therapeutic monitoring of statins by lipid parameters; for research the requirement of formal models which alone would allow to fill the gap left by mythical surrogate outcomes, without meeting all their impossible conditions; and eventually for labelling, a much higher level of demand, with heavy consequences.","1749":"The prevention of cardiovascular diseases is an important aim in public health. As hyperlipidaemia is one of the main causes of cardiovascular disease, a number of clinical trials have involved the testing of hypolipidaemic drug, i.e. statins, colestyramine, and gemfibrozil, and have shown their effectiveness in reducing the incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction and coronary death. Moreover, the use of statins has lead to a decrease in coronary mortality, hence a decrease in total mortality. Their efficacy was irrespective of the initial LDL-cholesterol level or atherosclerotic risk, regardless of age or gender. This demonstration of the effectiveness of hypolipidaemic drugs leads to the recommendation of there use in individuals with high atherosclerotic risk, particularly in those patients with a history of coronary heart disease or diabetes mellitus.","1750":"The comparison of major statin trials with trials using either cholestyramine or ileal bypass has suggested that the reduction in coronary heart disease events for those patients receiving statin therapy largely result from their low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol lowering action. LDL-cholesterol lowering has several physiological consequences, including plaque stabilisation with a decrease in the inflammatory process, slowing of plaque progression, and improvement of endothelial function, as evidenced by the measurement of endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation in response to hyperhaemia or acetylcholine infusion. Statins lower C-reactive protein without any consistent effect on the other inflammation acute phase proteins. The cause and consequences of this effect are still debated. In order to explain why some statins can prevent coronary events within a few months, a direct effect of this therapy on thrombosis has also been advocated; however, the evaluation of statin antithrombotic effects in humans has produced conflicting results. By inhibiting L-mevalonic acid synthesis, statins also prevent the farnelysation of small-GTP binding proteins such as Rho and Ras. In vitro, and in animal models, the inhibition of Rho with statins results in a decrease in endothelial nitric oxide production, an inhibition of leucocyte adhesion on endothelium, decrease in PPAR alpha activation and high density lipoprotein (HDL) production by the hepatocyte, decrease in Ca2+ stores in vascular smooth cells, and a stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis. However, most of these effects were obtained with high statin concentrations. Further evidence is needed before a full assessment of the clinical importance of isoprenylation blockage with therapeutic concentrations of statins in humans can be made.","1751":"Statins and fibrates constitute the two major families of hypolipidaemic drugs. Statins are widely used in the treatment of patients with pure hypercholesterolaemias and mixed dyslipidaemias while fibrates are used to treat hypertriglyceridaemias and mixed hyperlipidaemias. Some fibrates efficiently reduce low density-lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase and decrease cellular cholesterol synthesis. The resulting lower intracellular cholesterol concentrations suppress the capacity of Insing-1 and Insing-2 to inhibit the interaction of SCAP with SREBP-2 in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum and the formation of the SCAP: SREBP-2:SP-1 complex. When formed, this complex migrates towards the Golgi where activated SP-1 and SP-2 protease cleave SREBP-2 to give a free NH2-terminal-SREBP-2 peptide which migrates towards the nucleus. In the nucleus, this free NH2-terminal-SREBP-2 peptide binds to the SRE contained in the promoter of the gene of the LDL(B\/E)-receptor and induces the transcription of this gene, and the over-expression of the LDL(B\/E)-receptor in the cytoplasmic plasma membrane of hepatocytes. The over-expression of the LDL-receptor in the liver increases the clearance of circulating LDL, decreasing the LDL-cholesterol plasma levels. Fibrates decrease plasma triglycerides by decreasing their hepatic synthesis and increasing their catabolism. They decrease the triglyceride-very low density-lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesis through their capacity to increase the beta-oxidation of fatty acids in the liver. They increase the plasma triglyceride catabolism by inducing the lipoprotein lipase gene transcription and decreasing the apoC-III gene transcription. Fibrates increase high density-lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol by increasing apoA-I and apoA-II gene transcription. These bio-molecular effects of fibrates are entirely due to their capacity to activate PPAR alpha and to induce the over expression of genes containing a PPRE in their promoter. Therefore, the mechanism of action of the statins and fibrates depends on their capacity to modulate the expression of genes controlling the lipoprotein metabolism.","1752":"","1753":"","1754":"","1755":"","1756":"","1757":"Immune-mediated (type II) heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a common and potentially serious averse effect of heparin therapy. Early diagnosis is needed in order to prevent complications such as venous and arterial thromboembolic events. Clinical management of patients with type II HIT is difficult. In most cases, immediate cessation of heparin therapy is required, and continuation with alternative antithrombotic treatment is recommended. Currently, there is no consensus about the optimal anticoagulation therapy for type II HIT. A literature review regarding new antithrombotics and their role in HIT was carried out, using Medline. The pharmacologic characteristics as well as the clinical evaluation of direct inhibitors of thrombin (argatroban, inogatran, melagatran, ximelagatran, efegatran and napsagatran) and fondaparinux, a synthetic pentasaccharide were reported. There new anticoagulants are not available yet in France, so sodium danaparoid and lepirudin are the only effective antithrombotics officially induced in HIT, and constitute an important therapeutic advance. A procedure for HIT prophylaxis or thrombosis treatment with HIT was assessed. No comparative test concerning sodium danaparoid and lepirudin is available. The selection could not be based on clinical arguments, but the cost of treatment could constitute a selection criterion. The comparison of the treatment cost for a patient weighing 70 kg, and presenting with symptomatic HIT, was in favour of sodium danaparoid. Because of the increased risk of haemorrhage with lepirudin, and the less convenient administration methods for this drug, the prescription of sodium danaparoid as first-line therapy, following a test of platelet aggregation can be justified. The monitoring of a treatment by sodium danaparoid or by lepirudin could be carried out within our establishment. For all these reasons, we chose the systematic use of lepirudin in the event for symptomatic HIT thus in emergency. In patients presenting asymptomatic HIT, or with a history of HIT and for which a surgical operation requiring an active anticoagulant was programmed, sodium danaparoid must preferentially be used, only if the test of crossed reactivity with sodium danaparoid is negative. The absence of crossed reactivity of the heparin-dependent antibodies against sodium danaparoid should be systematically tested, imperatively during the acute phase of HIT. The conversion to vitamin K antagonists must be considered as soon as possible, after HIT correction. HIT should be largely prevented by limiting the duration of heparin administration and by monitoring platelet numeration, twice-weekly during the first three weeks of treatment, and in the event of its prolongation, to be carried out once a week. This approach should decrease the number of cases of thrombocytopenia due to heparin.","1758":"","1759":"Currently, the only therapy approved for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke is intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) initiated within 3 hours of symptom onset. This therapy is only used in a very small percentage of stroke patients even in experienced centers. There have been many other clinical trials of thrombolytic drugs beyond the 3-hour time window and neuroprotective drugs, but none of these trials have been positive. There are many potential explanations for these unsuccessful stroke trials and many valuable lessons have been learned. Using imagging technology such as diffusion\/perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and perfusion computerised tomography (CT) will likely enhance the enhances for success in future acute stroke trials when combined with appropriate trial design and patient selection. Developing new acute stroke therapies will be a difficult but necessary task to meet the large unmet need for this important and under treated disorder.","1760":"A \"good\" in vivo animal model of stroke must reproduce the etiology, anatomical, functional and metabolic consequences of human pathology and must also permit the study of anti-ischemic drugs in conditions pertinent to the clinical therapeutics. As stroke is a very heterogeneous clinical entity, such a model could only mimic a limited part of stroke. Animal data are usually collected in healthy laboratory rodents of the same age, in which a standardized amount of cerebral ischemia is induced by a reproducible intervention. In contrast, aetiology, location and severity of ischaemic stroke in patients is very heterogeneous. Among the various animal models of stroke, two of them are particularly used: a model of global transient ischemia by occlusion of the 4-vessels in the rat (Pulsinelli's model), which induces a delayed neuronal death in the hippocampus and model(s) of permanent or transient focal cerebral ischemia occluding the middle cerebral artery in rodents. A large number of compounds have been shown to be active using these two animal models, but unfortunately, none of them were found to be active in clinical trials. Various factors could be responsible for this major discrepancy and some of them are not related to pre-clinical studies, but to the complexities of the clinical problem of stroke. Failure in the translation of results from animals models to humans implicates potential limitations of the current drug development process. Retrospective analysis of studies suggests possible improvements at several stages during pre-clinical studies. Standardized guidelines for preclinical evaluation of neuroprotective drugs may improve chances of success. For example, preclinical studies should be performed in at least 2 species and 2 strains for a specific specie in order to take into account known strain and species differences. Moreover, while neuroprotection drug development is dominated by volumetric histology as the outcome measure, the demonstration of functional benefits must be performed both after short and long periods of recovery. Attempts should be made to use multiple models such as stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats, outbred rodents and aged animals that more closely simulate clinical conditions. In addition, treatment in animals should not be given immediately after ischaemia, but after a delay, as most patients are not treated within minutes of stroke onset. Animal models should be used to determine dosage and duration of therapy, which will vary with the pharmacokinetic properties of different agents. Moreover, complete dose-response curves should be established as bell-shaped dose-responses curves may predict dose-limiting adverse effects that hinder subsequent efficacy trials. Finally, physiological monitoring (cerebral blood flow, blood pressure and gazes, body temperature, glycemia, ...) should be performed to eliminate confounding variables and to observe adverse systemic effects. The future of neuroprotection for stroke remains bright in spite of previous disappointments.","1761":"In cerebral ischemia, the disappointment related to anti-glutamate strategies in clinical trials has led to examine new targets for the treatment of stroke. In vitro studies demonstrated that overactivation of glutamate receptors leads to nitric oxide (NO) production that contributes to the excitotoxic neuronal death. The role of NO was then studied in in vivo models of cerebral ischemia. In the early phase after ischemia, NO is produced by the constitutive endothelial and neuronal isoforms of NO-synthase (NOS 3 and NOS 1) while in the later phase, the inducible NOS (NOS 2) is responsible for the delayed production of NO. NOS 3 appears beneficial via vasodilatation and inhibition of leukocyte adhesion and platelet aggregation. By contrast NOS 1 and NOS 2 were demonstrated deleterious in cerebral ischemia. This was shown by three distinct strategies: selective inhibitors, mutant mice deficient in NOS 1 or NOS 2, and antisenses directed to one of these isoforms. Moreover it is now thought that NO-induced neuronal death is mainly mediated through the formation of peroxynitrite anions resulting from the reaction between NO and superoxyde anion. Peroxynitrites indeed damage lipids, proteins and nucleic acids. DNA strand breaks in turn activate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Overactivation of this enzyme in pathological conditions such as cerebral ischemia seems deleterious by depleting ATP stores. Thus inhibition of the NO-peroxynitrites-PARP pathway may lead to neuroprotective therapeutics in stroke.","1762":null,"1763":"The only treatment for acute ischaemic stroke patients that presently has proven efficacy is intravenous thrombolysis with rt-PA within 3 hrs of onset. However, only at most 5% of the patients are eligible for this therapy. It remains therefore of foremost importance to develop efficacious neuroprotective agents for ischaemic stroke. Unfortunately, despite proven efficacy in the laboratory animal, all clinically-tested neuroprotectants have failed to show significant benefit in well-powered randomized clinical trials. In this article, the possible causes for this situation--either at the level of the design of clinical trials or that of the pre-clinical evaluation--are reviewed, and a number of measures that could be taken to try and solve this awkward situation are proposed.","1764":null,"1765":"When an investigator invites a patient to take part in a clinical trial, he explains the purposes and details of the trial and gives him an information sheet. We decided to assess this information comparing it with the Huriet-Serusclat law and ICH norms. Seventy four information sheets from phase II and III trials were analysed. The research setting is always specified whereas the aim of the trial is presented in 96% of cases. The sequence of events is detailed in 76% of cases, and the benefits two times out of three. The text is often presented in only one paragraph and the average number of pages is about 2.6. For 25 percent of cases, information is lacking with regard to the progression of the trial; in other cases, the sheets are too long and patients are lost in an excess of information. Information sheets in clinical trials must be practical and short and rely on ICH recommendations.","1766":"Antimutagens and anticarcinogens are natural or synthetic substances able to inhibit or to reduce spontaneous or induced DNA alteration. These inhibitors act at different levels from the penetration of the xenobiotic to the expression of the mutation and cancer. They act in extracellular and intracellular levels; they react directly with mutagens or on the processes of their activation. Antimutagens and anticarcinogens also act on DNA-repair process.","1767":"","1768":"","1769":"","1770":"","1771":"","1772":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is increasingly common in medical practice, as a result of the inevitable aging of the population. The current therapeutic strategy includes three alternatives: watchful waiting, medical treatment and invasive therapy. Finasteride is one of the pharmacological options available. Many clinical studies have demonstrated its efficacy and good safety profile in patients with BPH. The survey we report provides new insights into what has to date been a purely therapeutic approach by taking into consideration patients' expectations and their perception of finasteride treatment. Results indicate that the main preoccupation for patients with BPH is that the pharmacological treatment will reduce the risk of major urological complications and the need for surgery (treatment characteristics considered as very or extremely important by 88 and 93% of patients, respectively). Decreasing symptoms and improving quality of life take second place after these primary concerns. Patient perception of finasteride is excellent. Nearly all patients are satisfied by the efficacy of the treatment, 89% of them reporting good to extremely good improvement of symptoms, the rapid onset of relief being particularly important. The efficacy of finasteride is not hindered by any tolerability issues and is further strengthened by its ease of use. Although this novel survey includes a number of biases, it nevertheless demonstrates that treatment of BPH with finasteride is well accepted by patients and satisfies their expectations. In addition, it provides a mass of general epidemiological data on patients with BPH, as well as on current medical practice regarding this condition.","1773":"We report 4 cases of hepatic injury in patients treated with a dextropropoxyphene-paracetamol combination in which the causal relationship with dextropropoxyphene can be suspected. These four cases show similarities with the 29 cases found in international publications. Hepatotoxicity occurs more frequently among old patients and women. Clinically, this condition can mimic a biliary tract disease with sometimes few or no symptoms. Biochemical criteria can show cholestatic, mixed or cytolytic hepatitis. Intrahepatic cholestasis may be found in liver biopsies sometimes suggesting cholangitis. Outcome is favourable on withdrawal of the drug. The mechanism of action of dextropropoxyphene is discussed.","1774":"The objective was to compare, during a 5-day therapy, the efficacy and tolerability of an antihistaminic antitussive syrup, oxomemazine, combining a small quantity of guaifenesine (T), with a centrally acting antitussive, clobutinol (S), in adult patients aged from 18 to 70 years and presenting with a dry cough of infectious origin. This study was performed by 22 general practitioners and 130 ambulatory patients were enrolled. The primary criterion of this multicenter, randomized, single blind study was to compare the evolution of cough intensity using a Visual Analog Squale (VAS) graduated from 0 to 10 cm. Nine secondary criteria including tolerability were also assessed. With regard to cough intensity, the treatments were not equivalent. A greater reduction was observed with T (-5.2 +\/- 2.3 versus -4.3 +\/- 2.3). This result was confirmed by a further reduction in cough intensity at days: 2 (p = 0.04), 4 (p = 0.05), and 5 (p = 0.02). The frequency of cough disappearance before the end of the study was significantly greater for T than for S: 46% versus 29% (p = 0.05). The time before disappearance of the cough was 4.0 + 1.1 days for both medicines. Induction of sleep and the frequency of nocturnal wakening were significantly better for T from day 4 (p = 0.02). The drowsiness induced by T meant that diurnal quality of life was better with S on days 1 (p = 0.002) and 2 (p = 0.01). Tolerability was similar for both medicines. In conclusion, as a symptomatic treatment of dry cough, T is efficient and well tolerated. Moreover, we have observed a tendency towards superior efficacy of T than S. T is therefore a useful alternative in the therapeutic armamentarium available to the general practitioner.","1775":"Recommendations have recently been published regarding the prescription of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) during pregnancy in women at risk of thromboembolism. To assess how well these recommendations are followed, we retrospectively recorded all pregnancy consultations in a thrombosis unit for two years. Of the 26 women included (mean age 30 +\/- 4.8 years), 81% presented with a history of thromboembolism, 35% thrombophilia, and 15% a history of pregnancy termination for medical reasons. Clinical follow-up concerned 17% of the women; 8% were given aspirin, 63% LMWH at prophylactic dosages, 4% combination of aspirin and prophylactic LMWH, and 8% were on curative LMWH. Neither thromboembolic nor neonatal events were observed. One case of termination of pregnancy for medical reasons was observed at the 5th month. Although we also took into account the gravity of previous thromboembolism, our prescriptions were globally in compliance with the recommendations. This approach has still to be validated with a decision-making tree.","1776":"To determine if systematic use of metoclopramide associated with opioids (Morphine sulfate SR) decreases the incidence of nausea and vomiting (N&amp;V), established adverse effects of opioids. Open randomised study with 132 patients treated for non malignant pain (71 women, 61 men, mean age 53.4 years). One group (n = 76) was treated with morphine alone; the other (n = 56) with morphine plus metoclopramide. Mean duration of therapy: 6 days; mean dosage: 60 mg\/d In the 2 groups, N&amp;V were present in the first 72 hours. The frequency of N&amp;V in the morphine group was 38.1% (conform with the literature). The systematic use of metoclopramide decreases the frequency of N&amp;V: p &lt; 0.005. However the use of morphine &gt; 60 mg\/d decreases N&amp;V: p = 0.036. High dosages of morphine can have an antiemetic effect by interaction with the mu receptors in the antiemetic center and not in the trigger zone which has an emetic effect. The systematic use of metoclopramide with opioid therapy for non malignant pain in rheumatology decreases the risk of nausea and vomiting. ","1777":"A single glass of grapefruit juice can improve the oral bioavailability of a drug thus either increasing its efficacy or enhancing its adverse effects particularly if the therapeutic index is narrow. Grapefruit juice acts by inhibiting presystemic drug metabolism mediated by CYP P450 3A4 in the small bowel and this interaction would appear to be more relevant if the CYP 3A4 content is high and the drug has a strong first pass degradation. Intestinal P-glycoprotein may also be affected by grapefruit juice. The compounds responsible for this food-drug interaction have not as yet been identified but this phenomenon could result from a complex synergy between flavonoids (naringin, naringenin), furanocoumarins (6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin, bergamottin) and sesquiterpen (nootkatone). In our study, we report the mechanisms of action of grapefruit juice and the interactions between grapefruit juice and 42 drugs; to date, only 12 drugs showed no interaction. Taking these results into consideration, patients should be educated about grapefruit juice intake with medication.","1778":"Polymorphic N-acetyltransferase (NAT2) is involved in the metabolism of several compounds relevant in pharmacology or toxicology, with diverse clinical consequences. Inter-ethnic variations in distribution of the acetylation phenotype are significant. The caffeine test is most often used to assess the acetylation phenotype and to identify rapid and slow acetylators. The NAT2 phenotype could account for the increased risk of certain side effects in slow acetylators treated with isoniazid (particularly peripheral neuropathies and lupus erythematosus), although therapeutic efficacy seems to be independent of the acetylation status. Hypersensibility reactions with sulfonamides (including Lyell and Stevens-Johnson syndromes) are more frequent in slow acetylators, who also show poor tolerance to sulfasalazine and dapsone. In contrast, myelotoxicity induced by amonafide is more frequent in rapid acetylators, probably because of increased production of a toxic metabolite of the drug. In carcinogenesis, NAT2 may play a protective role against bladder cancer, although studies have shown contradictory results. Slow acetylators may have a risk of developing primitive liver cancer. For lung cancer, data are not conclusive, but slow acetylation status may predispose to mesothelioma in subjects exposed to asbestos. No relation has been found between acetylation phenotype and breast cancer. Contradictory results were reported on its role in colorectal cancer. Non-smoking type 1 diabetics may be at increased risk of nephropathy if they are rapid acetylators. Parkinson's disease may be more frequent among slow acetylators, but again, data have shown contradictory results. Finally, a poor acetylator phenotype may predispose to atopic diseases.","1779":"Social Pharmacology, a new field in Clinical Pharmacology, describes the relationships between Society and Drugs. Topics of Social Pharmacology are first, the social consequences of populations' exposure to drugs and, secondly, the social factors explaining drug use behind clinical or rational explanations. Social Pharmacology also investigates the reasons for prescription, delivery, consumption and self-medication of drugs (behind clinical or rational factors). The paper discusses the role of the different players of Social Pharmacology in the field of drug development, evaluation, prescription and consumption. For example, the pharmaceutical industry should play an important role in the discovery of new medically and socially \"desirable\" drugs. Drug companies are also involved in this field for drug information to doctors but also patients. Regulatory agencies are concerned by social factors involved in drug approval, regulation of the maximal level of drug use, application and transferability of clinical trials to daily clinical practice. Social Pharmacologists also investigate the factors (others than clinical or rational) regulating drug use. Drug consumption varies according to social characteristics of physicians (sub-speciality, medical education, cultural origin, etc) or patients (gender, age, education, country, kind of work, social status etc). Relationships between drugs and religion make up a large chapter of Social Pharmacology. Other topics in Social Pharmacology involving other health professionals (pharmacists), lawyers and the media are also discussed. Finally, drugs should be considered as important social markers of population behaviour. The role of the Social Pharmacologist is to identify these social and irrational factors governing drug use in order to adapt and rationalize drug utilization in daily clinical practice.","1780":"","1781":"","1782":"","1783":"Indirect standardisation or the standardised rate method, consists of a comparison of the number of observed and expected cases. This method could be applied in the field of pharmacovigilance in order to investigate the potential relationship between drug exposure and the occurrence of an adverse event. It consists of the calculation of an expected number of events obtained by multiplying the exposed population by the event rate in the reference population. The comparison is made by means of a standardised mortality or incidence ratio (SMR or SIR). Three examples of this method are presented. The first example concerns central nervous system demyelinating disorders and hepatitis B vaccine, where the SIR calculated from spontaneous reports was equal to 1.05 (95% CI [0.82-1.26]). In the second example, the SMR of cardiovascular deaths related to sildenafil was significantly different from 1 (0.69, [0.43-1.08]) using data from prescription-event monitoring. In the last example, a strong association between acute leukaemia and chemotherapy in breast cancer was found (SIR 28.5, [12.3-56.2]) using exhaustive data from cancer registries. This method allows a quick and cheap risk assessment, although the quality of available data may limit validity of results. In this case, the hypothesis need to be examined by further ad-hoc clinical and pharmacoepidemiological studies.","1784":"There is currently little evidence available concerning the risks of foetal exposure to new anti-epileptic drugs such as lamotrigine, vigabatrin, gabapentine, topiramate. A small number of malformations without organ specificity have been described and are not easy to interpret because of the existence of concomitant treatments. We have reported a series of 12 pregnancies with exposure to recent anti-epilepticdrugs and that were reported to the Post-marketing Surveillance office in Tours, France. Five concerned Lamictal of which 2 related to monotherapy, one concerned Epitomax used in monotherapy and there were 6 cases of polytherapy including Sabril. Associated drug therapies were Depakine, Tegretol, Rivotril and Urbanyl. Six of the patients were on folic acid supplements. The average age of the women was 26.5 years. In each case, treatment had been initiated before conception and was continued for at least 3 months. Of the 12 babies born, only one presented with a malformation (aplasia of the muscle of the left lower lip and asymmetrical abduction of the hips) following exposure to Lamictal and Depakine. Four infants, two of whom were premature, showed signs of neonatal stress: transient respiratory distress and difficulty in taking feeding-bottles following exposure throughout the pregnancy to Epitomax; suction disorders, hypotonia and vomiting were observed after exposure to Sabril, Tegretol and Rivotril throughout the pregnancy; respiratory distress and apnoea--bradycardia were observed after exposure throughout the pregnancy to Lamictal and Urbanyl; respiratory distress and thrombocytopaenia were observed after exposure throughout the pregnancy to Lamictal\". This small series confirms that the current data concerning the teratogenicity of new anti-epileptic drugs are as yet insufficient to exclude any teratogenic risk. Consequently, strict adherence to current recommendations relating to drug use during pregnancy is essential. The treatment of all patients wishing to become pregnant should be discussed.","1785":"Depression is an incapacitating disease which needs appropriate treatment. This article reviews the pharmacology of antidepressant drugs and the future perspectives of treating mood disorders such as depression. The foremost theory for explaining the biological basis of depression has been the monoamine hypothesis. Depression is due to a deficiency in one or other biogenic monoamines (serotonin, 5-HT; noradrenaline, NA; dopamine, DA). Antidepressant drugs are therefore classified according to their ability to improve monoaminergic transmission. Since this first theory, other explanations based on abnormal function of monoamine receptors or associated with impaired signalling pathways have been suggested. Notable progress has been accomplished in the treatment of major depressive disorders with new compounds recently discovered (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: SSRI; serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors: SNRI). Behavioural, electrophysiological and microdialysis studies have shown that serotonin (5-HT) receptors, mainly 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT2C sub-types, exert a key role in modulating antidepressant activity. Indirect activation of neurotransmitter receptors by antidepressants may also lead, via increases in endogenous levels of serotonin in synapses in specific brain regions, to activation of various G proteins coupled to a receptor, signal of transduction, transcription factors and neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Thus, depression may be considered as a transduction mechanism anomaly. This hypothesis needs to be clarified by molecular biology. Although antidepressants have improved the therapeutic potential compared to tricyclics (TCA) in terms of reduced side effects, a number of problems still occur with these drugs. Clinical effects are not always observed until after this time has elapsed (4-6 weeks) and a substantial proportion of depressed patients show only partial or no response to antidepressants. Knowledge of the existence of links between neurotransmitter systems and the discovery of the most specific target, 5-HT receptors, should lead to improvements in antidepressant therapy. Developing drugs using innovative mechanisms such as directly acting on 5-HT receptors (5-HT1A agonists or 5-HT2 antagonists), would appear to be useful in the treatment of depression. The use of antidepressants in anxiety disorders such as obsessional compulsive disorders and even generalised anxiety, highlights the distinction between antidepressants and classic anxiolytics such as benzodiazepines, or even buspirone.","1786":"Any drug generally made and marketed by drug companies must respect the quality standards conferred by New Drug Approval regarding both safety and efficacy. Once prescribed by a doctor, inside a hospital, the drug, or more precisely the decision of its prescription will follow a complex circuit, involving numerous intermediates (human and technical) leading to drug dispensation and follow-up. Regulatory guidelines and rules harmonise and standardise this drug pathway in hospitals. Any weakness in this distribution system will be the source of nosocomial drug iatrogeny. The present review aims at describing the different steps and stages from the prescription to an individual patient to drug administration and follow-up. The evaluation of this system will be mentioned in the perspective of optimisation. The computerised system is essential allowing tracking of a drug, and providing help for decision-making (by confrontation with data bases) and a research tool (i.e, pharmacoepidemiology). Different experiences of assessment of the performance of such a drug distribution system inside hospitals will be presented, trying to check the quality reference: the right drug, the right patient, the right moment, in good conditions. The challenge is to optimise and secure all steps of the process. This goal needs assessment and quality control of the different phases, opening the discussion between hospital policy and regulatory and technical considerations.","1787":"Compliance is the appropriateness of patient behaviour to therapeutic prescriptions. Good compliance increases treatment efficacy although its constraints may harm quality of life. Factors affecting compliance are related to the patient, the disease, health-care workers, family and treatment itself. Psycho-sociologic theories have attempted to explain patient behaviour. In clinical trials, compliance has to be optimized, i.e. in the protocol, during the study and the statistical analysis. In real life, compliance concerns all those involved in health-care, particularly for education, training and motivation of the patients and their immediate environment. Observational surveys relating to compliance are needed to determine prioriites and to develop a \"compliance approach\" based on improving information and the use of tools for better therapeutic adherence. Evaluation of the quality of life and patient satisfaction aspects is necessary to validate this approach.","1788":null,"1789":"An important part of drug development relies on the analysis of the relationships between drug doses and therapeutic and\/or side effects. This analysis implies an in-depth understanding of the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of the drug and of the relationship which links them (PK-PD relationship). The aim of this round table was to define the place of the study of PK-PD relationships in drug development. After reviewing the definitions of PK models, PD models, and of integrated PK-PD models, the article highlights the importance of studying the PK-PD relationship during the successive phases of drug development (pre-clinical, phase I\/II, phase III) and in specific populations (children, elderly people). A number of examples taken from pharmaceutical development or international literature are given. They show the methodology used and the type of information which can be drawn at each step of drug development. The article also presents the difficulties which prevent a more systematic application of this kind of approach during drug development. Scientific limits, problems in relation with the misunderstanding of the approach both in academic institutions and in pharmaceutical companies, and difficulties related to the lack of specific guidelines are discussed. The conclusion emphasizes the importance of using PK-PD modeling all along drug development and presents a number of actions which could further broaden its use.","1790":"Fourteen years after the concept was created, it seemed important to assess how well investigators actually apply Good Clinical Practice. Various sources of information have revealed a general deficiency in their application: \"investigation by the working group, Afssaps (French Agency for the Safety of Health-Care Products) inspections, industrial data\". The deficiencies identified stem from different factors: lack of professionalization, lack of training, lack of motivation, the large numbers of poorly conducted studies. The working group drew up proposals intended to improve the training of investigators, to dissuade investigators from pursuing inadequate procedure and to verify the level of compliance. However in this respect, the investigator is not the only one at fault. Improved practice unavoidably requires better assistance on the part of the sponsors, more consistent supervision of monitoring, and greater vigilence by the authorities involved in the control and use of trials.","1791":"The Marketing Authorization (MA) granted to a new molecular entity does not allow for proper anticipation of its future positioning within the therapeutic strategy. A specific methodology should be devised as early as during the pre-MA development phase that could result in an initial positioning that should be subjected to further reappraisal with regard to scientific advances, the arrival of new treatments and further developments with this molecule. A methodology is thus proposed, based on early optimisation of the development plan, the granting of subsequent MAs, and reappraisal of the positioning within the strategy, based on analysis of all available data. It should be possible to take into account the economic context, within an agreed system with pre-defined medico-economic criteria. This may in turn raise the issue of the role of the various parties involved in this assessment, as well as how to understand the respective opinions of stakeholders: authorities, sponsors, prescribers and patients, each of whom has a specific view of the definition of the strategic objective that should apply to the disease concerned.","1792":"Long-term follow up for medicines used in children is necessary in some therapeutic areas. Long-term effects (e.g. in cancer) may be detected many years after the treatment period. Growth, development and maturation specific to children can make these effects particularly harmful. The development plan of a paediatric drug should include, long term follow up on the basis of pharmacological-toxicological and safety data. These aspects should be taken into account when modifying the protocol (lower dosage, withdrawal of some associations etc). The follow up period may be very long, as in cancer (e.g. second tumour after treatment for cancer). A cohort is the best choice for this follow up, but other alternatives may be useful, including a specific follow-up Unit. Long-term follow-up is nevertheless difficult and expensive, manpower-dependent and the risk of failure is great especially in the teenage years.","1793":"","1794":"","1795":"","1796":"","1797":"","1798":"5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a fluoropyrimidine antimetabolite, is widely used in the treatment of cancers of the digestive tract and breast. The clinical cardiotoxicity of 5-FU was first reported in 1975. Adverse cardiac effects include coronary disorders, heart failure and sudden death of suspected cardiac origin. Six new cases are reported, including 5 cases of angina and one of heart failure. The patients, 4 males and 2 females, were 26 to 71 years of age (mean: 56.2). They had no medical history of heart failure, myocardial ischemia or electrocardiographic anomalies prior to 5-FU treatment. Three patients had hypertension of whom one had had type-II diabetes mellitus for the past 20 years. Clinical symptoms included chest pain in 4 patients and heart failure in one, whereas the last patient had ECG changes with no associated clinical symptoms. Clinical symptoms of angina totally disappeared after the cessation of 5-FU administration, but heart failure was alleviated only after the introduction of digitalis, a converting-enzyme inhibitor and a diuretic. It has been estimated that 1.6% of patients treated with 5-FU develop adverse cardiac effects. Patients at greater risk are those with a history of ischemic cardiac disease, thoracic radiotherapy or high-dose 5-FU therapy. The mechanism involved is not clearly elucidated. Spasms of the coronary arteries or toxic inflammation of the myocardium have been suspected. These 6 new cases confirm the potential for cardiotoxicity of 5-FU and the need for careful cardiac monitoring of treated patients.","1799":"The major risk of oral anticoagulant therapy is haemorrhage potentially affecting all organs. Bleeding in the central nervous system is a rare but severe complication of anticoagulant therapy. This study aimed to analyse a series of intracranial haemorrhages. This series from the Regional Pharmacovigilance Center of Amiens included spontaneously reported and retrospectively collected cases from January 1999 to December 2000. During this period, 38 cases of intracranial bleeding possibly related to oral anticoagulant administration were reported; 19 women and 19 men, median age 69.5 (29 to 87) years. In 34% of the cases, patients died and in 18% neurologic sequelae were still present at the time of the evaluation. In 21 cases (62%), the INR (International Normalized Ratio) was higher than the therapeutic range recommended for the indication. Among the most frequent risk factors, hypertension and recent minor trauma are highlighted in this series. In 17 cases, oral anticoagulants were associated with potentially potentiating drugs. Mental status changes or headache were prominent early symptoms which had often been present for days. Our data confirm that anticoagulant-associated intracranial haemorrhages are not rare, can be severe, potentially fatal and are probably underestimated by physicians. The fact that more than 50% of patients in this series were overanticoagulated at the time of bleeding suggests that many cases of intracranial haemorrhage could be prevented by improved anticoagulation control. Epidemiological studies are needed in order to prospectively evaluate the incidence of this type of complication and its avoidance. The value of anticoagulation clinics can be discussed.","1800":"Drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome is an uncommon but potentially life-threatening idiosyncratic drug reaction. In the literature, about five cases have been reported concerning hypersensitivity syndrome with lamotrigine. Most cases concern aromatic anticonvulsants but we report a case induced by lamotrigine which is a non aromatic anticonvulsant. A 73-year-old man was treated with lamotrigine for epilepsy due to a cerebrovascular stroke for 5 weeks. After 2 weeks with a single oral dose of 50 mg lamotrigine, the patient received 100 mg. Quickly thereafter fever, erythema and edema involving the periorbital area appeared. He was then admitted to hospital and lamotrigine was immediately discontinued. He developed acute hepatic and renal failure. During his hospital stay, he was treated with systemic and topical corticosteroids. After slow improvement, he was discharged 4 weeks later. Concerning this typical case, we review the characteristics of hypersensitivity syndrome and the different etiopathogenesis. The hypersensitivity syndrome typically develops two to six weeks after a drug is first administered, later than most other serious skin reactions. This syndrome manifests as rash, fever, tender lymphadenopathy, hepatitis and eosinophilia. The mechanism of hypersensitivity syndrome is unknown. Several theories have been proposed. The reaction is secondary to circulating antibodies or concerns toxic metabolities. On the other hand, association of human herpes virus 6 infection may play a role in the development of hypersensitivity syndrome. Hypersensitivity reactions to the aromatic antiepileptic drugs appear to have an immune etiology much like lamotrigine: bioactivation, detoxification, covalent adduct formation, processing and presentation of antigen to the immune system, and consequent formation of antibody and T-cell immune effectors. Another theory involves toxic metabolites; the aromatic antiepileptic agents are metabolised by cytochrome P-450 to an arene oxide metabolite. This is normally detoxified by epoxide hydrolase. This enzyme may be lacking or mutated in persons that develop the syndrome, and this is genetically determined. Lamotrigine is mainly metabolised by hepatic glucuronidation, but hypersensitivity may involve similar processes such aromatic antiepileptic drugs, except that the toxic metabolite has not yet been found. Because of slow evolution and clinical similarity to many infectious illnesses, the diagnosis of hypersensitivity syndrome may be delayed. Prompt recognition and withdrawal of the suspected drug is essential. The goal of research is to describe a \"susceptibility profile\" identifying individuals at risk for these forms of drug toxicity.","1801":"Drug iatrogeny is a current Public Health issue; it is often related to misuse and is therefore preventable. The congress \"Les Ateliers de Pharmacovigilance de La Baule\" (May 2001) bringing together pharmacovigilance staff from both the industry and Health authorities, showed that misuse concerns every step of the drug process--prescription, dispensing and administration--and all health professionals as well as the patient. New concepts have been brought to light with regard to the definition of misuse: the medical point of view should be preferred, based on the risk taken by a given patient without the expected benefit. product characteristics alone are inadequate and should be enlarged by relevent scientific data. the main goal is to improve the quality of healthcare by preventing misuse. A working group including Pharmacovigilance staff from the industry, the CRPV and the Afssaps has: to reach a consensus on definition in France and then propose it to EMEA; to analyse and propose specific prevention actions; to write a vademecum of those involved in this prevention.","1802":"Since 1999, the French health products safety agency (Afssaps) has been responsible for the safety of cosmetic products. Attempts are underway to set up a French post-marketing surveillance system for cosmetics and a working group specially in charge of setting this up has been created. The \"cosmetovigilance\" system has the three following objectives: public health concerns about \"at risk\" ingredients in cosmetic products: animal derivatives, glycol ethers, aluminium, camphor, etc; notification of adverse reactions: creation of standard reporting forms of adverse reactions; follow-up of laboratory quality controls: emergency and routine controls. The \"cosmetovigilance\" system is not only restricted to the study of adverse reactions occurring with cosmetic products. It will also address public health issues about ingredients and will rely on laboratory controls. The aim of the \"cosmetovigilance\" system is to investigate but also to prevent the risk of adverse reactions.","1803":"The academic interest for pharmacovigilance appears to be very low, because of the judged weakness of a \"significant\" relationship between drug utilisation and pathological events. We have tried to collect the relevant surveys of the French pharmacovigilance network on cutaneous toxic reactions to show the use of this work for current medical knowledge. This study was limited to the most relevant reports: 1--Cutaneous disorders induced by local reactions to ketoprofen, bufexamac, paracetamol (i.v.) 2--Cutaneous disorders observed in systemic hypersensitivity syndromes: allopurinol, chlormezanone, pristinamycine 3--Photosensitisation (toxicity), including: Individual characteristics of patients Nature of the observed syndromes Induction time and evolution of the disease Imputation and apparent incidence of the cases observed 1--Concerning \"contact\" dermitis, erythematous skin reactions are the most frequently observed. The causality link is proved in 272 patients of the cases. The mean age of the patients is 40-50 and the induction time from one to ten days. 2--In the hypersensitisation syndromes, severe skin reactions, combined with general reactions (fever), are the most frequently observed. The mean age is 50-60 and the number of serious cases is high (4.5%). 3--Severe burns with bullous skin reactions are observed in phototoxicity cases. The mean age of the patients is 50. Time induction is short (ten days), the cases are frequently serious, but evolution appears good. In conclusion, the synthesis of pharmacovigilance surveys shows the value of this epidemiological approach to drug-induced skin reactions. It is regrettable that the results of this work are not more widely distributed. ","1804":"Drug-induced cutaneous side-effects are very frequent. All dermatitis may be induced by drugs. It is difficult to identify the drug responsible because patients take many drugs (prescriptions, self medication). For each pathology, physicians may use assessment methods based on specific chronological criteria (challenge, dechallenge, rechallenge) and specific semeiological criteria (promoting factors, alternate non-drug related explications, specific laboratory tests) to identify the drug responsible.","1805":"","1806":"Drug skin tests can be of value in investigating cutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADR). Guidelines have been recently published for drug skin tests to standardize the management of patients suffering from CADR in European dermatological departments. Three sorts of drug skin tests can be performed, each investigating specific immunological mechanisms: delayed cellular hypersensitivity with patch tests (PT), immediate hypersensitivity with prick tests and both immediate or delayed hypersensitivity with intradermal tests (IDT). The mechanisms involved in inducing CADR are not well elucidated. The results of the drug skin tests depend on the drug and the mechanisms i.e. the clinical features of the CADR. 164 patients developed a CADR that could be attributed to one drug. After a patch test and a negative prick and intradermal test, positive drug skin tests were nevertheless obtained in 72% of the cases. Some urticarias are due to an immediate IgE related hypersensitivity; in such cases prick tests and IDT performed with sequential dilutions can have immediate positive results. Vasculitis is related to circulating immune complexes and cannot be reproduced by skin tests. Delayed cellular hypersensitivity is involved in inducing maculopapular rashes, Baboon syndrome, localized or generalized eczema or acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. In such CADR, drug PT or delayed positive reactions on IDT occur in more than 50% of the patients. Diluted drug patch tests can be positive in investigating drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms. As Stevens-Johnson and Lyell's syndromes are due to many both toxic and immunological mechanisms, drug skin tests are not of great value in investigating these severe CADR.","1807":"","1808":"Over the last 20 years, our understanding of cutaneous adverse drug reactions has improved, especially with regard to the management of affected patients. The pathophysiological mechanisms have been studied to improve our understanding. We report different clinical and histological features of cutaneous drug reactions to distinguish a non drug-induced rash from a cutaneous adverse drug reaction.","1809":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of organ oil on isolated heart function before and after ischemia and on the activity of cardiac antioxidant enzymes. 16 Wistar rats were divided into 2 groups; control group and treated group receiving 5 mL\/kg\/day of organ oil. After 8 weeks of treatment, hearts were perfused and subjected to a global ischemia followed by reperfusion. Activity of cardiac antioxidant enzymes was assessed in freeze-clamped hearts at the end of reperfusion. Results showed that organ oil induces: 1--damage to heart function during the preischemic period, 2--decreased functional recovery during reperfusion and 3--significant increase in catalase activity. It seems that, in our experimental conditions, organ oil increases heart sensitivity to ischemia and reperfusion. However, the mechanism involved has yet to be understood.","1810":"Rubus imperialis is a Brasilian medicinal plant which previously exhibited therapeutical perspectives. This work describes the antinociceptive action of methanolic extracts obtained from different parts of the plant (roots and branches) as well as hexane, chloroform and ethyl acetate fractions obtained from branches. Such extracts or fractions caused significative inhibition in the writhing test in mice at 10 mg\/kg, given intraperitoneally. They were more active than two reference drugs, aspirin and paracetamol. The fractions also exhibited antinociceptive activity in the writhing test when administered orally at 200 mg\/kg. When analyzed in the formalin test, the chloroform fraction was the most active, causing considerable inhibition against both neurogenic and inflammatory phases of pain.","1811":"The activity of methanolic extract from the seeds of Peganum harmala L. (MEP) on vascular smooth muscle (rat aorta) was investigated. MEP induced relaxation in aorta precontracted with noradrenaline (10(-6) M) or KCl (80 mM) (IC50 = 14.49 +\/- 1.15 and 5.93 +\/- 1.26 micrograms\/mL, respectively) in a dose-dependent manner and this relaxant effect was not endothelium-dependent. The vasodilatory effects were potentiated by isoprenaline (10(-9) M) (1.08 +\/- 0.14 micrograms\/mL) and negatively affected by a non-specific inhibitor of phosphodiesterase, IBMX (10(-4) M) (20.81 +\/- 1.06 micrograms\/mL). Pretreatment with MEP (3, 6, 18 micrograms\/ml) shifted the phenylephrine-induced dose-response curves to the right and the maximum response was attenuated, indicating that the antagonist effect of MEP on alpha 1-adrenoceptors was non-competitive. These results suggest that MEP exerts a vasodilatory effect not related to the presence of endothelium and the main mechanism may be related to the inhibition of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase.","1812":"The general practitioner plays an essential role in the rational strategy of drug-use by the quality of his prescription which translates the validity and the relevance of his pharmaceutical information. The objective of this work is to study the different means of pharmaceutical information used by general practitioners in the region of Sousse (Tunisia). We conducted a transversal, descriptive, exhaustive survey of 140 general practitioners in private (68) and public (72) practice during 1999. Data were collected through a questionnaire. This study, with a participation rate of 78%, showed that pharmaceutical dictionaries are the major source of information for 86% of general practitioners, that medical delegates have a positive image for 84% of them and that 36% of general practitioners do not subscribe to any medical journal. Thus, general practitioners are exposed to relatively unreliable pharmaceutical information coming generally from the pharmaceutical industry.","1813":"In our hospital, surgical antibioprophylaxis (ATBP) was too often administered too late, thus raising the infectious risk. Antibiotic stocks of the anaesthesia department were also systematically used, instead of nominal prescriptions of these drugs. The pharmacy could neither charge antibiotics to each surgical department nor quantify and differentiate ATBP from curative antibiotic therapy. The pharmacy and anaesthesia departments therefore set out to standardize surgical ATBP, in order to adapt this treatment to each surgical indication, and particularly in the case of allergy to beta-lactamase antibiotics (second line treatment kits). Consequently, prescription forms were developed and supplied to each surgery department, as well as ATBP kits. The kits were prepared and distributed by the pharmacy, and comprised boxes containing antibiotics in sufficient quantities to respect the protocols approved by the French Society of Anaesthesia and Resuscitation (SFAR). A protocol describing prescriptions, dispensation and administration has been presented to physicians and nurses. Fifteen surgical departments were included in our study and 30 different kits were prepared. From 1998 to 2001, 5586 surgical operations required administration of a kit (second line treatment kits in 5% of cases): 1848 (33%) in visceral surgery; 764 (13.8%) in urology; 802 (14%) in orthopaedics; 13 (0.2%) in vascular and thoracic surgery; 1236 (22%) in ear-nose-throat (ENT), periodontics and ophtalmology, and 923 (17%) in gynaecology and obstetrics. 93% of filled prescriptions forms were spontaneously returned to the pharmacy, the others were obtained during the renewal of kit stocks. The cost (over 4 years) of ATBP was quantified: 157,871 F for the 15 departments included, 26,123 F in visceral surgery, 13,520 F in urology, 73,741 F in orthopaedics, 569 F in vascular surgery, 39,720 F in ENT\/ophthalmology\/periodontics and 4,198 F in gynaecology and obstetrics. According to the Altemeier classification, 2226 class I, 3151 class II, and 209 class III surgical operations were performed. Since the kits have been brought into use, the committee for the protection against nosocomial infections (CLIN) has observed a reduction in the incidence of post-operative infections, according to the Altemeier classification: from 1.6% to 0.5% in class I, from 6.5% to 4.3% in class II, and from 11% to 8.5% in class III. The difference was statistically significant only for classes I (p &lt; 0.01) and II (p &lt; 0.001), and unchanged for class III (p = 0.3). No analysis was carried out for class IV (curative treatments). Both nurses and physicians have greatly appreciated the implementation of this organization. The advantage in terms of post-operative infections, administration exhaustiveness and stock management is obvious. The prescribed kits were systematically appropriate for the surgical interventions. In orthopaedics, cefamandole was used over 24 h (188 kits) in ligament plasty and osteotomy, or for 48 h (499 kits) in prosthetic surgery; 24 amoxicillin\/clavulanic acid (first line) and 9 clindamycin\/gentamicin (second line) single dose kits have been prescribed in traumatic indications. In ophthalmology, kits were only prescribed in endophtalmitis (24 ofloxacin\/fosfomycin single amount kits), implant replacement or cornea graft (1076 ofloxacin 24 h kits) and cataract surgery in diabetic patients (12 ofloxacin single amount kits). In ENT and periodontics, 124 surgical operations required cefazolin single dose kits. In vascular surgery, 5 pefloxacin\/gentamicin 48 h kits and 1 amoxicillin\/clavulanic acid 48 h kit were used in contaminated limb amputation, 1 cefamandole 48 h kit in class I surgery and 1 vancomycin 24 h kit (betalactamase antibiotic allergy); in thoracic surgery, 1 cefamandole 24 h kit was used for a thoracic wound. In visceral surgery, 9 different kits have been used, depending on the opening (class II) or not (class I) of the digestive tract. 797 cefazolin (first line) and 68 clindamycin\/gentamicin (second line) single dose kits were used in class I surgery, and 689 amoxicillin\/clavulanic acid single dose (SD) kits in class II surgery. Specific protocols consisted of 18 ceftriaxone\/metronidazole and 48 metronidazole\/gentamicin SD kits in oesophagus surgery, 11 ceftriaxone and 17 gentamicin SD kits in biliary endoscopy, 137 metronidazole SD kits in proctology and 34 amoxicillin\/gentamicin 6 h kits for prevention of endocarditis. In urology, 133 cefotaxime and 20 pefloxacin\/gentamicin SD kits were precribed in renal lithiasis, 102 amoxicillin\/clavulanic acid SD kits in cystectomy, 27 amoxicillin\/gentamicin 6 h kits in endocarditis prevention and 58 cefamandole SD kits in all other indications. In gynaecology and obstetrics, 534 cefazoline and 19 clindamycin\/gentamicin (second line) SD kits were used, and 370 doxycyclin SD kits were prescribed in pregnancy termination. Some departments (orthopaedics and visceral surgery) adapted the protocols to their needs, specifically with regard to treatment duration. However, these situations were quickly corrected. A constant follow-up and update of this system, associated with routine audits, should allow the maintenance and possibly the improvement of these results, hence shortening treatment duration.","1814":"","1815":"","1816":"","1817":"","1818":"","1819":"","1820":"","1821":"","1822":"Methylphenidate (Ritalin) is the only psychostimulant approved in France and indicated in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children over 6 years. It is under restricted prescription and distribution conditions. As such, it requires a hospital initiated prescription from either a neurology, psychiatry or pediatric specialist and it is covered by the \"narcotics\" schedule. The French Pharmacovigilance database spontaneous adverse drug reactions reporting, since it was approved in 1995, were analyzed. 21 adverse drug reactions were reported. In 16 cases, methylphenidate was suspected. They were generally non-serious, mild side effects and in most cases promptly resolved. These results do not suggest methylphenidate misuse in France or an overuse in between 1300 and 4000 treated children, to date. Until more information is available concerning the long-term effects of methylphenidate, and in order to limit misuse, inappropriate or overuse, the current prescription and dispensing regulation should be maintained in France, and could well be developed in other countries.","1823":"An institutional pharmacovigilance specialist gives advice only when consulted by a prescribing physician about a pregnant woman. The situation may involve a pregnant woman for whom a prescription may be considered or a pregnant woman for whom a prescription has been given. The aim is to evaluate the risk for the fetus, both before and after the fact. In view of recent decisions by the Cour de Cassation (*) which imposed penalties for preventing a woman exposed to a teratogenic risk from resorting to an abortion by providing her with inapropriate information, we are suggesting here the hypothesis that an institutional pharmacovigilance specialist acting as a consultant could be implicated. However, this hypothesis is purely academic. If action were taken to render a pharmacovigilance specialist liable, it is in fact the State that would have to answer.","1824":"A growing body of evidence supports the hypothesis that exposure to prenatal environmental risk factors increases the vulnerability for a broad range of psychiatric disorders. Although the association between exposure to obstetric complications and increased vulnerability for psychiatric disorders is well documented, few studies have explored the putative deleterious impact of psychoactive substances and xenoestrogens on subsequent liability for psychological disturbances. Cohort studies suggest that prenatal exposure to nicotine is a risk factor for conduct disorders, and some case-control studies have reported an association between prenatal nicotine exposure and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Studies on the long-term behavioural consequences of prenatal exposure to other licit and illicit psychoactive substances are hampered by methodological flaws limiting the interpretation of the findings. Regarding prenatal exposure to hormones, sparse findings suggest that exposure to xenoestrogens such as diethylstilbestrol may be a risk factor for psychiatric disorders, mediated by a deleterious impact of these substances on the foetal neurodevelopment. However, this hypothesis is largely speculative due to the low number of studies and their methodological limitations. Further studies are required to explore the long-term cognitive and behavioural consequences of prenatal exposure to psychoactive drugs and xenoestrogens.","1825":"Various epidemiologic designs permit an evaluation of drug teratogenicity, but none is sufficient to establish the risk. Only concordance of results of several studies lead a substance to be considered teratogenic. The usual designs of analytical epidemiology can be used: prospective studies of total populations, case-control, cohort. Case series may be useful when no good epidemiologic study is available. Most of those published were collected by teratogen information services (TISs). These series of exposures are not representative samples of the general population, and when interpreting the pregnancy outcomes, it is difficult to define an unexposed group for comparison. In practice, if 50 pregnancies are reported with early exposure to a given drug and without unwanted effects, one can exclude a strong teratogenic effect, and reassure a woman inadvertently exposed. TISs have published several of such exposure series, and they are often used. On the contrary, if the question arises whether or not to prescribe a drug to a woman in early pregnancy, a much larger sample of pregnancy with known outcomes is needed to answer \"yes\": this is a situation of population risk assessment, because one would give the same answer to all similar questions, which may be many. Birth-defect monitoring systems are in a better position to do this and several examples can be given (valproate and spina bifida, corticosteroids and orofacial clefts).","1826":"A high-performance liquid chromatographic method has been developed for the determination of eight antiretroviral drugs (amprenavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, efavirenz and nevirapine) in a single run. After a liquid-liquid extraction with diethylether, the antiretroviral drugs are separated on a Stability RP18 column eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile and phosphate buffer (50 mM pH 5.65). A sequential ultraviolet detection allowed for simultaneous quantitation of antiretroviral drugs (240, 215, 260 nm). Calibration curves were linear in the range 100-10,000 ng\/ml. The limit of quantitation was 50 ng\/ml for all drugs except for nevirapine (100 ng\/ml). The accuracies ranged from 88.2% to 110.9% and both inter- and intra-day coefficients of variation were lower than 11%. The extraction recoveries were higher than 62%. This method is simple and shows good specificity with respect to commonly coprescribed drugs.","1827":"Type 4 phosphodiesterases (PDE4) belong to a superfamily of at least 11 isozymes catalyzing the hydrolysis of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and\/or cyclic GMP (cGMP). PDE4 regulate intracellular levels of cAMP and are the predominant PDE expressed in inflammatory cells. Elevation of cAMP produces the inhibition of different inflammatory processes, such as cellular trafficking, cytokine release or reactive oxygen species production. But recent papers showed that the involvement of PDE4 in inflammatory mechanisms cannot be completely attributed to a cAMP-dependent pathway. The wide range of inflammatory mechanisms controlled by PDE4 designated these enzymes as a good target for anti-inflammatory compounds. PDE4 inhibitors have been demonstrated to be very potent in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but their therapeutic window has yet to be improved.","1828":"This study aimed at evaluating the role of nitric oxide (NO) when generated 24 h prior to ischemia-reperfusion. Three groups were studied in an isolated buffer-perfused heart model: Control (saline = 3.3 mL\/kg, n = 10), the precursor of NO, L-arginine, (500 mg\/kg, n = 10) and an inhibitor of NO synthase, L-NAME, (10 mg\/kg, n = 9). All groups were injected intraperitoneally 24 h before heart extraction. Nitrites, nitrates (an index of nitric oxide release) and cardiac troponine I were assayed. During the reperfusion period, there was a low release of nitric oxide and cardiac troponine I associated with improved recovery of post-ischemic myocardial function. These results indicate that in this model, the pre-treatment improved myocardial function and thus, NO could play a role as a trigger and not as a mediator of cardioprotection.","1829":"Arachidonic acid metabolism-derived products are key mediators of angiotensin II-mediated vascular effects. The modulatory effect of cyclooxygenase derived products--in particular thromboxane A2 and prostaglandin H2--in angiotensin II-mediated vascular effects is well established. In contrast, few studies have assessed the involvement of lipoxygenase-derived products in the vascular effects of angiotensin II. Cysteinyl leukotrienes (5-lipoxygenase-derived products) and 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (12-HETE) (12-lipoxygenase-derived products) are potent proinflammatory and vasomotor mediators. Their biosynthesis is increased in various models of hypertension. In addition, compelling evidence has suggested that they might contribute to the vasoconstrictor, hypertrophic and mitogenic effects of angiotensin II. The demonstration of their contribution to angiotensin II-mediated vascular effects may explain, at least in part, the vascular inflammatory complications associated with hypertension.","1830":"In China, increasing emphasis has been laid in recent years on research on natural products. About 140 new drugs have been developed from Chinese medicinal plants. For example, anisodamine possesses good effects in the treatment of septic shock and morphine addiction; 3-n-butylphthalide isolated from seeds of celery was shown to be a new cerebral anti-ischemic agent; indirubin was identified as an anti-leukemic drug with no inhibition of bone marrow; huperzine is a potent and reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and its selective action is superior to that of donepezil; clausenamide was shown to be a potassium channel blocker, its nootropic effect was 50-100 times more potent than that of piracetam; bicyclol was synthesized from schizandrin C isolated from Fructus schizandrae. It has remarkable hepatoprotective and certain anti-hepatitis virus actions; salvianolic acid B is a very strong antioxidant agent with potential anti-dementia effects; yingzhaosu A and artemisinin are anti-malaria drugs containing a peroxide ring which is very rarely seen in natural substances.","1831":"Tacrolimus is a calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppressant that has been widely used in the last decade. The recommended doses and therapeutic ranges have changed from the beginning because now new combinations of immunosuppressants are used and the tendency is to maintain low tacrolimus levels in order to avoid undesirable side effects. As there is a great pharmacokinetic variability between patients we have a pediatric liver transplant protocol to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) in order to avoid over-immunosuppression in patients with risk of lymphoproliferative disorder. We have studied the influence of hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) on tacrolimus requirements in patients with kidney transplant, and we observed that HCV+ patients need lower tacrolimus doses to maintain the same level as HCV-patients. These studies clearly contribute to improving drug effectiveness and thus to achieving an adequate immunosuppressive therapy.","1832":"The immunosuppressive drug sirolimus, recently licensed in Europe for use following kidney transplantation, was developed against a background in which it was common practice to use blood concentration measurements as a guide to therapy. This article sets out to document the use of blood concentration measurements in the assessment of the early and pivotal clinical trials of the drug and the attention that has been paid to the validation of analytical techniques used to measure the drug. It is concluded that, building on experience from the older drugs used for immunosuppression, data relating drug concentrations with efficacy outcomes have played a significant role in formulating guidelines on sirolimus dosing.","1833":"There is currently no effective therapy available for Creutz-feldt-Jakob disease. However, a limited number of drugs such as polyanions, the amyloid-binding dye Congo red, amphotericin B anthracyclines, dapsone, beta sheet breaker peptides, porphyrines and phtalocyanines have been found to delay the appearance of the clinical signs in experimental prion diseases. Today, the most promising agent would appear to be a less toxic derivative of amphotericin B, MS-8209. Indeed this compound has a wide spectrum of anti-prion activity and is the only molecule capable of prolonging survival time when treatment is performed in the late stages of infection. This result represents an important step forward in therapeutical approaches of prion diseases and justifies the development of new polyene antibiotic derivatives.","1834":"Supplements, frequently containing vitamins, are often taken to try to compensate for an unhealthy life style or in an attempt to maximise health or performance. As illustrated by vitamin E, fundamental issues on both the efficacy and safety of the chronic use of relatively high dosages of vitamins still need to be resolved. To recommend the application of vitamin supplements, firstly the gaps in our knowledge on these fundamental issues should be filled. Secondly, objective and scientifically sound information should be given to the public. Via diverse sources there is an uncontrolled supply of vitamins. Educating the consumer on vitamins is therefore the only way to come to a rational use of vitamin supplements in self medication.","1835":"Self-medication with analgesics is common and accepted and even recommended by health systems in order to avoid reimbursement. Self-medication, nevertheless, is not an easy task, since making choices is difficult for patients on the basis of the available standard information. Guiding information for patients has to be improved, but also physicians need to be trained how to handle self-medication of their patients. Special attention should be paid to the approval of combination analgesics for the treatment of headache and migraine. There were two major points of discussion during the last decades: possible risks of nephropathy and possible drug-induced overuse. According to a very recent evaluation, analgesic-associated nephropathy appears to have been primarily caused by phenacetin rather than any other single or combination analgesics. Analgesic-induced overuse is also caused by the psychotropic actions of phenacetin in presentations providing rapid absorption, such as powders, rather than by other analgesics or caffeine.","1836":"With regard to the risk of reproductive or developmental toxicity, the regulatory decisions to allow clinical trials in humans or the marketing of a new drug are based almost entirely on animal data. This is not the case for other types of toxicity for which the preclinical data are supported by data from clinical trials. Whilst animal studies have been remarkably successful in the detection of reproductive toxicology over the last 40 years, they are not infallible. The efficacy of animal experimentation is largely dependent on the selection of appropriate animal models. Progress in the study of teratogenic mechanisms, comparative physiology, developmental biology and pharmacokinetics will hopefully continue to bring about more economical and effective uses of animals. Nevertheless, owing to the limitations of animal models, the monitoring of human births unfortunately remains an essential defence in the detection and early prevention of chemical-induced birth defects.","1837":"Safety Pharmacology is now specified by various European and international guidelines. The ICHS7A text, which has now been implemented, requires all new compounds to be tested before any administration in humans. The compound should be evaluated under GLPs for its potential effects on so-called vital functions (cardio-vascular, respiratory and central nervous system). Also, the potential risk for QT prolongation and Torsades de Pointes should be appropriately assessed using in vitro and in vivo models (CPMP\/986\/96 and draft ICHS7B) before the initiation of Phase I. Various other European or international guidelines relate to more specific evaluations: abuse liability, anti-osteoporotic compounds, etc. Safety Pharmacology should also, as other studies required for regulatory submission, be conform to the electronic records and signature constraints (CFR23 part 11 for the USA) and to the format of the Common Technical Document (ICHM4). To address all these requirements, the pharmaceutical industry should now be creating specially assigned Safety Pharmacology teams.","1838":"","1839":"","1840":"","1841":"","1842":"","1843":"Within the framework of an early drug access programme launched in 1995, a multicentre open study was initiated in France in order to assess, inter alia, the safety of riluzole (50 mg twice a day) in a total of 2069 patients from 28 centres. This programme, a phase IIIb study with direct individual benefit, had two main objectives: to enable patients to receive riluzole therapy pending regulatory approval and commercial availability and to provide further data on the safety of riluzole in a broader ALS population. The most frequent adverse events related to riluzole treatment were: asthenia, nausea and elevation of serum transaminase levels. These observations, similar to data derived from previous pivotal clinical trials, confirm that riluzole has a satisfactory tolerability profile.","1844":"This text is a history of the early development of clinical pharmacology in France in the 60s and 70s. It relates the obstacles that needed to be surmounted to impose clinical trials, pharmacovigilance, therapeutic drug monitoring. It follows the evolution of regulations, and the constitution of a new hospital and academic discipline. This study shows the obstacles raised by an established medical tradition against a change in paradigm towards a scientific approach to the evaluation and clinical use of drugs. It relates a crucial moment of the history of French pharmacology, when French medicine entered the modern era.","1845":"A French nation-wide pharmacovigilance survey of ketoprofen topic collated, from September 1996 to August 2000, 770 cutaneous side-effects. The frequency varies from 0.013@1000 to 0.028@1000 according to the commercial gel. Analysis concerns spontaneous notifications of French nation-wide pharmacovigilance. Sex ratio is well distributed, population is young. Treatment lasted about 12 days, the side-effects appearing after about 13 days, 25 per cent of cases are delayed to discontinuance of treatment, mainly after exposure to sunlight. Co-administered drugs are in most cases systemic or topical NSAIDs and\/or fibrates and then increase the seriousness of the iatrogenic pathology. 75 per cent of cutaneous side-effects appear in summer, 50 per cent have been reported as \"photosensitivity\". Reactions are severe in 30 per cent of the cases. More than 80 per cent of cases present an extension beyond the site of application. The course is usually favourable and neither topical nor systemic corticosteroid treatment influence the duration of evolution. Photopatchtests testing in 23 per cent of cases show evidence of photoallergy to ketoprofen and crossed photoallergy with tiaprofenic acid, fenofibrate, oxybenzone and benzophenone. These results confirm that photoallergy is due to the common benzoylketone structure but not to their arylpropionic function. Some cases of persistent or recurrent photosensitivity must be more explored. The results lead to request a modification of marketing authorizations.","1846":"Endoscopic operations in the genitourinary tract require the use of an irrigating fluid containing glycine 1.5% and expose patients to adverse events in relation with the absorption of that irrigating fluid, summarized as \"transurethral resection reactions\" (TURP syndrome). Intra and extra vascular absorption are now well described. The uptake of 1000 ml of fluid corresponds to an acute decrease in the serum sodium concentration of 5-8 mmol.l-1 and give poor clinical signs. This is the volume above which the risk of absorption-related symptoms is statistically increased. Dilutional hyponatraemia and toxicity of glycine and\/or its metabolites explain the clinical symptoms. Hyponatraemia and the osmotic gap assess the diagnosis of TUR syndrome. There is a threat to life and a knowledge of an adequate management is essential. Ethanol monitoring is an non invasive method to prevent and detect early irrigating fluid absorption.","1847":"The aim of the study was to assess the impact of an individual patient order form which concerned the 21 most costly antibiotics in a university hospital. Antibiotics expenditures were monitored from 1995 to 1999 and were expressed in 1999 French Francs per 100 patient days (p.d.). The time series were analyzed by auto-regressive models. The trend of antibiotics expenditures which were concerned by the individual patient order form was a yearly increase of 50 FF\/100 p.d. (p &lt; 0.01). The individual patient order form had no significant impact on global antibiotics expenditures but there were some differences across departments: antibiotics costs decreased 1.293 FF\/100 p.d. (p = 0.02) in intensive care departments. Monitoring antibiotics consumption should be continued in order to increase power of analysis and to assess the impact of the implementation of guidelines.","1848":"Since March 1999, desirudin (REVASC), a recombinant hirudin, has been used in Nancy to treat patients who undergo total hip or knee replacement with a high risk of thromboembolic complications. We carried out a retrospective study using clinical data on the first 15 consecutive patients treated with desirudin to find out prescription motivations, type of shift (indirect anticoagulants or low-molecular-weight-heparin) and evolution. They all had a high risk of deep vein thrombosis (thrombophily, obesity, history of thromboembolic events). Some of this patients would have been excluded of the studies which permitted desirudin to be approved. In this study, we found no thromboembolic complications. The only striking facts are one bleeding complication (after difficult surgery) and one pulmonary embolism (2 months later).","1849":"","1850":"The objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness ratio of HAART in the treatment of HIV infection. Two random samples were extracted from the database of the Rothschild Public Hospital, and patients were matched for age, sex and T4 cell counts: a first sample selected in 1996\/97 of HAART treated patients (CAS group) and a second sample selected in 1994\/95 of non-HAART treated patients (CONTROL group). Immune recovery and use of resources data were extracted and analyzed over two years for 196 included patients. Mean T4 cell count after two years was higher among CAS patients (344\/mm3 vs. 234\/mm3; p &lt; 0.0001). CAS patients recorded a supplementary cost of antiretroviral treatments (+171%; p &lt; 0.0001) balanced by savings in other drugs expenses (-62%; p = 0.0560) and in hospitalizations (-25%; NS). Overall, CAS patients presented a 15% (NS) lower medical cost than CONTROL patients.","1851":"","1852":"","1853":"The adrenolytic agent, Op'DDD (Mitotane) has been employed for almost 50 years for treatment of Cushing's syndrome. Despite clinical observations of elevation of hepatic enzymes encountered in patients taking the drug, there are few published data regarding the frequency, time course and factors that might influence hepatic toxicity of Mitotane. We analysed 10 patients consecutively treated with Mitotane for Cushing's syndrome. We measured hepatic transaminase and gamma glutamyl transferase before, during and after treatment. The study population included 6 women and 4 males, with a mean age of 41 years. Seven patients presented Cushing's disease while two had adrenal tumours and one had an undetermined origin of Cushing's syndrome. After a progressive increase, patients were being treated with a mean dosage of 9 g per day. All patients had elevation of either GGT or ALAT and all but one had elevation of transaminase (the maximum increase was sixfold the basal value). The only variable correlated with hepatic increase was the body mass index. In contrast, the severity of the disease, alcohol intake, and other biological characteristics were not correlated with transaminase elevations. We conclude that transaminase increase is encountered in the vast majority of patients treated with Mitotane. Levels at which the drug should be withdrawn remain to be established.","1854":"Cases of adverse drug reactions which occurred in the elderly, and were notified to the Regional Centre of Pharmacovigilance of Angers between 1995 and 1998, were analysed in two subgroups: from 75- to 84-years-old and older than 84 years. Among the 263 cases recorded in the elderly, there was no significant difference between the 75- to 84-year-old patients (180 cases) and the patients older than 84 years (83 cases) concerning past medical history, severity of effects or medication. Side-effects in patients over 74 were mainly cutaneous, haematological and neuropsychiatric, involving in decreasing order of frequency cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric, antibiotic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs. In comparison with patients under 75, adverse drug reactions are more frequent and more serious, notably overdose and drug interactions, in elderly people. The occurrence of some avoidable side-effects justifies the strengthening of information about therapeutic safety in the elderly.","1855":"This study was conducted in a haematological paediatric department and was aimed at evaluating drug medication errors. Their frequency was studied, but also and mainly their degree of severity and preventability. Only adverse drug events that were identified as possibly due to pharmacological properties of drugs or medication errors were collected. An original method was used, based on a multidimensional mathematical tool, called Factorial Analysis of Multiple Correspondences (FAMC), in order to assess the grade of severity and preventability for each adverse drug event. A total of 155 adverse drug events were detected for 34 out of 52 patients hospitalized during the study period. The prevalence rate was 65 per cent and among these adverse drug events, 16 per cent were serious and 53 per cent were avoidable. Apart from the fact that the FAMC helped to determine the grade of preventability, FAMC allowed one to demonstrate that allergy and medication errors were the most avoidable adverse drug events. In this way the method used was validated. This study permitted the assessment of drug medication errors in this department and helped to choose the priorities for the management of preventive actions.","1856":"","1857":"","1858":"","1859":"","1860":"","1861":"","1862":"","1863":"A prospective study was done to test the efficacy of 5-fluorouracil (topical and systemic) in multiple and unresectable histologically proven facial squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) secondary to XP. Twelve patients (7M\/5F, mean age 19.8 years) with multiple facial SCC were treated between 1994 and 1997. 5-FU was used as a twice-a-day local application in the documented areas, by continuous infusion associated with cisplatin (2 patients) and short infusion combined with folic acid (3 patients). Evaluation was done by clinical examination every two months for topical therapy and after every cycle for systemic treatment. Median treatment duration was 12 months (2 to 36 months). Treatment was well tolerated excluding episodes of pruritus in the treated areas. We observed mainly superficial tumour regression followed by dryness and crusting. In 5 cases, we performed biopsies after treatment showing in one case an extensive fibrosis with absence of tumour. However in the remaining 4 cases, despite a superficial reduction of tumour and a reconstitution of the epidermis, viable and unmodified squamous cell carcinoma remained in the deeper dermis. In the 5 patients treated by systemic 5-FU, we observed 1 complete response and 3 partial responses. Despite a dissociation between a good cosmetic result and a relatively superficial effect, topical 5-FU represents a useful therapeutic option in multiple unresectable facial SCC in patients with XP. Systemic chemotherapy is recommended in the event of more extended or profound lesions.","1864":"Analysis of 22,510 urinary calculi between January 1991 to July 2000 performed by infrared spectroscopy allows for separation of drug-induced urolithiasis into two categories: first, the drugs physically embedded in the stone (n = 238; 1.0 per cent), notably indinavir monohydrate (n = 126; 52.9 per cent), followed by triamterene (n = 43; 18.1 per cent), sulphonamides (n = 29; 12.2 per cent) and amorphous silica (n = 24; 10.1 per cent); second, the category of metabolic nephrolithiasis induced by drugs (n = 140; 0.6 per cent), involving mainly calcium and vitamin D supplementation (n = 56; 40.0 per cent) and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (n = 33; 23.6 per cent). Composition of the stone depended not only on the inducer drug but also on the metabolic state of the patient. Today, drug-induced stones comprise about 1.6 per cent of all calculi in France. Physical analysis and therapeutic history recall of such patients are the keys to diagnosis. Medical care is based on drug avoidance or dose adjustment with increased diuresis and, if necessary, change in urinary pH.","1865":"The inappropriate use of BCG vaccine could be followed by adverse events (AE). In order to know their frequency and type, we evaluated the spontaneous reports of misuses (MS) and overdosages (OV) over a 4-year period. One hundred and twenty-six notifications were collected; 109 concerned MS, 13 OV, and 4 concerned both MS and OV. We recorded a high number (97) of MS related to the injection of a BCG vaccine instead of a tuberculin test (TT). Among the 126 initial notifications, 122 cases of AE were reported, 107 after an MS, 11 after an OV and 4 after both MS and OV. The most common AE were related to injection-site reactions which were in fact expected reactions when BCG is used under correct conditions. In half of the cases systemic signs were associated. The most common were asthenia, fever and lymphadenopathy. Seven cases related to MS were considered as serious according to the ICH definition. Six of them recovered, for one the outcome was unknown. It appeared that perhaps the presentation of the products BCG vaccine and TT could play a role in contributing to this inappropriate use. Both presentations contain 10 doses but there are significant differences in colours used and in specific instructions. Despite the fact that the AE reported after an MS and\/or an OV represented the one-third of the total notifications recorded with the BCG vaccine over the 4-year period under review, they have to be considered in light of the 170 million doses distributed in 150 countries. We have to consider the possibility of under reporting because of the delicacy of incorrect administration and differences in pharmacovigilance structures worldwide. Even if the number of AE is low, MS and OV should be reported and documented for good pharmacovigilance surveillance.","1866":"We carried out a retrospective analysis of 1500 forensic autopsies following sudden unexpected cardiac death. This analysis showed a group of 43 cases that could have been related to surgery and\/or anaesthesia. Pathological examination revealed the existence of cardiac lesions in 40 cases: arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (14 cases), coronary artery disease (9 cases), cardiomyopathy (8 cases), structural abnormalities of the His bundle (7 cases), mitral valve prolapse (1 case) and acute myocarditis (1 case). These disorders are compatible with a paroxysmal (rhythmic) phenomenon at the origin of the cardiac arrest. Identification of the cause of death in a patient who was presumed to be at low risk may provide major relief to the patient's family and the medical staff.","1867":"Severe adverse reactions (ADR) are uncommon and benefits of drug treatment usually outweigh the disadvantages. Definitions and guidelines for managing adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are proposed mainly with the aim of helping to keep the possibility of ADR at the front of our minds and making the right diagnosis. As spontaneous reporting is a cornerstone in post-marketing surveillance, the reasons for under-reporting are thoroughly analysed. Finally, a reminder is given that communication of information should be encouraged within the medical community and that everyone who is involved in the treatment of patients has an active part to play in the network of pharmacovigilance.","1868":"Where do analgics come from? If their ancestors are many centuries old, we observe that the four main drugs of modern analgesia, morphine (1816), codeine (1832), paracetamol (1893) and aspirin (1897) were discovered during the 19th century. And through what 'sagas'! The first known prescriptions, written on earthenware shelves in Mesopotamia 3 centuries BC, already mentioned medications derived from willow to cure headaches. The Greeks dedicated to Asclepios, god of therapeutics, a statue carved in a willow trunk as a symbol! Thus, before becoming a drug, aspirin was born from the willow, which grows with its feet in water 'without suffering', as the ancestors put it. But before it walked on the moon with Neil Armstrong in 1969, the discovery of aspirin as a drug was the consequence of the filial love of a young researcher, Felix Hoffmann, who wanted to decrease the resistant pain of his rheumatic old father.","1869":"We describe here our own experience in creating a regional multidisciplinary network made up of health professionals involved in the treatment of pain. The rationale, aims, difficulty already experienced and still expected, and the results are discussed.","1870":"This national survey aims to evaluate opioid availability and prescription by pharmacists in Tunisia and to examine pharmacists' attitude regarding Tunisian law. We surveyed a sample of 300 pharmacists randomly selected from the National Council of Pharmacists list and using the random table. This study started in September 1999 by sending to pharmacists a confidential questionnaire asking about the importance, the rate of sale and the availability of analgesics in their pharmacy. It also tried to determine pharmacists' opinions regarding Tunisian law. A total of 157 pharmacists out of 300 responded to the survey (52 per cent), 95 per cent were working in pharmacies and 15 per cent in hospitals. Analgesics were estimated to be important to very important in their work in 84 per cent and less important in 16 per cent of cases. They were given under advice with great importance in 85 per cent of cases and with less importance in 15 per cent of cases. Analgesic self-medication was frequent in 95 per cent of cases and rare in 4 per cent of cases. Analgesics of levels 1 and 2 were often to always available in 97 per cent of cases and rarely available in 1.5 per cent of cases. Some 84.7 per cent of pharmacists had opioid supplies and 8.9 per cent had no opioids in stock and 6.4 per cent hadn't given a response. 30 per cent of pharmacists think that the 7 days law for opioid prescription should be modified and 66 per cent think it should not, fearing illicit use, fraud and dependance. Pharmacists think that the minimal list of opioids to be stocked in a pharmacy is sufficient because of low demand.","1871":"The interest in the topic of pain in children is increasing within the paediatric community after a long period of misrecognition, often under-valuation, sometimes negligent or even denial. A lack of knowledge concerning pharmacology and toxicity of antalgic drugs and poorly adapted galenic presentations induced delay and complications in their use in children. The recent progress is supported by a better semiology, development of adequate pain scales, availability of adapted drugs, an effort at education of caregivers and public sensitization. In primary care the objective is to lead the practitioner to identify and consider pain in his\/her preventive and curative strategies. In hospitals efforts are needed to improve the use of protocols and evaluations, the systematic practice of preventive analgesia and the quality of interprofessional cooperation within care teams. Managed care organizations are today an effective system to promote these practices.","1872":"Pain is the first consultation motive everywhere in the world. Modern medicine consider the fight against pain as a true challenge, and analgia has today become a real ethical imperative. The concept of chronic pain as a true disease, first described by Leriche, has given rise to Pain Centers. Pain Centers allow a multidisciplinary approach, meticulous evaluation with scales of pain and finally global management of the patient with chronic pain.","1873":"The treatment of chronic pain uses drugs from different pharmacological classes. Analgesics are the common basis of these treatments. Peripheral analgesics (or minor analgesics such as paracetamol) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are used for moderate pain (grade I of WHO). Major analgesics, opioids, are used for more severe pain (grades II and III). When pain can be related to a precise cause or location, more specific drugs may be used. This is done in migraine, facial pain, muscular spasms, dental pain, local inflammation. Chronic pain of grades II and III is treated with opioids. According to the severity, agents of different powers are used: partial agonists, full agonists of receptors OP3 (mu) and OP2 (kappa). According to other pathological signs linked to pain, coanalgesic drugs may be used in association: psychotropic drugs, either psycholeptic drugs which act synergistically with analgesics and bring their own effects, anxiolytic and\/or neuroleptic, or anti-depressants which inhibit the depression state that may be associated with pain. Corticosteroids are also very useful for the numerous effects they induce: inhibition of the inflammation process, CNS stimulation, analgesics in medullary, or plexus compressions and in elevations of intracranial hypertension. Moreover their metabolic effects may be useful in cachectic states. The pharmacological treatment of chronic pain of grades II and III poses the problem of chronic administration of increasing doses of opioids and of their coprescription, of acquired tolerance, of dependence and of toxicity induced by drug accumulation.","1874":"","1875":"The aim of this study was to estimate the level of scientific evidence contributed by randomized clinical trials in rheumatologic indication of spa therapy. A literature search was made of computer data banks, with analysis of 20 randomized hydrotherapy trials. On the 20 identified randomized hydrotherapy trials, four were carried out double-blind; nine included a comparison of inter-groups evolution. The indications assessed are chronic low back pain, osteoarthritis of the knee and hip joints, osteoarthritis of fingers, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis arthritis. The results suggest durable, persisting improvement several months after balneological care, in accordance with the following evaluation criteria: pain, handicap, quality of life, consumption of analgesics and of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It was concluded that randomized evaluations, demonstrating a beneficial and prolonged clinical effect of balneologic treatments, exist in respect of the main indications for rheumatologic hydrotherapy. These results acknowledge the medical help given by hydrotherapy within the aforesaid parameters, to which may be added a reduction of the adverse gastrointestinal events of NSAIDs. Evaluation needs to be continued to clarify the medical benefit offered by rheumatologic hydrotherapy.","1876":"We studied the ASA pharmacokinetics of single doses of 500 mg and 1000 mg of D,L-lysine-monoacetylsalicylate (Lys-ASA) administered both orally (Delgesic) and 500 mg parenterally (Aspisol) as well as 500 mg acetylsalicylate (ASA, Aspirin) in 13 healthy volunteers. Blood samples were taken before and at defined times up to 48 h after application of Lys-ASA and ASA. Analysis for ASA and its metabolite salicylic acid were performed by HPLC. All concentration versus time data were presented descriptively. As far as ASA was concerned, differences were assessed by means of ANOVA according to Friedman including post hoc Wilcoxon tests for each time point. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated based on a one-compartment model. The concentration vs. time curves after oral intake of 500 mg of ASA and Lys-ASA differed significantly (p &lt; 0.001). Peak serum ASA concentrations (Cmax) were 6.8 mg\/l for oral Lys-ASA and 2.7 mg\/l for ASA per os. The corresponding tmax-values were 14.2 and 38.0 min. Absolute bioavailabilities for 500 mg doses were 75.4 and 63.4 pour cent, respectively. After intake of 100 mg and 1000 mg oral doses of Lys-ASA Cmax was 2.7 mg\/l and 15.9 mg\/l, tmax being 14.2 min for the 1000 mg dose. The shortest half-life was found after i.v. injection with 7.5 min. Metabolism was fast with maximum rise of salicylic acid concentration after injection of Lys-ASS. We conclude that concerning time dimension oral administration of Lys-ASA is almost equivalent to i.v. Lys-ASA and may be an alternative for i.v. administration in cases of acute heart attacks.","1877":"Pharmacokinetic studies in neonates are essential because of maturational changes in physiological functions during this period. International harmonization conferences have established guidelines for such studies, including recommendations on age ranges to be studied and description of methods and study design. Multiple blood sampling to obtain a full pharmacokinetic profile cannot be proposed in neonates. Population pharmacokinetic analysis, with minimal sampling schemes, is more appropriate but involves more subjects than the traditional approach. Population pharmacokinetic analysis also focuses on the influence of individual factors on pharmacokinetic parameters. Most studies performed with neonates have involved drugs with a narrow safety margin and cleared by renal or metabolic routes to study the impact of immaturity on drug concentrations and on clinical effects.","1878":"Selenium is an essential trace element. In the form of selenocysteine, an amino acid, selenium is necessary for the activity of important enzymes (i.e. glutathione peroxidases, thioredoxin reductase). In the periodic table of the elements, selenium belongs to the same column as oxygen. In fact, seleno-enzymes have an important role in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species, especially peroxides and hydroperoxides. In septic and septic-like shock patients, reactive oxygen species, particularly peroxides, play an important role through their destructive actions, which are favourable as critical components of microbial destruction and also deleterious in excessive generation. This excessive generation results in tissue damage. Moreover, reactive oxygen species modulate the activation of important intracellular mediators (NF kappa B activation, arachidonic acid cascade). Simultaneously in patients with severe infection, there is a marked and early plasma selenium decrease. Redistribution due to selective selenium uptake for metabolic use could be one of the main mechanisms for this decrease. This review was carried out by questioning on the one hand the Medline database, by consulting the reviews and works available in the services of biology, biochemistry and pharmacy, by a prospective follow-up on the subject in Current Contents, but also thanks to library searches carried out by Aguettant laboratories. Several supplementary studies at various doses (from 140 to 1000 micrograms\/day sodium selenite) have been conducted, though only on small groups of patients and with a questionable design. Selenium treatment seem to be promising in severely septic patients. However, in the absence of pertinent clinical data, only the administration of doses below adverse effect levels, staying within physiological limits, can presently be recommended (i.e. 200 to 500 micrograms\/day of sodium selenite).","1879":null,"1880":"","1881":"","1882":"","1883":"","1884":"","1885":"The experience of the past twenty years in the field of H1 antihistamines prompts us to consider that these drugs are more dissimilar than has previously been reported in the scientific literature. In fact, the H1 antihistamines that are used in man seem to be effective, even if there are some differences in clinical efficacy. Nevertheless they may have marked differences as far as the following aspects are concerned: their possible binding to various biological targets, their pharmacokinetics, their metabolism and their volume of distribution. All these differences must be taken into consideration when judging the real quality of each of these drugs.","1886":"The similarity between ketamine effects and endogenous psychoses has created interest in the capacity of antipsychotic medications to block ketamine effects. In healthy subjects, a sub-anaesthetic single dose of lorazepam, typical neuroleptics, such as haloperidol, and atypical neuroleptics, such as clozapine and olanzapine, failed to block ketamine-induced positive and negative symptoms resembling schizophrenia. However, haloperidol is able to decrease ketamine-induced impairment in executive cognitive functions. Recently, lamotrigine reduced ketamine-induced psychotic symptoms, perceptual alterations, and cognitive impairments. In schizophrenic subjects, single doses of olanzapine do not decrease the effects of ketamine. However, long term treatment with clozapine has been reported to decrease ketamine-induced positive symptoms. Pharmacological modulation of the effects of NMDA receptor antagonists, such as ketamine, may lead to development of novel therapeutic agents for psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia.","1887":"Resveratrol, a phytoalexin found in grapes and wine, has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties. Since endothelium is activated during inflammation by some cytokines released by macrophages and many other cells, we tested whether resveratrol could modulate endothelial cell activation. We studied the effect of resveratrol treatment in vitro on the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 by tumour necrosis factor alpha-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In addition, we studied the effect of resveratrol treatment in vivo (in a murine experimental model) on the modulation of tumour necrosis factor alpha-induced vascular permeability. Resveratrol, used at the concentrations present in human plasma following moderate wine consumption, was demonstrated to be an inhibitor of the adhesion molecule expression by tumour necrosis factor alpha-stimulated endothelial cells. In addition, resveratrol significantly prevented the cytokine-induced vascular leakage. Our results (both in vitro and in vivo) may explain some aspects of the anti-inflammatory effects of resveratrol.","1888":"Alongside the French paradox, the REGICOR Study (Girona, Spain) has shown another paradox in the Mediterranean area: a high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors with low incidence of myocardial infarction in the population of Girona, Spain. The antioxidant effects associated with olive oil consumption could explain part of this 'Mediterranean Paradox'. Virgin olive oils processed by two centrifugation phases and with low fruit ripeness have the highest levels of antioxidant content. The total content of phenolic compounds (PC) from virgin olive oil could delay LDL oxidation. The content and nature of olive oil PC have a high influence in the antioxidant capacity of an olive oil. PC from diet could bind human LDL in non-supplemented volunteers. PC from virgin olive oil could bind LDL and tyrosol is bioavailable in humans from ingestion of virgin olive oil in its natural form.","1889":"Five groups of drugs are presently available to reduce the symptoms associated with angina pectoris: beta-blockers, calcium channel antagonists, nitrates, potassium channel agonists and trimetazidine. beta-blockers remain the drugs of first strategy since they are unique in reducing major cardiac events. Angiogenesis and gene therapy are still in the field of research. The second therapeutic goal is to reduce cardiovascular morbi-mortality. Inhibitors of platelet aggregation, hypolipemic agents and converting enzyme inhibitors have proved their efficacy in these fields. Conversely, vitamins C, E and B, antibiotics against intra-cellular germs and substitutive hormonotherapy of post-menopausal women must yet prove their efficacy.","1890":"EGb 761 is a standardized extract of dried leaves of Ginkgo biloba. EGb 761 is a neuroprotective and anti-ischaemic drug. Its broad spectrum of pharmacological activities allows it to be adequate to the numerous pathological requirements--haemodynamic, haemorrheological, metabolic--which occur in cerebral, retinal, cochleovestibular, cardiac or peripheral ischaemia. Moreover, EGb 761 has direct effects in retinal and myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion injuries. EGb 761 improves retinal microcirculation, reduces oedema of the retinal inner layer and protects chemoreceptors against free-radical injuries. On myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion models, EGb 761 improves myocardial functional recovery, and reduces the number of ventricular extrasytoles and the duration of ventricular tachycardia induced by reperfusion. EGb 761 protects the retina and the heart against ischaemia-reperfusion damage via its free radical-scavenging and anti-lipoperoxidative properties and its regulation of mitochondrial respiratory function.","1891":"Although cardiac ischaemia-reperfusion is well known as a disease of the myocytes, it is now clear that its consequences also extend to the vascular wall and especially to the endothelial cells. Using a rat model of ischaemia-reperfusion in vivo, we evidenced an impairment of the NO-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine of coronary artery segments. Moreover, we showed that cultured endothelial cells submitted to anoxia\/reoxygenation displayed an increased neutrophil adhesion, associated with an increased expression of adhesion molecules, probably responsible for the endothelial injury. In this context, we focused on the concept of endogenous protection against ischaemia, i.e. preconditioning, and demonstrated that endothelial dysfunction could be reversed by both the early and the delayed phase of preconditioning. The delayed endothelial preconditioning mechanism appears to involve complex interactions between NO and free radicals, leading to delayed improvement of NO production and decreased neutrophil adhesion to the endothelium. Identification of these mechanisms may lead to the development of new endothelial protective agents in pathophysiological situations associated with endothelial dysfunction.","1892":"A mitochondrial dysfunction has been suggested to explain chronic renal toxicity observed in ciclosporine A therapy. Our study has investigated whether trimetazidine allows inhibition of mitochondrial alteration induced by ciclosporine A. Oxidative phosphorylation was measured by polarography, calcium fluxes by a specific calcium electrode and the mitochondrial swelling by determination of the optical density at 520 nm, using a spectrophotometer. The ciclosporine A effect on the respiratory control was fully inhibited by trimetazidine (EC50 5.10 x 10(-7) M; Emax 11 per cent). Trimetazidine also inhibited the ciclosporine effects on calcium fluxes, i.e. calcium accumulation into the matrix and delay of efflux. Trimetazidine allows a decrease of mitochondrial dysfunction induced by ciclosporine A.","1893":"Chronic heart failure is characterized by increased vascular systemic resistances secondary to activation of various vasoconstrictor systems and to decreased endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. Endothelial dysfunction, described both in animals and in humans, may be caused by an increased inactivation of nitric oxide (NO) by reactive oxygen species, leading to decreased NO bioavailability and impaired vasodilatation. Increased levels of free radicals in heart failure may result either from increased production or a decrease in the cellular antioxidant reserves. Free radicals are produced by three enzymatic systems: NADH\/NADPH oxidase (after stimulation by angiotensin II or TNF-alpha), xanthine oxidase or endothelial NO-synthase (NOS) itself. However, oxidative stress alone cannot explain endothelial dysfunction. Other mechanisms involved in the regulation of the production of NO (e.g. decreased expression and\/or activity of the NOS) and\/or changes in production of vasoconstrictors may participate in this impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in heart failure.","1894":"Clamping the hepatic pedicle (or Pringle's manoeuvre) is frequently used to reduce blood loss during liver surgery. This induces a normothermic ischaemia of the overall liver. In this study we have investigated the anti-ischaemic effect of trimetazidine during surgery on hydatid cysts of the liver requiring vascular clamping of the hepatic pedicle. Seventy-six hepatic pericystectomies were performed under a 40 min normothermic ischaemia. Two randomized groups including 38 patients each received daily either trimetazidine (80 mg\/kg, group 1) or placebo (group 2) for 5 days before surgery. The effect of trimetazidine was evaluated on different parameters, the macroscopic appearance of the tissue, the ATP content in liver biopsies obtained before and after 15, 30 and 60 min reperfusion, the activity of the aminotransferase in the plasma and the plasma concentrations of reduced and oxidized gluthatione. No mortality was observed. The duration of hospital stay was reduced for patients treated with trimetazidine (8 +\/- 1 days compared with 11 +\/- 1.5 days for patients in group 2; p &lt; 0.05). Morbidity rate was lower in group 1 (11 per cent) than in group 2 (18.5 per cent) but the decrease was not significant. Trimetazidine treatment reduced cytolysis (p &lt; 0.05 on day 1, day 3, day 5), increased liver ATP content and limited the increase of reduced and oxidized gluthatione in the plasma during reperfusion. These results suggest that trimetazidine alleviates ischaemia-reperfusion injury during liver surgery and may allow extension of the ischaemic period without damage to the liver.","1895":"The consequences of ischaemia-reperfusion injury from kidney recipients on delayed graft function and graft survival still remain a matter of debate. Using an autotransplanted pig kidney model, the influence of trimetazidine added to two standard preservation solutions (Euro-Collins and University of Wisconsin) was studied. The renal parameters were analysed over a period of 12 weeks after transplantation. The degree of interstitial fibrosis, and the number of CD4, CD8 and macrophage positive cells were analysed at 2, 4-5 and 11-12 weeks after the transplantation. Glomerular filtration and sodium reabsorption were significantly more improved after cold-flush and preservation with trimetazidine-supplemented solutions than with trimetazidine-free solutions. The cytoprotective action of trimetazidine also reduced interstitial fibrosis and the number of infiltrating CD4 and CD8-positive cells. These results indicate that the condition of cold preservation may influence long-term kidney graft functions and that trimetazidine reduces to a certain extent the degree of interstitial fibrosis.","1896":"Sigma receptors are present in many organs and several functions are allotted to them but the specificity of their effect remains to be established. Indeed, all the molecules known to interact with these receptors also have affinities for other receptors. Recently, sigma-1 receptors were implied in the processes of cellular protection, several of their ligands showing a neuroprotector effect in various models of cerebral ischaemia. S-16950, a trimetazidine derivative, is a powerful anti-ischaemic drug on a hepatic model of ischaemia-reperfusion. It is structurally closely related to SA4503, a sigma receptor ligand showing also an anti-ischaemic action. Our study shows that S-16950 inhibits the binding of [3H]pentazocine, a selective sigma-1 receptor radioligand, to rat brain membranes with a high affinity (IC50 = 7 nM). This affinity is equivalent to the most potent sigma ligand such as haloperidol. Its affinity is 170 times higher for the sigma-1 subtype than for the sigma-2 subtype. The effect of Gpp[NH]p on S-16950 inhibition of [3H]pentazocine binding and the potentiation of the convulsivant effect of cocaine under the action of S-16950 suggest that this molecule may act as an agonist. These results indicate that S-16950 is a new sigma ligand and reinforce the assumption of a link between sigma receptors and a cytoprotective activity.","1897":"Steroid biosynthesis begins with the transfer of cholesterol from intracellular stores into mitochondria. Through in vitro and in vivo studies using various steroidogenic cell models and with the help of pharmacological, biochemical, morphological and molecular approaches we demonstrated that the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is an 18 kDa mitochondrial protein that interacts with other proteins in the outer mitochondrial membrane to form a multimeric complex. PBR is required for the binding, uptake and release, upon ligand activation, of the substrate cholesterol. Thus, cholesterol becomes available to the inner mitochondrial membrane P450scc where steroid biosynthesis begins. The presence of mitochondrial PBR is also critical in maintaining outer mitochondrial membrane stability and in preventing apoptosis. Considering these functions of PBR and the fact that PBR is a ubiquitous protein, it is suggested that this drug receptor may serve as a target to control various mitochondrial and cell functions and to protect against experimentally or pathologically induced mitochondrial and cell toxicity.","1898":"","1899":"Optimization of the management of chronic renal failure (CRF) is aimed at decreasing morbidity and mortality risks of CRF patients, due to the progression of CRF toward end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and to CRF-related complications with functional or life-threatening consequences. The so-called spontaneous progression of CRF toward ESRD depends on factors related to the primary renal disease, and on non-specific factors mainly related to hypertension and renal functional adaptations to nephron loss. Secondary prevention of CRF needs: early identification of primary renal disease, in order to start specific therapies; the treatment of hypertension; dietary advice on protein intake; prevention of events and drug toxicity potentially harmful to renal function. Clinical events appear late in the course of CRF, following several disorders often present for a long time: hypertension, dyslipidemia, phosphocalcic disorders, anaemia, malnutrition). These disorders should be screened for, and treated, as a part of tertiary prevention measures. When dialysis becomes unavoidable, early information and medical preparation of the patient are mandatory, giving the best chances of success to the applied dialysis method. Unfortunately, most CRF patients are referred at a late stage of the disease, when the effects of therapeutic interventions are limited; this results in increased length of hospital stays, increased risk of early dialysis complications, and decreased capacity to be treated at home.","1900":"Failure Mode, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) is used in industry to prevent process or product failures. We studied the feasibility of this method in hospital organizations. FMECA was used to improve drug prescription in two medical wards. Failure modes were identified and classified hierarchically. Corrective actions were taken. Involvement of all the professionals concerned in this process was obtained, and has resulted in real acceptance of the proposed changes and in their effective realization.","1901":"Until recently, only compassionate use of ciprofloxacin in children with cystic fibrosis was possible despite limited pharmacokinetic data. We studied five subjects with cystic fibrosis and exacerbation of pulmonary infection. A 15 mg\/kg b.i.d. regimen of oral ciprofloxacin was administered. On the 15th day, eight blood samples were collected and plasma concentrations were measured by HPLC. The actual dose administered ranged from 10 to 14 mg\/kg b.i.d., due to the fixed-dosage formulation. Corresponding AUC0-12 ranged from 8.2 to 11.9 mg.h\/L. Plasma concentrations were maintained above individual MICs for a median time of 12.7 h over 24 h. The median area under the inhibitory curve was 52.8, which is about half the proposed target value for ciprofloxacin in pulmonary infections with Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A higher dose, administered from a specific formulation to ensure precise dosing, must be given in order to obtain adequate concentrations in cystic fibrosis children.","1902":"Anticancer drugs can induce tumour cell death by apoptosis. The main pathway from specific damage induced by the drug to apoptosis involves activation of caspases in the cytosol by pro-apoptotic molecules such as cytochrome c released from the mitochondria. At least in some cell types, anticancer drugs also upregulate the expression of death receptors and sensitize tumour cells to their cognate ligands, which could be used to amplify the response to cytotoxic drugs. The Bcl-2 family of proteins, which includes anti- and pro-apoptotic molecules, regulates cell sensitivity at the mitochondrial level. Chemotherapeutic drugs modulate their expression (e.g. through p53-dependent gene transcription), their activity (e.g. by phosphorylation) and their subcellular localization (e.g. by translocation of pro-apoptotic proteins from the cytosol to the mitochondria). When interacting with tumour cells, anticancer drugs also activate lipid- and kinase-dependent signalling pathways that modulate the death response to specific damage. Protective pathways include activation of NF kappa B transcription factor, accumulation of heat shock proteins and activation of proteins involved in cell cycle regulation. The recent identification on these pathways to cell death has suggested several new strategies to improve the therapeutic efficacy of currently used anticancer drug regimens.","1903":"Treating cancer by targeting its vasculature is a recent conceptual revolution. The use of newly discovered potent antiangiogenic factors has confirmed the anti-growth and anti-metastatic efficiency of anti-angiogenic therapy in a variety of experimental solid tumour models. Using gene transfer technique to deliver anti-angiogenic molecules in vivo is becoming a widely accepted new approach. This review summarizes the biological basis, current situation and development trends of this new therapy, as well as its promising perspectives in cancer treatment.","1904":"Biological effectiveness of low LET radiations is dependent on the partial oxygen pressure in the tissues at the time of energy deposit. Direct pO2 measurements demonstrate a low oxygen tension in tumours compared with surrounding normal tissues. Tumour hypoxia mediates response to treatment (radiotherapy and chemical modifiers), and modulates gene expression and angiogenesis, a key factor for metastases. The knowledge of these microenvironmental factors will allow new treatment strategies.","1905":"In this brief review, we show that intravital microscopy has permitted characterization of the specific aspects of tumour microcirculation. Microvascular networks in tumour are largely different from those in non-tumoural tissue or in non-tumoural neoangiogenesis. Both from the anatomical and the hemodynamical aspects, the tumour microvascular network appears highly chaotic. In vivo measurements have shown the large heterogeneity of oxygen and metabolic status associated with tumour growth. Effects of antiangiogenic drugs can also be tested using intravital microscopy. These techniques have also allowed demonstration of the specific vasomotor response of vessels irrigating tumours, thus allowing specific modulation of tumour blood flow.","1906":"The multiplicity of experimental models of angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo complicates the choice of a straightforward strategy to accurately identify the anti-angiogenic potential of a natural or synthetic compound with antitumoral activity. In the absence of such consensus, it is clear that the demonstration of an activity lies in the use of several models, both in vitro and in vivo. A rapid overview of the most currently used models, especially in vitro, is presented, with an emphasis on their limitations. Several examples of research strategies for identifying antitumoral anti-angiogenic compounds are used in illustration.","1907":"The plasminogen\/plasmin system plays a key role in cancer progression, presumably via mediating extracellular matrix degradation and tumour cell migration. High levels of components of the plasminogen activation system, and paradoxically also its inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), have been correlated with a poor prognosis for patients with cancers of different types. Recent findings clearly suggest that PAI-1 is essential for capillary sprouting during tumour angiogenesis. Moreover, there is accumulating evidence that both the urokinase receptor and PAI-1 are multifunctional proteins involved not only in extracellular matrix proteolysis but also in cellular adhesion and migration through their binding site for vitronectin. The understanding of whether PAI-1 plays a regulatory role in angiogenesis by tightly controlling proteolytic activity or by influencing cell migration could allow a new anti-angiogenic approach for tumour therapy.","1908":"Physiological angiogenesis occurs during embryonic development but also in adults, during the female reproductive cycle (in the endometrium, corpus luteum and placenta), exercise or in wound-healing processes. Regulation of angiogenesis is classically understood as a dynamic balance between activators and inhibitors. It requires the combined activities of numbers of growth factors such as VEGF and angiopoietins. VEGF is essential from the earliest stages of vascular formation. It induces endothelial cell differentiation, migration and proliferation. Angiopoietins participate in maturation and stabilization of blood vessels and, in some conditions, in vascular regression. Comprehension of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate physiological angiogenesis contributes to advances in understanding of tumoural vascularization and to the identification of potential new therapeutic targets.","1909":"","1910":"","1911":"","1912":"Benzodiazepines are well tolerated by young adults whereas in elderly people they are less safe and globally induce more central nervous system side-effects and falls. Falls result from a decrease of vigilance and an alteration of postural reflex. This latter includes the reception of sensory information and central integration modulated mainly by dopaminergic D2 receptors and motor stimulation. Benzodiazepines act simultaneously on the three stages, decreasing their efficacy. The risk increases when certain other drugs are coprescribed, especially synergistic drugs such as another psycholeptic drug, an aminoside or a centrally active antihypertensive drug. Thus their co-prescription with a benzodiazepine increases the risk of falls. The pharmacokinetic parameters of benzodiazepines may be modified or remain constant during ageing. The choice of molecules whose parameters do not vary seems advisable. Whatever the selected benzodiazepine, it is obvious that it must be administered at the lowest possible dose, this dose being increased only if necessary, the overall prescription being time limited.","1913":"This paper describes a phytochemical and pharmacological study with Calophyllum brasiliense leaves, a medicinal plant employed in folk medicine for the treatment of several ailments. Based on spectroscopic evidence, five phenolic compounds were identified as hyperin (hyperoside), amentoflavone, quercetin, gallic acid, and protocatechuic acid. The fractions and some phenolic compounds exhibited significant analgesic activity against the writhing test and in relation to the second phase (inflammatory pain) of the formalin test in mice, suggesting that this plant can be useful for the treatment of dolorous processes.","1914":"The hypoglycemic effect of five Brazilian medicinal plants (Epidendrum monsenii, Marrubium vulgare, Rheedia gardneriana, Rubus imperialis and Wedelia paludosa) was studied on alloxan-induced diabetic rats. The extract of these plants was intragastrically administered to diabetic rats. The results showed that all plants studied (except R. gardneriana) significantly lowered the blood glucose. These results suggest that these four medicinal plants could be an adjuvant agent in the treatment of diabetes mellitus.","1915":"After a significant mortality benefit with bisoprolol in heart failure was demonstrated in CIBIS-II, an economic evaluation has been performed in cost-effectiveness terms. Average direct costs per patient were based on clinical data from 231 French patients, and measured in the perspective of the French National Health Insurance, effectiveness being expressed in terms of life days gained per patient. The extra cost of bisoprolol treatment and follow-up (averaging FF 1300 per 1.3 years) is outweighed by the reduction in hospitalization costs (representing a saving of FF 10,500 per patient) and other medication costs. Finally, bisoprolol therapy induces benefits in terms of both cost and survival: on average FF 9500 and 11 life days per patient. Sensitivity analyses confirm these results.","1916":"For many years, the use of benzodiazepines has been particularly high in France. This use can be described through pharmacy delivery. A cross-sectional one-day survey was conducted in June 1999, within a randomly selected network of community pharmacies in Aquitaine. Pharmacists were asked to interview each patient presenting with a prescription form including at least one benzodiazepine. A total of 58 pharmacies participated in this study; 328 patients were included representing 356 benzodiazepines prescribed. Among the 20 different benzodiazepines concerned, bromazepam, lorazepam and alprazolam represented more than half (54 per cent) of the prescriptions. The mean age of the patients was 62 years (median: 64) and 70 per cent of them were women. Most patients (93 per cent) were known to the pharmacist and 86 per cent had benzodiazepines prescribed by a single physician. In most cases (77 per cent), the prescribed benzodiazepine had been used for more than one year and in one quarter for more than five years. For 81 per cent of chronic users, no dose increase was observed. This study confirmed that long-term use of benzodiazepines is frequent, particularly in the elderly. This use is commonly accepted by health professionals as well as by patients, although it clearly reflects the dependence potential of benzodiazepines.","1917":"The great variability of slow acetylator (SA) and\/or rapid acetylator (RA) frequency is mainly due to ethnic-racial origin. Using the urinary elimination ratio of three metabolites of caffeine--acetylamino formylamino methyluracil (AFMU) to AFMU + 1-methyl urate (1U) + 1-methyl xanthine (1X)--we settled the acetylation phenotype in 54 independent subjects of Khmer and 70 independent subjects of Caucasian origin. Using DNA from peripheral leucocytes, we determined by PCR, in 32 Khmer and 122 Caucasian subjects, the frequencies of wild-type alleles (NAT-2 *4) and of mutated alleles (NAT-2 *5A, *6A, *7A). The frequency of SA was respectively 28 per cent and 61 per cent in Khmer and Caucasian subjects. The antimode of the distribution of the ratio was different in the two populations: 0.07 in Khmers and 0.18 in Caucasians showing a reduced acetylation capacity in the Khmer population in spite of a higher frequency of RA. The frequencies of alleles were also different between the two populations. Between Khmers and Caucasians respectively: *4: 48.4-23.8 per cent *5A: 15.6-44.2 per cent. *6A: 29.7-32.0 per cent. *7A: 6.3-0 per cent. These differences might be taken into account to define a therapeutic strategy in the treatment of tuberculosis by isoniazide.","1918":"Local pharmacological intradermal infiltration is a therapy being used more and more thanks to the positive results achieved, particularly for all those therapies acting on the microcirculation. In trying to better the results obtained with medical therapy for tinnitus sufferers, to assess the effect of a vasoactive drug, the method of administration by the intradermal route, which allows a strengthening of the pharmacological effect, has been added. The present study comprised 120 tinnitus sufferers who underwent intradermal auricle infiltration with a vasoactive drug. The control group includes 115 tinnitus sufferers who underwent systemic vasoactive therapy with the same drug. Forty-five days after beginning intradermal treatment the symptom improved and continued to do so following further infiltrations which patients underwent every 15 days. In the control group we noticed a moderate improvement 45 days after the beginning of oral therapy; thereafter the results reached a plateau by the 60th day. Intradermal vasoactive therapy for idiopathic tinnitus seems to be a new success, which will be an interesting progression in the therapy of this kind of symptom.","1919":null,"1920":"In some circumstances and despite investigations, no aetiology is found for hypereosinophilia. This becomes of particular concern when hypereosinophilia is elevated and persistent. While some chronic hypereosinophilias signal the onset of malignant haemopathies, others remain unexplained for up to several years. But all may cause severe complications to the viscera, among which cardiopathies, and in particular endomyocardial fibrosis, are predominant. New data on chronic unexplained hypereosinophilia point to regulation defects in eosinophils or more often in T lymphocytes. Thanks to simple investigations such as flow cytometry, along with other more sophisticated procedures, we should soon be better equipped to classify chronic hypereosinophilia and, in the long term, to define more adequate strategies for treatment.","1921":"","1922":"","1923":"The hematopoietic system is the adult cellular model in which the biology of the stem cells is the best known and may be a model for numerous other tissues.

Mobilization of stem cells by growth factors is now clinically used for hematopoietic transplantation in man.  CXCR4 and its ligand, the SDF-1 chemokine, play an important role in stem cell chemotaxis and in their retention in the marrow.","1925":"","1926":"","1927":"In addition to being a fast-growing subpopulation, the elderly also receive large quantities of medication and are particularly exposed to iatrogenic effects. In France, 8.6 per cent of hospitalizations of patients over the age of 70 are due to an adverse event. This workshop comprising pharmaceutical companies, pharmacologists, geriatricians and health authorities aimed to make propositions for improving drug research in the elderly in order to prevent iatrogenic drug reactions by encouraging more rigorous application of existing guidelines. In addition to information extrapolated from clinical trials conducted on young or healthy people, it is imperative to include in clinical trials a sufficient number of elderly patients and to take into consideration specific criteria such as multiple medication regimens, concomitant diseases, cognitive impairment and motor disturbances. The assessment of drugs used in the elderly must be based on a specific and validated geriatrics scale and in some cases (postmarketing studies) may be based on specific trials (those called 'conducted in the real world').","1928":"The objectives of the reflection on biomarkers are far ahead of the issues of surrogacy, and constitute a major stake for pharmacology: enhancement of the liability of positive or negative screening for candidate drugs, speed-up of development processing, accurate identification of responders to a specific drug, and optimization of drug monitoring. Examples illustrate the situations where biomarkers are useful: diagnosis, prognosis, prediction of therapeutic response, either favourable or unwanted. The advance of pharmacogenetics leaves hope for optimization of drug use through the adaptation of drug choice to an individual profile. Some deficiencies have been identified concerning policies of transfer, evaluation or interdisciplinary validation. The optimization of the use of highest level evidence data, which is possible when appropriate biomarkers and clinical data are systematically collected during all the steps in drug development, the formal modelling of physiological, pathological and pharmacological processes and their assessment through computer simulation, and the simultaneous conduct of pragmatic and cognitive approaches, appear to be the necessary conditions for fulfillment of the objectives defined above.","1929":"Reference data on pathologies, their management, risk factors and the use of drugs in real life is necessary. In France, there are no existing databases of a set of systematically recorded data which associate information on drugs and morbidity\/mortality. In contrast, there are a great number of studies focused on pathologies, their management or on drugs. A directory that could identify these databases and a means of accessing them would be desirable. Pharmaco-epidemiology studies must answer epidemiologically specific quality criteria, which must be planned at study conception. The protocol must be developed with a scientific committee on which there are epidemiologically experienced people. It is a prerequisite that a committee of experts with epidemiological competence should give advice on the 'acceptability' of the protocol, that is on the aim and the methodology. Data collection must be the subject of specific quality control of both the study and its aims. Cross-checking with other sources of data is recommended when possible. The coordinator of each study must send a final report to investigators and publish the results.","1930":"France ranks third among European countries as regards the level of investment in clinical R&amp;D and, overall, accounts for a contributive effort proportional to the size of its population and pharmaceutical market respectively. However, there is a trend for phase II and III studies to become proportionally fewer than in the past, while the number of phase IV studies is increasing. In a growing proportion of the mega-trials, which are instrumental for establishing evidence-based practice, French experts, investigators and, even more seriously, French patients, are insufficiently represented. Though studies in France are initiated relatively fast due to a clear regulatory framework and perform equally well as far as quantitative and qualitative factors are concerned, compared with most European countries involved in clinical research the costs incurred per completed patient are higher than those recorded in the other countries. Academic research shares most of these constraints and suffers from a lack of financial and human resources, while it faces additional delays in implementing studies because of longer administrative processes. Given the stakes in play, specific solutions should be implemented to maintain and further develop French competitiveness in clinical R&amp;D. At the patient level, positive perception and awareness of the usefulness and safety of participating in clinical trials need to be emphasized. Education at the school level and using the lay media should be developed. Intervention of institutional and government officials is much needed. Direct patient recruitment should be developed through advertisement and the Internet, as well as within doctors' offices and through collaboration with patients' organizations. Patient information and consent forms should be made much simpler than those imposed within the framework of global studies because of FDA requirements. The French health system discourages the recruitment of patients by investigators who are not the family doctor or the usual care provider. Thus, motivation and education of general practitioners and hospital doctors may be increased by involving them during the trial design phase and in the publication process. Specific administrative solutions, within private or public institutions, need to be developed for investigators who do not personally wish to receive investigation fees. Because of lack of availability, investigators need to be assisted with study nurse services and site management organizations, particularly within hospitals and clinics, using the model of the Clinical Investigation Centres. Networks of clinical investigation centres and of individual investigators need to be created. Implementing these solutions should lead to better implications for and reputation of French clinical research.","1931":"As far as communication of the evaluation of risk benefit assessment of medications is concerned, validated and interpreted data only have to be taken into account. Free access to information by the public has to be considered seriously and there is now a real and strong demand. This situation has to be viewed in parallel with the huge development of websites communicating information on health issues. This report summarizes the discussion between the authorities and pharmaceutical companies and reports the different concrete proposals that emerged.","1932":"","1933":"","1934":"The aim of this prospective pharmacovigilance study was to assess the incidence and the preventability of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) leading to hospital admissions. All patients admitted to the Toulouse University Hospital through the medical admission ward during four non-consecutive weeks were included in the study. Characteristics of patients admitted for a suspected ADR (cases) were compared with those admitted for other reasons (controls). All cases were reviewed by both a pharmacologist and an emergency medicine specialist. Among a total of 671 admissions, 44 ADRs were identified. The incidence of hospital admissions for ADRs was 6.1 per 100 admissions [4.4-8.3]. Cases were exposed to a higher number of drugs (3.6 vs. 1.7; p &lt; 0.001). Some classes of drugs were significantly associated with a higher risk of ADRs: antineoplastic, anti-infectious or musculoskeletal drugs. Haematological, metabolic and electrolytic, liver\/gastrointestinal or cutaneous disorders were causes of admissions significantly more frequently related to ADRs. Using Imbs's preventability scale, 65 per cent of ADRs were categorized as 'definitely unpreventable', 26 per cent 'potentially preventable' and 9 per cent 'definitely preventable'. These results underline the frequency of ADRs leading to hospitalization, with 35 per cent which are more than likely preventable. Further studies are needed to validate this preventability scale in order to obtain an easier, more reliable and more reproducible tool.","1935":"","1936":"","1937":"The aim of this study was to investigate possible discrepancies between the drug prescribed and that recorded in the patient's file. A prospective open blind study was conducted with 178 patients included consecutively. We analysed 1011 prescriptions (the median (range) number of drugs per patient was 5 (1-37)) and identified 49 discrepancies (5 per cent of cases). In 18 cases, the drug given to the patient by a nurse was not the drug initially prescribed but the drug recorded in the patient's file was the drug actually given to the patient. In another 31 cases, the drug given to the patient was not the drug initially prescribed, but the drug recorded was that prescribed. This inquiry shows that there may be a discrepancy between the drug initially prescribed and that actually administrated and suggests that poor traceability may affect pharmacological surveillance surveys.","1938":"Two independent expert groups assess new medicines in France: that of the journal Prescrire (P), and the official Transparency Commission (CT). Each uses its own 5-level scale to assess its contribution to therapeutics (P: (1) bravoi, (2) interesting, (3) adds something, (4) possibly useful, (5) nothing new; CT: (1) major, (2) important, (3) moderate, (4) modest, (5) none). We have compared the gradings for new drugs in P from 1993 to 1998 (except vaccines, generics and items for exclusive hospital use) to those of CT. Of 414 P gradings, 14 were without opinion, 54 were not found in CT (old or unexamined products), and 82 had been examined but not graded. The 264 graded pairs were 99 new substances (NS), 17 new combinations (NA), 50 new indications (NI), 56 new formulations (NF), 27 new dosages (ND), 10 new forms of packaging (NC), and 5 late gradings or reregardings (CR). For NS and NA, there were 21 discordances (2 degrees difference or more) between P and CT. When P is shifted one point to the left (better gradings), the number of discordances decreases to 2. NI, NF, ND, NC were less often graded by CT (respectively 63 per cent, 67 per cent, 54 per cent, 31 per cent of gradings). For NI, high CT grading results in 15 discordances (30 per cent). For NF, ND, NC the concordance is good (respectively 3, 1, 0 discordances). For CR, 13 of 18 products (72 per cent) are downgraded for P, and are discordant with the 5 initial CT grades. In 3 per cent of cases, P emits no opinion, CT gives a high grading in 2\/3, never null (these are for severe diseases). In conclusion, the two groups of experts come to similar conclusions considering different objectives (use or not a new drug vs. give indications for reimbursement) and the time distortion. Discrepancies can also be explained thus, but some can result from differences in appreciation of the data.","1939":null,"1940":"Disulone (dapsone + ferrous oxalate) is a sulphone marketed in France since 1958 and authorized in P. Carinii prophylaxis in HIV+ cotrimoxazole intolerant patients, bullous dermatosis, leprosy and polychondritis. Between 1983 and 1998, 249 adverse reactions were reported to French pharmacovigilance centres and Aventis, the manufacturer. Every side-effect was reviewed and the causal relationship was assessed on the basis of the French method for causality assessment. Main side-effects were divided as follows: 117 blood dyscrasias (generally neutropenia and agranulocytosis, rarely methaemoglobinaemia, haemolysis, macrocytosis, anaemia, aplastic anaemia, haemochromatosis and sulphaemoglobinaemia); 29 hypersensitivity syndrome; 39 cutaneous reactions, generally rash; 27 liver injuries (cholestatic, cytolytic and mixed hepatitis); 27 neurological and psychiatric side-effects including 7 axonal neuropathy; 10 gastrointestinal effects, generally nausea and vomiting. Five deaths were reported (4 septicaemia including one case not due to dapsone and 1 digestive bleeding due to underlying disease). In the other cases the outcome was favourable. The results were compared with the published references. It would seem to be important to reinforce information to prescribers about the possible serious adverse reactions with dapsone, particularly hypersensitivity syndrome and agranulocytosis, that can cause death if the drug is not stopped in time.","1941":null,"1942":"","1943":"","1944":"","1945":"Concomitant administration of three or more antiretroviral drugs is the standard treatment for HIV-infected patients. I.p. and NNRT are metabolized by cytochrome P450 and are inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4. Therefore a number of drug-drug interactions are likely to occur. Ritonavir, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, is coadministered with saquinavir, indinavir and amprenavir to enhance their plasma concentrations and their virological efficacy. In contrast, nevirapine and efavirenz are CYP3A4 inducers, which warrant an increase in i.p. dosing. These properties lead to interactions with other drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 and a knowledge or the route of biotransformation is useful to avoid side-effects or decrease efficacy (as in the case of statine coadministration). Some important interactions can lead to contraindications such as coadministration of rifampicine, astemizole, ergot derivates or cizapride, as a large decrease or increase in concentration can lead to inefficacy or to major side-effects. Clinical trials and notification of side-effects are important to detect unpredictable interactions and to propose guidelines; such an example is therapeutic drug monitoring of methadone to avoid withdrawal syndrome when coadministered with ritonavir or nelfinavir.","1946":"An alert was published during 1999 by the French Perinatal Cohort: eight cases of mitochondrial dysfunction were reported among 1754 infants exposed to nucleoside analogues in utero and during the neonatal period. These eight infants were not infected by HIV. Mitochondrial toxicity of nucleoside analogues is clearly described in adult HIV patients receiving NRTI. Zidovudine (the only and the first NRTI studied) induced mitochondrial DNA dysfunction in animals (monkeys) and neurobehavourial effects in mice at a dose similar to the human dose. Practitioners have been informed. Retrospective and prospective studies are in progress. The recommendations for prevention of maternofoetal transmission of HIV are not reassessed. Pregnant women in rich countries are receiving combination antiretroviral therapy. Information of women has to be undertaken and therapeutic strategies for maternal indication have to be discussed case by case. Careful long term follow up of children exposed to antiretroviral agents is a priority.","1947":"","1948":"Genetic-controlled biotransformation is a factor partly accounting for interindividual variability in drug responses. This control occurs via gene coding for polymorphic enzymes or rare genetic variants. Currently, the clinical relevance of genetically controlled biotransformation concerns only a few drugs. Determinants of clinical relevance depend on the size of the contribution of the metabolic pathway subject to genetic control, the existence of a relationship between the concentration and the therapeutic and\/or toxic effect, a low therapeutic index and a pharmacokinetic variability smaller than pharmacodynamic one. Phenotyping using test drugs allows the determination of the activity of the drug-metabolizing enzyme but can be hampered by drug-drug interactions and some pathophysiological states. Genotyping can offer additional information such as the differentiation between ultra rapid metabolizers and patients who comply poorly with drug treatment, and the differentiation between genetic and environmental determinants. Genotyping and phenotyping can help predict dosage requirements. Currently the number of clinical laboratories using these tools in the drug-monitoring approach is small.","1949":"A reassessment of the interest of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is needed for a better definition of its applications. It rests on the hypothesis of the existence of an interindividual variability of the dose-effect relationship, this variability being influenced by pharmacokinetic variability. Different types of endpoints were used in validation studies (pharmacokinetic, indirect, economic) and few studies have used clinical endpoints. The question should be: does TDM allow for a better dose adjustment than one based only on criteria other than drug concentration? Retrospective studies have a 'diagnostic test' approach and only prospective clinical trials will provide a real validation. Factors which limit the setting up of such studies are: the number of subjects to include, the often imprecise measurement of drug exposure and poor knowledge of the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship and its variability.","1950":"The French group 'Suivi Therapeutique Pharmacologique' (STP) has tried to define the best translation of the English term Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM). The TDM concept was initiated with the development of Pharmacokinetics and Analytical Chemistry. At first, the aim was the adaptation to target concentrations of efficacy and toxicity. Then, monitoring became more individualized and took into account the patient, the indication and the coprescriptions. TDM participated in the improvement of knowledge of actors (physicians and biologists), the tools and the drugs concerned. The most recent developments have been the population approach, the Target Concentration Intervention (TCI) and the Randomised Concentration Controlled Trials (RCCT). TDM today is an individualized intervention that aims to achieve the best benefit\/risk ratio, in the context of the patient and his\/her entire environment.","1951":"Therapeutic Drug Monitoring consists of sampling organization, measurement and interpretation of the blood concentration or biological effect of a given xenobiotic, and sometimes using this result for pharmacokinetic computation, with the aim of individual dose adjustment.

This group takes part in the main French organizations dealing with or using TDM, as well as the scientific activities of SFP and organizes multi-centre clinical trials studying exposure-effect relationships or based on 'concentration-controlled' protocols. Finally, another aim of this TDM group is to promote the development and acknowledgement of this activity in hospitals.","1952":"Nociceptin, a neuropeptide 17 amino acid residues in length, is the first novel bioactive substance to have been discovered by functional genomics. Nociceptin was isolated from a rat brain extract as the endogenous ligand to an orphan receptor, ORL1 (Opioid Receptor-Like 1), structurally akin to opioid receptors, whose cDNA had been cloned from a human brain stem library. The peptide is processed from a larger precursor polypeptide, prepro-nociceptin, which is widely distributed in the nervous system. Nociceptin is primarily an inhibitory neuropeptide that acts on neurons to depress synaptic transmission. Nociceptin's wide spectrum of pharmacological actions hints at several potential therapeutic applications for ORL1 receptor agonists and\/or antagonists, particularly for treating pain states, stress and anxiety, cognitive defects, and drug addiction. A major challenge is now the discovery and pharmacological in vivo profiling of ORL1 receptor ligands that are active by medically practical routes of administration.","1953":"Acetylcholine (ACh) may induce the relaxation and the contraction of human blood vessels. These effects involve the activation of muscarinic receptors located on endothelial or smooth muscle cells. In humans and animals, five subtypes of muscarinic receptors (M1-M5) have been identified. In the particular case of human blood vessels, the M3 subtype seems to be prevalent on endothelial cells as well as on smooth muscle cells. However, the M1 subtype may be specific for the pulmonary vascular endothelium. In contrast, the M4 subtype has not been described in human vessels. These conclusions are, however, based on a limited number of studies and further work is needed in this area of research. Although muscarinic receptors may not be the only receptors involved in hypertension, the development of specific agonists for M1 receptors may be useful to counteract any elevation of blood pressure in the pulmonary circulation.","1954":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro effects of phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors (PDE4I) and their combination with salbutamol (beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist) on spontaneous contractions and to investigate by in vitro and biochemical studies and analysis of mRNA expression the presence of beta 3-adrenoceptor in human near-term myometrium. Rolipram, RP 73401 and Ro 20-1724 (PDE4I) inhibited spontaneous myometrial contractions (Emax approximately 100 per cent; pD2 approximately 6.80 for the two first and 6.31 for Ro 20-1724). Rolipram 10(-8) M potentiated the response to salbutamol (Emax = 88 per cent vs. 40 per cent and pD2 = 6.93 and 6.36 with or without rolipram respectively). SR 59119A, a beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist, was more efficient than salbutamol in inhibiting the contractions (Emax 52 per cent and 27 per cent respectively, p &lt; 0.05) but they both induced a significant increase of cAMP production. In both functional and biochemical studies, SR 59119A was only antagonized by the beta 3-adrenoceptor antagonist SR 59230A. The beta 3-AR mRNA was positively expressed in myometrium preparations in a reverse transcription polymerase chain assay. In conclusion, phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors alone or combined with beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists and beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists might have potential interest as tocolytic agents.","1955":null,"1956":"Quality in healthcare has to evaluate the efficacy, the cost effectiveness and patient satisfaction.

Its incidence is 5 to 15 per cent of hospitalization days. Preventable iatrogenic is a main problem in terms of public health owing to its human and economic consequences. Prevention of iatrogenic is based on better knowledge of its reality, on well-adapted initial and long-term intensive training of physicians, other healthcare workers and also patients and citizens. A better healthcare system is also needed.","1969":"","1970":"In France, the number of admissions to emergency departments increase by 5 to 10 per cent per year. Traditionally, patients who require services beyond the first hours in the emergency department have been admitted to the acute care hospital. Observation unit are becoming common in hospitals because they allow an additional option to admission or discharge. In France, 60 per cent of emergency departments have observation units. Five to ten per cent of patients seen in an emergency department are transferred to the observation unit. These observation units are staffed with emergency personnel specifically assigned to the function of the unit. The average period of observation is less than 48 h. Of the patients observed, 50 per cent are discharged after extended observation and treatment. These observation units can be a safe, effective and cost-saving way of ensuring that patients who are considered to be in an intermediate category receive appropriate care.","1971":"In 1980, 11,000 French patients were given home respiratory care (HRC); today there are ten times more cases, i.e. about 120,000. There are two principal conditions in this population: chronic severe lung disease (CSLD), treated mainly with long-term oxygen therapy and assisted ventilation, and sleep apnoea syndrome (SAS), treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), a treatment that first became available in 1985. The mean age of patients with CSLD is currently 67 years and is increasing annually, while for SAS it is 58 years. The constraints of treatment, prescribed for the rest of the patient's life, are incompatible with long-term hospitalization, given the daily length of treatment (12-24 h for CSLD, and 5-8 h at night for SAS). The number of medical and social workers involved in providing these types of treatment requires complex coordination for the patient to be able to benefit from such highly cost-effective medical and technical services. In the case of home respiratory care, France has benefited for almost twenty years from the services of a not-for-profit network that comprises a national coordinating body, ANTADIR, and regional HRC services administered by physicians specializing in pneumology or resuscitation, often from university hospitals.","1972":null,"1973":"Using examples of economic assessment of medical innovations in the field of oncology, haematology and safety of blood products, the article shows that most of these innovations follow a law of diminishing returns: increasing levels of resources must be devoted in order to obtain an additional unit of health benefit (such as a life-year saved by a medical intervention). The article argues that, in such a context, cost-benefit analysis, a standard method in public economics, can be a useful tool to determine the 'optimal' level of resources that should be allocated by society for various medical interventions. In some instances, cost-benefit analysis can help to identify barriers to optimal diffusion of medical innovations that are due to inappropriate incentives and constraints in the management of the healthcare system.","1974":null,"1975":"National and international recommendations on the management of arterial hypertension and hypercholesterolemia suggest a treatment decision based on the evaluation of absolute cardiovascular risk. In order to evaluate the cardiovascular risk level, Anderson's equation (Framingham) has been proposed but does not apply to the French population. In medical practice, cardiovascular risk has to be appreciated according to the estimated cardiovascular risk of the country or area. The limits of a decision based on cardiovascular risk have been emphasized, particularly the balance age\/life expectancy in respect of early prevention of atherosclerosis. However, the benefit of treatment of hypertension with beta-blockers, diuretics and recently ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists or hypercholesterolemia with statins has been clearly stated--the higher the cardiovascular risk the higher the benefit. Secondary prevention in patients with major cardiovascular events is effective and necessary. The discussion concerns only primary prevention and from an economic point of view may concern patients at high cardiovascular risk. The general population have to be informed on cardiovascular risk factors, and patient education must be encouraged and developed via the healthcare network.","1976":"French national health insurance has carried out two nationwide surveys as part of its programme intended to improve the care given to patients with hypertension, focusing on affiliates diagnosed with severe hypertension entitled to exemption from co-payments (patients are reimbursed 100 per cent for all care related to the corresponding disorder). The objective was to measure the difference between observed care and the quality of care delineated in the guidelines (1997) elaborated by the National Agency for Healthcare Accreditation and Evaluation (ANAES). The before and after comparison was designed to determine whether actual care is in accordance with the guideline's standards. The initial survey took place from 31 May to 12 November 1999 over the entire French territory (metropolitan and overseas departments) and concerned a representative sample of patients whose ages ranged from 20 to 80 years at the time they qualified for exemption from co-payments for severe hypertension. The method used for comparison involved the calculation of a number of different evaluation parameters, the principal one being blood pressure control, using the systolic (PAS) and diastolic (PAD) pressures reported by attending physicians. Other evaluation parameters included the quality of the therapeutic strategy utilized. A total of 10,665 patients were enrolled in the survey by using information gathered from 8377 practicing physicians. Extrapolated to the entire population in 1999, the results can be applied to 50,383 patients. The average age was 63 years and the patients had been treated for hypertension for an average of 9 years. In addition to severe hypertension, 64 per cent of the patients had other significant high-risk factors for cardiovascular disease: 44 per cent had dyslipidemia, 28 per cent had diabetes mellitus, 15 per cent were smokers. In 41 per cent of cases, the patients' blood pressures were well controlled (systolic and diastolic pressures below 140\/90 mmHg or, for patients older than 60 years with only isolated systolic hypertension, systolic pressure equal to or lower than 160 mmHg); in 12 per cent of cases the patients' blood pressures were equal to the limit values; in 47 per cent of cases blood pressure was poorly controlled. Diabetics had poorly controlled blood pressure in 85 per cent of cases (systolic or diastolic pressures greater than 130\/85 mmHg) and, similarly, 94 per cent of the patients who were in renal failure were poorly controlled (systolic or diastolic pressures greater than 125\/75 mmHg). Preferential prescription with a particular therapeutic class, because of an existing comorbidity, was found in 68 per cent of patients whereas potentially contraindicated therapeutic classes were prescribed in 27 per cent. The daily cost of anti-hypertensive drug therapy was estimated at 8.05 francs per day per patient. Extrapolated to the study population in 1999, this represents 148.1 million francs. Less than 1 per cent of this observed cost (1.1 million francs) was economized by prescribing less expensive, alternative drug specialties in spite of the fact that an estimated 9.6 million francs could have been saved if these equivalent, alternative drugs had been prescribed. The potential saving corresponds to 6.5 per cent of the total observed cost. The care given to severely hypertensive patients is sub-optimum when compared with the ANAES guidelines (1997). In public health terms, the most preoccupying feature is poor blood pressure control because it occurs in a patient population with a high cardiovascular risk. These findings fully justify the continuation and amplification of the actions undertaken in this nationwide public health programme concerning the medical care given to hypertensive patients.","1977":"","1978":"Innovation should not be likened to progress and cost, true innovation should be clearly distinguished from false, novelty for novelty's sake should be avoided, and medicoeconomic evaluations should be interpreted with caution as they are often too precocious and overfavourable. It seems preferable (taking into account examples of statins, anti-Cox 2 NSAIDs, antiTNFs, recombinants...) that therapeutic innovation, as concerns both the prescriber and the evaluator, should give rise to critical reflection rather than to blind enthusiasm and scientistic belief. Delayed use, focusing on real or potential dangers, can be as deleterious for our patients' health as precipitate or generalized use while only considering increased efficacy. Innovation is extremely desirable, particularly when it seems to correspond to a health requirement of prior concern. However, it should be evaluated with a cool head, without prejudice, and even with a hint of scepticism to act as a counterbalance. It should be used with discernment, without improper extrapolation to patients for whom it is not necessary. Careful assessment of the sanitary and economic consequences of therapeutic innovation--which constitute a source of expenditure or economy--should be a permanent concern of health authorities. They must be evaluated using reliable and partly independent data from firms and paying agencies.","1979":"","1980":"","1981":"","1982":"","1983":"","1984":"","1985":"","1986":"","1987":"This study investigates the relationship between exposure to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and liver injuries using the French Pharmacovigilance Database. We use the case\/non-case methodology, where 'cases' were reports of the reactions of interest (liver injuries as recorded in the database according to the WHO-ART classification including cytolytic and cholestatic hepatitis, acute hepatitis, liver enzyme elevations). 'Non-cases' were all reports of reactions other than these being studied. Amineptine and acetaminophen were used as 'positive controls'. Among the 42,913 adverse drug reactions recorded in the database between January 1995 and December 1997, 5708 (13 per cent) were liver injuries. In comparison with other drugs in the database, liver injuries were inversely associated with exposure to NSAIDs, whatever the class of the drugs (OR 0.3 [0.3-0.4]). In contrast, liver injuries were significantly related to acetaminophen (OR 2.1 [1.9-2.3]), and amineptine (OR 14.0 [10.5-18.7]). Naproxen and diclofenac were associated with a higher frequency of liver injuries, respectively 15.7 per cent and 11.5 per cent. The risk associated with NSAIDs alone significantly decreased when the analysis was performed after exclusion of hepatotoxic drugs associated with NSAIDs (except for naproxen). The present results show the low frequency of liver damage associated with NSAIDs. The main factor appears to be concomitant exposure to other hepatotoxic drugs.","1988":"The objectives of this study are to describe the management, outcomes and costs of patients with severe chronic heart failure (CHF) and to identify the associated socio-demographic and clinical determinants. In 1994, the EPICAL study enrolled in a French region a representative cohort of 358 patients presenting for the first time with severe CHF (NYHA class III or IV) requiring hospitalization. The mean annual cost per patient was 125 652 FF, 92.6 per cent of which was associated with in-patient care including the index hospitalization. Ten per cent of patients contributed 33 per cent of the total cumulative costs. The rate of readmission was very high (20 per cent per month of follow-up) and appeared as a major cost driver. Three variables were identified in a multivariate logistic regression as the main contributors to cost: the presence of co-morbidity, renal insufficiency and marital status (living alone versus with spouse). These findings confirmed the major clinical and economic interest of any intervention that could lower the rate of readmissions in this group of patients.","1989":"Taste disorders, generally poorly studied, have various causes. From 1985 to 1997, 305 observations of taste disorders imputed to drugs were notified to Regional Pharmacovigilance Centres. Patients were on average 54.4 years old and 58 per cent were women. Quantitative as well as qualitative disorders have been observed. Drugs mainly found were: angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, terbinafine, zopiclone, D-penicillamine, imidazole derivatives, quinolones, macrolides, carbimazole and calcium channel blockers. The outcome was favourable for 60.3 per cent of patients. The possible efficacy of zinc is discussed. It is generally considered that taste disorders are not a serious side-effect, but they can reduce the quality of life and lead to poor compliance with treatment.","1990":"With 5388 patients in the marketing application dossiers and post-marketing experience of more than 130 million prescriptions of levofloxacin worldwide, the tolerability profile of this anti-infective is now well defined. During clinical trials, 12 per cent of patients treated with levofloxacin experienced an adverse event considered to be related to the study drug compared with 13 per cent of the patients with a comparator. Nausea and diarrhoea were the most frequent adverse effects. During clinical trials, the frequency of tendinitis, psychotic episodes and seizures was less than 0.1 per cent. Following recent concerns with some fluoroquinolones, specific attention was paid in post-marketing surveillance worldwide. The notification rate of significant severe liver injuries (hepatitis, necrosis, hepatic failure) has been less than 1 for 5 million prescriptions. Cardiac tolerability is satisfactory and the phototoxic potential of levofloxacin is one of the lowest amongst fluoroquinolones.","1991":"Ursodeoxycholic acid is a protective agent against liver toxicity caused by some drugs. In the present pilot study, we assessed the effect of this bile acid on tacrine-induced hepatotoxicity. Fourteen patients with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease received tacrine and ursodeoxycholic acid (13 mg\/kg\/day) for 105 days. Serum ALAT was the main evaluation criterion. Serum levels of ALAT were compared with those of 100 patients who had been treated with tacrine in the same centre. In patients receiving ursodeoxycholic acid, ALAT serum levels were normal in 93 per cent of cases vs. 69 per cent in control patients and moderate hepatotoxicity (ULN &lt; ALAT &lt; 3 ULN) did not occur while it was present in 25 per cent of controls (p = 0.036). In contrast, the percentage of patients with ALAT &gt; 3 ULN was similar in the two groups (7 per cent vs. 6 per cent). These present findings suggest that UDC could prevent moderate tacrine-induced hepatotoxicity. These results should be confirmed in a controlled therapeutical trial.","1992":"Recent research has revealed the presence of opioid receptors in inflamed peripheral tissues. This gives rise to the possibility of treating the pain caused by wounds with the advantage of reducing the secondary effects related to the use of opioids and at the same time rendering their use more efficacious. The theory of a peripheral analgesic action of opioids has been tested in a variety of situations, in particular in brachial plexus blocks and intra-articular injections. In addition, the analgesic effect of opioids has been tested by cutaneous application for various conditions but on only a limited number of patients. On the basis of these case reports, we cannot conclude that the peripheral use of opioids is efficacious and the topical use of opioids cannot be recommended unless done within the framework of a controlled clinical trial.","1993":"The French system of evaluation of dependence has been defined in the French Public Health Code by decree 99-249 of 31 March 1999. It was created by health authorities 10 years earlier and concerns dependence and abuse, which were previously just submitted to control under the designation of non-conforming use and misuse. The consultative function of the narcotics and psychotropics commission has been reinforced and its mission extended to include evaluation. Cooperation with different actors has been organized. This is based on the complexity of the methods of evaluation and the impact of decisions concerning control and\/or information. The same principles organize the cooperation of this system at the European and international levels.","1994":"An investigation of prescription and consumption of hypnotic and anxiolytic drugs in hospital was carried out and has associated a transverse prescription study and a prospective consumption study. The prescription study was undertaken on one day in several medical departments of Sainte-Marguerite Hospital in Marseille in February 1999. Of the 91 hospitalized patients included, 42 (46 per cent) had been prescribed a hypnotic or anxiolytic. Furthermore, the quantities of drugs taken out of the pharmacy during the month of February were 1.54 time more than those prescribed. This discrepancy was even more obvious in the case of certain benzodiazepines such as bromazepam (ratio from 1 to 4) and lorazepam (ratio from 1 to 8). Self-prescription and patients being supplied without a prescription are the hypotheses advanced to explain this phenomenon.","1995":"During the 6 months following the child-proof top commercialisation for the paediatric syrup EFFERALGAN in France, 51 cases of accidental ingestion were collected by the Marseilles Poison Centre. For 21 pour cent of them, the alleged dose taken was greater than the toxic dose. For 2 cases only, the responsible bottle had a child-proof top and was open on the table. For all other cases, it was simple-opening bottles (old bottles still present in houses, or bottles without a special top but sold in order to get rid of stocks). This study proves that such a preventive measure (modification of the top of the syrup bottles) is only fully effective if additional measures are undertaken such as return of unsold stocks or the provision of information to pharmacists and physicians.","1996":"To evaluate the frequency and severity of accidental poisoning in children by narcotics or buprenorphine, a retrospective study was carried out: 75 cases were collected by the Marseille Poison Centre between 1993 and 1999. Most of the patients were between 1 and 3 years old and the drugs involved were cannabis and, more recently, Subutex (buprenorphine). These two drugs were responsible for the most severe cases of poisoning, most of which occurred at home.","1997":"Although infrequent, hepatitis associated with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid combination is probably underestimated. Except for cases with few symptoms, a time interval between stopping treatment and the first manifestations (jaundice in most cases), sometimes of several weeks, may hinder diagnosis. We report 9 patients who exhibited this characteristic. The delay between stopping treatment and the onset of hepatitis varied from 13 days to 6 weeks after stopping the drug. Other causes of jaundice were excluded. Male sex, advancing age, or prolonged treatment (more than 10 days) may increase the risk. Complete recovery occurs within 1 to 4 months after discontinuation of treatment. The mechanism is unclear. Clinical and biological signs of hypersensitivity may suggest an immunoallergic reaction.","1998":"The antibacterial activity of ofloxacin was evaluated in urine over a period of 96 h after oral administration for 5 days of 200 mg twice a day in 12 healthy female volunteers. Bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity of urines were studied for five strains of enterobacterias recovered from urinary infections: two strains of Escherichia Coli Nal-S and Nal-R, two strains of Proteus mirabilis Nal-S and Nal-R, and one strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae Nal-S. Mean urinary concentrations of ofloxacin were very high during the first 12 h following last intake. They were still above 7 mg\/l till the 48th hour and above 1.6 mg\/l till the 72nd hour. Bactericidal activity of urine was present for 72 h in respect of four strains studied at that time; urine was not bactericidal as regards E. coli Nal-R. After 5 days of oral treatment with ofloxacin (200 mg b.i.d.), urine retains a bactericidal activity for at least 72 h against bacterial strains of urinary tract infections.","1999":"A combination of low-dose aspirin (A) and anticoagulation (AC) may provide better protection against thromboembolic events compared with AC alone in high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). We performed a multicentric placebo-controlled double blind-trial to test the preventive efficacy against thromboembolic events of the addition of aspirin (A) (100 mg) or placebo (P) to anticoagulant treatment in patients with high-risk atrial fibrillation. A total of 157 patients were included, with atrial fibrillation and previous thromboembolic event or older than 65 years with either a history of hypertension, a recent episode of heart failure or a left ventricular dysfunction. All patients received fluindione (F) and P or F and A, with an INR target between 2 and 2.6. The primary endpoint was a combined endpoint of stroke (ischaemic or haemorrhagic), myocardial infarction, systemic arterial emboli or vascular death. The study had to be stopped prematurely owing to a too low recruitment rate. During follow-up (0.84 years) 3 non-fatal thromboembolic events were recorded (1P, 2A) and 6 patients died (3P, 3A), none of them from a thromboembolic complication. However, 3 deaths were secondary to severe haemorrhagic complications (1P, 2A). Non-fatal haemorrhagic complications occurred more often in group A (n = 10, 13.1 pour cent) compared with group P (n = 1, 1.2 pour cent), p = 0.003. The FFAACS study was not able to show any therapeutic benefit from the addition of aspirin to anticoagulant in patients with high-risk AF. Such a combination increased the incidence rate of bleeding complications, which therefore greatly reduces its potential overall benefit. ","2000":"","2001":"Cardiovascular diseases are frequent in elderly subjects and these patients also frequently present with hyperlipidaemia. Therapy must take current uncertainties into account and, in the absence of therapeutic studies carried out in the elderly, is typically based on a case-by-case approach. Raised cholesterol levels remain a significant risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD) in the elderly. Although the relative risk of CHD tends to diminish with increasing age, this reduction is accompanied by an increase in absolute risk (i.e. the number of events) as the frequency of the illness increases markedly with age. The results of major outcome studies with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), when analysed according to patient age, indicate that the benefits of these agents are not merely confined to younger individuals. However, the elderly form a unique patient population: the proportion of women is greater and the profile of cardiovascular illnesses is characterized, among other things, by a greater incidence of cerebrovascular accidents. Moreover, the potential widespread treatment of hyperlipidaemia in the elderly has profound economic implications. Under these circumstances, the clinical practice recommendations depend upon a reasonable extrapolation of epidemiological and therapeutic data obtained from middle-aged men. At present, treatment is therefore aimed at patients with the most severe forms of hyperlipidaemia, generally in the secondary prevention setting, taking into account the patient's life expectancy.","2002":"Three classes of hypolipidaemic drugs are used currently for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Resins, by binding bile acids, prevent the intestinal reabsorption of these acids. Subsequently, an increase in their synthesis appears to arise from intracellular cholesterol. The intracellular cholesterol concentration decreases and leads to an increase in the number of LDL receptors. The consequence is a decrease in plasma LDL-cholesterol level. Statins act by inhibiting HMGCoA reductase, a key enzyme which regulates intracellular cholesterol synthesis. Thus, the intracellular cholesterol level decreases and leads to an activation of SREBP2 (Sterol regulatory element-binding protein), a transcription factor which, by binding to the promoter of the LDL-receptor gene, activates its transcription and thus the numbers of LDL receptors. The final effect is a decrease in plasma LDL-cholesterol. Fibrates activate a transcription factor named PPAR alpha. This activation results in binding with RXR, another transcription factor. The PPAR alpha\/RXR heterodimer binds to the promoter of specific genes increasing their transcription and thus the proteins coded by these genes. This mechanism accounts for the increase in lipolysis (modulation of apoCIII and lipoprotein lipase) and in HDL-cholesterol (modulation of apoAI and apoAII genes).","2003":"","2004":"","2005":"","2006":"","2007":"Since 1996, marketing of new drugs called protease inhibitors has revolutionized the treatment of patients suffering from AIDS. The side-effects of this new therapeutic family are quite well known but we wanted to evaluate the attitude of the clinician: can these adverse effects be corrected by symptomatic treatment, do they regress spontaneously or do they lead to an alternative PI therapy? We therefore carried out a retrospective survey in the Infectious Diseases Department of Poitiers Hospital consisting in research on files of patients (n = 70) treated in this department (hospitalization and consultation) for any clinical or biological abnormality attributable to the PI. For each drug we determined what sort of side-effects could be found and the position adopted by the clinician. For 30 patients the PI was stopped and for 21 of these cases because of drug toxicity (gastrointestinal, neurological, renal and metabolic effects). The biological anomalies are quite well tolerated and regress spontaneously in most cases.","2008":null,"2009":"Among the side-effects attributed to valproic acid (VPA), the occurrence of Parkinsonian syndromes and cognitive impairment is very uncommonly reported. We describe five cases of reversible associated Parkinsonism. These cases were observed in epileptic patients, 57 to 74 years old, two women and three men. Extrapyramidal disorders appeared after various durations of treatment (from 6 months to 10 years). Dementia characterized by an insidious onset was associated in three cases and bradypsychia in one case. Brain pseudoatrophy was present in three patients. In all cases the signs and symptoms improved some weeks or months after discontinuation of VPA. In the literature some cases, usually in young adults or children, have been reported. In a prospective study, Armon et al. found various abnormal symptoms and signs related to motor and cognitive function impairment in patients with long-term VPA therapy. These side-effects may be related to a disturbance in the gabaergic pathways in the basal ganglia system. It is of interest to consider that delta 2-valproic acid, a metabolite of VPA, is especially accumulated in selected areas of the brain: the substantia nigra, superior and inferior colliculus, hippocampus and medulla.","2010":"The 24-h urinary excretion rate of caffeine metabolites following 200 mg caffeine intake has been proved to be a valuable safe quantitative test of liver function. The pathological mechanism of acute hepatitis of viral and drug origin is different. In both diseases, the patient's caffeine metabolic capacity during the acute and the recovery period was compared. In the acute period, in both diseases, the strongly reduced metabolism of caffeine paralleled the variations of the usual biochemical tests. During the recovery period, in viral hepatitis, caffeine metabolism and biochemical tests returned to the normal values. In drug-induced hepatitis during the recovery period, caffeine metabolism remained severely impaired at a time when biochemical tests were back to the control levels. This discrepancy might be due to the histological or molecular toxic effects of the drug(s), irrespective of cytolysis. After drug-induced hepatitis, a caffeine test might be used to check the total recovery or to choose an adapted dosage of medicines.","2011":"A historical study of the prescription of midodrine was carried out at the university hospital of Toulouse (France) between 1994 and 1998. The aim was to compare the observed prescriptions and the ideal prescriptions in accordance with the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC). The analysis of 97 consecutive medical reports found discrepancies in prescription concerning the non-respect of contraindications and of potentially hazardous drug associations. Fifty-four (55.7 per cent) patients would have been excluded from prescription if the physicians had strictly respected the SPC. The inappropriate prescription of midodrine was associated with an increase in adverse drug reactions (ADRs). ADRs occurred in 34.0 per cent of cases overall and required drug discontinuation in 15.5 per cent.","2012":"A prospective drug prescription and descriptive study was undertaken in a sample of 214 pregnant women in the department of the Loire. This population was randomized using pregnancy declaration files from the French Health Care Centre. Data recording was retrospective. A total of 2064 drugs have been prescribed; 90 per cent of women received at least one drug during the course of pregnancy with an average of 11.5 drugs per woman. Antispasmodics are mainly prescribed in the first trimester while vitamins, mineral supplements, antianemics and vasoactive agents are found in the third trimester. Prescriptions do not rise with age but increase in urban areas. Use of PDD\/DDD (Prescribed Daily Dose\/Defined Daily Dose) is an estimation of prescription customs. For ketoprofen, it is 1.6 in the last trimester, although this drug is contra-indicated.","2013":"Numerous spontaneous reports of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) have followed the increased use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). It has been estimated that 1 in 200 patients treated per year developed SIADH, age and low body weight being particular risk factors. No clear gender effect has been detected when confounding factors such as body weight or antidepressant consumption are taken into account. Age-related susceptibility to hyponatraemia may be explained by physiological changes in renal and endocrine function. The high prevalence of polymedication and pluripathology in the elderly may be a contributing factor as well. To date, no study has demonstrated how SSRIs affect the regulation of fluid\/sodium balance nor whether they have an independent effect on this regulation in depressed subjects.","2014":null,"2015":"Liver drug metabolism is a major source of drug interactions. Three major human in vitro models are employed to detect drug interactions in the preclinical phases of drug development: recombinant enzymes, human liver microsomes and primary human hepatocyte cell cultures. Results obtained from these models may vary during the different phases of drug development. Identification of the metabolic pathways, enzymes involved in drug metabolism (mainly cytochrome P450s), enzyme induction or inhibition allow us to detect the major pharmacokinetic drug interactions which can occur in man and to identify specific populations at risk for such interactions. In vitro models are essential to decide if and which future drug interaction studies should be performed in man. However, the clinical relevance of the potential pharmacokinetic drug interactions detected by these in vitro models remains to be determined and confirmed by human studies.","2016":"Despite recent progress, childhood pain in France is still underevaluated and undertreated and its treatment very heterogeneous among clinicians and health care providers. Pain assessment is often a difficult task in this population. The ontogeny of nociceptive pathways, their maturation, and their functionality during development are not completely understood. Painful sensations primarily involve the child's own experience but can be modified, influenced by his\/her parents and the psychosocial environment with their own experience of pain and anxiety. The use of analgesics cannot be precisely quantified using retail sales data. However, the 'Pediadol' survey has demonstrated that their use in children experiencing painful situations is definitely insufficient. Also, another survey conducted among pharmacists showed that at least one-third of analgesics approved for adults are not licensed for paediatric use, sometimes due to inadequate drug formulation. The situation is even more critical for young infants and neonates for whom there are even fewer available approved analgesics. A number of issues need to be addressed in order to improve pain management in children. First of all, evaluation of pain should be generalized. Auto-evaluation should be used in children over 6 years of age. Under 6 years, the initial step would be to further evaluate and validate hetero-evaluation scores. Second, analgesics should be evaluated in order to be licensed for paediatric use. When possible, data obtained in adults or older children should be used and studies in younger infants performed only when necessary. Finally it is of paramount importance to continue to increase paediatricians' and health care providers' awareness of the existence of pain in children and to train them to evaluate pain and treat it appropriately.","2017":"'Alicaments' ('ali' for 'aliment' = 'food' in French, and 'cament' for medicament = drug), is an inappropriate term to designate a developing domain: functional foods, in other words health claims in nutrition. It is not easy to delineate the frontier between foods and drugs; this results in some regulatory problems. The key question is the evaluation of health claims. In this report, we synthesize the discussions of a workshop bringing together specialists from the food industry and nutritionists, scientists and representatives of public health departments.","2018":"The participants attending the 1999 French Clinical Pharmacological meeting in Giens eventually reached a consensus about the necessity to set up a clear policy regarding self-medication products in France. Despite a wish by French people to take more responsibility for their own health care, self-medication products' use and development in France have been held back for many years for the reasons reported below. However, self-medication could be developed while respecting or even improving public health care by applying the following key principles: (1) the acknowledgement of a consensual definition. 'A self-medication drug is a drug (the guarantees for which are provided by marketing authorization approval and dispensation and advice of a pharmacist) specifically suitable for use without any physician's prescription'; (2) the advertising of self-medication products to the general public is authorized; (3) the safe use of self-medication products is linked to the selected indications and the relevance of the information provided to the general public; (4) the self-medication drug approval procedure could be simplified, managed by a specific AFSSAPS unit; (5) the role of the pharmacist involved, as well as suitable pharmacovigilance, is mentioned; (6) more than 1000 previously marketed drugs without any clear status, the so called 'grey zone drugs', should be taken into consideration. According to the participants at the meeting, it is possible to set up a new clear and dynamic policy for self-medication products in France in conformity with EU requirements.","2019":"A public health network involves several and different health professionals who work in synergy to achieve a common objective: to improve the management of a given disease. Per se, this objective could not be achieved by each of these professionals if working separately. In practice, existing public health networks ensue from very different legal frameworks and come up against various impediments. They have been developed mainly for the management of chronic and serious diseases (e.g. asthma, diabetes, virus C hepatitis, Parkinson's disease, drug abuse). Public health networks can be a very valuable source of data for clinical and epidemiological research, mainly because patients are followed up over a very long period and information coming from various health professionals (general practitioners, specialists, nurses, etc.) is centralized and recorded in a common database. It can also be useful for pharmacovigilance purposes (assessment of Type A and delayed reactions). In any case, the relative interest of such networks should be regularly assessed by an ad hoc methodology, e.g. an experimental or pseudo-experimental design vs. a reference. Despite the fact that there are relatively few operational networks, they can be of great interest for clinical research.","2020":"The global cardiovascular risk is the probability of developing a cardiovascular disease within a defined period of time, taking into account several risk factors simultaneously. Born 50 years ago with the analytical epidemiology of cardiovascular diseases, this concept may be considered today as a potential prevention tool integrating the multifactorial aspect of these diseases. Its implementation in clinical practice raises numerous questions related to its estimation, practical use and consequences for the health system. This new approach to cardiovascular diseases does not aim to cure a complaint but to try to avoid its appearance by means of restricting measures. This will modify the relationships between physician and patient and will imply major modifications of our treatment habits. For this strategy to be effective three main prerequisites are needed: management choices will have to be the result of a deal between the patient and the physician, the responsibility for decisions will be endorsed by both of them, and the actions should be maintained over time.","2021":"Even if computer science, at its birth, had strong links with the neurosciences, it is today mainly oriented toward efficiency and robustness. For example, memory in a computer has few relationships with memory in a living being. Nevertheless, some domains in computer science are interested in this kind of modelling. In particular, connectionism, whose goal is to elaborate artificial neural networks, uses a formalism for its calculus inspired from calculus in the brain. Different kinds of memory that can be emulated by artificial neural networks, inspired by statistics or biology, are presented here. Their relationships with human memory are discussed together with their tentative interest for the biologist or the therapist.","2022":"Memory rehabilitation can be proposed to amnesic patients with mild or moderate isolated memory deficit and with some preserved memory components. It is necessary to study memory with global psychometric tests, specific memory examination and pragmatic study, and to have definite memory aims. The facilitating effects of mental imagery and mnemonic strategies, preserved learning and compensatory aids were analysed.","2023":"Memory assessment in pharmaceutical trials has to date been mainly performed in Alzheimer's disease. North American and European Medical Evaluating Agencies recommend guidelines. Tests need to be simple and short, and sensitive enough to assess changes over a wide range of severity to avoid floor or ceiling effect. They require inter-rater reliability and face validity. They should be at least appropriate for different languages and culture, correlate well with universally accepted estimates of a function and have several parallel forms available to avoid a training effect. Memory is assessed with sub-tests of composite scales assessing a number of cognitive functions including episodic memory. The ADAS-Cog has become the standard instrument since it was used for the approval of tacrine and other cholinesterase inhibitors. Some studies have assessed more specifically different sub-systems of memory. However, autobiographical, remote or prospective memory, as well as metamemory, has not been explored in pharmaceutical trials.","2024":"Today, the memory is regarded as a network of memories which is sustained by distinct interconnected neuronal pathways. These diverse neuronal pathways are differentially impaired during cerebral ageing. Consequently, according to their molecular and cellular targets, cognitive enhancing therapies will be specifically applied to some neurodegenerative diseases or to age-related cognitive disorders. During recent decades, cognition enhancers have been devised in order to facilitate or to serve as substitutes for the effects of deficient neurotransmitters, particularly acetylcholine. These pharmacological approaches have allowed the proposition of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and muscarinic agents. At present, these targets remain in progress but research is orientated on the discovery of nicotinic agents and acetylcholine releasers. Simultaneously, intense research activity has been undertaken around the other major systems of neurotransmission and\/or neuromodulation such as the glutamatergic, monoaminergic and peptidergic pathways. Although research has always given precedence to symptomatic treatments (cognition enhancers) over organic treatments (neuroprotective agents), those are the subject of intensive research activity as they could be capable of counteracting the neuronal death and decrease of synaptic plasticity that occur during neurodegenerative diseases and ageing, respectively.","2025":"Memory troubles associated with age justify treatment and medical attention because they lead to real disabilities in daily living even without dementia, and also because they are early predictors of dementia in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, the treatment of these troubles remains uncertain, badly codified and extremely variable depending on the health systems concerned. Moreover, the dominant idea of many physicians, in the general population and even in health authorities, is that it is normal to have memory troubles in the elderly. This fact explains the common attitude of therapeutic nihilism. However, recent progress in the treatment of AD demonstrates that this disease should not be considered as an irremediable phenomenon. Moreover, on the basis of the follow up of an elderly cohort, it is possible to determine subjects at high risk of dementia where preventive interventions could be undertaken.","2026":"Our studies show that chronic alcohol consumption (CAC) in Balb\/c mice induces (1) a deficit of spontaneous but not effortful retrieval processes, and (2) a concomitant reduction of anxiety, suggesting a potential interaction between emotional and memory disorders. We have shown that the benzodiazepine agonist, diazepam, induces memory deficits similar to those produced by CAC, whereas administering beta CCM (an inverse agonist of the benzodiazepine receptor) alleviated the memory deficits of alcohol-treated subjects. Parallel neuroanatomical studies have shown that CAC produced cell damage in the mamillary bodies, whereas no major changes were observed in the hippocampus or the frontal cortex, which is involved in long-term consolidation processes. Overall data show that CAC induced amnesia is not due to a dysfunction of the neural networks underlying memory storage processes, but rather results from a difficulty in activating the neural substrates engaged in retrieval processes which depend on emotional, motivational or environmental factors.","2027":"Some drugs induce memory impairments that resemble those observed in neurological and psychiatric disorders. It has therefore been suggested that these drugs might be used as models of these disorders. The concepts and methods developed by cognitive neuropsychology to investigate memory impairments are analysed. The interest and limitations of pharmacological models are discussed and illustrated by the benzodiazepine model of organic amnesia. It is concluded that the validity of a pharmacological model has to be defined in terms of face, construct and predictive validity and assessed according to the aims of modelization.","2028":"The present work was aimed at determining, both at the psychological and at the neurobiological levels, aspects of rodent memory that fall into line with human declarative memory which is known to be selectively impaired in amnesic subjects and during the course of ageing. The ability to compare and to contrast items in memory, and to support inferential use of memories in novel situations (flexibility), were considered to be the two key psychological features of human declarative memory that were altered by both hippocampal lesions and hippocampal dysfunction. Adult and aged mice were trained on learning tasks using two-stage paradigms, the aim of which was to assess memory performance through these two psychological aspects in the same subjects. Results suggest that ageing specifically impairs the ability to both compare and contrast items in memory (declarative\/relational memory based on complex associations), without altering memory based on simple S-R associations (procedural memory). Hippocampal lesions in adult mice produced the same dissociation between relational memory (impaired) and procedural memory (spared). Pharmacological experiments showed that, depending on the drug used, the relational memory deficit of aged mice may be selectively reversed (i.e. without changes in procedural memory) and that the behavioural efficacy of certain treatments was shown to parallel their potency in re-establishing normal (i.e. adult) levels of hippocampal plasticity-related mechanisms. Together with previous findings, these results suggest that the storage and use of relational representations would critically depend on the plasticity of hippocampal synapses, which via their connections with cortical areas, would support the storage of associations between perceptual, behavioral and cognitive events.","2029":"Functional imaging permits us to tackle in a better way one of the most noble functions of the human brain: memory. First of all, it is a way to validate the wide subdivisions proposed by cognitive psychology and clinical neuropsychology such as short-term memory\/long-term memory dissociation, episodic memory\/semantic memory dissociation and the distinction among working memory subcomponents. Moreover, functional imaging yields a new perspective on the global physiology of the brain. It makes it possible to propose new relationships that are more or less reciprocal between cerebral structures and cognitive functions and raises new fundamental questions. Thus, its first goal is to answer precise questions in the framework of definite cognitive models and it offers the possibility of elaborating a new modelling conception. Finally, functional imaging is a potential tool for a predictive approach to memory functions in both normal subjects and patients.","2030":"There has been nearly a century of interest in the idea that information is stored in the brain as changes in the efficacy of synaptic connections on neurons that are activated during learning. The discovery and detailed report of the phenomenon generally known as long-term potentiation opened a new chapter in the study of synaptic plasticity in the vertebrate brain, and this form of synaptic plasticity has now become the dominant model in the search for the cellular bases of learning and memory. To date, considerable progress has been made in understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity and in identifying the neural systems which express it. In parallel, the hypothesis that the mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity are activated during learning and serve learning and memory has gained much empirical support. Accumulating evidence suggests that the rapid activation of the genetic machinery is a key mechanism underlying the enduring modification of neural networks required for the laying down of memory. These advances are reviewed below.","2031":"The working memory model proposed by Baddeley and Hitch has frequently been used in cognitive psychology and neuropsychological studies. This model consists of several interacting components, responsible for the storage and processing of the information stored in working memory. Many neuropsychological and functional imagery data are consistent with that formulation of working memory. Moreover, many cognitive tasks have been specifically designed to explore particular aspects of working memory functioning. Taken as a whole, these data confirm that the working memory model remains a useful theoretical framework to explore memory functioning both in normal subjects and in pathological conditions.","2032":null,"2033":"","2034":"","2035":"","2036":"The present prospective pilot study investigated putative drug interactions in primary health care. Among 110 outpatients, 50 were treated with more than one drug (maximum = 10). Among these 50 prescription forms, 21 concerned at least one drug interaction, with a total of 47 different drug interactions. Most of them (94 per cent) were explained by a pharmacodynamic mechanism. They were classified as 'requiring use precautions' (64 per cent), 'to be taken into account' (25 per cent) or 'inadvisable' (11 per cent). None of them was 'contraindicated'. Most often the drugs involved were diuretics, converting enzyme inhibitors or non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Drug interactions, which concern around one in five prescription forms, remain an important topic in Clinical Pharmacology.","2037":"The use of iodinated contrast agents is associated with adverse drug reactions (ADRs) (mainly allergic). Data from the literature suggest a frequency of ADRs ranging from 5 to 8 per cent for the whole group of iodinated contrast agents. The present systematic prospective study performed over a period of six months investigated ADRs in a Radiology Department of the University Hospital in Toulouse. After 1480 injections of iodinated contrast agents, only five ADRs (i.e. 0.34 per cent) were observed. However, the frequency remained higher in patients with a history of allergy (1.5 per cent). The low frequency of ADRs can be explained both by the use of mainly low osmolality contrast agents (75 per cent) and by systematic preventive management of risk (detailed questionnaire, choice of the contrast agent according to risk).","2038":"Medical students, who deal routinely with difficult studies and with patients, are not always prepared for this challenge. This may produce a specific and important source of stress. As a consequence, medical students may sometimes develop maladaptive responses, such as substance abuse. This study aimed to evaluate performance-enhancing drug use among medical students at the University Hospital of Nancy, France. A self-administered anonymous questionnaire was given to all 104 eighth-year residents. The 93 responding students (37 female and 56 male), were aged 28.0 +\/- 2.2 years (mean +\/- SD); 53 per cent of the subjects reported enhancing-substance use in their first year of medical studies (72 per cent during preparation for their difficult examinations and 28 per cent throughout the year). The main substances were vitamins, anti-fatigue capsules, betablockers, marijuana (illicit drug) and benzodiazepines; 46 per cent of them were still using these drugs during the second to sixth years of their medical course. The main sources of drugs were retail pharmacists, with or without medical prescriptions. Could this use persist and lead to doctors with substance problems?","2039":null,"2040":"The chronic ingestion of 5 ml\/kg\/d of Argan oil by spontaneously hypertensive rats restores normal blood pressure and induces hypocholesterolaemia. In order to confirm these results Meriones shawi, a rodent of the Gerbillideae family, was tested as a second animal model. Meriones submitted to a hypercaloric diet and physical inactivity became fat, and exhibited hypertension, dyslipidaemia and hyperinsulinaemia. When treated for two months with the same dosage regimen, decreases in glycaemia, total plasmatic cholesterol, LDL, insulinaemia and systolic and diastolic blood pressures of 4.4 per cent, 14.4 per cent, 32.5 per cent, 26.8 per cent, 28.8 per cent and 30.5 per cent were simultaneously observed. Increases in LDH and of TG of 27.9 per cent and 16.2 per cent respectively were also observed. No effect on body weight occurred. The action of polyunsatured fatty acids of the Argan oil is predominant, but in addition, other constituents play an active part.","2041":"The authors report on the cases of two adult male patients presenting with autoimmune cytopenias associated with malignancies: a case of autoimmune haemolytic anemia occurring after remission of Hodgkin's disease and a case of autoimmune neutropenia in the setting of renal carcinoma. High-dose intravenous immune globulins (IIG) administered after failure of corticosteroid therapy produced a rapid and long-lasting response. These cases illustrate that intravenous immunoglobulins may be helpful in refractory cases of autoimmune cytopenias. The association of IIG and corticosteroid could be synergistic and effective independently of the outcome of the underlying disease. The pathophysiogenic mechanisms and literature are discussed briefly.","2042":"Acetylation status was compared, using caffeine as a probe drug, in the three main racial\/ethnic groups living in Tunisia: Arabs, Berbers and Numides. The frequency of slow acetylators appears identical in these three groups and is different from that observed in Caucasians. However, the NAT-2 activity as a whole is lower in Tunisians than in Caucasians. These differences might be attributable to the various population mixings which occurred in the past, given the geographical position of Tunisia. It may be asked whether these differences are relevant in term of efficiency and\/or frequency of adverse drug reactions when medicines whose metabolism is NAT-2 dependent are used. This hypothesis deserves to be tested.","2043":"Using the validated probe drug debrisoquine and the 8 h urinary metabolic ratio debrisoquine\/4 hydroxy-debrisoquine, we have determined the phenotype of the debrisoquine CYP2D6 dependent polymorphic metabolism in 464 Arabs, 227 Berbers and 215 Numides to elicit similarities or dissimilarities of poor metabolizer (PM) prevalence. We found 2.36 per cent of PM in Arabs, 3.08 per cent in Berbers and 2.33 per cent in Numides. These figures are similar to those observed in Middle East populations, and cannot be considered as different from those observed in Caucasians.","2044":"A recent hypothesis suggests the possible role of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) polymorphism (involved in the metabolism of a large number of drugs), as a potential risk factor for the development of extrapyramidal side-effects of psychotropic drugs. The CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotype (dextromethorphan test) of 31 drug treated psychiatric adult patients suffering from extrapyramidal side-effects (group 1) and of 31 matched patients without drug side effects (group 2) were compared. In the first group, 13 poor metabolizer patients (41.9 per cent) were found, characterized by a dextromethorphan metabolic ratio &gt; 0.3, and only two patients in the second group (6.4 per cent). These data provide some support for the notion that in subjects in whom CYP2D6 is probably saturated, the risk of drug extrapyramidal side-effects may be increased. In such patients the choice of psychotropic drugs 'without' this risk must be preferred.","2045":"Long-term administration of morphine for chronic non-malignant pain continues to be controversial, mainly because of the fear of opioid addiction and abuse. It is important to distinguish three phenomena: tolerance of the analgesic and side-effects of the drug, physical dependence (which is a pure pharmacological event) and addiction (defined as a compulsive drug-related behaviour). Animal studies suggest that similar mechanisms underlie tolerance and physical dependence. These may result from an imbalance between anti- and pro-nociceptive mechanisms. By contrast, the occurrence of an addictive behaviour depends on both different endogenous mechanisms and environmental factors. Clinical data suggest that the use of stable doses of morphine (or other opiates) is common in patients suffering from chronic non-malignant pain. However, drug addiction might develop in 'at-risk patients' and therefore the decision to start long-term treatment with an opiate should be undertaken very cautiously, and ongoing assessment of aberrant drug-related behaviours should be undertaken repeatedly.","2046":"The clinical and socioeconomic background of chronic viral hepatitis is favourable to new therapeutic approaches based on gene biochemistry. As with all gene therapy, the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis using this approach would make use of a therapeutic gene and a delivery system adapted to the pharmaceutical objectives of targeting, gene expression and kinetics. The various vectors under review are not yet sufficiently optimized for selective targeting of infected hepatocytes. Moreover, four therapeutic gene processes are currently under development: antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, dominant negative mutants and DNA vaccines. These developments are obviously limited by the lack of experimental or animal models representative of the pathophysiology of chronic viral hepatitis. The gene therapy for chronic viral hepatitis is nearly ready for clinical evaluation but must be weighed against the continuous progress of pharmaceutical treatments.","2047":"","2048":"","2049":"","2050":"","2051":"During the postwar decades, the quasi-spontaneous growth permitted less rigorous management than that of today in terms of the development of enterprises. The choice was made in a more or less well-considered way and often by 'feeling'. The economic upheaval that followed the oil crises, the acceleration of technological discoveries and their practical applications and the speeding up of the dissemination of information have imposed a new way of strategic decision making on society. This type of approach, used largely in the industrial world, ought to be better understood by doctors so that they may appreciate the changes and also so that they can eventually use these methodologies in their field of activity.","2052":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly fatal degenerative disorder of the motoneurones which was without any effective therapy until 1997. Riluzole (Rilutek) has been the first patented drug used in its specific treatment. In order to evaluate the tolerability profile of this molecule, a Pharmacovigilance study was undertaken in the Department of Neurology B at the Montpellier University Hospital. A total of 153 patients were studied and all observed side-effects were listed in the French bank of Pharmacovigilance. Riluzole induced one or more adverse effects in 50.3 per cent of patients. The most frequent were gastrointestinal disturbances, hepatotoxicity and asthenia. Dermatological, haematological, neuropsychiatric and metabolic side-effects were also reported. This study shows an acceptable safety profile for riluzole. Due to its mode of action, riluzole could potentially be used in the treatment of other neurodegenerative diseases involving glutamate excitotoxicity. Subsequently, Pharmacovigilance will have to be carried out to establish the proper use of riluzole.","2053":"The drugs most diverted for toxicomanic use from their therapeutic indication are principally the opioids or related substances, with codeine still high in importance, in spite of the wide prescription of substitution treatments. The psychotropic drugs, essentially the benzodiazepines and the stimulant antidepressants such as amineptine, are also frequently used. The market withdrawal of amineptine should diminish its misuse. The abuse of amphetamines-anorectics and barbiturates seems to be regressing. Nevertheless, substances such as nitrous oxide and ketamine are the subject of selective, recent misuse. Moreover high-dose buprenorphine misuse, as a concomitant buprenorphine-benzodiazepine combination and\/or an intravenous injection of high doses of buprenorphine, can be implicated in severe adverse effects. Twenty-one lethal intoxications linked to such drug misuse have already been reported. However, the addictive drug potential is not the only explanation for drugs diverted for toxicomanic use. It is also associated with a polytoxicomania, a symptom of pre-existing difficulties, particularly familial, social and environmental in origin. Therefore, the therapeutic regime should be adapted to the drug addict's personality. We report a few cases of polydrug abusers, treated with methadone in a specialist unit. The misuse and the practical therapeutic response, adapted to each case, are compared and discussed in respect of the data published in the literature.","2054":"In type II diabetes treated with metformin (Glucophage) lactic acidosis is a rare adverse reaction, fatal in approximately 50 per cent of cases. Metformin is implicated by plasma and intra-erythrocyte levels. An analysis is carried out on available information about this risk for healthcare professionals and for patients. A comparison is made of approved labelling information on Glucophage and its patient leaflets in France and in the USA and an analysis made of the differences. In France, Information given to physicians, pharmacists and patients on the risk of lactic acidosis where Glucophage is implicated must be improved, and on the interest of the metformin plasma level in this case. These are primary points because the issue for the few patients concerned may be fatal. Advice on self-medication may be introduced. The evolution of information provided on these risks depends on the pharmaceutical laboratory, government authorities and healthcare professionals.","2055":"The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of a pharmacokinetic population model built by the two-stage method and individual parameters determined by a Bayesian estimation instead of nonlinear regression. We performed a retrospective analysis on 32 patient files (mean age: 82 years). First, we analysed prediction of amikacin serum levels for the Bayesian method (MAP) and nonlinear regression (MLS). Second, we compared pharmacokinetic parameter values for each patient with MAP and MLS methods for a one- or two-compartment model. For the one-compartment model, no difference in prediction performance was found (correlation coefficient: rMLS = 0.911, rMAP = 0.903, p &gt; 0.05; precision: pMLS = 134.3, pMAP = 147, p &gt; 0.05). A significant difference was observed only for systematic error (eMLS = -4.47, eMAP = -3.34, p &lt; 0.05). For a two-compartment model, the Bayesian method was better for long-term prediction: 4-8 days (rMLS = 0.877, rMAP = 0.886, p &gt; 0.05; eMLS = 5.26, eMAP = 0.04, p &lt; 0.01; pMLS = 441.7, pMAP = 149, p &lt; 0.05). The comparison of MAP and MLS estimated pharmacokinetic parameter values for a one-compartment model showed that the Bayesian method used to built a pharmacokinetic population in two stages does not influence pharmacokinetic parameter estimation (p &gt; 0.05 for Vd, Kslope, Kel and t1\/2). We conclude that we can use a Bayesian method to build a pharmacokinetic population in two steps in order to perform adaptative control of a drug-dosage regimen.","2056":"Drug removal during plasma exchange (PE) is a complex phenomenon that is defined by the molecule pharmacokinetic characteristics. Plasma-protein binding and the volume of distribution (Vd) are two kinetic parameters that strongly affect the efficiency of drug removal by PE. The effect of PE on drug kinetics has been specifically studied with antivirals, cardiotonic agents, antibiotics, corticosteroids, antalgics, anti-epileptic agents and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. This effect can be evaluated using different parameters: extracorporeal clearance, half-life, amount eliminated, and fraction of the drug removed. The estimated fraction eliminated (Fe) from the body by PE is the best parameter to evaluate the effectiveness of the exchange procedure; it can account for 0.5-30 per cent. Results reported in the literature showed that PE most influences drugs with a low Vd, regardless of the extent of protein binding. We established that, during PE, there is a linear relationship between Fe and the fraction of the drug in extracellular fluids. The fraction eliminated during PE is approximately one-seventh of the fraction of the drug in extracellular fluids. We propose to use this extracellular fraction as a predictive index: when &lt; 20, extraction is low; the amount eliminated becomes consequential only when the index &gt; 20. Dosage supplementation may be needed to maintain an adequate drug concentration in the body. Practically, for drugs with a low Vd (&lt; 0.3 l\/kg), it seems necessary to adjust the dosage.","2057":"The importance of the criterion of Quality of Life (QOL) for compliance with antihypertensive drugs led us to study the QOL of 51 hypertensives receiving 2.5 mg of the new formulation of prazosin (sustained release), compared with 49 subjects treated by a converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril 10 mg), in a double-blind randomized trial. QOL, assessed by means of a 22 item self-administered questionnaire, improved significantly with prazosin, during the 24 weeks of the trial. In the intention to treat analysis, the global score of QOL increased from 46.3 +\/- 8.4 to 51.6 +\/- 8.9 (p &lt; 0.0001); the covariance analysis showed that the improvement was obtained as early as the 8th week. A similar favourable evolution was observed for anxiety, retardation and anhedonia components, computed from the same questionnaire. No significant difference in QOL evolution was found between prazosin and enalapril. Both treatments proved equivalent in respect of efficacy on blood-pressure values, and tolerance, estimated through the number of dropouts or side-effects. These results confirm the benefit to QOL of hypertensive patients of the new formulation of prazosin.","2058":"","2059":"Voltage-gated calcium channels are involved in a large variety of cellular functions such as excitation-contraction coupling, hormone secretion, firing and pacemaker activity, gene activation and proliferation. Cloning of complementary DNAs encoding for calcium channel subunits has challenged the study of the functional properties of calcium channels and has allowed analysis of the molecular basis of calcium channel diversity. Recently, pore-forming subunits of T-type calcium channels have been cloned. Recent data describing the genes encoding calcium channels, their molecular and pharmacological studies, as well as their linkage to human genetic diseases are reviewed in this article.","2060":"The interaction of oestrogens with their intra-nuclear receptor is now recognized in its tri-dimensional aspects. A new receptor, ER beta, has been cloned and new non-genomic oestrogen effects have been reported. Hence, a better understanding of physiological mechanisms or of pathophysiological aspects, such as phyto- and xeno-oestrogens' influence on the organism, is possible. New compounds, belonging to the SERM family, are being explored. Raloxifene is now available for the prevention of post-menopausal osteoporosis. Tamoxifen has been associated with a beneficial effect for the primary prevention of breast cancer in a high-risk population. The understanding of genetic susceptibility could contribute, to better define women at risk. A dedicated primary prevention strategy in women with a high risk of breast cancer coupled with early detection through mammography will continue to improve the prognosis of this hormono-dependent cancer.","2061":"","2062":"A 75-year-old woman experienced fever and convulsions. She was treated for diabetes mellitus, angina pectoris and also for arteritis with Buflomedil Merck (3 tab\/d). Further investigations failed to find any aetiology. Buflomedil dosage was elevated to 6.3 mg\/l (N = 4-4.5 mg\/l). The drug was discontinued and there was no recurrence of symptoms. There was no evidence of error in dosage or interaction. A failure of the generic product was suspected. Only a pharmacist solved the problem. Fonzylane (buflomedil) had recently been switched to Buflomedil Merck. The patient misunderstood the change and took both drugs! Our purpose is not to report a known effect but to emphasize the importance of extending the information given to the patient and the risk of misuse of the generic product.","2063":null,"2064":null,"2065":"Cloned HERG and KvLQT1-IsK K+ channels have been expressed in mammalian cells and assayed as a target for calcium channel blockers. These channels generate the rapid and slow components of the cardiac delayed rectifier K+ current, and mutations can affect them that lead to long QT syndromes. HERG is blocked by bepridil (EC50 = 0.55 microM), verapamil (EC50 = 0.83 microM) and mibefradil (EC50 = 1.43 microM), whereas nitrendipine and diltiazem have negligible effects. Steady-state activation and inactivation parameters are shifted to more negative values in the presence of the blockers. Similarly, KvLQT1-IsK is inhibited by bepridil (EC50 = 10.0 microM) and mibefradil (EC50 = 11.8 microM), whilst being insensitive to nitrendipine, diltiazem or verapamil. This work may help to understand the mechanisms of action of verapamil in certain ventricular tachycardias as well as some of the deleterious adverse cardiac events associated with bepridil and mibefradil.","2066":"The hallmark of long QT syndromes (LQTS) is an abnormal ventricular repolarization characterized by a prolonged QT interval on the electrocardiogram and a propensity to the occurrence of syncopes resulting from polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, called torsades de pointes. They may degenerate to ventricular fibrillation, possibly causing sudden death. Congenital LQTS, which implicates at least six chromosomal loci, LQT1 to LQT6, three of them corresponding to mutations concerning the coding of K+ channel proteins, give useful information about the mechanism underlying the arrhythmia. One of the potassium channel genes implicated in congenital LQTS is HERG, which encodes the IKr current channel protein. This current has provided a relevant insight into the occurrence of drug-acquired LQTS, since all drugs associated with torsades, such as erythromycin, terfenadine, haloperidol, or cisapride, also block IKr.","2067":"Perspectives in immunosuppressive drug therapy have changed rapidly in the past few years with the appearance on the market of several new entities. Used for organ transplantation, bone-marrow transplantation and more recently in some auto-immune diseases, the usual classical scheme consisting of corticoids, azathioprine (1970) and cyclosporin (1980), with or without an induction period with antilymphocyte antibodies, has varied little except for the monoclonal antibody OKT3. The considerable evolution due to the introduction of cyclosporin almost twenty years ago has reached its limits. The new perspectives offer two aspects: (1) on one hand, the specificity of each compound: tacrolimus, Prograf, Fujisawa; mycophenolate mofetyl (MMF), CellCept, Roche; cyclosporin, Neoral, Novartis; basiliximab, Simulect, Novartis; and dacliximab, Zenapax, Roche; monoclonal humanized antibodies, rapamycine or sirolimus, Rapamune, Wyeth; or its derived form RAD Novartis; (2) on the other hand, all these products represent alternatives to the present scheme in a field where coprescription is the rule. These alternatives encounter one main difficulty: the evaluation and the organization of the different possible combinations have to be done within a small series of patients. It is essential to note that the market authorizations have been given on the basis of a precise scheme of dosage regimen from the pivotal studies and that extrapolation from these conditions, in particular choice of the doses, has required thorough reflection. These recent developments need optimization between an improvement of immunosuppression and a higher risk for infection and malignancy.","2068":"A classification on the basis of time-course effect is proposed to describe the pleiotropic actions of interleukin-1 (IL-1) on the central nervous system (CNS); two main time-frames, minutes-to-days and days-to-years, are distinguished. The former includes the central aspects of acute-phase response with fever, altered food and water intake, sleepiness, sickness behaviour and neuroendocrine changes. Apart from stress response triggered by immune-inflammatory stimuli, the concept that IL-1 mediates other types of stress is also reviewed, showing that the cytokine may have a role in mediating hypothalamic responses to restrain stress and nociceptive stimuli. The days-to-years time-frame includes several CNS disorders accompanied by inappropriate and\/or sustainedly elevated IL-beta production: ischaemia, Alzheimer's disease, HIV-related dementia and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis-multiple sclerosis. In all cases, IL-beta is not envisioned as an aetiological factor, but it contributes significantly to the maintenance of disease state. Current and perspective therapeutic approaches involving the modulation of IL-beta production and effects are briefly discussed.","2069":"The immune T-cell compartment maintains the capability to respond to a wide variety of antigens (Ag). This whole process is regulated by lymphocyte apoptosis (programmed cell death, PCD) and involves the coordinated expression of a great number of genes including those coding for cytokines and their receptors, such as for example IL-2\/IL-2R and the Fas\/FasL systems and those coding for transcription factors, including the NF-kB complex, involved in T-cell activation and apoptosis in that they simultaneously activate cell suicide and an anti-death programme. This binary effect, PCD activation and inhibition, is due on one hand to GCH-induced activation of the caspases cascade and on the other to the induction of expression of a new gene that we have named GILZ. In fact, GILZ over-expression in transfected cells inhibits the sequential increase of NF-kB\/DNA-binding activity, IL-2 production and IL-2R expression, and transcription of the Fas\/FasL complex that follows TCR triggering and plays an important role in the control of T-lymphocyte apoptosis. These results indicate a new mechanism responsible for the GCH-mediated inhibition of T-cell death and activation that could contribute to anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive efficacy.","2070":"The explosive growth in cytokines has been followed by many attempts to bring them into clinical use. Immediate applications are already recognized in cancer and infectious diseases. Future applications are foreseeable in inflammatory and auto-immune diseases. The use of accurate and sensitive methods for cytokine measurements in body fluids is an absolute prerequisite to define the pharmacological effect of parenterally administered recombinant cytokines. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has become the most convenient method but there is an urgent need for a real standardization of this technique. Moreover, ELISA may be susceptible to cross-reactivity due to the high percentage of amino-acid homology between the various cytokines. The pharmacokinetic profile of recombinant cytokines may be influenced by endogenous production, receptor binding effect, receptor antagonists and soluble receptors. Cytokines elicit an immunogenic response and anticytokine antibodies should be monitored. Serum half-life of elimination is about 4 h after subcutaneous administration. In contrast with conventional drugs, pharmacokinetic data do not provide useful information for the design of a clinical protocol, and the rational choice of the unit dose and dosing schedule should be based on biological considerations. In vitro studies on the duration of receptor occupancy required for effector augmentation provide one of the bases for the choice of therapeutic protocol. Recombinant cytokines share biological activities and synergize with or antagonize one another so that it is difficult to evaluate their effects in clinical studies. Thus, pharmacological results do not always correlate with therapeutic effect. There is no direct relationship between dose and activity. One must determine the optimum biological dose (OBD), which is the minimal dose resulting in a significant augmentation of effector cell activity correlating with the therapeutic response. Surrogate markers may help to assess the clinical response such as 2',5'-oligo(A) synthetase or neopterin following interferon administration. Cytokines' adverse effects are difficult to foresee in the human because studies in rodents and dogs cannot fully predict them because of their species specificity. New relevant animal models are needed such as transgenic animals and parallel animal models. Pro-inflammatory cytokines inhibit cytochrome P-450 and have the potential to cause drug-cytokine interactions.","2071":"Diagnostic criteria and classification are changing. It is no longer acceptable to include patients with a general diagnosis of any anxiety, or neurotic anxiety. Regardless of the reference system used, DSM IV or ICD 10, anxiety disorders are now detailed in separate entities. General anxiety disorder, GAD, which is pivotal for the evaluation of new products, can only be claimed after the elimination of all the others, and is relatively rare. The inclusion of such outpatients is further complicated, as comorbidity is frequently associated with GAD--alcoholism, major depression, dysthymia, personality disorders, somatic disease likely to interfere with patient evaluation--and leads to exclusions, and also because the requested duration for the syndrome, prior to inclusion, is six months, which means six months without psychotropic drugs, including excessive alcohol consumption. As to patient evaluation, the reference scale remains the HAM-A. It should show a score above 20 at baseline. It has been designed to assess the level of anxiety of patients presenting with the diagnosis of anxiety, but not the diagnosis of GAD, and, clearly, in relation to the expected results obtained with BZD, which are still the standard reference drugs. The same is true for the other investigator scales and self-rating scales. Moreover, the criteria defining clinical improvement are still discussed. More generally, clinical testing in comparison with placebo and reference drugs is particularly important for anxiolytic drugs. The optimal dose range should be investigated in phase I, evidence of sedative or disinhibiting effects, and in phase II, defining the minimal active dose. Longer duration of treatment should be scrutinized in phase III, in order to check on long-term efficacy, recurrences and relapses. The effects of drug withdrawal should also be studied: withdrawal syndrome, rebound, recurrence, dependence. It currently looks difficult to market new anxiolytic drugs, and clinical research mainly provides an extension of the indications for antidepressant drugs in anxiety.","2072":"The existence of endogenous benzodiazepines such as diazepam and nordiazepam has been provided in human blood and brains as well as in medicinal plants and foods. It must be stressed, however, that in plasma and brain tissue there are also other benzodiazepine-like compounds termed 'endozepines' which are not halogenated. A synthetic pathway for the production of benzodiazepine-like compounds and endozepines has not yet been found, hence it may be surmised that these compounds could be of exogenous source. Changes in the level of endogenous circulating benzodiazepines due to food or drug ingestion could be responsible for pathological conditions. Clinical experiments were designed in order to study the levels of the endogenous benzodiazepines in vegetables and in the blood of control subjects and of cirrhotic patients. These patients accumulate benzodiazepines because of decreased liver metabolization capacity and impaired renal secretion, reaching plasma concentrations similar to those recorded in commercial benzodiazepine consumers.","2073":"","2074":"The French network of Regional Pharmacovigilance Centres evaluated in 1997 the prevalence of adverse effects of drugs (AED). In 1998, and again with the support of the French Drug Agency, in collaboration with the company CEMKA for economic evaluations, the incidence of AED-related hospitalizations in the medical department of French public hospitals was studied. The evaluation was performed over 14 consecutive days in 62 hospital departments, which were selected randomly. The total number of 3137 patients were hospitalized for a mean duration of 9 days and they were using a mean number of six different drugs. Taking into account the number of about 4 million patients admitted per year in the hospitals represented, it was estimated that the total number of AED-related hospitalizations amounts to about 130,000 annually (CI95%: 100,916-156,620). Using established cost calculations for hospitalized days (AP-HP, results of 1996) the mean cost for an AED-related hospitalization was estimated to be about FF16,000.","2075":"Data concerning the reasons for consultation and the use of NSAIDs were collected in 4643 patients, seen by 126 GPs over 2 days' consultation. In all, 11.6 per cent took NSAIDs. They were older (49 vs. 46 years, p = 0.02), took more drugs (3 vs. 2.5, p &lt; 0.01), and more had ADRs (8 vs 2 per cent) than non-users, even after correction for age, sex and number of drugs taken. Some 33 per cent of NSAID users also took adjuvant medication for the prevention of gastric injury (including with COX-2 inhibitors meloxicam, nimesulide). Estimated excess costs associated with NSAID use were high, related to excess consultations (GP or specialist, for ADRs, approx. 5-8 million Euros per year in France) and to use of preventive medication (100 million Euros per year at least).","2076":"125 oncologists, taken at random from a French professional list, followed up a cohort of 836 patients suffering from advanced breast cancer and treated by chemotherapy. The following data were collected prospectively: socio-demographics of patients and practitioners, disease history, characteristics of one chemotherapy cycle (type, utility and cost). A total of 89 chemotherapy combinations were described during the first-line treatment, independently of doses, eight combinations representing 70 per cent of all the prescriptions. No statistically significant differences were found when comparing the utility of the most often used combinations. Chemotherapy was the main cost driver of administration, rising to 90 per cent of the total cost when using taxans, followed by CSF. The cost price of taxan administration was twice to three times that of FEC or vinorelbine associations. These differences were poorly taken into account by the French budget allocation system as based on Diagnosis Related Groups.","2077":"Positive and negative effects of long-term therapy are sometimes difficult to highlight, for instance in gerontology or in respiratory medicine, and the use of computerized data may be a good alternative. Data collection is made of three steps. First, a study population is identified from disease criteria. All treatments used during a given study period are then extracted from computerized files; these data may be linked, when needed, to detailed patient surveys. Finally, all outcomes of the study period are retrieved, possibly using validated proxies. This method also allows for assessment of the quality of prescribing and the burden of disease. Asthma studies are used as examples.","2078":"Data on refundable pharmaceutical drugs are numerous and of various kinds. The clinical approach and the economic approach could be used together. This new approach allows for not only the synthesis but also the structuring of all the available information. The new information obtained is involved in decision trees.","2079":"Pharmacoepidemiology aims to complete the evaluation of drugs made before approval, by providing reliable information concerning effectiveness, safety and utilization of medicines in realistic conditions. The goal may be only descriptive or aetiological. In the latter, the conclusions from observational studies can be jeopardized by systematic errors and cannot achieve the robustness of experimental designs. According to directionality, three main types of studies can be identified: cross-sectional, prospective and retrospective. Prospective and retrospective studies can be based on a single group (descriptive studies) or include a reference group (comparative or aetiologic studies). The interest of prospective studies is reduced when (1) the incidence of the considered event becomes low or (2) one intends to assess the effects of various causal factors. Retrospective studies are approaching their limits when (1) the prevalence of the exposure is low in the source-population or (2) several events or outcomes are concerned.","2080":"","2081":"Some drugs have been reported to induce severe ventricular arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes, and have been responsible in some cases for sudden death of patients. Although the mechanisms of these arrhythmias are not well understood, they are often, but not always, associated with QT interval prolongation. Regulatory authorities (CPMP in Europe) have recently pointed out the necessity to assess most carefully the potential, especially of non-cardiovascular drugs, for QT interval prolongation. Different methodological approaches are presented in this paper and experimental protocols are suggested; limitations and advantages of the presently available in vitro and in vivo models are discussed. It appears that both in vitro and in vivo approaches are complementary. In particular it is pointed out that only the in vitro models using isolated cardiac tissues (Purkinje fibres or papillary muscles) enable assessment of the drug properties under low cardiac rhythm conditions. This model allows us to mimic pathological situations of long QT interval (such as acquired or congenital long QT syndrome) in which most of the major clinical problems are encountered. Finally, a strategy for the preclinical assessment of the potential of a molecule for QT interval prolongation is presented.","2082":"Telemetry allows the monitoring of multiple parameters, such as blood pressure, temperature, motor activity and ECG, without any stressful handling or restraint. The invasive phase (i.e. the surgical implantation of a transmitter), which takes place before the start of the study, is of critical importance. Good surgical techniques as described below are essential. All risks of trauma or infection should be avoided, particularly if the animals are to be used in long-term studies. The utility of telemetry may be complemented with other atraumatic techniques, for instance the use of indwelling i.v. infusion catheters allowing long-term studies without any extrinsic stress resulting from the dosing procedure or routine examinations.","2083":"The kidneys are an important target for toxic effects of drug candidates. It is mandatory to select accurate, clinically relevant parameters in order to be in a position to detect putative nephrotoxic effects during the safety pharmacology programme. The glomerular filtration rate appears to be of major interest since it is associated with the definition of acute renal failure. Measurement of the renal blood flow, proteinuria, enzymuria, fractional excretion of sodium, etc. are also highly useful to detect any possible renal impact of a new compound. Although the rat is, by far, the most widely used animal species, there are no specific (clinically relevant) reasons to choose it. Various parameters may vary according to the species, sex, strain, age, etc. Since in most cases acute renal failure occurs following administration of drugs in patients with pre-existing risk factors, it is suggested that sensitized animal models be validated and used (salt depletion, dehydration, co-administration of pharmacologic agents, etc.).","2084":"Safety pharmacology, a discipline unrecognized until the last few years, is now the subject of Japanese, American, European and ICH draft guidelines. The aim of these guidelines, either of a general nature or targeted at one particular organ, is to define the necessary pharmacology studies as well as the conditions in which these studies must be performed to ensure the safe use of new molecules when they are administered to man. This presentation attempts to give a comparative analysis of these documents and to place them in the context of future international harmonization.","2085":"Many drugs affect respiration in man. The changes in respiratory function following their administration are due to a direct effect on the respiratory system or are the consequence of a central, metabolic (alteration of the acid-base balance) or vascular effect (pulmonary hypertension). Regulatory documents (CPMP, FDA and MHW drafts) are in agreement in considering the respiratory system as a vital function to explore during safety pharmacology studies. On the basis of these recommendations, the first studies to be performed should be on conscious unrestrained animals, in general the drug being administered as a single dose. The effects on the respiratory function are best studied by plethysmography in the guinea-pig or rat. The measurement of ventilatory parameters--respiratory rate, tidal volume, inspiratory time, expiratory time, peak inspiratory flow, peak exploratory flow and resistance--allow the differentiation between drugs affecting respiratory control and those altering lung mechanical properties. The pulmonary hypertension risk could be evaluated in the dog during haemodynamic studies. Finally, the study of the effects on blood gases should always be carried out in conscious animals, usually in the dog. For drugs belonging to pharmacological classes presenting a high respiratory risk, complementary studies should be considered. The extrapolation from healthy persons to ill patients (especially chronic respiratory insufficiency patients) of the incurred risk is often difficult. For this reason, it is very useful to study the effect of such drugs on the respiratory function of pathological animals.","2086":"The cardiovascular system is one of the primary vital functions which have to be examined during safety pharmacology studies. Cardiovascular system functioning is maintained by cardiac electrical activity and by pump-muscle function which contribute to haemodynamic efficacy. The aim of cardiovascular safety pharmacology is to evaluate the effects of test substances on the most pertinent components of this system, in order to detect potentially undesirable effects, before engaging in clinical trials. In the basic programme, a detailed haemodynamic evaluation is carried out in the anaesthetized dog. It is completed by cardiac and\/or cellular electrophysiology investigations in order to assess the arrhythmogenic risk. The basic programme can be preceded by rapid and simple testing procedures, during the early drug discovery stage. It should be completed, if necessary, by specific supplementary studies, depending on the data obtained during the early clinical trials. The following article describes and presents an analytic strategy aimed at problems of cardiovascular risk.","2087":"Some of the results formerly included in the dossiers under the heading of 'General Pharmacology: Central Nervous System' were intended to document most of the information now covered by the CNS Safety Pharmacology. This paper allows to point out some general experimental conditions relating to the choice of (1) suitable animal species whose use should be advocated, (2) the route by which the effects of the drugs should be studied and (3) the controls of the experimental context (surroundings, temperature, schedules of the trials, interference with food-intake episodes, influence of noises and smells, expertise of the experimental staff) likely to optimize the predictive value of the trials. Besides the core of investigations recommended by most of the regulatory authorities (changes in gross behaviour, motor coordination, locomotor activity, interaction with hypnotics, convulsant potential), the need to include or not some investigations such as EEG studies and the prediction of adverse events, such as anxiolytic and amnesia potentials, is considered. The place, within the scope of CNS Safety Pharmacology, of studies intended to document the potential for drug abuse and dependence is mentioned and some information given about the methods generally used.","2088":"In an attempt to study the functional aspects of respiratory mucin secretion and the effects of mediators of inflammation on the release of M1\/MUC5AC mucins in airways diseases, an ex vivo human bronchial model of mucin secretion was developed. Anti-M1 mucin monoclonal antibodies raised against the peptidic core of ovarian cyst M1 mucins were used. PAS and Alcian blue stainings of sections of bronchial rings revealed the presence of mucins in epithelial goblet cells as well as in glandular mucous cells. Immunohistochemical labelling of these sections with anti-M1 monoclonal antibodies revealed a preferential localization of M1\/MUC5AC mucins in epithelial goblet cells. Functional studies were performed on this bronchial model using various secretagogues (methacholine, leukotrienes D4 and anti-human immunoglobulin E antibodies). No statistical difference of M1\/MUC5AC mucin secretion was observed after a one-hour stimulation of bronchial rings with these agents. The development of an ex vivo functional human bronchial model of mucin secretion and the use of specific anti-M1 antibodies are essential tools in studying the regulation of the M1\/MUC5AC mucin release from human airways.","2089":"3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, or statins, are hypocholesterolaemic agents used in the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia and cardiovascular diseases. Their hypocholesterolaemic action results from the inhibition of the intracellular synthesis of cholesterol via the mevalonate pathway. Recent studies have demonstrated that cholesterol is not the only intracellular target of statins. Indeed, statins have been shown to inhibit protein isoprenylation, a post-translational modification involved in membrane localization and protein activity. By inhibiting isoprenylation of Ras protein, statins induce the inhibition of the Ras-AP1 pathway and the decrease in cell proliferation. Similarly, inhibition of Rho protein insoprenylation leads to the disorganization of the cytoskeleton and the induction of the fibrinolytic system. All these effects need to be confirmed in vivo and in the human, and open new areas for these therapeutics agents.","2090":"Experimental models based on the culture of cells within tridimensional (3-D) gels add a 3-D organization to the classical 2-D culture of vascular cells. They allow the study of cell structure in an environment which is more representative of the in vivo situation and the investigation of cellular functions which cannot be studied using the basic 2-D models. This review shows examples of the use of cultures of vascular cells (endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells as well as fibroblasts) in 3-D collagen matrices for the study of cellular functions as diverse as angiogenesis, extracellular matrix reorganization, migration through 3-D collagen gels or phenotype modulation. It also describes recent advances in the in vitro reconstruction of biological blood vessels by bioengineering. A method for the preparation of 3-D collagen gels is described.","2091":"Leukotrienes are 5-lipoxygenase-derived arachidonic acid metabolites. In addition to their bronchoconstrictor effects, leukotrienes are also important modulators of the vascular tone which may exert paradoxical effects. Indeed, depending on the vascular tone (in either the basal or norepinephrine-precontracted state), leukotrienes are capable of inducing either contraction or relaxation. These paradoxical effects of leukotrienes depend on the vascular bed and the species investigated. Since urinary LTE4 excretion is increased in various cardiovascular diseases, including arterial pulmonary hypertension or cardiac ischaemia, the study of the effects of leukotrienes on human vascular preparations is of interest. This article reviews the in vitro evidence linking cysteinyl leukotrienes to the modulation of the vascular tone on human vascular preparations.","2092":"Adverse effects of NSAIDs are serious, mainly related to gastrointestinal bleeding, and throughout the world cause about 260,000 hospitalizations and 26,000 deaths a year, but each day at least thirty million patients take NSAIDs. Selective COX-2 inhibitors (i.e. celecoxib, rofecoxib) have demonstrated in clinical trials better gastrointestinal tolerability but their safety in patients with active ulcer, cardiovascular or renal disease has still to be further investigated. When their long-term safety has been established by pharmacovigilance studies they could be prescribed in the at-risk population or for other indications, including pre-term labour, colorectal cancer and Alzheimer's disease, provided they have shown efficacy and safety in controlled trials.","2093":"Allergic and pseudoallergic reactions frequently occur in hospitalized patients and represent up to one-third of adverse drug reactions. Allergic reactions are unpredictable reactions, related to immunologic mechanisms. Pseudoallergic reactions mimic allergic reactions but no drug-specific antibody or T-cell proliferation can be demonstrated. Clinical presentations are numerous and heterogeneous, from a mild urticaria to a dramatic anaphylactic shock and an extensive bullous skin disease. A true diagnosis is rarely set up and the tools for it are lacking. In this review, we will focus on some epidemiological data concerning these reactions, including data on incidence, mortality and cost.","2094":"Drugs are able to activate the immune system, which may generate hypersensitivity states in individuals. This article first deals with the critical processes that are involved in drug sensitizations: what are the specific features of drugs as immunogens; how are drugs recognized as non-self by activated immune cells; what is the spontaneous outcome of an immune response to drugs in individuals; does a genetic predisposition regulate the immune response to drug antigens; how much are biotransformation processes involved in the immunogenicity of drugs? The second part is mostly devoted to the biological investigation of drug sensitizations: what are we looking for and why; are all the available methods equally suitable for routine diagnosis; what are the major methological problems that we have to deal with in investigating patients who have presented with symptoms which are clinically suspected to be of immuno-allergic origin?","2095":"","2096":"In 1998, 77 cases of accidental ingestion of paracetamol paediatric syrup (Efferalgan) in children were notified to the Marseille Poison Centre. In a quarter of them, the alleged dose taken was greater than the toxic dose. Ingestion was mainly due to the child opening the bottle. The proximate marketing of a product with a child-proof top, which should allow the number of accidents to be reduced. Doctors and pharmacists should be informed rapidly, so that they can warn the families who still have the old type of bottle.","2097":"","2098":"","2099":"The extracts of six plants selected on the basis of folk-medicine reports were examined for their antibacterial effects against eight pathogenic bacteria. The results showed that n-butanol extract of Calotropis procera proved to be the most effective against the bacteria tested using the paper disc diffusion method. The antiprotozoal activity was also examined and showed that ethyl ether extract of Sium nodiflorum exhibits a parasiticidal effect against Trichomonas intestinalis and vaginalis.","2100":"Ethyl ether, ethyl acetate and n.butanol extracts of Cotula cinerea L. were tested for their antiprotozoal activity against two species of Trichomonas: Trichomonas intestinalis and Trichomonas vaginalis. It has been found that the growth of both Trichomonas was significantly inhibited.","2101":"From ancient times, Peganum harmala was claimed to be an important medicinal plant. Its seeds were known to possess hypothermic, and essentially hallucinogenic properties. Various authors have undertaken studies on the antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral effects of Peganum harmala seeds, but studies on the antitumour activity are not to be found in the literature. In Moroccan traditional medicine, seed powder is sometimes used on skin and subcutaneous tumours. This work was designed to investigate some aspects of the antineoplastic properties of the plant Peganum. Varying concentrations (10 to 120 micrograms\/ml) of total alkaloid extracts of Peganum harmala seeds (collected in Morocco) were tested in vitro on four tumoural cell-lines: Med-mek and UCP-Med carcinoma, UCP-Med sarcoma and Sp2\/O-Ag14. In vivo experiments were performed with the Sp2\/O cell-line grafted subcutaneously in syngenic BALB\/c mice. In vitro, proliferation of tumoural cell lines was significantly reduced by all tested concentrations of the Peganum alkaloid extracts during the first 24 h of contact. A cell lysis effect occurred after 24 h and progressed to complete cell death within 48 to 72 h depending on the alkaloid concentration. Results obtained indicate that alkaloids of Peganum have a high cell toxicity in vitro. The active principle at a dose of 50 mg\/kg given orally to mice for 40 days was found to have significant antitumoural activity. Peganum harmala alkaloids thus possess significant antitumour potential, which could prove useful as a novel anticancer therapy.","2102":"Ferula communis is an ombelliferous plant of the Mediterranean regions. It is represented in Morocco by two varieties: brevifolia and genuina. The later is very rich in a soap or resinous gum. This product, collected from the roots, is largely used in traditional medicine. It is know as fessoukh in Morocco and other Arab countries. This plant is also well known for its toxicity and its anticoagulant activity. In the present review, are discussed: (1) the ethnobotany of the plant, especially medicinal uses of fessoukh in traditional medicine as well as alimentary use of young stems as legumes; (2) clinical and biochemical data of intoxication by this plant, which are dominated by haemorrhage as a consequence of blood coagulation disturbance; (3) 4-hydroxycoumarins isolated from Ferula communis L. and their anticoagulant activity; (4) the role of vitamin K1 in the treatment of poisoning by this plant.","2103":"The main objective of this work lies in the setting up of a database on plants used in medicines which is aimed at pharmacological development of plant resources in Morocco. We have, as a first step, made an inventory of different plant species involved in medicine making in Morocco. This survey dealt with 825 miscellaneous pharmaceutical products and reveals the use of 445 different plant species in medicine making. For each plant species, we have also noted the parts of the plant which are used in the pharmaceutical industry. Furthermore, we have taken an interest in plant extracts involved in this medicine making. The results show that in all these medicines contain 46 extracts of a vegetal nature. At the top of the list, menthol is used in the manufacture of 110 pharmaceutical products. Finally, an analysis per pharmaco-therapeutic family reveals the impact of the involvement of these plants on each of these families. In fact, it turns out that 204 plant species play a part in medicines classified in the family of gastro-entero-hepatology whereas only one plant is involved in anti-inflammatory medicines.","2104":"Experiments were performed on male and female spontaneously hypertensive rats weighing 310-340 g (10 animals per group). The oral administration of 200 mg\/kg\/day of saponins from Herniaria glabra for 30 days, resulted in a significant decrease in blood pressure in hypertensive rats. The systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly and respectively from 187.60 +\/- 20.63\/119.00 +\/- 7.09 mmHg at day 0 (D0) to 141.60 +\/- 7.51\/90.40 +\/- 7.68 mmHg at day 30 (D30), p &lt; 0.001 (vs. 186.30 +\/- 11.27\/114.10 +\/- 12.00 mm Hg at D0 to 154.50 +\/- 6.38\/132.3 +\/- 7.68 mmHg at D30 in furosemide-treated group, p &lt; 0.001). Control animals receiving placebo did not show any significant variation in the mean arterial pressure. The effect of saponins of Herniaria glabra on renal function was evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive rats using clearance techniques. Glomerular filtration rate was constant in the control rats and increased significantly in the hypertensive rats after saponins treatment (5.55 +\/- 0.32 vs. 6.03 +\/- 0.43 ml.min-1.kg-1 in the control (C) and saponins (S) groups, respectively, p &lt; 0.05). Saponins administration provoked an increase in urinary flow (59.38 +\/- 5.85 ml.kg-1.24 h-1 vs. 36.92 +\/- 5.17 ml.kg-1.24 h-1, p &lt; 0.001). Saponins also increased potassium excretion (6.89 +\/- 0.81 mmol.kg-1.24 h-1 vs. 5.40 +\/- 0.51 mmol.kg-1.24 h-1, p &lt; 0.001) and sodium excretion (10.74 +\/- 1.21 mmol.kg-1.24 h-1 vs. 7.25 +\/- 0.54 mmol.kg-1.24 h-1, p &lt; 0.001) as well as chloride excretion (13.59 +\/- 1.04 mmol. kg-1.24 h-1 vs. 9.67 +\/- 0.77 mmol.kg-1.24 h-1, p &lt; 0.001). It is concluded that chronic oral administration of saponins from Herniaria glabra decreased the arterial blood pressure and affected salt and water transport in renal tubules.","2105":"In this study, the antimicrobial activity of leaf extracts obtained from two species of genus Cistus L. was examined in vitro against five strains of bacteria and five strains of fungi. The species studied are Cistus villosus L. = incanus and Cistus monspeliensis L. All extracts showed inhibitory activity against microorganisms. These results encourage us towards further biological investigation.","2106":"To study the effect of Suaeda fruticosa in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism in the hypercholesterolaemic and insulin resistant sand rat, 25 rats were subjected to a high cholesterol diet for 90 days. On the 45th day the animals were divided into two groups: control and treated. Aqueous extract prepared in infusion at 10 per cent was administered orally at 1.5 ml per 100 g of body weight per day. On the 90th day, the control group developed a severe hyperlipidaemia, impaired glucose tolerance test and insulin resistance. Treatment by Suaeda fruticosa extract showed hypoglycaemic (41 per cent) and antihyperglycaemic (53 per cent) effects. Furthermore, the plant led to a decrease in plasma levels of insulin (31 per cent), total cholesterol (50 per cent), LDL cholesterol (55 per cent), VLDL cholesterol (49 per cent), oxidized LDL (40 per cent), lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (44 per cent), triglycerides (57 per cent) and free fatty acids (36 per cent). We concluded that Suaeda fruticosa aqueous extract contains at least two compounds responsible for hypoglycaemic and hypolipidaemic activities.","2107":"Sand rats fed a hypercaloric diet manifest obesity and diabetes. We have used this model to develop hypercholesterolaemia and describe the beneficial action of Olea europea var. oleaster leaves. Twenty-eight sand rats submitted to a high cholesterol diet for four months were assigned to control and treated groups. Plant decoction at 10 per cent was given orally for two months. Results showed that the control group exhibited hyperglycaemia, glucose intolerance, hypercholesterolaemia and moderate hyperinsulinaemia. Light microscopic study showed thickening of capillary walls in skin, pancreas and kidney. The treatment produced hypoglycaemic (43 per cent, p &lt; 0.001), antihyperglycaemic (48 per cent, p &lt; 0.001) and hypoinsulinaemic (39 per cent, p &lt; 0.01) activities. In addition, the plant presented a hypocholesterolaemic effect (47 per cent, p &lt; 0.001) accompanied by lowering of oxidized LDL (30 per cent, p &lt; 0.01). Accordingly, capillary wall thickening was reduced in skin and pancreas and completely prevented in kidney. The data demonstrate that oleaster leaves possess at least two active compounds to treat hypercholesterolaemia and diabetes.","2108":"Investigations were carried out to evaluate the hypoglycaemic activity of the infusions of Globularia alypum and Zygophyllum gaetulum. Oral and intraperitoneal administration of the plants (0.7 g\/kg) produced a significant hypoglycaemic effect in normal as well as in hyperglycaemic rats. The infusions increased significantly plasma insulin levels in normal rats. It is suggested that the hypoglycaemic activity of these plants may be mediated through enhancement of peripheral metabolism of glucose and an increase in insulin release.","2109":"Astragalus lusitanicus is a toxic legume grown in Morocco and in some other Mediterranean countries. In small ruminants, poisoning by this plant is dominated by nervous signs characterized by many cycles of excitement-depression. Macroscopic examination of poisoned animals showed congestive lesions and oedema in the brain and lungs. Microscopic lesions consisted mainly of vacuolar degeneration in neurons, hepatocytes and in spleen and kidney cells. Serum activity of AST and CK as well as blood glucose and urea were increased as a result of poisoning. However, serum activity of alpha-mannosidase was not modified as is the case in locoism. Chemical investigations showed that A. lusitanicus does not contain swainsonine or miserotoxin and its selenium concentration is very low. However, this legume contains indolizidin alkaloids and a first compound was purified and identified.","2110":"An acute toxicity study of twelve medicinal plants on Swiss albino mice has been carried out. The extracts were administered orally at a dose of 1 g\/kg body weight. Animals were observed for 7 days and changes in weight and behaviour were noted. On the eighth day, the animals were sacrificed and an anatomo-histopathologic survey was undertaken. The results showed a change in behaviour and some histologic modifications following the administration of certain plant extracts.","2111":"The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of smoking habits on safety of trandolapril assessed by interrogation and by visual analogue scales (VAS). A total of 3402 hypertensive smokers (&gt; or = 1 cigarette\/d for at least 6 months) and non-smokers (no smoking or ceased at least 6 months previously) received trandolapril 2 mg\/d for 4 weeks. The safety profile of trandolapril was assessed by both interrogation and by VAS. The VAS completed by the patients at D0 and D28 explored the following symptoms: asthenia, nausea, cough, headaches and dizziness. A significant change in cough VAS was previously defined by an at least 19 mm change. VAS analysis was performed on 2840 patients (1296 smokers and 1544 non-smokers), mean age 59 +\/- 12 years. Smokers and non-smokers were significantly different for age 56 +\/- 12 years vs. 62 +\/- 12 years, sex ratio 74 per cent males vs. 45 per cent, history of hypertension 4.5 +\/- 6.1 years vs. 5.3 +\/- 6.5 years and cough VAS score at D0 35 +\/- 26 mm vs. 20 +\/- 21 mm. In the total population, 214 adverse events were reported by 177 patients (5.2 per cent). The most frequent adverse events were a cough (2.1 per cent), bronchitis (0.6 per cent), headaches (0.5 per cent), rhinitis (0.4 per cent), nausea (0.4 per cent) and asthenia (0.3 per cent). Cough was reported by 23 smokers (1.5 per cent) and by 49 (2.6 per cent) non-smokers (p = 0.02). In the VAS population, 151 adverse events were reported by 130 patients, 47 smokers (3.6 per cent) and 83 non-smokers (5.4 per cent, p = 0.03). The difference between the two groups was mainly due to a cough: 15 smokers (1.2 per cent) reported a cough vs. 38 non-smokers (2.5 per cent, p = 0.01) and 77 smokers (5.9 per cent) presented a significant change of cough VAS score vs. 124 non-smokers (8.0 per cent, p = 0.03). In this large scale study, 1.9 per cent of patients treated with trandolapril exhibited a cough. Smokers were less likely to present a cough. Use of VAS confirmed this trend.","2112":"Renal failure, proteinuria and proximal tubular acidosis are the features of cidofovir renal toxicity, its main side-effect. Proteinuria occurs in more than 40 per cent of patients and correlates with early renal dysfunction. A fall in serum potassium, bicarbonate, uric acid, calcium and phosphorus levels associated with glucosuria is the hallmark of proximal tubular acidosis. Most of the patients exhibit only glucosuria. Renal failure, diagnosed in 12 per cent of treated patients, is a late feature, usually discovered after the onset of proteinuria and glucosuria. Prevention of cidofovir-induced renal toxicity involves a search for other risk factors, probenecid treatment, and requires an optimal hydration status.","2113":"A total of 125 inpatients from a rheumatology unit were interviewed to assess their awareness of the rules for using a prescribed NSAID. Two per cent were unaware that they were receiving an NSAID, and 13 per cent and 71 per cent respectively did not know the name or the dosage. Twenty-two per cent admitted excessive intake, and 2 per cent simultaneous intake of two NSAIDs. Some declared that in the absence of adequate improvement they would take another NSAID (17 per cent) or aspirin (26 per cent) simultaneously. Fifty-nine per cent were unaware that aspirin is an anti-inflammatory drug, 3 per cent thought that taking a double dosage on alternate days was safe, and 46 per cent that taking a stronger dose at the beginning of treatment was an efficient and safe procedure. The replies of patients who had read the directions for use (69 per cent) did not differ from those of patients who had not (31 per cent). Fourteen per cent of patients declared that they would not advise their physicians after buying NSAIDs over the counter.","2114":"Familial adenomatous polyposis is a rare genetic disease characterized by the development of colorectal adenomatous polyps. Extracolonic digestive and extra-digestive manifestations can also appear. Inevitably, colorectal cancer occurs if a colectomy is not performed. Sulindac is an indolic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory indole drug which decreases colonic tumoral proliferation. The different trials published since 1983 have shown that sulindac caused regression of colorectal adenomatous polyps, but it does not affect the other manifestations of familial adenomatous polyposis. However, colorectal polyps recurred after cessation of this therapy; the effect of long-term sulindac therapy is unknown; and sulindac may cause, as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, digestive side-effects. Moreover, treatment with sulindac does not completely eliminate the risk of cancer. For patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, total colectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is the recommended procedure for most patients. However, sulindac is useful for patients who have had subtotal colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis, if these patients have only a few rectal stump polyps and accept regular and strict follow-up of the rectal stump. Sulindac is also indicated for patients who have not undergone colectomy because surgery is contraindicated or has been refused.","2115":null,"2116":"","2117":"","2118":"","2119":"","2120":"","2121":"","2122":"","2123":"The laws regulating the practice of clinical research in France, in particular the law of 20 December 1988, the so-called Huriet's law, constitute a major advance for medical progress. However, their implementation by administrative offices generates practical difficulties which impair the development of applied research in human beings. Beyond the laws themselves, it appears that our institutions are unprepared to optimize the conduct of such research. This round table sought to list the existing problems and to propose constructive solutions or objectives to be reached to optimize clinical research in France, with a view to improving French participation in international collaborative programmes, notably European ones. Evaluation of projects and practices, financial support and accounting, and some aspects of existing laws have been identified as the major sources of our difficulties. Harmonization and clarification of our procedures as well as improvement of training should be our primary objectives to achieve a higher level of medical, scientific, financial and administrative quality in the conduct of clinical research. Creation of a referential Web site, designed and updated by a central public organization, is an imperative step towards reaching these objectives.","2124":"Toxicology covers a very large scientific area, needing specialists in the main basic disciplines involved, and generalists with a large and practical overview. Academic education, consequently, should take this necessity into account. This education is presently satisfactory in France, even if some adjustments are necessary, for the specialists but is inadequate for the generalists, whereas an important need exists in industry. It should be emphasized that toxicology is a profession and consequently practical experience is essential, as well as continuing education. In view of this situation, an evaluation of toxicologists in the course of their professional activities is necessary. In the USA, this evaluation is devolved to the American Board of Toxicology and in Europe to the Eurotox Accreditation. In conclusion of the Round Table, 8 recommendations are proposed.","2125":"A therapeutic strategy is a hierarchical set of appropriate measures to provide an answer to a pathological state. A drug is a part of this set (together with the diagnosis, the environment and the other medicinal interventions or not). A new drug's place in a therapeutic strategy can be evaluated according to one or several referential(s) when it (or they) exist, referentials which express the state of knowledge before launch of the new drug. The drug's profile (indication or contraindication, etc.), at the point when the marketing authorization is given, is purely theoretical. One must evaluate the real place of the drug under its real conditions of use (pragmatic trials, observable surveys). A new drugs' place in a therapeutic strategy can only be evaluated in the course of time unless a therapeutic revolution occurs.","2126":"During the National Meeting of Clinical Pharmacology (Giens 1998), the working group exchanged information and examined the new therapeutic approaches to inflammation in asthma. The group performed a state of the art review of the current research on mediators of bronchial inflammation to determine new pharmacological targets of therapeutic interest. An update on the development of potential drugs acting on these targets was established. Specificities related to asthma in terms of evaluation and development of anti-inflammatory drugs were discussed. The place of pharmaco-economy in the development of anti-asthmatic drugs was specified.","2127":"The discovery of an inducible form of cyclooxygenase (COX-2) requires a refinement of the theory that inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity explains both therapeutic effects and side-effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Selective COX-2 inhibitors have demonstrated in clinical trials a significantly better gastrointestinal tolerability than classical NSAIDs, for the same anti-inflammatory activity. Their tolerability in patients with active ulcer or with a recent history of ulcer as well as in patients suffering from cardiovascular or renal diseases has still to be investigated in detail. Their therapeutic potential in several new indications, including pre-term labour, colorectal cancer and Alzheimer's disease, is currently being investigated.","2128":"Insufficient drug evaluation in children and the lack of adapted pharmaceutical formulations explain the importance of unlicensed and off-label prescriptions. As a consequence a regulation proposed in the USA by the Food and Drug Administration, requiring manufactures to assess the safety and effectiveness of new drugs in paediatric patients, has recently been adopted. Appropriate means to facilitate drug evaluation in children are now necessary in terms of recruitment and methodology. A ten-centre American Pediatric Pharmacology Research Unit network has been created and is being financed by the National Institute of Health. A similar trend is evolving in Europe. Appropriate drug utilization in children requires adequate formulations, administration devices and information as well as improved knowledge on the long-term potential consequences of drug use during growth and maturation.","2129":"In the last few years, a worldwide reorganization affecting the entire pharmaceutical industry has begun and is now accelerating.

Special attention is mandatory in prescribing biological exploration because of the many physiological or pharmacological interferences which can modify the results. Identification of a genetic defect may induce specific management and individuals should receive counselling regarding the implications of this diagnosis. Further prospective studies should help to determine the thrombotic risk in symptomatic and non-symptomatic patients with inherited thrombophilia and the risk\/benefit ratio of laboratory screening for hereditary thrombophilia and therapeutic intervention.","2131":"Efficacy indices do not contain the same information although they are all combinations of the same two quantities. Therefore, one should choose the proper index. Actually, none is entirely appropriate. Each more or less meets the specifications, depending on the underlying effect model for the therapy considered. However, one can say that the absolute benefit is more appropriate from the patient's point of view, the relative from the scientific point of view and the number of patients to treat from the policy maker's point of view. Nevertheless, this classification needs to be considered with caution. Finally, it emerges from the review that none is fully relevant to express the efficacy of a therapy, even in the most suitable condition, the acute illness.","2132":"The stability and compatibility of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in admixtures for continuous intravenous infusion using PVC bags and administration sets were studied. 5-fluorouracil was reconstituted and diluted to 1.8 mg\/ml for infusion in polyvinyl chloride and glass containers, and to 1 mg\/ml to 16 mg\/ml for storage in polyvinyl chloride bags containing 5 per cent dextrose or 0.9 per cent sodium chloride injections. Admixtures were stored at +4 degrees C and with protection from light, for 7 days. Analyses were performed by HPLC. No significant drug loss was observed during simulated infusions using PVC infusion bags and administration sets vs glass bottles and administration sets, over an infusion period used in hospitals (24 h). The solution stored at +4 degrees C with protection from light in PVC bags showed that at 1 mg\/ml to 16 mg\/ml, 5-fluorouracil was stable at least for 7 days in 0.9 per cent sodium chloride and 5 per cent dextrose.","2133":"Baclofen (4-amino-3-(4-chlorophenyl)butyric acid) is the only selective agonist for GABA-B receptors. Its R-(-)-enantiomer is about 100 times more active than the S-(+)-enantiomer. In the search for new compounds that bind to GABA-B receptors, it is very important to clarify the structural requirements. The authors report the synthesis and separation of isomers of various 3-heteroaromatic (benzo[b]furan and thiophen) aminobutyric acids. The 4-amino-3-(7-methylbenzo[b]furan-2-yl)butanoic acid is a potent and specific ligand for GABA-B receptors, with an IC50 value of 5.4 microM for the displacement of [3H] GABA.","2134":"The synthesis and psychotropic activity of 1,5-diakyl-1,5-benzodiazepine-2,4-dithiones (alkyl = methyl, ethyl and benzyl radicals) were studied. Alkylation reactions were performed in catalytic conditions by phase transfer. These reactions allowed us to isolate only one kind of product N-alkyl. Acute toxicity studies were conducted according to European protocols in two species of appropriate mammals in order to discover the lethal doses. The activity of the compounds on the CNS was then studied, using a battery of compartmental tests used in psychopharmacology. No toxicity was demonstrated at therapeutic doses. Each product had a sedative effect more or less pronounced and different from the reference substance clobazam (Urbanyl). They also had myorelaxant and anxiolytic effects, even lengthening the hypnotic effect of thiopental (synergic action).","2135":"As part of the synthesis of the benzimidazole derivative heterocyclique system, we are interested in studying the condensation of the o-phenylenediamines with amino-acids such as aspartic acid, serine and histidine. The interest that these present is based mainly on their pharmacological properties. They have, in fact anti-inflammatory, antidepressive, antibacterial and antihistamine properties. On the other hand, it should be noted that 5,6-dimethyl-1-(alpha-D-ribofuranosyl) benzimidazole constitutes part of vitamin B12. Taken together, these results led us to pursue our research in this domain while focusing on new methods of benzimidazolic derivative synthesis. It should be said that the obtaining of these compounds depends on the quantity of the amino-acid. All synthesized products have been characterized by infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry.","2136":"While mitochondria are key factors in energy production in cells they are also key factors in their life cycle because under certain circumstances they can provoke cellular apoptosis. Some 45 per cent of myocardial volume is taken up by mitochondria. Furthermore, mitochondria are key to many aspects of neuronal activity and can trigger neurodegenerative processes. Lipid oxidation is responsible for the production of much ATP resynthesis in the heart but this process is less oxygen efficient than glucose oxidation. During ischaemia, lipid oxidation is suddenly blocked, but markedly increased during reperfusion, causing accumulation of potentially toxic metabolites (acylcarnitines, acyl-CoA, lysophospholipids). These metabolites can change calcium handling, inducing arrhythmias. Trimetazidine, and another product in development, ranolazine, by inhibiting lipid oxidation favours glucose oxidation and inhibits the production of deleterious lipid metabolites. Thus this class of drugs can have beneficial effects on myocardial metabolism without direct haemodynamic effects.","2137":null,"2138":"In Morocco, neurosyphilis is a serious public health problem. In the neurology service at the specialist hospital in Rabat, two drug treatments were used. Treatment A consisted of infusion over a period of 4 h of 20 MUI of penicillin G per day for 3 weeks. Treatment B consisted of infusion over a period of 6 h of 30 MUI of penicillin G per day for 10 days. Each treatment was tested on a group of eight neurosyphilitic patients as first-line treatment. On the first day of treatment, both blood and CSF pharmacokinetics were sampled for each patient. Blood and CSF were taken within 24 h. Penicillin G concentrations were determined by a microbiological method. The results obtained showed that perfusions of either 20 MUI or 30 MUI of penicillin allowed the achievement of high serum concentrations. These increased progressively until reaching their maximum at T4 h for treatment A (from 92.33 to 106.38 micrograms\/ml). For treatment B, maximal concentration is obtained at T6 h (from 108 to 141.52 micrograms\/ml). Penicillin concentrations decreased immediately after stopping the perfusion. At CSF levels, penicillin G concentrations were identical to serum concentrations. However, one difference was observed: a one-hour difference between the serum and CSF peaks. The CSF peak was achieved at T5 h for treatment A (0.063 to 2.25 micrograms\/ml) and at T7 h for treatment B (0.92 to 2.94 micrograms\/ml). The concentrations obtained were largely superior to the CMI of Treponema pallidum for both treatment A and treatment B, at 47 times and 82 times higher respectively. The recovery time of the patients was 14 h for treatment A and 24 h for B treatment. These results have shown that therapeutic method B was more efficient than A. Moreover, the evolution of penicillin G's diffusion in the CSF during treatment, of cell counts of protein level, of the VDRL test and of the gamma-globulin rate was studied.","2139":"Polymorphonuclear neutrophils are the predominant cells in acute inflammatory lesions and their functions and recruitment are regulated by cytokines, including IL1, TNF and IL8. Antibiotic modulation of inflammatory effects has stimulated investigations of antibiotics for their potential activity as immunomodulators over their primary bactericidal or bacteriostatic activities. This study reports the influence of macrolides, spiramycin and dirithromycin on IL1 beta production. Mononuclear cells, isolated from healthy human volunteers, were preincubated with macrolides (0.1 to 500 micrograms\/ml) and stimulated by Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. Then, IL1 beta production was detected by western blotting analysis. At therapeutic concentrations, dirithromycin and spiramycin seemed to enhance IL1 beta production by LPS-stimulated cells, with +37 per cent and +28 per cent at 1 microgram\/ml respectively. At supratherapeutic concentrations, these drugs seemed to inhibit IL1 beta production through protein kinase C inhibition, with inhibitory concentrations 50 per cent of 378 micrograms\/ml for dirithromycin and 234 micrograms\/ml for spiramycin. So, macrolides may modulate the host defence system through their influence on cytokine production.","2140":"In previous studies, we have shown that the rate of cell swelling induced by concentrative proline uptake in isolated rat hepatocytes decreased by 50 per cent after only 24 h of cold storage in University of Wisconsin (UW) solution, thereby representing a sensitive marker of alterations in hepatocyte functions after cold preservation and rewarming. We have thus used concentrative proline uptake to compare the capacity of UW and sodium-lactobionate-sucrose (SLS) solutions to maintain such differentiated hepatocyte functions. Isolated rat hepatocytes were kept at 4 degrees C for 4, 10, 24 and 48 h in UW or SLS solutions, and subsequently cultured at 37 degrees C for 1-2 h. Viability was measured by Trypan blue exclusion. After rewarming, cells were subjected to a 10 min administration of 10 mM proline and accumulation of the amino acid was assessed by changes in cell volume as measured by digital analysis of single-cell images obtained under bright-field illumination. Cell viability was reduced gradually and significantly after 0 to 48 h of preservation, and rewarming amplified this effect. However, loss of viability was similar in UW- and SLS-stored cells, as were initial steady-state cell volumes. Proline-induced swelling rate was reduced significantly by 13, 46 and by 57 per cent after 10, 24 and 48 h of preservation in UW solution, respectively. There is no significant difference between SLS- and UW-preserved hepatocyte swelling rates after 10 h and 48 h of cold preservation. However, the decline in the swelling rate of SLS-preserved hepatocytes incubated for 24 h is significantly lower than that of their UW-preserved counterparts. These results show that the SLS solution can preserve differentiated hepatic functions as well as the UW solution does.","2141":"The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of neomycin on monoamine contents of rat striatal tissue. The analysis was performed by HPLC with electrochemical detection. Rats were injected with neomycin (2 mg\/kg; i.p.) and killed at different times over 24 h. The striatal homogenate was injected in a reversed-phase HPLC. Results showed a significant increase in dopamine tissue level (+35 per cent; 4 h after neomycin injection) and a decrease (-36 per cent) in the level of its metabolites. Striatal serotonin level showed a rapid and significant (p &lt; 0.001) increase, +130 per cent, 2 h after neomycin injection. DOPAC\/DA and 5HIAA\/5HT ratios were reduced by 34 per cent and 46 per cent respectively. These results indicate an inhibitory effect of neomycin on striatal dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems. Several mechanisms could be involved in these effects of neomycin in the biosynthesis process through stimulation of tyrosine hydroxylase and tryptophane hydroxylase and\/or MAO and COMT activities. The blockage of calcium channels was also suggested.","2142":"The inferior colliculus (IC) is the initiation site in the neuronal network for the epileptic audiogenic seizure (AGS). The present study investigates the effects of alteration of IC cholinergic transmission on the elicitation of epileptic seizures. Unilateral microinjections of carbachol (3 and 6 micrograms\/0.2 microliter) into the IC elicited intense locomotor activity, contraversive rotations and myoclonic seizures. This result indicates that the IC is the initiation site for the induction of myoclonic seizures and suggests that these myoclonic seizures may result from activation of m1 muscarinic receptors. Microinjections of the nicotinic-muscarinic antagonist, gallamine (2 and 6 micrograms\/0.2 microliter), into the IC induced AGS susceptibility. However, microinjections of muscarinic antagonists, atropine (15 micrograms\/0.2 microliter) and scopolamine (12 and 20 micrograms\/0.2 microliter), or the nicotinic antagonist, hexamethonium (12 and 20 micrograms\/0.2 microliter), into the IC have no effect. Gallamine-induced AGS susceptibility may result from a selective blockade of m2 muscarinic receptors.","2143":"The aim of the present study is to examine the effect of phospholipids on the lipid destabilization induced by chlorpromazine (CPZ) and imipramine (IP) at different levels of pH. The large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) are formed in the presence of calcein (60 mM). The vesicles containing calcein have been incubated in the presence of CPZ and IP at pH 4.5 and pH 8. At pH 4.5 CPZ and IP induce a rapid release of the calcein encapsulated in the liposomes. Calcein release, at equal concentrations of pharmacological agent, is more important by CPZ than by IP. At pH 8, the calcein release was more important than at pH 4.5; this effect appears to be more significant for the CPZ than for the IP. In conclusion, the insertion of chlorpromazine and imipramine into large unilamellar vesicles is accompanied by a strong destabilization of the vesicles. These effects appear more significant for chlorpromazine than for imipramine.","2144":"The goal of the present study was to determine the possible interactions between somatostatin (SST) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). We thus investigated the SST interaction with [35S]-tertiary butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) binding sites of the cortical and hippocampal regions of the rat brain. The method used to identify such effects is in vitro quantitative autoradiography. Thus, the binding of the cage convulsant [35S]-TBPS to a picrotoxin-sensitive site in the rat brain was used to investigate the modulatory action of SST on the GABAA receptor complex. The addition of the peptide to the incubation medium results in a dose-dependent inhibition of [35S]-TBPS in cortical and hippocampal structures. Detailed analysis showed a dose-related effect of SST with relative potencies comparable to those observed for 5 alpha 3 alpha P and 5 beta 3 alpha P. In addition, these neurosteroids were able to enhance the efficacy of SST in inhibiting [35S]-TBPS binding. The efficacy of SST in enhancing the inhibitory action of neurosteroids was also evidenced. Furthermore, SST seems to mimic the effects of these neurosteroids as well as GABA and picrotoxin on [35S]-TBPS binding to the rat brain in every context examined. This suggests that somatostatin allosterically modifies [35S]-TBPS binding through a mechanism similar to that of GABA. On the other hand, a possible action of SST via transduction systems on the GABAA receptor complex could also be suggested. These results illustrate the importance of interactions in SST-mediated GABA transmission in these brain regions.","2145":"The purpose of this study was to test the effect of calcitonin, when injected into the lateral ventricle, on conditioning behaviour and to see whether antidepressant drug treatment can antagonize calcitonin-induced impairment of this behaviour. Conditioned response by conditional stimulus (CS) was compared in control rat (CO) and in rats that received intraventricular perfusion of calcitonin (CA), acute antidepressant drug treatment (ADa), acute antidepressant drug treatment + calcitonin (ADa + CA), chronic antidepressant drug treatment (21 days) + calcitonin the day after (ADc + CA). Control rats acquired easily the conditioned response, the CA group and ADa + CA had problems in making the correlation between CS and unconditional stimulus (US), and consequently did not acquire a conditioned response, but in the ADc + CA group, rats exhibited more conditioned responses. The results indicate that calcitonin disrupts conditioning processes and chronic but not acute antidepressant drug treatment can reverse the effects of calcitonin.","2146":"Few epidemiological data have been reported on the relation between Ramadan fasting, life habits (meal frequency, sleep habits) and daytime sleepiness during Ramadan. This paper presents the results of a detailed study of the chronotype and daytime sleepiness before and during Ramadan. It was conducted on a sample of 264 subjects aged between 20 and 30 years. Results have revealed a significant decrease in the meal frequency during Ramadan compared with the control period. Before Ramadan, the majority of subjects woke up between 6 and 7 a.m. and went to sleep between 10 and 11 p.m. however, during Ramadan fasting, they woke up after 8 a.m. and preferred to go to sleep later (after midnight). Chronotype as evaluated by the Horne and Ostberg scale was changed significantly during Ramadan: an increase of the evening type and a decrease in the morning type of subjects was observed. Daytime sleepiness as evaluated by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale was significantly increased.","2147":"In order to defeat the atheroresistance in sand rats, 25 animals were given a high cholesterol diet for 45 days, which was then associated with oral treatment with vitamin D2 2000 IU\/day for a further 45 days. At days 0, 45 and 90, plasma parameters, and aortic and heart morphology were examined. Results showed at D45 hypercholesterolaemia, increased plasma LDL and VLDL cholesterol, oxidized LDL, triglycerides, free fatty acids (FFA) and calcium levels and moderate hyperinsulinaemia. At D90, plasma-oxidized LDL and FFA were more enhanced, whereas calcium level was reduced. Development of hyperglycaemia was associated with hyperinsulinaemia and insulin resistance. The vitamin D2 administration induced advanced lesions, represented by the degenerescence of elastic lamina, smooth muscle cell proliferation and lipid calcic plaque at an ulcerated stage in most cases. The ischaemic effects were represented by acute myocardial infarction. The potential of the sand rat to develop atherosclerotic lesions at different stages opens the field to therapeutic tests of new anti-atherogenic agents.","2148":"The study was conducted on 216 dairy cows. Samples of feeds distributed to cows were collected monthly for the purpose of determining their content in dry matter, energy, crude proteins and mineral matter. Milk samples were collected weekly for every cow from newly calved cows until confirmation of pregnancy by rectal palpation at least 2 months after artificial insemination. These samples were used for progesterone assays in skimmed milk, in order to assess the interval between calving and return to ovarian activity [C-ROA], calving and first insemination [C-I1], calving and conception [C-C] and number of inseminations per conception (nI\/C). Results have shown a significant negative correlation between the duration of [C-ROA] and [C-C] intervals and the dietary content in crude proteins (r = -0.720, p &lt; 0.05 and r = -0.914, p &lt; 0.01 respectively).","2149":"Iodine-deficiency disorders are a major problem of public health in Morocco. To mitigate this deficiency, the iodination of all the salt intended for human consumption in a proportion of 80 +\/- 10 mg\/kg of salt has become obligatory since a decree published in 1995. We estimated that this rate of iodized salt issued risked inducing an iodine excess in the population. To check this hypothesis, we provided 7 families made up of 28 subjects, who at the start were consuming a non-iodized salt, with the decreed, iodized salt and we followed the evolution of their urinary iodine excretion over a period of 3 weeks. The mean values of urinary iodine excretion of the 28 subjects were 12.8 micrograms\/dl before use of iodized salt and 26.8, 35.5 and 63.2 micrograms\/dl, respectively, after 7, 14 and 21 days from the introduction of iodized salt into their diet. After 21 days of the use of iodized salt, 84.6 per cent of the subjects had an iodine excess. We conclude that prolonged use of this iodized salt exposes the population to the risk of thyroid disorders.","2150":"Iodine status was evaluated by assessment of urinary iodine excretion in 221 mothers and their 223 newborns. During the first month after childbirth, 59.3 per cent of the mothers and 26.5 per cent of the newborns received applications of iodized antiseptic containing Polyvidone-iodine. 50.2 per cent of the newborns and 24.9 per cent of the mothers had a urinary iodine of more than 20 micrograms\/dl (iodine excess). For the mothers and the newborns who had received applications of iodized antiseptic, 38.2 per cent and 74.6 per cent had an iodine excess, respectively. This iodine excess is directly related to use of iodized antiseptic. Such high iodine levels may contribute to the risk of thyroid disorders, and particularly to transient congenital hypothyroidism at a critical age for normal development of the nervous system.","2151":"","2152":"","2153":"The Internet, indisputably the most important source of information obtainable in real time, was long essentially the domain of researchers in the USA, but has now become more accessible to French Pharmacovigilance Centres (CRPV) and pharmaceutical companies. A questionnaire was sent to every CRPV to determine how the Internet was perceived in terms of pharmacovigilance activities and existing Websites of particular value to CRPVs were investigated. Analysis of the questionnaires revealed that 66.7 per cent of CRPVs are connected to the Internet but do not use it fully; 94 per cent of connected CRPVs use it essentially for access to a bibliographic database such as Medline (88 per cent), and none subscribes to discussion lists concerning alert messages on problems related to drugs and therapeutics. Non-connected CRPVs do not intend to use the Internet because of financial considerations, lack of time or the assumption that it is not beneficial in everyday situations. Apparently, many French CRPVs are not sufficiently aware of the importance of the Internet for professional purposes. A non-exhaustive list of sites on the Internet providing information likely to be of use to Pharmacovigilance Centres in their everyday activities is included. The Internet offers far greater possibilities than research for bibliographic references on Medline and could improve the manner in which pharmacovigilance is practised.","2154":"In chronic illness, when death or a non-fatal event can occur at any time, the current efficacy indices are no longer appropriate to express the effect of the treatment on the potential therapeutic objectives.

For a continuous outcome, the effect size is the best choice. The odds ratio approximates the relative risk. The difference may be large in some instances. The number of patients to treat is the reciprocal of the absolute benefit. Although they are built on the same two quantities, they are not interchangeable and should not be considered in the same way. Moreover, their meaning is not straightforward and they can be misused.","2157":"","2158":"In the woman, lipoprotein plasma concentrations vary according to ovarian function. In general, menopause induces variations in lipoprotein plasma concentrations which are related to an increase in cardiovascular risk. Oestrogen therapy increases the synthesis of all lipoproteins including ApoB and increases the rate of their metabolism in various degrees depending on the type of lipoprotein. Globally, under oestrogen treatment, LDL cholesterol is decreased and HDL cholesterol is increased--more specifically HDL 2 and Lp A1 fractions. Oestrogens alter the lipoprotein metabolism through numerous mechanisms. New drugs such as Selective Oestrogen Receptor Modulators or phytoestrogens act on lipid metabolism: these effects could be useful in clinical practice.","2159":"The rationale for oestrogen replacement therapy relies mainly on two types of evidence, both of which are flawed: (1) the relative protection of women in premenopausal status against cardiovascular diseases and the increase of risk following menopause; (2) data from observational studies that showed a lower prevalence of cardiovascular events in women taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT) compared with those not taking such treatment (OR = 0.65; 95 per cent CI: 0.59-0.71). Behind the former evidence there is the assumption that the difference in risk before and after menopause is mostly due to the lack of ovarian oestrogens in post-menopausal women. This is indeed a strong assumption since there are many other changes during and after menopause. The second type of evidence assumes that the ORs given by the observational studies are unbiased. In fact, there are reliable data suggesting that women taking and not taking HRT are different in many respects, especially in their concerns for their health. This dimension has been proposed as an explanation for the correlation between compliance with placebo and survival. The only reliable approach is to perform adequately sized and long-term follow-up randomized trials. Although they should not be viewed as conclusive, the results of the first completed trial do not support the hypothesis that HRT is beneficial in women with a history of coronary disease.","2160":"The incidence of cardiovascular disease is lower in women before the menopause compared with men, while menopausal women have an incidence of coronary disease similar to that of men of the same age. This is mainly dependent upon oestrogen deficiency. Large-scale epidemiological studies have demonstrated that oestrogen replacement therapy leads to approximately 50 per cent reduction of cardiovascular disease in women taking hormones, compared with untreated women. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain the cardiovascular risk reduction observed in women on oestrogen therapy. Oestrogens positively affect plasma lipids and exert a beneficial effect upon carbohydrate metabolism and the haemocoagulation profile. Oestrogens may also have anti-atherogenic properties. Recent in vitro studies have demonstrated that oestrogens may positively influence all the steps involved in the formation of the atherosclerotic plaque (accumulation of cholesterol in the arterial wall, arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation, platelet aggregation, collagen and elastin production). Angiographic studies conducted in humans have demonstrated that women on oestrogens have significantly less coronary disease and less severe occlusion scores compared with women not taking hormone replacement therapy. Animal and human studies have shown that oestrogens act as vasodilating substances. Endothelium-dependent mechanisms have been identified and imply that oestrogens act through the endothelial release, mainly, of nitric oxide, a potent vasodilating substance which has been identified with EDRF (endothelium derived relaxing factor). More recently, oestrogens have been shown to affect also the vascular tone in the absence of the endothelium. Therefore, endothelium-independent mechanisms could be involved in the pathogenesis of the oestrogens' vascular effects. There is evidence that oestrogens have calcium antagonistic properties; this mechanism may be responsible for the reduction of peripheral vascular resistance observed in women on hormone replacement therapy and may slow the progression of coronary artery disease. The menopausal age is characterized by an imbalance of the neurohormonal system. Sudden increases of plasma catecholamines are evident when women have hot flushes, a typical clinical sign of the menopausal period. The abnormal release of catecholamines may reduce coronary flow reserve and increase peripheral vascular resistance and, therefore, may be dangerous for the heart. It has been shown, by means of the study of heart rate variability, that oestrogens are effective in modulating the neurohormonal system. The reduction of sympathetic tone has beneficial effects on coronary flow reserve and may be important in explaining the cardioprotective effect of oestrogens. Peripheral and coronary vasodilation observed in women on hormone replacement therapy might be also due to the inhibition of the release of vasoconstrictor factors such as endothelin-1 by oestrogens. Therefore, oestrogens protect the heart against coronary artery disease and they are now regarded as being as important as aspirin and antihypertensive drugs were in the past. Hormone replacement therapy should be considered in every menopausal woman to possibly prevent the occurrence of cardiovascular disease or, if already present, to slow its progression.","2161":"Cardiovascular risk associated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has been analysed by large epidemiological studies. This treatment has different effects depending on the type of vessel (venous or arterial) or site (heart or brain). The several meta-analyses which have been published conclude that there is a significant decrease of about 30 to 50 per cent in ischaemic heart disease associated with HRT. In addition, oestrogen replacement therapy is associated with a 25 per cent decrease in cardiovascular mortality. A recent meta-analysis has analysed the effect of HRT on cerebrovascular risk. A significant 20 per cent increase in ischaemic stroke associated with the use of HRT has been shown. However, a protective association of about 30 per cent has been observed in haemorrhagic stroke with HRT use. Recent epidemiological studies have suggested an increased risk of thromboembolic disease associated with HRT. The results of a randomized blind placebo-controlled secondary prevention trial have recently been published. In this clinical trial, women who receive oestrogen (0.625 mg conjugated equine oestrogen daily) plus progestin (2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate daily) therapy did not experience a reduction in overall risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction and cardiovascular heart disease death. This treatment also significantly increases the rate of thromboembolic events. Other randomized trials of HRT for primary prevention are scheduled to yield results by 2000 or 2005. All these studies have been conducted essentially in Anglo-Saxon countries and have analysed the effects of conjugated equine oestrogens alone or combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate. This treatment is not currently used in France. But no randomized trials are under way with the HRT common in France (transdermic oestrogen combined with natural progesterone). The effects of this treatment on cardiovascular disease remain unknown.","2162":"The pharmacodynamic evaluation of venotropic compounds deals mainly with vascular reactivity and fluid exchanges. At the microvascular level, three kinds of approaches can be used: (1) clinimetric measurements of cutaneous temperature (thermometry), skin colour (chromametry) and leg volume; (2) indirect physical parameters evaluating the haemodynamic or nutritional efficacy of the microcirculation (TcPO2 and laser doppler); (3) capillaroscopy with digital image analysis, which allows a quantification of the microvascular bed, of some kinds of transcapillary exchanges and of lymphatic microcirculation. At the venous level, they are also several usable techniques: (1) US duplex, which allows measurements of venous diameter variations; (2) plethysmography, which evaluates the compliance of the venous system from pressure\/volume curves.","2163":"During menopause the essential modifications in haemostatis are an increase in fibrinogen, in PAI and in factor VII, all of which are arterial risk factors. Women who have undergone physical training or polymorphism of factor VII are protected from unfavourable modifications in haemostasis. Hormone replacement therapy tends to correct modifications of arterial risk factors (decrease in fibrinogen and PAI), which is a beneficial effect of treatment. This treatment also induces other changes that are venous risk factors (decrease in antithrombin and protein S) and these constitute an unfavourable treatment effect. The most important variations are associated with conjugated equine oestrogens. The transcutaneous administration of oestrogens is associated with no variations in haemostasis, which seem to have a favourable effect on venous risk but the effect on cardiovascular risk could be ineffective if the fibrinolysis parameters will be predominant.","2164":"Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is associated with a genetic risk factor in about half of all cases. Antithrombin, protein C or protein S deficiencies account for 5 to 10 per cent of hereditary thrombophilia whereas the Arg 506 Gln factor V mutation is found in 20 to 30 per cent of DVTs and the G20210A factor II gene mutation in 5 to 10 per cent of them. The risk for DVT is increased three- to fourfold in women using oral contraceptives (OC); it is also increased during menopause hormonotherapy. Oestrogens modify the haemostatic balance, inferring a role in the thrombotic risk. The only thrombophilic factor which in association with OC was demonstrated to multiply the risk is the factor V Arg 506 Gln mutation, with a relative risk around 30. This observation reinforces the hypothesis that venous thrombosis is a multifactorial disease.","2165":"Women appear to be protected, until the menopause, from the development of coronary artery syndromes. This protective effect seems to be due to the beneficial effect of ovarian hormones, in particular oestrogens. A number of potential mechanisms for the protective effect of oestrogens have been proposed. An important postulated mechanism could be by improving the function of vascular endothelium. In this review, we present the currently published studies that have evaluated the effects of 17 beta-estradiol, the only oestrogen used in France for hormone replacement therapy, on peripheral and coronary vasomotor function in postmenopausal women.","2166":"In recent years, two concepts--endothelial dysfunction and arterial remodelling--have emerged as keys to the understanding of the pathophysiology of the arterial system. The clinical investigation of endothelial dysfunction and arterial remodelling became a requisite for understanding the effects of any drug acting on the arterial wall, such as oestrogens during oestrogen replacement therapy. In this paper, we describe the various non-invasive methods for studying the geometry and the function of large and small arteries. Recent technological and methodological improvements allow this investigation to be carried out with satisfactory repeatability, and to be applied to clinical pharmacology. We also discuss the few studies which have applied these methods to the study of the effect of oestrogens on the arterial system and we suggest a physiological schema for an integrative mechanism of action.","2167":"Two isoforms of oestrogen receptors (alpha and beta) have been identified in the cells of the arterial wall, and a heterogeneity of their expression according to the animal species, the vascular beds and the sex has been reported. Oestrogens can thus directly influence the vascular physiology through a 'genomic' mechanisms, but 'extra-genomic' mechanisms responsible for a short-term effect have also been suggested. Oestrogens potentiate endothelium-dependent relaxation through an increase in nitric oxide bioavailability (increase in its production and\/or decrease in its degradation by superoxide anion according to the vascular beds). Endothelial 'dysfunction' (abnormality of the endothelium-dependent vasodilation) occurs in atheromatous arteries. Oestrogen replacement prevents and even corrects this endothelial dysfunction. In monkeys, this beneficial effect of oestrogens is not altered by coadministration of progesterone, but is abolished by coadministration of medroxyprogesterone. Finally, oestrogens prevent fatty streak deposit, and the mechanisms of this atheroprotective effect are being studied.","2168":"Studies on the effect of oestrogen on the circulatory apparatus have shown changes in vascular reactivity and structural alterations of blood vessels that participate in vascular growth and remodelling, whether physiological or pathological (atherosclerosis, ischaemia, restenosis). Direct vascular effects of oestradiol are mediated by functional steroid receptors, ER alpha and ER beta. ER alpha is predominantly found in arterial smooth muscle cells. During the menstrual cycle and pregnancy, endometrial vascular growth is required to allow embryo implantation and the development of the blood supply for fetal growth; oestradiol, in association with progesterone, promotes the growth of endometrial arteries, via ER and unknown mechanisms which probably involve the production of growth factors; oestradiol also induces endometrial angiogenesis, via the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by epithelial cells and fibroblasts. Oestradiol inhibits the proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the arterial wall (except in the genital tract), explaining in part the protective role of oestrogen against restenosis and chronic graft rejection. Further studies are required to determine the molecular mechanisms of these actions and the respective role of ER alpha and ER beta.","2169":"Nuclear receptors form a superfamily of transcriptional regulators including both classical hormone receptors and orphan receptors. The functional anatomy of the receptors is described as well as their interaction with coactivators, cointegrators and corepressors. Nuclear receptors activate and inhibit gene transcription by regulating histone acetylases and histone deacetylases. Receptor isoforms (oestrogen receptors alpha and beta), ligands exerting differential effects on the same receptor and the mechanism of action of antihormones are discussed.","2170":"","2171":"The concept of quality assurance is emerging in public and private clinical laboratories in France following the introduction of decrees on Hospital Accreditation procedure. We report here the methodology used for the implementation of a quality system in a Therapeutic Drug Monitoring laboratory. The quality manual, which represents the basis of the quality system, was drafted according to the following methodology: Step 1--study of the requirements of ISO 9001 Standard; Step 2--analysis and synthesis of the European EN 45001 Standard and French regulation GBEA system respectively, compared with the 20 headings of the ISO 9001 Standard; Step 3--elaboration of the quality manual on the basis of steps 1 and 2 and relating to: laboratory and staff organization, quality document management, quality planning relating to specific activities relevant to projects or contracts on drug monitoring and pharmacokinetic studies, and operating procedures. The implementation of a quality system in a public hospital laboratory may be considered as a means of improving the laboratory organization and management.","2172":"Efficacy indices measure the efficacy of therapies. They derive, by definition, from two quantities, the basal or control risk of event, Rc, observed in the control group, and the on-treatment risk, Rt, observed in the treated group. In clinical trials and meta-analyses, each is an unbiased measure of efficacy. Although they are a combination of frequencies, these indices are used in clinical practice to predict the benefit in treated patients. Their relevance to express efficacy depends on the type of clinical condition, and is better for acute diseases than for chronic diseases. In order to be useful for prescribers, they should meet certain specifications. In addition, they should be considered in the more general framework of effect models.","2173":"","2174":"","2175":"","2176":"","2177":"","2178":"","2179":"","2180":"","2181":"The prescription of maintenance treatment for opioid dependence has increased dramatically in France since the approval of high-dose buprenorphine in general practice. Community pharmacists are particularly involved since daily dispensing is recommended. A postal survey was conducted within a representative network of community pharmacies in Aquitaine, south-western France. The objective was to assess quantitative and qualitative data on these treatments in the region through pharmacists' opinions and experiences. Out of 61 responders, 62 per cent had already dispensed maintenance treatment. During the survey, 88 patients were under treatment at these pharmacies. Nearly 80 per cent of the pharmacists agreed with the dispensing of these treatments and more than 60 per cent had a positive opinion of them. Community pharmacists feel concerned by the treatment for opioid dependence.","2182":"The aim of this study was to identify the latest trends in psychotropic drug use and the effect of the increase of maintenance treatments for serious opioid addiction. The results are based on data from OPPIDUM, an annual survey primarily concerned with the consumption of licit and illicit drugs. The study involved 1066 drug addicts recruited during the month of October 1997 from 38 French health centres connected with the Centres for Evaluation and Information on Drug Addiction (CEIP). The most frequently reported drugs were benzodiazepines (n = 323), some of which, especially flunitrazepam (Rohypnol, n = 123), are extremely addictive. The data showed a slight decrease in heroin consumption as well as a marked increase in the use of maintenance treatments. The association between benzodiazepines and buprenorphine (Subutex) should consequently be studied, whether buprenorphine is being used illicitly or prescribed as a maintenance treatment.","2183":"Molecules currently available or in late phases of development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease have modest and apparently equivalent efficacies. Thus, the choice will depend on the safety profile of these drugs and on the patient characteristics. The aim of this review is to undertake an inventory of adverse effects and interactions reported in the literature for anticholinesterasics (the only ones approved by authorities). As most of the molecules described in this article are still in early phases of development, data reported here mainly issued from clinical trials carried out on specific populations. Most of these reported adverse effects have not been attributed according to the rules of pharmacovigilance. Nevertheless, we believe that the data presented in this review will be of great interest to clinicians and pharmacovigilance specialists as the compounds concerned become available on the market.","2184":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency and the gravity of Trans Urethral Resection of the Prostate Syndrome or 'TURP Syndrome,' which occurs when irrigating fluids containing 1.5 per cent glycocolle are used. All the adverse effects that occurred with 5 products containing 1.5 per cent glycocolle which were notified to the pharmacovigilance structures in France were reviewed. The adverse effects notified comprised 24 cases of TURP Syndrome and 5 of renal failure. TURP Syndrome consisted of neurological signs (92 per cent); cardiovascular signs (54 per cent); visual disturbance (42 per cent) and digestive signs (25 per cent). Hyponatraemia occurred in all patients (mean 113 +\/- 6 mmol.l-1) and 25 per cent of patients died. In 27 per cent of cases TURP Syndrome occurred when glycocolle was in contravention of AMM guidelines. The Drugs Agency has requested that modification be included in the Vidal pharmacopoeia (warnings and adverse reactions) and on glycocolle bags and that surgeons and anaesthetists be informed.","2185":"Ageing generates an important inter- and intra-individual variability in drug pharmacokinetics. The increasing frequency of ofloxacin adverse effects in elderly patients results from increased ofloxacin plasma levels about two or threefold over normal concentrations. A retrospective study of ofloxacin population pharmacokinetics in 17 elderly patients (83.6 +\/- 6.8 years) shows the existence of three subgroups according to ofloxacin total clearance [group 1: 1.44 l\/h, group 2: 4.37 l\/h and group 3: 15.08 l\/h] reflecting the important inter-individual variability. No correlation between this clearance and creatinine clearance, nor between this clearance and age, could be established, showing the limits of traditional drug monitoring in the elderly. Ofloxacin pharmacokinetic parameters estimated by the non-parametric software NPEM2 in the 17 elderly patients (absorption rate constant, Ka: 2.668 +\/- 1.256 h-1; apparent volume of distribution related to weight, Vs: 1.272 +\/- 0.778 l\/kg; elimination rate constant, Ks: 0.265 +\/- 0.247 10(-3) min\/ml\/h) are clearly different from those estimated in young adults. These results show the limits of classic drug monitoring in the elderly, and also the interest of adaptive control of a drug regimen.","2186":"The objective of this study was to test the influence of bisoprolol and verapamil on left ventricular filling in hypertensive patients in a 6 month randomized, double-blind trial in 54 hypertensive patients not previously treated with beta-blockers or calcium inhibitors. After administration of placebo for 14 days, an M echocardiogram of the left ventricle was recorded to determine left ventricular mass. Blood flow was evaluated by pulsed Doppler sonography. After randomization into two groups, one group received 10 mg of bisoprolol and the other 240 mg of verapamil LP in a single dose in the morning. After 2 months' treatment, the patients whose blood pressure was not well controlled were given a diuretic. Echo-Doppler was performed again by the same operator after 4-10 days on active treatment, after 6 months and after a subsequent 2 weeks of placebo for the patients treated with a single drug. The reduction in blood pressure was comparable in the two treated groups, but there was no significant decrease in left ventricular mass. Left ventricular filling was improved only in the patients receiving bisoprolol. The effect was observed immediately after the first administration and throughout the 6 months' treatment period declining slowly during the placebo wash-out. This effect appeared to be independent of any alteration in heart rate and was thought to be a specific action of this drug.","2187":"Beyond considerations of cost-effectiveness, clinical practice guidelines (CPG) can reduce practice variations and thus improve the quality of care. However, despite the proliferation of implemented CPG and their wide diffusion thanks to Internet-based technologies, physicians' compliance with formal standards is weak. Developed according to a document-based paradigm, OncoDoc proposes an original framework for implementing CPG. Domain knowledge has been encoded as a decision tree whose branches are both exclusive and exhaustive. This generic knowledge is operationalized at the point of care by the interactive building, through hypertextual navigation, of a patient-based clinical context leading to specific therapeutic recommendations. OncoDoc has first been applied to the management of breast cancer patients and demonstrated within a full-scale experimentation in a clinical setting a compliance of 80 per cent.","2188":"Substantial therapeutic advances have been achieved in cardiology in the last fifteen years. They are due to the progress of cardiovascular pharmacology and interventional cardiology. Many devices are now competing with drugs. In France, the evaluation procedures of these two types of treatment are highly different. The benefit\/risk ratio is not evaluated sufficiently before the marketing authorization of the devices. The procedures leading to reimbursement by Social Security are completely different for the drugs and the devices, and harmonization of these procedures is essential. It could allow the avoidance of paradoxical situations such as that of the automatic implantable defibrillator whose efficacy is now validated by controlled studies; but payment for which is not reimbursed by Social Security. The consequence is a serious dearth of this item, the implantation ratio per million residents in France being lower than that of all neighbouring countries.","2189":"Hospital admissions resulting from an adverse drug reaction have been studied in the emergency unit of the university hospital in Poitiers during a 27-day period. This prospective study consisted in documenting all observations considered as an ADR by the medical practitioner in charge of the patient. There were 1235 hospital admissions to the emergency unit during the study period. Thirty-one (2.5 per cent) of admissions were considered to be drug-related. Women were more often affected than men. Patients with ADR were classified taking into account the type of pathology and the drug responsible for the effect. Dermatological and gastrointestinal reactions were predominant. Antibiotic and analgesic drugs were the most common drug groups implicated in causing an ADR.","2190":"The traditional way of teaching of pharmacology is discussed in three parts. First two trends are presented that impact on the evolution of medical education. The first trend orients teaching toward instructional formats that solicit, and often require full student involvement. This is justified by the second trend: the organization of knowledge into long-term memory is built around semantic networks linked to the clinical context, thus facilitating recall in clinical practice. In the second part a method is presented which illustrates these principles: problem-based learning (PBL). The tutor's is role and roles where the onus is on the students are specified. The last part explores how PBL could be a more relevant method for teaching pharmacology, provided that three prerequisite assumptions are respected.","2191":"Cell death by apoptosis plays a major role in the homeostasis of the vascular system. Apoptosis of vascular cells, and of endothelial and smooth muscle cells, can be triggered by intrinsic signals related to the cell differentiation phenotype, or by extrinsic signals, including free radicals, inflammatory cytokines or oxidized LDL. Apoptosis contributes to normal physiological modelling of arteries after birth as well as to capillary rarefaction occurring during ontogenic development. Apoptotic processes have been found in several pathological conditions, including atherosclerosis, hypertension or restenosis following percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. However, a direct causal relationship between apoptosis and occurrence of these afflictions remains to be established.","2192":"Recent data suggest an increase in vascular pathology in ageing including changes in blood-brain barrier permeability and morphological changes in microvasculature. In the present study, cortical brain microvasculature was studied by immunohistochemistry using a monoclonal antibody against a vascular heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Vascular changes were consistently observed in ageing and included decrease in vascular density and presence of atrophic vessels. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular changes were even more severe including presence of coiling vessels and glomerular loop formations. The laminar and regional distribution of these vascular alterations was correlated with the presence of neuropathological lesions (neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid deposits) suggesting a role of vascular changes in AD pathology. The degree of overlap between vascular and neurodegenerative disorders may be more substantial than previously thought. If vasculopathy in Alzheimer's disease is not directly involved in pathogenesis, it may act synergistically with other pathogenetic mechanisms including genetic and environmental factors. This aspect of pathology is particularly interesting in view of its accessibility to therapeutic interventions.","2193":"The ability to control body hydration is frequently impaired with age. This mainly results from changes in thirst and from loss of renal concentrating ability. The cellular mechanisms responsible for this functional renal failure have been extensively studied in different experimental models. Although the loss of nephrons sometimes observed with age impairs the ability of the kidney to retain water, a similar defect was reported in animals free of glomerulosclerosis, indicating that the reduction in the number of nephrons was not the only cause. Because age-related polyuria has also been demonstrated in rats with unchanged secretion of vasopressin, renal changes in water reabsorption was hypothesized. Such alterations have been searched along the whole length of the nephron. Neither the single nephron filtration rate nor proximal or early distal flow rates were modified in senescent animals where water reabsorption in the collecting duct was reduced. The affinity and the density of the V2 receptors were mainly constant in most experimental models of ageing. In contrast, intracellular cAMP accumulation following vasopressin stimulation was reduced in the oldest animals. The expression of aquaporins in luminal and basolateral membranes of the collecting duct epithelial cells was altered. The amount of basolateral aquaporin 3 and 4 was respectively decreased by 50 per cent and unchanged in renal papilla. In addition, the expression of aquaporin 2, which is rate limiting for the osmotic permeability of the collecting duct, was reduced by 50 per cent in the outer medulla and by 80 per cent in the inner medulla of the senescent animals. This drop in aquaporin 2 expression in the distal part of the nephron could be the main cause for the fall in concentrating ability of the kidney and the age-related impaired control of hydration.","2194":"The assessment of the clinical properties of analgesics is not easy. Some of the difficulties are due to the multiplicity of the aetiologies involved in the pain process, to the complexity of pathophysiological mechanisms modulating the nociception and to the subjectivity of painful sensation. All of these explain the fairly high variability of the criteria available for assessing pain level or pain relief. As a consequence, that variability directly interferes with the pharmacological effect of analgesics to be assessed in clinical trials. Furthermore, the lack of consensus concerning the evaluation criteria does not facilitate the choice of a study design or the comparison of data collected from different clinical trials. Clinicians have to choose between testing the analgesics in healthy volunteers (experimental pain) or in patients suffering from painful disease (spontaneous pain). These two approaches are often complementary for assessing the pharmacological profile of new analgesic compounds. Whatever the choice, the investigators have to pay attention to the methodological aspects to avoid pitfalls and bias in this difficult field of therapeutic research.","2195":"It is now well accepted that the pain suppression effect of morphine is related to the interaction of this alkaloid with binding sites located in the central nervous system. The wide distribution of opioid receptors probably accounts for the multiplicity of pharmacological responses elicited by morphine administration, as in addition to its strong analgesic potency morphine induces side effects. Therefore, there is a critical need for new analgesics able to fulfil the gap existing between opioid analgesics and antalgics. These new analgesics could be of major interest in a number of severe pain syndromes. The discovery that the endogenous morphine-like peptides enkephalins are degraded by well-defined metabolic pathways represents a promising outlook for the development of new analgesics. The complete inhibitors of enkephalin catabolism produce their physiological effects by increasing the extracellular levels of endogenous opioid peptides released either tonically or following stimuli-evoked depolarization. Under these conditions, their effects will depend upon the magnitude and duration of the enkephalin release evoked by a particular stimulus, which probably varies in the different enkephalinergic pathways. It is expected that increasing the levels of endogenous opioid peptides would avoid serious drawbacks inasmuch as they appear related to a ubiquitous overstimulation of brain opioid receptors. Some mixed inhibitors of enkephalin degrading enzymes are now undergoing preclinical trials.","2196":"This article reviews the peripheral and central mechanisms of neuropathic pain. The main mechanisms involved in neuropathic pain are: (1) ectopic activities, (2) ephapses, (3) sensitization of nociceptors. Central morphological alterations could also be involved: (1) medullar neuronal reorganization, (2) hyperexcitability of central nervous system nociceptive neurones. The relative resistance of these neuropathic pains to opioid drugs could be related to a decrease in the number of opioid receptors to an amino acid mediator related spinal neurons hyperexitability and to an increase in non opioid peptides such as cholecystokinin.","2197":"Acute pain can be managed favourably by the use of paracetamol, non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids and local anaesthetics, solely or in combination. Sophisticated methods of administration such as nerve blocks or patient-controlled analgesia will improve results. Chronic pain, on the other hand, presents a more complex situation and the pharmacological approach is only one aspect of bio-psycho-social management programmes. The role of opioids in the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain has still not been clarified. Adjuvant drugs are often required.","2198":"Investigation of the physiologic mechanisms involved in the activation of eosinophils is crucial to comprehend their role in the pathogenesis of allergic reactions. To overcome the difficulty of obtaining large numbers of eosinophils, we differentiated in vitro eosinophils from human umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells. These cells responded to fMLP or PAF with an increase in [Ca2+]i, associated with O2 production. Deprivation or chelation of extracellular calcium induced a reduction of fMLP or PAF-induced [Ca2+]i rise and O2- production. Similar results were obtained with extracellular Ni2+ addition. Chelation of intracellular calcium induced an inhibition of fMLP- or PAF-induced [Ca2+]i rise and a decrease in O2- production. Our results indicate that fMLP- and PAF-dependent O2- production in eosinophils requires intra- and extracellular Ca2+ and that Ca2+ influx is necessary for optimal activation.","2199":"The regulation of pulmonary vascular tone by acetylcholine (ACh) involves the activation of different subtypes of muscarinic receptors as well as the cholinesterase activities which are responsible for ACh degradation. Most of the studies on the cholinergic control of the pulmonary vascular tone have been performed in vessels derived from animals. The ability of ACh to induce pulmonary vasoconstriction is species dependent. In vessels derived from sheep lung, ACh induced contractions in veins but not in arteries whereas in human pulmonary vessels the reverse was observed. The subtype(s) of the muscarinic receptors involved in the pulmonary vasoconstrictions is also dependent on the species which are studied. M1 receptors are implicated in the rabbit pulmonary vasoconstrictions, M3 in humans, whereas M1 and M2 receptors are involved in the dog. The cholinesterases are implicated in the vasoconstriction produced by ACh in human and rabbit pulmonary arteries. However, in these studies while acetylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7) and butyrylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.8) activities were detected in human vessels only acetylcholinesterase activity was found in rabbit vessels. The endothelium-dependent relaxation induced by ACh has been reported in isolated pulmonary vessels from different animals including man. However, the muscarinic receptors involved in the ACh-induced vasodilatation of rat and rabbit pulmonary artery are of the M3 subtype while those characterized in the human pulmonary artery are of the M3 and M1 subtypes. Together these results concerning the cholinergic control of the pulmonary vascular tone indicate that extrapolation of the data obtained in animal models to human vessels requires some caution. In addition, there is considerable evidence to demonstrate that ageing may modify cholinergic responses. However, little information is available concerning the pulmonary vascular bed during ageing.","2200":"5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) has been implicated in pulmonary hypertension, hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, and the pulmonary side-effects of some drugs. 5-HT contracts bovine, ovine, canine, caprine, feline, rabbit, guinea-pig and rat isolated pulmonary arteries mainly by activation of 5-HT2A receptors but relaxes porcine pulmonary artery through activation of endothelial 5-HT2B receptors. Pharmacological responses of the pulmonary veins to 5-HT have been less studied and comprise both contraction (bovine, canine, feline, equine, rabbit) and relaxation (ovine, caprine). Functional and radioligand binding studies in human isolated intrapulmonary arteries and veins have demonstrated a mixed population of 5-HT1B\/1D and 5-HT2A receptors mediating vasoconstriction but no evidence of involvement of 5-HT1A, 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptors. Remarkable differences exist in the in vitro pulmonary vasoreactivity to 5-HT and related drugs in humans compared with other mammals. Therefore, the use of human tissues is to be preferred to study pathophysiological responses of pulmonary circulation with clinical relevance.","2201":"The objective of the present study was to determine the viscoelastic properties of the common carotid artery in 35 patients with aortic aneurysm before surgery (AAA) (age 71 years, range 61-84), in comparison with 48 patients with essential hypertension (HT: 50 years, range 24-88) and 44 normotensive subjects (NT: 44 years, range 23-85). The second objective was to establish the relations between common carotid artery (CCA) viscoelastic properties and histologic lesions observed on AAA segments, obtained after surgery. CCA diameter was larger and distensibility smaller in AAA patients than in HT and NT. Distensibility of the aortic aneurysm was smaller than that of upstream 'normal' aorta, itself being smaller than control aortas. AAA wall lesions were extensive, associating adventitial and medial fibrosis, elastolysis, smooth muscle rarefaction, neovascularization, inflammation and plaques. The grade of these lesions was not correlated with the mechanical properties of the aorta and CCA; however, they could explain their qualitative alterations. AAA is characterized by severe stiffening and dilatation of large arteries distant from the aneurysm location. Whether this pattern of arterial phenotype is explained by the increase in stiff material (collagen) and the rarefaction of distensible material (smooth muscle and elastin) remains to be determined.","2202":"Recently, cells isolated from airways have been used to characterize precisely the electrophysiological properties of this smooth muscle and to describe the changes in cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) occurring upon agonist stimulation. Although most studies have produced consistent results in terms of types of ion channel and pathways of calcium signalling implicated in the mechanical activity of airways, there are differences according to (i) the site along the bronchial tree (trachea vs. bronchi); (ii) the proliferating status of the cells (freshly isolated vs. cultured) and (iii) the species (human vs. animals). With regard to the electrophysiological properties of airway smooth muscle, the contribution to [Ca2+]i rise of Ca2+ influx through L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels depends on the balance between depolarization related to non-specific cation channel and\/or chloride channel activation and hyperpolarization related to activation of a variety of potassium channels. Most of the above-mentioned channels appear to be controlled, directly or indirectly, by agonists in human bronchial smooth muscle. With regard to calcium signalling, the pattern of agonist-induced [Ca2+]i responses, the so-called [Ca2+]i oscillations, has been observed recently in freshly isolated airway smooth muscle cells. The role and the calcium sources involved in these oscillations in human bronchial smooth muscle are currently being investigated.","2203":"The isolated human bronchus model is interesting for the study of drug-receptor interactions in 'normal' preparations. Several attempts have been made to prepare in vitro models of airway hyperresponsiveness close to the pathophysiology of asthma. In this paper, we shall present some results obtained with LPS and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta). LPS (100 ng\/ml, for 3 to 6 h) or IL-1 beta potentiated bradykinin and the tachykinin NK-1 selective receptor agonist [Sar9, Met-O2] SP -induced human isolated bronchi contraction in vitro (IL-1 beta 3 10(-10) M, at 37 degrees C for 1 to 3 h for bradykinin or at 21 degrees C for 15 h for [Sar9, Met-O2] SP in Krebs-Henseleit solution). As in control bronchi, the effects of bradykinin and of [Sar9, Met-O2] SP after interleukin 1 beta pre-treatment were abolished by indomethacin (10(-6) M), the thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist GR 32191 suggesting that prostanoids remain involved under these experimental conditions. Although bradykinin and [Sar9, Met-O2] SP -induced contractions were mediated by thromboxane receptor stimulation, the thromboxane A2 (TxA2) mimetic U46619 induced contraction of human bronchi was not enhanced by IL-1 beta pre-treatment. The cyclooxygenase 2 (cox 2) inhibitor GGP 28238 (10(-6) M) inhibited IL-1 beta-induced potentiation of [Sar9, Met-O2] SP but not of bradykinin effect. Bradykinin and [Sar9, Met-O2] SP induced a release of TxB2, the stable metabolite of TxA2, in the organ bath and this release was increased by IL-1 beta pre-treatment. Bradykinin-induced release of 6 keto prostaglandin F1 alpha (the stable metabolite of prostaglandin I2) was not enhanced by IL-1 beta. Taken together, our results suggest that IL-1 beta is able to potentiate the effect of bradykinin or tachykinin receptor agonists on the human isolated bronchus. Several mechanisms might be involved, including an increase of thromboxane synthase synthesis and\/or activity in the case of bradykinin and of short term incubation (3 h, 37 degrees C) or an increase of synthesis and\/or activity of cox-2 for tachykinin and for long-term incubation (15 h, 21 degrees C).","2204":"Is clinical pharmacology a science or only an application of science? Karl Popper suggested a method to identify science and to sort it out from other logical activities such as metaphysics, whereby the falsification criterion he proposed can apply to the theory in such a way that the theory could be refuted. The clinical pharmacologist's approach requires the build-up of a therapeutic model on the basis of two other models: the physiopathologic and the pharmacological. The three-model construct is a theory. Is it scientific in the Popperian sense? From the therapeutic model, one can predict the efficacy of a drug, and the corresponding statement is tested by a clinical trial. Whatever the original statement, it is modified into a refutable one because of the use of the statistical approach in clinical trials. Furthermore, the predicate represents a hypothesis of the model validity, which will then be confronted with 'reality' through clinical experiment. As the therapeutic model is refutable, clinical pharmacology is a science in the Popperian sense.","2205":"","2206":"","2207":"In France, three over-the-counter products containing quinine exist to treat cramps. This study aims to analyse data on spontaneous reports to the French System of Pharmacovigilance of adverse reactions to quinine drug products. From 1985 to 1996, we reviewed 58 adverse reaction reports. Most involved hypersensitivity reactions: rash, pruritus, generalized anaphylaxis, thrombopenia and hepatitis. Cinchonism is rarely observed at the usually low dose of quinine in this indication. No fatal outcome has been notified as described in the USA and Australia. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) decided that prescription of quinine drug products should not be used any longer in the treatment of muscle cramps. Immuno-allergic reactions are potentially serious and must be avoided by giving clear information to patients and prescribers, and looking into the history of such reactions in patients in respect of the quinine drug and also tonic water.","2208":"A bezoar is a mass of undigested material which may form within the lumen of the gut. Some drugs have the potential to form bezoars. In the majority of patients, there is a clear predisposing factor. We present here the data of the French System of Pharmacovigilance on sucralfate and a literature review. Two distinct populations were involved: 16 adults and 5 newborn babies. All were hospitalized in intensive care units. The children were very low birth weight newborn babies, all of whom presented with abdominal distension or acute occlusion. The abdominal radiograph revealed an opaque mass filling the contour of the stomach. Adults presented an oesophageal bezoar around a nasogastric tube. Risk factors for bezoar formation were severe illness, gut hypomotility, dehydration, overdosage, nasogastric tube feeding. Sucralfate is used in the management of peptic ulcer. At pH &lt; 4, extensive polymerization occurs and a sticky viscid gel is formed. In view of this inquiry, the French System of Pharmacovigilance decided to advise caution for adults in intensive care unit being fed by nasogastric tube and contraindication in premature babies and dysmature newborn babies receiving sucralfate.","2209":null,"2210":"The pancreatic toxicity of oral 5-aminosalicylic acid (5ASA) derivatives used for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases remains controversial. A new case of mesalazine-induced acute pancreatitis (AP), with positive rechallenge, and an analysis of the previous published cases are presented. Twenty-nine patients (17 women, 12 men), aged 26.4 +\/- 9.9 (12-43) years, were involved, receiving sulfasalazine (n = 11), mesalazine (n = 16), olsalazine (n = 1) or 5ASA without further informations (n = 1), for ulcerative colitis (n = 15), Crohn's disease (n = 13) or another indication (n = 1). The AP occurred in the first month of treatment in 71.4 per cent of the cases (n = 28). The clinical course was essentially benign in most of the cases. Recurrence of AP after rechallenge was observed in 17 of the 19 cases, even if the molecule, the dose or the form were modified. These results show that all 5ASA derivatives are potentially pancreatotoxic. An AP must be considered when an occurrence or increase of abdominal pain occurs during such therapy and warrants serum amylase assay and discontinuation of the drug.","2211":"Hiccup is a sudden contraction of the inspiratory muscles, followed by an abrupt closure of the glottis, thus producing a characteristic sound. Some drugs have been reported to induce hiccup. Using the French Pharmacovigilance Database, the aim of the present study was to investigate reports of such an adverse drug reaction (ADR). Between 1985 and 1997, 53 cases were reported to the French pharmacovigilance network. The sex ratio was 16.6. Mean age was 52 years (range 18-83). Of the total number, 23 per cent were related to corticosteroids. 15 per cent to psychiatric (mainly non-imipraminic antidepressants), 13 per cent to neurologic (mainly dopaminergic antiparkinsonians), 12 per cent to anti-infectious (beta-lactams, macrolides, fluoroquinolones), 7 per cent to cardiovascular (mainly digitalic compounds), 6 per cent to analgesic (opioid drugs), 6 per cent to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.... Rechallenge was positive in 7 cases. Two cases were 'serious' according to the WHO definition. The diagnosis of drug-induced hiccup is difficult and often achieved only by a process of elimination. The mechanism of this drug-induced ADR remains often not clearly explained.","2212":"Theoretically, the merit of a medical drug can be quantitatively determined by calculating benefit and risks as the drug-attributed gain or loss, respectively, of quality-adjusted life years. This calculation is based on comprehensive data concerning large numbers of patients. For most drugs, however, the data available are more or less incomplete. Therefore, large-scale intensive and continuous data collection needs to become routine in medical and pharmaceutical practice. In addition, important scientific, ethical, logistic and financial obstacles need to be overcome. Preliminary evidence suggests that the 'Principle of Threes' is a useful tool for categorizing the merit of drugs and for comparing drugs of a given therapeutic class. The safety of a drug is a dynamic rather than a constant feature. The merit of a drug is not an absolute quality, but is meaningful only in a given context. It is still uncertain whether merit assessment can present the dilemma that 'a drug causes benefit in many at the cost of serious injury in some' in a way the individual user can understand. Quantitative merit assessment will be welcome but should not be expected to replace individual therapeutic decision making. It remains to be seen whether merit assessment is to result in a gold standard for the acceptability or unacceptability of drugs.","2213":"The French network of Regional Centres of Pharmacovigilance has made an estimation of the occurrence of adverse drug reactions in a representative sample of patients in French public hospitals (departments of medicine, of surgery and of geriatrics). The study looked at one specific day in the spring of 1997. Each observed case of adverse drug reaction was validated. The total sample comprised 2132 patients of whom 969 were in a university hospital and 1163 in a general hospital. The hospitals and units concerned are representative of the country as a whole. One adverse drug reaction at least was present for 221 patients on the day of the investigation. This means a prevalence rate of 10.3 per cent (95 per cent CI: 8.7 to 11.9 per cent). In 33 per cent of cases (95 per cent CI: 26 to 42 per cent), the observed effects were rated as serious. From an incidence rate of 1.8 per cent (95 per cent CI: 1.0 to 25 per cent) on one specified day it can be estimated that in France an adverse drug reaction will occur in about 1,300,000 patients per year during a stay in hospital.","2214":"Strictly speaking, there are no specific regulations on excipients but their use in the preparation of medicines clearly makes them essential to the quality, efficacy and safety of these medicines; consequently, the regulatory framework for excipients derives from the regulations concerning medicines. The conditions for the use of excipients in Europe are defined in the European regulations, either within the framework of the European Union through Community directives and guidelines prepared by the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products, or within the framework of the Council of Europe and the European Pharmacopoeia Convention through standards prescribed in the European Pharmacopoeia itself; the two types of regulations complement each other. After a brief overview of the general regulations on medicines, during which the key points relevant to excipients will be highlighted, we will successively discuss the regulations that bear on the conditions of use of excipients in medicines.","2215":"Excipients are essential ingredients of medicinal products. Approximately 1000 excipients are today in use in marketed pharmaceuticals. The safety issues regarding excipients can be classified into three categories: quality, toxicology and improper use.

They are produced, as for drugs, by lots and although they correspond to official Pharmacopoeian monographs, they may vary from batch to batch. This can alter the physico-chemical properties as well as their functionalities. Even for classical and non-critical tableting excipients, tablets prepared with the same excipient (microcrystalline cellulose) but originating from several suppliers may display very dramatic differences: the main difference concerns the in vitro dissolution rate which can consequently affect the bioavailability. Switching from one excipient to another is still possible but the similarity in behaviour of the dosage form must be demonstrated by relevant tests including functionality tests.","2217":"","2218":"","2219":"","2220":"","2221":"","2222":"","2223":"","2224":"","2225":"The objective of this study was to determine the proportion of Massachusetts Medicare patients who received prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism following colectomy, hysterectomy or total hip arthroplasty. The sample frame was all 90 Massachusetts acute care hospitals, and the time frame was 1 April to 30 September 1994. The patients discharged with an International Classification of Disease (ICD-9-CM) discharge diagnostic code (recorded in the Massachusetts Medicare Claims Database) for colectomy, hysterectomy or total hip arthroplasty were used to identify the target patient population. The sample population comprised 1397 patients randomly selected from the target population, including 467 total hip arthroplasties, 474 colectomies, and 456 hysterectomies. Medical records were reviewed by trained nurse abstractors who collected information on the use of prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism. Prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism was employed by surgeons practicing in Massachusetts hospitals in 93 per cent of total hip arthroplasty cases (regional variation 85-98 per cent), 84 per cent of colectomies (regional variation 57-93 per cent), 66 per cent of hysterectomies (regional variation 35-71 per cent), and in 87 per cent of the subset of 111 hysterectomies with malignancy (regional variation 25-100 per cent). The results of this statewide study demonstrated significant regional and hospital-to-hospital variation in use of prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism following major surgery. A lower rate of prophylaxis use was observed in hospitals with fewer than 200 beds and in hospitals that did not have teaching programmes. Hospitals with below-average rates of prophylaxis were targeted for intensive quality improvement interventions.","2226":null,"2227":null,"2228":"Prevention of venous thromboembolism is of major importance because deep vein thrombosis is an economic burden. To prevent pulmonary embolism, whether fatal or not, and the postphlebitic syndrome, virtually all patients' level of risk should be assessed in order to provide adequate prophylactic measures against venous thromboembolism. Non-pharmacological, pharmacological or combined modalities can reduce the frequency of venous thrombosis. Evidence-based guidelines are available for most situations in surgical patients. However, in medical patients there are fewer data and there are wide variations of opinion. Systematic reviews should be performed and updated to obtain practice guidelines. Cost and effectiveness as well as patients' preferences should be taken into account. Randomized control trials are ongoing: low-molecular-weight heparins are being evaluated in general medical patients; other forms of prophylaxis or combined methods are also being investigated.","2229":"In medical patients there are numerous and variable risk factors for deep vein thrombosis. Placebo-controlled clinical trials are rare. The efficacy of standard heparin or low molecular weight heparin for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis is clearly demonstrated for patients with recent myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke with hemiplegia or severe pulmonary sepsis with lung failure. Pharmacological prophylaxis is probably also efficient in patients with a severe acute disease and a certain history of deep vein thrombosis. For all other medical and especially for bedridden elderly patients, use of low molecular weight heparin might decrease the incidence of deep vein thrombosis but might not modify the overall mortality. In these situations, placebo-controlled clinical trials are needed for best evaluation of the benefit-risk ratio.","2230":"The venous thromboembolic risk seems to be demonstrated in medical patients since the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) without any prophylactic methods is respectively about 50 per cent in stroke, 25 per cent in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and 15 per cent in internal medicine. A synthesis of clinical trials performed in medical patients shows that prophylactic doses of heparins (unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparins) reduce the incidence of DVT by 40 to 60 per cent compared with the lack of any antithrombotic agents but without any significant effect on total mortality. Other antithrombotic agents such as antiplatelet agents seem to reduce the incidence of DVT by about 40 per cent associated with a significant decrease in total mortality of stroke or AMI. But the recommendations made on the basis of these results have to be extremely cautious since the number of medical patients included in clinical trials is quite limited compared with the surgical area. Moreover, each of these recommendations is not sufficiently proven. Thus more clinical trials have to be carried out with a placebo control group in internal medicine and an aspirin control group for stroke and AMI.","2231":"This paper aims to clarify the concepts and terminology of clinical research, evaluation, and quality. Clinical research or clinical epidemiology aims to demonstrate the efficacy of medical care. The optimal methodology is a randomized, double-blind trial that allows a causal inference in respect of efficacy. This should be the first stage before generalization of all medical practice. Evaluation of quality of care aims to verify the effectiveness of medical care by comparing practice with references. The optimal methodology is clinical audit that allows fine-tuned diagnosis of the existence of deviant practices. The analysis of causes and correction of the care process are an integral part of the evaluation work. Thus quality assurance and quality management concepts and methods have been developed which tend to ensure solutions for better care and to maintain the level of quality of care to achieve patient satisfaction. Evaluation, clinical research and management quality could in fact be seen as the complementary facets of a comprehensive approach to quality of care.","2232":"Voluntary drug intoxications are not systematically recorded. Main aspects of this important problem have been studied in the unit responsible for medico-psychological emergencies in the university hospital of Poitiers. Files of all patients admitted to the unit from January to December 1994 have been analysed and 598 patients were included in our study. Of these, 67 per cent were females. 31 per cent were 20 to 29 years old and for the most part unemployed (62.5 per cent). Drugs most commonly used are benzodiazepines (39 per cent), alone or often associated with alcohol (33 per cent). A fatal outcome was observed in one patient. In many cases (50 per cent) this was not the first episode of voluntary intoxication; 53 per cent of the patients were discharged from hospital after a psychiatric consultation. For many years, voluntary drug intoxication frequency has increased continually. All cases have a specific intention that we have to clarify in order to take effective preventive measures to prevent recidivism.","2233":"PaMo 2.0, a type of software, includes a pharmacokinetic model for propofol in the adult. It allows both administration and monitoring of propofol target-controlled infusions. In order to evaluate PaMo 2.0, a prospective clinical trial compared, at defined infusion times, predicted and measured plasma propofol concentrations, in 28 patients programmed for hip-replacement surgery. A propofol plasma determination technique had first been validated, including high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. A statistical analysis based on correlation (r = 0.73), inaccuracy = 29.18 per cent, bias = 11.67 per cent, wobble = 19.15 per cent, and divergence = -0.06 per cent\/min calculation, related to this system, has been carried out. PaMo 2.0 under-estimated plasma propofol concentrations. The convergence between predicted and measured propofol concentrations was good and not modified in respect of infusion time. This infusion system is suitable for propofol administration, but the integration of Bayesian pharmacokinetic models would greatly improve propofol plasma concentration estimation and regimen adaptation to each patient.","2234":"Despite considerable advances in the understanding of cardiac arrhythmia mechanisms, death in relation to ventricular tachyarrhythmias remains an important public health problem, and management of ventricular arrhythmias remains a perpetual challenge in clinical cardiology. In the last decade, the development and refinement of implantable cardioverter defibrillators and the progress in techniques of radiofrequency electrode catheter ablation and antiarrhythmic surgery have been revolutionary in the management of ventricular tachycardia. On the other hand, there have been major changes in the use of drug therapy since the publication of the results of the CAST study. Inclusion of mortality as an endpoint in clinical trials highlights the fact that some antiarrhythmic drugs may have the proclivity to exert fatal proarrhythmic reactions while also having the potential to control recurrences of ventricular tachycardia. All these changes that now need to be integrated into global approaches for ventricular arrhythmia control led us to wonder whether serial testing is still up to date in the management of ventricular tachycardia. After more than 20 years of clinical use, there is much concern about the use of serial drug testing to guide antiarrhythmic drug therapy for the management of life-threatening sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias in light of recent advances in the management of cardiac arrhythmias. The purpose of this article is to discuss, within a relatively brief compass, the cumulative data from different lines of investigations, results of randomized clinical trials, recently acquired beliefs and meta-analytic findings concerning the present place of serial electrophysiologic drug testing in the management of ventricular tachycardia.","2235":"Hyperthyroidism is associated with alterations in pharmacokinetic parameters such as absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination. Beta-blockers are used in particular in the treatment of hyperthyroidism and are also subject to pharmacokinetic changes occurring during this pathology.

Clinical means used to assess the accuracy of therapeutic drug monitoring are also described.","2236":"","2237":"","2238":"","2239":"","2240":"","2241":"","2242":"","2243":"","2244":"","2245":"","2246":"","2247":"","2248":"Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is characterized by annual major depressive episodes. It occurs most commonly in young women during autumn and winter with full remission during the following spring. The patient's mood is a combination of depression and anxiety accompanied by fatigue, loss of libido, and a reduction of socialization. Most of these patients complain of atypical vegetative symptoms (e.g. hypersomnia, carbohydrate craving, and weight gain). Hypotheses on the underlying mechanisms of these behavioural disorders indicate that environmental variables, e.g. climate, latitude, light, and changes in neurotransmitter function that occur naturally with the seasons, may be important. Phototherapy is being used increasingly for the treatment of SAD. The antidepressant response is contingent on the exposure of the patients' eyes to light. The biological basis of the diverse psychological and biological changes in SAD and the underlying mechanism of action of phototherapy are still unclear and require further study.","2249":"The primary function of melatonin in mammals is to transmit information concerning light-dark cycles for the organization of day length dependent on seasonal functions. There is little evidence for an essential role in circadian organization in mammals, in contrast with lower vertebates. It does, however, appear to reinforce physiological functions associated with darkness. Free-running blind and indeed sighted subjects show a close correlation between maximum sleepiness, minimum temperature and peak melatonin secretion. In humans exogenous melatonin will lower core body temperature and induce transient sleepiness in suitable doses and conditions. Similarly it will shift circadian phase, as assessed by a number of marker rhythms. These phase-shifting properties may not be sufficient to synchronize all circadian rhythms in the absence of other time cues. In most normal sighted subjects and a number of blind subjects the sleep-wake cycle can be 'stabilized' to a 24 h period by daily melatonin administration in free-running conditions. However, anomalous results have also been obtained. Daily administration of melatonin (5 mg) appears to fragment sleep in some subjects treated in dim light conditions. This observation requires further investigation since it may compromise the therapeutic potential of both melatonin and its agonists.","2250":"Melatonin is a hormone secreted mainly by the pineal gland but also by the retina. It is synthesized from tryptophan and its characteristic circadian rhythm is ruled by light through the control of two limiting enzymic activities N-acetyl-transferase and hydroxyindole-O-methyl-transferase. In man--as in all studied species--its maximum plasma concentration is at night. Therefore it is considered as a signal transducing information on solar light within the organism thus providing the temporal framework upon which metabolic pathways are organized. Since its circulating levels decrease with ageing the question arises as to the origin and\/or the consequences of this decrease, as well as the possible beneficial effects which could result from its administration in ageing humans.","2251":"The role of melatonin in human glucose regulation is poorly understood. Under normal conditions, glucose tolerance is modulated by circadian rhythmicity and sleep, two central nervous system processes which may be influenced by melatonin. In the presence of a constant stimulus (e.g. intravenous glucose infusion), blood glucose levels increase from morning to evening and further increase until the middle of sleep, when a decline towards morning levels is initiated. This 24-h variation is due to coordinated changes in insulin-dependent and non-insulin dependent glucose utilization (e.g. by the brain), in insulin sensitivity and in insulin secretion. Causative roles for the 24-h cortisol rhythm and for sleep-related growth hormone release have been clearly identified. Changes in sympatho-vagal balance at the level of the pancreas could also be implicated but have not been investigated. Melatonin is likely to play an indirect role in the mechanisms underlying glucose regulation via its actions on the suprachiasmatic nucleus and on sleep regulation.","2252":"Evidence from the last 10 years suggests that melatonin may influence the cardiovascular system. Vascular melatoninergic receptors\/sites have been demonstrated and are functionally linked with vasoconstrictor or vasodilatory effects of low (10(-9)-10(-7) M) and high (10(-6)-10(-3) M) melatonin concentrations respectively. Furthermore several other properties of the neurohormone (e.g. sympathetic inhibition) could contribute to cardioprotection. In vivo melatonin beneficially affects the rat cerebrovascular circulation and protects the rat heart following myocardial ischaemia. In this regard, preliminary clinical data report some alteration of the melatoninergic system in human stroke and coronary heart disease. Finally, the suprachiasmatic nucleus and possibly the melatoninergic system may modulate cardiovascular rhythmicity. Clinical cardiovascular data on melatonin treatment are very scarce; the effects of a therapy modulating the melatoninergic system on cardiovascular haemodynamics and rhythmicity under several physiopathological conditions need to be further explored together with the possible impact on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.","2253":"Melatonin has been detected in the digestive tract of several species and appears to be synthesized by the enterochromaffin cells of the gut. Although a diurnal rhythm of melatonin release has been observed in gastrointestinal tissues of birds, in other species it seems to depend on the presence of nutritional elements. Melatonin binding sites have been identified in the digestive tract of several species and it has been suggested that melatonin could act as a protecting agent of the gastrointestinal mucosa. Moreover, the potential role of melatonin as a local regulator of gastrointestinal motility has been investigated. It seems that at least some effects of melatonin on gut activity depend on an antagonistic relationship between serotonin and melatonin. The effects of melatonin on segmental gut transit both in the fasting and in the fed state, as well as on the electromyographic pattern of the small intestine in rats, are described.","2254":"Melatonin, synthetized by the pineal gland, is the chemical messenger which allows seasonally reproductive animals to perceive day length changes. In the ewe, the neural message, transformed into a hormonal one, triggers pulsatile activity of the LHRH neurons. About 40 days are necessary for melatonin to centrally stimulate the pulsatile LHRH activity. Its sites and mode of action are not yet known completely, but a precise hypothalamic zone has been defined in which radioactive melatonin binds specifically and where cold melatonin delivered locally stimulates LHRH activity. In the veterinary clinic, the most frequent mode of distribution is a sub-cutaneous implant, which induces an advancement of the cyclical ovulatory activity of ewes and goats. The date of fertilization is advanced and fecundity of females is improved. It can be used alone, or in association with other hormonal treatments, or after an artificial photoperiodic treatment. Under these conditions, it allows a quantitative and qualitative increase in out-of-season sperm production in rams and billy-goats. Such an implant is registered and marketed in France, the UK, Greece, Australia and New Zealand.","2255":"Melatonin is a neurohormone secreted by the pineal gland (or epiphysis). It is secreted only during the night whether in man or in diurnal or nocturnal animals. Melatonin secretion is regulated by light, which inhibits or synthesizes it. By a 'feedback' mechanism, melatonin can regulate the suprachiasmatic nuclei which function like internal clocks at the level of melatonin receptors. Specific melatonin agonists are active in different animal models representative of sleep disturbances due to alterations of circadian rhythms.","2256":"Melatonin fulfils most of the requirements of a typical lead compound for rational drug design. We have rationally modified each of its structural features with a view to clarifying their role in drug-receptor interactions (affinity and activity) and to obtain agonist and antagonist ligands which could be used as pharmacological tools and\/or as drugs. Molecular modelling studies allow us to propose a pharmacophore model. The naphthalenic bioisostere of melatonin (agomelatin) is currently under clinical (phase II) evaluation and two other compounds have been selected for development.","2257":"Melatonin is a hormone involved in various physiological processes such as the circadian cycle, hormone release and immune response. High-affinity melatonin receptors are classified in two pharmacologically distinct groups: Mel1 and Mel2. These receptors have first been localized in different organs and brain structures and some subtypes have since been cloned. Inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by Mel1 receptors is the best investigated signalling pathway but cannot be entirely responsible for the diversity of melatonin-induced phenomena. Phospholipase C, potassium ion channels and guanylyl cyclases have also been reported to be modulated by melatonin. This review updates present knowledge of the characterization and signalization of melatonin receptors.","2258":"Melatonin is synthesized and secreted by the pineal gland during the dark period of the light-dark cycle. This rhythmic nocturnal melatonin secretion is generated directly by the circadian clock located, in mammals, within the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SCN) and entrained to a 24 h period by the light-dark cycle. The melatonin rhythm is thus an important efferent hormonal signal from the circadian clock. The periodic secretion of melatonin might thus be used as a circadian mediator of any system that can 'read' the message. The rhythmic nocturnal secretion is dependent on the SCN but the duration of the nocturnal production is directly proportional to the length of the dark period. It is through these changes in duration that the brain integrates the photoperiodic information, which explains the present use of melatonin on farms to control seasonal functions (e.g. fur, reproduction, milk production...). In essence, the melatonin rhythm appears to be an endocrine code of the environmental light-dark cycle conveying photic information that is used by an organism for both circadian and seasonal temporal organization. The major question arising out of this effect of melatonin concerns its precise mechanism of action. Our present knowledge is still fragmentary. As for other hormones, melatonin seems to exert its effects throughout different receptors. In mammals two types have already been determined and cloned (Mella and Mellb). Very probably others will soon be characterized and the list of melatonin receptor-containing structures or organs will lengthen. Most of our functioning (e.g. immune system, cardiovascular system...) displays temporal organization and disorders are known to result from a disturbance of such organization (e.g. during ageing). The potential therapeutic use of melatonin is great; however, this remains to be systematically evaluated.","2259":"Spontaneous reporting remains so far the most used and cost-effective method for detecting new adverse reactions associated with marketed drugs. In France, this routine surveillance involves a network of 31 regional centres. In this study, the numbers of reported cases were compared between centres for three different drug-event associations having justified regulatory decisions. The number of reports differed greatly, both between centres and for the relative numbers of reports of each type in each centre. This study showed that the observed differences between centres probably resulted in a complementary and efficient surveillance of the whole French territory.","2260":"Doxorubicine is an anthracyclin used widely in medical oncology. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the genotoxic and clastogenic effects of this substance through the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay.

It has enabled the demonstration of a significant decrease, after exposure of cells to doxorubicin, of the rate of micronucleated cells (average = 10.8 +\/- 5.7 micronucleus versus 31.9 +\/- 11.5 after exposure, p &lt; 0.0001) and chromosomic aberrations (1 aberration for the control culture versus 17 since the first dose, p &lt; 0.001). At the end of this study, the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay represents a reliable test to study and evaluate the genotoxic power of some substances.","2261":"Medicine combinations for AIDS and cancer treatment are becoming common practice in most clinical stages. These combinations are based on clinical developments which do not follow established guidelines such as those for fixed combinations. There are no current recommendations which can guide these developments and we have tried to identify the critical steps. The main difficulty is to balance the fast development required by the poor prognosis of these diseases and the protection of patients who can only be subjected to combinations for which reasonable expectation of a favourable therapeutic index is foreseen. For each pathology, the pre-clinical evidence-needed before pilot clinical studies and the surrogate clinical end-points are considered (viral load for AIDS and response rate for cancer). These are prerequisities for randomized clinical trials, which are the only means of definitive assessment of new combinations versus existing therapies.","2262":"The first protocol of gene therapy was started in 1990 for two children with adenosine deaminase deficiency. In 1997, the field largely widened, with 2100 patients treated: 10 per cent suffer from hereditary disease, cystic fibrosis mainly, and 90 per cent acquired disease, mainly cancers or HIV infection. No toxicity of gene therapy has been observed for the patients or their environment. A psychological barrier has been crossed which might allow an easing of the regulations. Industrial firms are heavily engaged in this field and are defining the rules of production and use. After in vivo administration to patients, the gene is expressed but the vectorisation is still very weak. Gene therapy should thus be limited to indications with a well-established clinical and scientific rationale.","2263":"This workshop intended to perform a \"state-of-the art\" of current research on adhesion molecules in various pathophysiologies, and to determine pharmacological targets. Indeed, recent important progress concerning the cellular and molecular physiology of adhesion molecules led to the development of various integrin antagonists in several domains, like cardiovascular disease, inflammation and cancer. Integrins play a major role in numerous process like embryonic development, tumor growth and metastasis, apoptosis, hemostasis, leucocyte recruitment and activation, and bone resorption. The development of integrin antagonists is well advanced in the cardiovascular domain, since the first marketed drug (abciximax, Reopro) is an antibody directed against the GPIIb\/IIIa complex (integrin alpha IIb\/beta 3) involved in the final pathway of platelet aggregation. Another active domain of research in pharmacology is 'cardioprotection', i.e. the prevention of cardiac damages induced by the reperfusion of the coronary bed after an ischemia secondary to thrombolysis, angioplasty, of coronary bypass. The pharmacological targets of these antagonists are integrins involved in various process like leucocyte and platelet adhesion and endothelial function. Other potential indications in the cardiovascular field are restenosis after angioplasty, and atherosclerosis.","2264":null,"2265":"The carrying out of clinical trials with a view to the marketing of drugs for human use is directly related to results of some animal studies. This workshop was devoted to evaluation of the quality and interest of these experimental models in reproductive toxicology. The predictive ability of preclinical trials to make extrapolations from animals to man decreases from foetotoxic to tetratogenic risks respectively and from the effects on fertility in both sexes to postnatal risks. As a result of this workshop, we propose the following improvements: (1) standardization and generalization of fertility test evaluations, especially the spermogram, in order to improve animal and human correlations; (2) development of knowledge and standardization of the follow up of the oestral cycle; (3) improvement of standardization, harmonization and diffusion of postnatal tests that prove relevant in animals; (4) increase in initiatives aimed at better mutual understanding of all drug partners; (5) creation of registers for new drugs, as soon as possible during clinical trials, to study their effects on the whole reproductive process; (6) recommendations for the creation of guidelines for International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) to enable classification of observed effects in experimental models. This could lead to specific (potentially for each phase of the reproductive cycle) guidelines, precautions for use and\/or contraindications which are listed in the summary of product characteristics.","2266":null,"2267":"Stents are indicated in the prevention and treatment of coronary occlusion and restenosis following percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. ReoPro (abciximab) is a chimeric monoclonal antibody interfering with the IIb-IIIa glycoprotein platelet receptor. Its efficacy in preventing ischaemic events after coronary angioplasty was evaluated in the EPIC, EPILOG and CAPTURE studies. In these studies, 525 (9.6 per cent) patients were treated with coronary angioplasty and stent. Amongst them, 388 were in a bail-out situation (73.4 per cent). Results showed a significant reduction in the principal criterion (death, myocardial infarction, revascularization procedures) occurrence at 30 days (60.3 per cent; p &lt; 0.001) and at 6 months (23.7 per cent; p = 0.043) and good safety. The greatest reduction was observed in the bail-out situation. Its efficacy must be confirmed by specific studies including health economy data in order to define the place of such an association amongst future therapies.","2268":"Although they are considered as destructive agents, free radicals can sometimes become useful. Their presence is intimately coupled with the activity of certain hemal oxydases which insert an atom of oxygen into their substrate by a stereospecific radical mecanism. The cytochromes P450 and the enzymes of the eicosanoide metabolism are some examples. The free radicals can act as second cellular messengers, especially to modulate the metabolism of arachidonic acid and the prostaglandin tract or to infer a myorelaxation. They can even play the role of neurotransmitters such as azote monoxyde. The activation of phagocytes, which is an essential event in the inflammatory reaction, integrates these notions at several levels: in the mechanisms of bacterial death, in the spread of the inflammatory reaction and in the alteration of the extra-cellular matrix. The inflammatory reaction is initiated by interactions between vascular endothelium, platelets and leukocytes including signal exchanges, adhesion molecule expression and secretion of chimiotactic mediators. Activation of vascular endothelium is a key event in the initiation of the phenomenon. The cells intervening in the precocious inflammatory phase were tissular mastocytes and platelet-liberating mediators (histamine) and neutrophile cells responsible for vascular injuries induced by oxygen free radicals and nitric oxide. Reactive oxygen intermediates play a critical role, primarily to limit tissue damage and prevent or inhibit infection, secondary to enhancing and prolonging reaction. The monocytes and platelets liberate cytokines early, which appears to be important in activation and production of an inflammatory response. In fact, cytokines, especially TNF alpha and IL-1, induce synthesis and secretion endothelial adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin, which have been demonstrated to mediate leukocyte recruitment to sites of inflammation. The cytokines also activate the fibroblasts and endothelial cells that produce, among others, free radicals and other chimiotactic cytokines of which some (IL-8 and related) can induce neutrophil degranulation and stimulate oxidative stress and formation of free radicals. Furthermore, endothelial cells have been shown to make use of a broad repertoire of cytokines including IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 and gro\/MGSA, which may be secreted during an inflammatory response and exercise pro-inflammatory functions. Under the influence of the inflammatory mediators, other enzymes are also activated. The inducible isoforms of cyclo-oxygenase (COX-2) and nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) play an important role in inflammatory reactions via the production respectively of prostaglandins and nitric oxide. The induction of cell adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin), cytokines, acute phase proteins, growth factors, COX-2 and iNOS expression is mediated by the activation of transcriptional factors, especially the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B). The NF-kappa B system is essentially involved in immediate early expression of various immunoregulatory genes and has been demonstrated to represent an important regulatory system of endothelial activation. The target genes for NF-kappa B comprise a growing list of genes intrinsically linked to a coordinated inflammatory response. The NF-kappa B is a heterodimer composed of two subunits (p65 and p50). In non-stimulated cells, NF-kappa B resides in the cytoplasm as an inactive complex bound to its inhibitor, I kappa B. Upon stimulation with various agents including cytokines, mitogenes, viruses and reactive oxygen intermediates, I kappa B dissociates from the NF-kappa B-I kappa B complex and translocates to the nucleus, binding with high affinity to specific sites in the promoter regions of target genes and stimulating their transcription. In the case of any weakness of this anti-oxidizing defence or any over-production of radical species, a state of oxidative stress occurs. (ABSTRACT TRUNC","2269":"Healthy volunteers who participate in clinical trials usually present a specific personality profile characterized by high extroversion and low anxiety traits. Herein, we examined whether anxiety traits influence performance and vigilance, as well as reactivity for six emotions (fear, anger, disgust, sadness, happiness and a neutral state), the latter being induced by the presentation of six film excerpts. Sixty-four healthy volunteers were stratified into high and low anxiety groups on the basis of their score on the Cattell and Hamilton Anxiety Scales. They were assessed on the Digit Symbol Substitution Scale (DSST), Choice Reaction Time (CRT) and Visual Analogue Scales (VAS). Their emotional reactivity was evaluated before and after each film excerpt, on responses to the Differential Emotions Scale (Izard DES). Prior to emotional induction, high-anxious subjects presented a pattern of low positive emotions and high negative emotions. After each film excerpt, emotional reactivity was more pronounced for high-anxious subjects compared with low-anxious subjects. However, there were no significant interactions between anxiety level and the values of DSST, CRT or VAS. The present findings raise the question of the relevance of selecting healthy volunteers according to their personality traits. In future studies, anxiety level will be further investigated as a factor of response variability to drugs, by examining differences in response to psychotropic drugs as a function of this factor.","2270":"First-line antihypertensive monotherapy is effective in normalizing blood pressure in approximatively 50 per cent of patients. Normalization in the remaining patients may require a combination of two or more drugs. This review considers the rationale and the evaluation of combinations with drugs interacting with the renin-angiotensin system (i.e. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor antagonists) with other drugs. The combinations may be justified when giving an additive or synergistic action and when reducing clinical or metabolic side-effects. Recent developments concern the potential benefit of combining ACEI and angiotensin receptor antagonists.","2271":"Renin, angiotensin II and aldosterone levels are elevated in congestive heart failure, especially when diuretics are introduced. This activation is clearly deleterious by elevating myocardial workload and is related to prognosis of heart failure. The link between hormonal activation and prognosis is causal, as hormonal inhibition by converting enzyme inhibitors improves heart failure prognosis. Angiotensin II and aldosterone appears to be toxic for the myocardium. The results of the trial conducted with angiotensin II antagonist losartan confirm data derived from converting-enzyme-inhibitors trials. The exact role of aldosterone is currently being evaluated in the RALES programme.","2272":"Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is now recognized as an effective approach for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. In addition, ACE inhibitors are very effective for the prevention of chronic renal failure. Today, it is possible to antagonize the effects of angiotensin II more specifically using AT1 receptor antagonists. Several non-peptide, orally active angiotensin II receptor antagonists have recently been developed clinically. These new molecules are as effective as ACE inhibitors, calcium antagonists and beta-blockers at reducing blood pressure in hypertensive patients. Furthermore, they appear to have similar systemic and renal hemodynamic properties in patients with congestive heart failure and renal diseases. Now, several large clinical trials such as the LIFE, the RENAAL and the ELITE II studies are under way to investigate the long-term benefits of one of these compounds in hypertension, heart failure and type II diabetic nephropathy.","2273":"Gene coding for the main components of the renin-angiotensin system have been characterized and localized: angiotensinogen (AGT, chromosome 1q42), renin (REN, chromosome 1), angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE, chromosome 17), angiotensin II receptors (AT1R, chromosome 3 and AT2R, chromosome X). A positive linkage and association have been found between AGT and essential hypertension. M235T is also associated with plasma AGT concentration. In vitro studies suggest that a polymorphism (G-6A) which is in complete linkage disequilibrium with M235T and which is located in the promoter close to the start of transcription might explain this association with high blood pressure. The ACE I\/D polymorphism explains about 30 to 40 per cent of the variance of plasma ACE levels. Although the ACE gene itself does not seem to play a role in blood pressure level, the corresponding chromosomal region has been linked to blood pressure in both spontaneously hypertensive rats and humans. In tissues, an increased ACE activity may explain the association between the ACE I\/D polymorphism and coronary heart disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, neointimal proliferation in vessels and progression of diabetic and IgA nephropathy.","2274":"The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an important role in blood pressure regulation and fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) were the first of the RAAS blocking agents to be widely used in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists, another class of pharmacological blockers of the RAAS, have more recently been shown to be safe and useful in hypertension and perhaps also in heart failure. This review deals with the similarities and differences between these two classes of drugs with particular emphasis on the effects of the drugs on the heart, the blood vessels, the kidney (role of the drugs as nephroprotective), the brain, the hormonal profile and finally the potential adverse effects. The place of angiotensin II antagonists in congestive heart failure remains to be more precisely defined.","2275":"The renin-angiotensin system is involved in the control of sodium and water balance, mitogenesis and the regulation of vascular tone as well as of the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Many of these effects may be regulated at a local level by independent tissue renin-angiotensin systems. The renin-angiotensin and adrenergic nervous systems are cross-regulated by interactive compensatory mechanisms. Therefore, the activation of one of these systems induces the activation or induction of the other leading to a co-amplification of cellular mechanisms, for instance resulting in the facilitation of sympathetic neurotransmission. This paper describes the interactions between these systems in the central nervous system and at pre- and postsynaptic sites of the nerve endings in cardiovascular tissues. Since these systems are cross-regulated, the inhibition of one would attenuate the activity of the other. The drugs that inhibit specifically the various components of the renin-angiotensin system have proved powerful tools for studies of the physiology of this system as well as for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure.","2276":"The pharmacology of the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone and analogues is reviewed in the light of recent discoveries regarding the primary structure of corticosteroid receptors and the different isoforms of the enzyme 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. The type 2 isoform of this enzyme functions in some tissues to keep the aldosterone receptor activation specific, i.e. it allows stimulation by aldosterone while eliminating glucocorticoids such as cortisol and corticosterone. The type 2 isoform has been shown in the colon, hypothalamus, kidney, placenta and salivary gland. New clinical uses of aldosterone antagonists may be derived from these developments. Most prominent in this respect appear to be myocardial fibrosis and specific forms of hypertension with altered mineralocorticoid receptor functioning and deficiencies in the protection system of the receptor against glucocorticoids.","2277":"Aldosterone exerts its effects by binding to an intracellular receptor, the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), that belongs to the superfamily of ligand-regulated transcription factors. This family includes receptors for steroid and thyroid hormones, vitamin D and retinoids and also orphan receptors with unidentified ligands. All the members of this family display a modular structure composed of a transactivation domain, a DNA binding domain and a ligand binding domain. Upon hormone binding, the receptor undergoes a series of structural modifications leading to its interaction with DNA sequences and transcriptional modulation of specific genes. Since the level of circulating glucocorticoids is 100-1000 fold higher than that of aldosterone and the affinity of the MR is identical for glucocorticoids and aldosterone, the question of the mechanisms responsible for the in vivo selectivity of aldosterone for its receptor arises. The mechanisms of cellular and tissular selectivity involved in the physiological response of aldosterone are discussed in this review.","2278":"In this review, the authors describe: (1) the different types of glucocorticoid hormone receptors, on the cell membrane and two types inside the cell, the MR and GR (mineralo- and glucoreceptors); (2) the synthesis of the hormones with the decisive role of the final enzymes, 11 beta-hydroxylase and aldosterone-synthetase; (3) the increasing evidence for a cardiovascular steroid system in the vessels as well as in the myocardium. The authors have reported new data suggesting the existence of an endocrine cardiac steroidogenic system in the heart with a potential physiological and pathological relevance (for transmembrane ion transport and trophic alterations).","2279":"The structure, the coding gene and expression of the AT2 subtype receptor of angiotensin II have been described recently; however, the possible role of this receptor remains unclear despite its presence in most mammalian tissues. The AT2 receptor is probably involved in fetal growth and adult tissue repair and remodelling, especially in the cardiovascular system. There are still conflicting results, in vitro and in vivo, as to whether AT2 receptors limit and\/or accelerate the growing processes in the cardiovascular tissues.","2280":"Angiotensin II (AngII), a circulating vasoactive peptide, interacts with specific membrane-bound receptors on the target tissues (vessels, kidneys and adrenal gland). Using new pharmacological tools and molecular cloning, these receptors have been classified in two types, called AT1 et AT2, whereas two subtypes, called AT1A et AT1B, have been identified for the rodent AT1 receptors, but not in humans. All these receptors present a seven hydrophobic transmembrane domain structure, which is classical for G protein coupled receptors. The interspecies molecular homology of these AngII receptors is high (&gt; 90 per cent identity) within the same type of receptor, but is rather low (approximately 35 per cent identity) between the two types of receptors. The AT1 receptors are responsible for most of the AngII physiological actions and are coupled to a Gq protein, which activates a phospholipase C producing second messengers which activate protein kinases C and mobilize calcium intracellular stores. More recently, a strong interaction of this receptor has been demonstrated with the signalling pathways of the tyrosine kinases. The molecular mechanisms and the physiological importance of these interactions remain to be elucidated. The intracellular signalling (Gi coupling and tyrosine phosphatase activation) and the physiological actions (cellular differentiation, apoptosis) of the AT2 receptors are more controversial.","2281":"","2282":"","2283":"As shown in many studies, up-to-date knowledge is not reflected in prescribing behaviours.

Data of 1115 in-patients of Hospices Civils de Lyon were collected. We have shown the feasibility of such a study in spite of many difficulties (52.15 per cent of questionnaires received, missing data...). Reference treatments such as ACE inhibitors in heart failure treatment or betablockers for high blood pressure represent respectively only 14.6 per cent and 6.7 per cent of the prescriptions in these indications.

The main difficulties we encountered concerned communications (4 letters), fewer questionnaires collected than expected (1525\/3018), many missing data, and the lack of a specific budget, thus allowing only partial data exploitation and control. This study revealed many problems such as relevant information for physicians, training and management of investigators, control, data capture and analysis.

Centralization needs a previous standardization, of which terminology is a crucial component. ADR terminology must be designed so as to enable users to know exactly what is covered by each term regarding the nature of the reaction and its significance for public health. A worldwide standardized terminology for all drug reporting purposes is currently being developed by the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use. However, practical definitions of medical terms will be necessary and could be developed by specialists on drug safety in collaboration with specialists of different system organs, as has already been achieved for some of them.","2286":"Ketoprofen gels, since their introduction on the French market (1989), have been responsible for various cutaneous side-effects (essentially photosensitization and contact eczemas). A study conducted by the French drug surveillance system detected 337 cases. Analysis showed that the frequency of cutaneous adverse events was from 0.008\/1000 to 0.023\/1000 according to the commercial gel. The sex ratio was well distributed, and the population was young (30-40 years) and athletic. Treatment lasted about 7 days, and the appearance of the side-effect was sometimes quite delayed relative to discontinuance of treatment. Reactions were severe in 40 per cent of cases. The factors favourable to side-effects were essentially exposure to the sun (one-third of cases) and occlusive dressing. No particular predisposing conditions were noted, although 2.6 per cent and 8.5 per cent of cases respectively involved earlier sensitization by a topical NSAID. The side-effect lasted about 16 days. The course was usually favourable but hospitalization was required in about 10 per cent of cases. Photoallergological testing indicated photosensitization to ketoprofen. These results led the National Commission of the French drug surveillance system to request a modification in the indications for the prescription of the ketoprofen gels.","2287":"Self-medication is widely practised and could be defined as taking drugs without the advice of a physician. The present survey documented self-medication users' profile and their drug-taking behaviour. prospective study by self-report questionnaire. 600 residents of the Meurthe et Moselle subdivision (eastern France), ranging in age from 15 to 85 years, including 288 males and 312 females. use and impressions of self-medication, based on the subjects' own experience. questionnaires were coded and put on computer. The data were analysed and compared by chi-square and analysis of variance. Statistical significance was accepted at p &lt; 0.05. 313 subjects (52.2 per cent) reported having used self-medication. The three main motives for this practice were: headache (46.9 per cent), nose, throat or respiratory tract diseases (22.1 per cent) and abdominal pain (7.3 per cent). Self-use of drugs usually involved left-over past prescribed treatment (76 per cent), or were bought without the advice of a pharmacist (28 per cent). The self-medication user tends to be a woman, ranging in age from 20 to 39 years, living in a marital relationship and resident in an urban zone. The behaviours leading to self-medication were studied. Five groups are described, probably associated with five different attitudes towards self-medication. One of them shows subjects who essentially use drugs not to treat a disease but to enhance their performance. ","2288":"This study in normotensive subjects compared plasma concentrations of amlodipine (5 mg) and of a sustained release form of diltiazem (300 mg) after single and multiple oral dosings of the two drugs. As a consequence of the galenic form of administered formulations, plasma concentration of diltiazem versus time curves exhibited two peaks corresponding to fast and slow releases of diltiazem. Conversely, the curves of amlodipine plasma concentration depicted only one peak. There was less variability in plasma concentrations and in pharmacokinetics with amlodipine than with diltiazem after both single and multiple oral dosings of the two drugs. These results suggested that amlodipine displayed less variability in blood pressure response at steady-state. The rate of decrease in plasma levels of diltiazem between 24 and 48 hours post-dose was higher than that of amlodipine. So, even after a missed dose, there is only a small decline in plasma concentrations of amlodipine and therefore it suggests a small repercussion on the blood pressure attenuation.","2289":"The aim of this study was to assess drug prescription and utilization in Morocco 8 years after the statement of the Action Program for Essential Drugs. To evaluate the role of essential drugs in these prescriptions, a study of about 600 prescriptions and questionnaires sent to a random sample of 111 prescribers and a series of visits with the investigator as a neutral observer was undertaken. The average number of drugs prescribed was 3.27, which reflected the feelings of most of the clinicians, for whom 3 drugs per patient is the required number.

In infected patients, an accumulation of a host protein from the genes, the prion protein, is observed in proportionality to the infectious load.

On neuropathological examination, patients have a characteristic triad: neuronal vacuolisation, neuronal death and glial reaction. The nature of agents involved in these subacute spongiform encephalopathies is not known. Most authors think that the causal agent is a pathological form of the PrP protein partially resistant to proteinase K (the prion). For others, it is a more classical structure including an independent genome for which the prion protein will be either the receptor or the virulent factor. The apparition of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United Kingdom and of the new variant of Creutzfelt-Jakob disease brings into question the discovery of new subacute spongiform diseases and involves the proposition of efficacious protective measures for public and animal health.","2293":"","2294":"","2295":"","2296":"","2297":"We report our first 100 cases of Alzheimer's (AD) patients treated with tacrine (Cognex) for a period of one year.

It becomes symptomatic from the fifth decade of life and needs treatment in 50 per cent of patients. Hyperplastic prostatic tissue and the smooth involuntary sphincter have a high density of alpha 1-adrenoceptors, thus alpha 1-blockers can decrease sphincter tone and reduce the tension exerted by the prostatic muscular component. Attempts have been made to find alpha 1-antagonists that have a selective effect on the prostate (alfuzosin), are long acting (tamsulosin, terazosin, doxazosin) or present specificity on the alpha 1A prostatic adrenoceptors (tamsulosin), in order to maintain efficacy without affecting blood pressure. Finasteride, a 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor without hypotensive side-effect may be more effective in men with a predominantly glandular component to their benign hyperplasia or with very large prostate glands, but has a longer onset of action and produces more adverse sexual effects. Thus, alpha-1 antagonists can be considered as an appropriate treatment option in patients with troublesome symptoms of BPH and who have not developed serious complications indicating surgery.","2299":"Menopause is a very important public health problem for many reasons.

New dopaminergic drugs, either with longer elimination half life or with specificity for subtypes of dopamine receptors may allow these dyskinesias to be managed more efficaciously. New non-dopaminergic, serotoninergic, adrenergic, opiate or gluamate drugs could offer antidyskinesia properties. The study of Parkinson disease's model in the methyl phenyltetrahydropyridine (MPT)-treated primate and the improvement in clinical evaluation of these dyskinesias could lead, in the short or medium term, to the discovery of new pharmarcological strategies, dealing more efficaciously with this serious adverse effect of L-dopa treatment.","2301":"Four different forms of primary autonomic failure (multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, Parkinson's disease and dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency) have been described. The first part of the article will focus on the interest to pharmacology of elucidating pathophysiological mechanisms underlying autonomic involvement at the central level (growth hormone response to clonidine acute challenge), presynaptic level (plasma catecholamine levels after yohimbine administration) and on post-synaptic receptors (binding studies, pressor responses to noradrenaline). The second part will discuss efficacy and side-effects of some of the many drugs which are currently proposed for the treatment of one of the most disabling symptoms related to autonomic failure, orthostatic hypotension. Special attention will be paid to drugs acting on blood composition (fludrocortisone, erythropoietin), on post-synaptic alpha-adrenoceptors (midodrine and clonidine) and on noradrenaline spill-over (yohimbine and L-Threo-DOPS).","2302":"Treatment of degenerative diseases includes neuroprotective strategies. Among these, the importance of the different neurotrophic factors has been demonstrated but the remaining difficulty is the way of administration. It is important to find new strategies in cell and gene domains. Cell ex vivo therapy and gene in vivo therapy are under development but must be confirmed by clinical trials.","2303":"Neurodegenerative processes are generally characterized by the long-lasting course of neuronal death and the selectivity of the neuronal population or brain structure involved in the lesion. This is the case for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's or Huntington's diseases, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The reasons for such a specificity are largely unknown as are generally the mechanisms of the diseases. One common feature of these diseases, however, is that the neuronal death is thought to involve apoptosis, at least partly. Interestingly, apoptosis in the brain would involve specific gene products similar to that identified in the nematode c. elegans, partly corresponding in mammals to ICE-related compounds and Bcl2 protein. The involvement of calcium as well as of oxydative stress mechanisms in such neuronal death is to be fully proved but putative modulation by external signals (such as those provided through trophic factors or even neurotransmitters) represents an interesting way to validate the current hypothesis of neuronal death in neurodegenerative diseases in humans.","2304":"The potential chondrotoxicity of drugs is very difficult to appreciate because of the difficulties involved in evaluating the evolution of cartilage in human beings. This article attempts to summarize the data from the literature concerning the hypothetical chondrotoxicity of non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, fluoroquinolones, intra-articular injections of corticosteroids, and other drugs.","2305":"The term 'chondroprotective agent' must be dropped in favour of that of structure-modifying drug which allows consideration of the global process of osteoarthritis (OA). A structure-modifying drug is defined as being able to prevent, retard, stabilize or even reverse all or a part of the lesions of bone and cartilage which form the structure of human OA. The demonstration of an eventual structure-modifying effect can only be provided by the proof of a favourable result on the anatomical lesions of OA. The measurement of joint-space narrowing by manual 'radiochondrometry' or performed by computer is presently the 'method of choice', but requires the strict respect of standardized rules during the radiographic procedure. MRI may allow, in the future, a satisfactory assessment of the volume of articular cartilage. Chondroscopy permits a direct evaluation of lesions but is an invasive technique. Molecular markers still lack reliability. Until now, no drug has been able to provide well-established proof of a real effect of structuromodulation.","2306":"","2307":"","2308":"","2309":"","2310":"","2311":"","2312":"The aim of the present study was to investigate the incidence of adverse effects and the prognostic value of various risk factors in a large population of unselected hypertensive patients treated with the ACE inhibitor trandolapril. Among the 30 072 patients investigated in this post marketing retrospective study, 1813 patients (6.0 per cent) reported an adverse effect. The five most frequent side effects were coughing (3.1 per cent), dizziness (0.7 per cent), headache (0.6 per cent) asthenia (0.5 per cent) and nausea (0.3 per cent). Intolerance risk factors for trandolapril were researched using both univariate and multivariate analysis. In the univariate analysis, a prior intolerance of an ACE inhibitor and female gender were strongly correlated with either overall intolerance or coughing. The most relevant variables for the occurrence of adverse effects, listed according to their entry order in the multivariate analysis, were: prior intolerance of ACE inhibitors (OR: 4.19, 95 per cent CI: 3.66-4.78), female gender (OR: 1.46, 95 per cent CI: 1.31-1.63), prior intolerance of other antihpertensive agents (OR: 1.27, 95 per cent CI: 1.14-1.41), smoking (OR: 0.76, 95 per cent CI: 0.66-0.87) and combination with a beta blocker (OR: 1.31, 95 per cent CI: 1.08-1.58). A prior intolerance of an ACE inhibitor appears to be a very strong predictor of coughing (OR: 6.14, 95 per cent CI: 5.24-7.19). The following variables, namely female gender (OR: 1.61, 95 per cent CI: 1.40-1.85), age 60-80 (OR: 1.25, 95 per cent CI: 1.09-1.44) and prior intolerance of other antihypertensive agents (OR: 1.20, 95 per cent CI: 1.03-2.39) appear less significant.","2313":"Since September 1994, danaparoid (Orgaran), a heparinoid, has been used in our centre to treat patients with thrombocytopenia occurring during heparin therapy and who need continuing antithrombotic therapy. We carried out a retrospective study using clinical and biological data on the first 13 consecutive patients treated with danaparoid (for 1 to 18 consecutive days). The platelet count returned to normal for ten patients, but one patient died having contracted a severe sepsis and bleeding occurred in one patient with acute renal failure. In the three other cases, the diagnosis of heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) was in retrospect unlikely and the death of these patients was related to severe underlying diseases which were held responsible for thrombocytopenia. We confirm that danaparoid appears to be an effective, well-tolerated substitute for heparin in HIT patients. The French regulation Temporary Authorization for Prescribing Medicines allowed the prompt use of this as yet unmarketed drug and collection of reliable and pertinent data.","2314":"Between 1985 and 1992, 81 spontaneous oesophageal injuries associated with tetracycline were notified to the French Regional Pharmacovigilance Centres. The side effects were oesophageal ulcers (79 per cent), esophagitis (11 per cent) and dysphagia (10 per cent). Esophagitis and dysphagia appeared sooner (4 days) than the ulcers (15 days). The mean age of the patients was 29 +\/ 13 years and 73 per cent were women. In 92 per cent of cases, the recommendations for administration were not observed (medication taken at bedtime with not enough or without water). With 96 per cent of patients, doxycycline was the tetracycline in question; this prevalence could be explained by its irritant and cytotoxic properties. The oesophageal injuries were 22 times more frequent with capsules than with tablets, because of their easier adhesion to the oesophageal surface. Oesophageal injuries are potentially serious and must be avoided by clear information to patients and prescribers on tetracycline administration; consumption in the middle of a meal with an adequate quantity of water and never less than one hour before bedtime.","2315":"In the light of recent experiences and anticipating an increase in similar requests in the future, it seemed very interesting to a drug safety executives' group from the pharmaceutical industry to propose guidelines for the set-up and follow-up of pharmacoepidemiological studies requested by Health Authorities for the assessment of drug risk. The scope of these guidelines is to establish the responsibility of the teams and structures involved in the study, to define the necessary stages set-up, and to determine the rules in order to ensure its smooth running from the drafting of the protocole to the final use of the data.","2316":null,"2317":"The quality of prescription writing has been evaluated in respect of standards of good practice. Among the 44 medical departments of a university hospital, 39 agreed to participate in the study.

The patient's identification was completed in 39.1 +\/ 3.4 per cent. THe prescriptor was properly identified by name and signature in 7.2 +\/ 1.8 per cent of prescriptions studied. Only 8.9 +\/ 2.1 per cent of prescriptions contained the required information for each medication.

This evaluation constitutes the first stage of a quality process based on the awareness and information of concerned actors and follow up of specific indicators.","2318":"A clinical practice survey, if patient focused, identifies and analyses complexity of drug use. It is not a clinical audit whose aim is to compare observed practice with predetermined criteria. A clinical practice survey is useful when a problem exists in a low evidence based clinical area or to elaborate clinical guidelines. Implementation is based on epidemiological methodology and project management and needs a framework determined by a facilitator (trained in quality improvement methods and expert in the clinical area concerned), planning (the more higher the number of wards, the higher the complexity) and the project guidelines must be respected. Since lack of physician involvement is a drawback, support provided by the quality centre (if it exists) must be limited to technical aspects. It is important to appreciate the level of quality culture of the organization and the project must be approved by the hospital manager.","2319":"Hepatitis C now poses an important problem of public health in France. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost of care of 55 patients who were carriers of hepatitis C and treated with interferon alpha. The economic analysis included the blood testing costs, pharmaceutical costs and hospitalization costs. A questionnaire permitted the impact of the treatment on the socio-professional life of each individual to be assessed. The global cost amounted to 1155 359 francs spread among hospitalization costs (55 pour cent), pharmaceutical costs (35.8 pour cent) and blood testing costs (9.2 pour cent). Of 36 actively working patients being treated, 10 modified their activities and 4 of these 10 restarted their initial activities after stopping treatment. This evaluation has shown the disparities which exist in the clinical follow up of patients treated for chronic hepatitis C. It is thus imperative to institute a systematic screening of patients being transfused to permit an early diagnosis, to establish a rigorous standardization of blood testing, to visualise day care treatment and above all to establish a consensus of global care of these patients.","2320":"The reliability of trials in clinical research is principally conditioned by the quality of the conception, the realization and the data recording in the hypothesis of pertinent trials with an adequate methodology. The author describes the application in the cardiovascular domain, the realization and the use of numeric Case Report Forms DCRF working with a 'notebook' microcomputer and easy to use software which allows the conduct of quality clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice. The numeric CRF is a tool to monitor in real time the data from trials (ongoing data trials) and ensures the continuity from the investigator site to the statistical department. An example of realization of a phase III multicentre clinical study is presented to evaluate the efficacy of two antihypertensive calcium-channel blockers.","2321":"Among the molecules under development or registration proposes for licensing among the pharmaceutical firms, the choice of one molecule is often difficult. The methods of decision analysis can allowed the formalization of this choice. Multicriterion analyses (ELECTRE 1 and 2) have the capacity to integrate the qualitative criteria and to incorporate concordance and discordance indicators in the judgement. The objective of this study is to present the bases of the multicriterion method and to give an example of application in the clinical cardiovascular domain to select one anti-hypertensive molecule among a preselection of 9, by using 12 differently weighted judgment criteria. Five molecules were selected by the ELECTRE 1 method and only one by the ELECTRE2 method.","2322":"Many theories about dopaminergic function in Parkinson's disease are based upon the effects of the D2 receptor. Standard treatments mostly involve dopaminergic D2 agonists. However, the recent development of dopaminergic D1 agonists should help to clarify the role of the D1 receptor in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. The authors review the physiopathological, behavioural and therapeutic data on D1 agonists administered in animal models and in patients.","2323":"The rehabilitation of memory must be defined in terms of patient selection, therapist support and techniques as accurately as for language therapy. Three objectives can be offered for organic amnesia: reorganizing the memory by using alternative intact routes; working with remaining intact memory as the implicit focus, modification of surroundings with 'mnemonics protheses' such as a diary, alarms. The approach must be cognitive for the theoretical support of therapists, but also pragmatic to respect the patient's needs and wishes in the context of family and job. Patient selection must be based not only on rigorous aetiological and neurological grounds but also on an individual and cognitive understanding of each patient.","2324":"","2325":"To study the predictive value of memory complaints resulting in consultation with a GP as to the risk of subsequent dementia, we analysed the data from the follow-up of the Paquid cohort study carried out around Bordeaux. A sample of 1503 elderly people over 65, living at home and non-demented at the baseline screening, was considered. The risk of dementia was measured two and four years after the baseline screening: 60.8 per cent of subjects themselves perceived a memory impairment and 15.6 per cent expressed this complaint to their GP. Forty-eight developed a subsequent dementia. Taking the group without memory complaint as the reference set, three groups of elderly people could be recognized as at high risk of dementia: subjects with self-perceived memory impairment, consulting a GP with low memory performance or with normal memory performances, and subjects with memory complaints not resorting to a GP but with low memory performance. In non-demented elderly people, memory complaints expressed to the GP may be a strong predictor of dementia and should not be neglected.","2326":"Recognizing the existence of memory disorders in elderly subjects necessarily involves developing a diagnostic strategy to identify the causes. Three types of complementary investigation are available: neurophysiological and neurobiological tests, and anatomical and functional brain imaging studies. Major efforts have been made to identify diagnostic markers on the electroencephalogram. Quantified EEG may have a certain value. However, it provides a plethora of data and there is no consensus on which items are most relevant on the EEG, whether the patient is awake or asleep. Evoked 'cognitive' potentials may also provide useful data, particularly to distinguish between the different types of degenerative dementia. Exaggerated pupil dilation in response to a mydriatric drug has also been put forward as a diagnostic test. The results, however, are controversial. For the time being there is no diagnostic laboratory parameter that can be used routinely, even if studies of the proteins tau and P97 are promising. Molecular genetics-based studies have identified a number of chromosomal abnormalities in certain families. Apart from studies of chromosome 19 and apolipoprotein 3, these markers have no practical utility. Allele sigma 4 is associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease. Apolipoprotein E phenotyping can of course be of diagnostic value, but no more so than neuropsychological or neuroimaging methods. On the other hand, it is difficult to derive a predictive test. It also seems difficult to develop a diagnostic strategy without including brain imaging studies. The value of morphological imaging (CT, MRI) in the diagnosis of dementias is clear. Volumetric measurements of certain brain structures might be a useful diagnostic approach for early detection. Functional brain imaging methods (PET and SPECT) appear particularly suited to the diagnosis of degenerative dementias. The presence of functional abnormalities at onset, and, even before the first clinical signs appear, is clearly valuable.","2327":"Cognitive assessment in memory clinics requires selection of the appropriate tests according to several criteria such as (a) sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis purpose, (b) equivalence of test forms for follow-up purposes, (c) pragmatic aspects (acceptability, duration), (d) theoretical background. Clearly, there is not any single test available that can satisfy all these requirements. Clinical experiences from many groups involved in memory clinics were collected and compared in order to try and identify strategies to improve and, it was hoped, to make uniform various methods for memory assessment. Indeed, early diagnosis, a condition sine qua non for better treatment, should benefit from such uniform and theory-based assessment across French-speaking countries.","2328":"Assessment of clinical health care focuses on 'what is really done' in order to describe day-to-day practice. These data could be compared with standards or guidelines. The method used, the 'clinical audit', aims to improve the quality of care through specific actions. Finally, a second data collection could assess the efficacy of these actions. Many protocol designs could be used; they are illustrated by two examples in this article. The choice of protocols depends on the field and on the objectives of the work. Most of the time, assessment of clinical health care is included in a continuous quality improvement programme.","2329":"The main points of a workshop on the place of clinical trials in the memory clinics in France are reproduced schematically. The efficiency of these centres has been tested at the time of the numerous clinical trials performed in France on Alzheimer's disease. In parallel, several difficulties have been pointed out: inhomogeneity of the technical approaches, official role of psychologists in the hospital teams, integration of clinical research to individual care. A particular effort should be oriented towards specific research on the different types of dementia, on early stages, on information for both media and authorities as well as on specific technical and methodological problems.","2330":"The day hospital appears to be highly suitable for a memory clinic, not only as a complementary service, but also for teaching and clinical or epidemiologic research purposes. As regards diagnostic procedures, the possibility of doing tests and assessments in the same place and in a short time is a clear advantage for these often fragile patients. In the day hospital, clinical assessments can be coupled with the paraclinical tests required to make a diagnosis, with efficient technical resources on hand. Multidisciplinarity and close collaboration between the different specialists are the key elements in the diagnosis and long-term management of these patients, who also find the premises less worrisome than the hospital environment. The day hospital appears to be the ideal setting for monitoring and therapeutic management, being situated at the interface between hospital and community physicians.","2331":"Follow-up of patients in memory units raises problems of structure, team, diseases, evaluation and organization. Structures could be within the hospital, for early diagnosis, or outside hospital for prevention. The medical team is organized around the neurologist, must integrate different medical specialists (neurologist, psychiatrist, geriatrician) and be composed minimally of a clinician and a psychologist. Diseases range from memory complaint to very serious diseases such as Alzheimer's, vascular or post-traumatic dementia. Therapy includes cognitive stimulation and drug clinical trials. Evaluation requires medico-psycho-social analysis of the patient and his\/her family. Memory consulting units could be integrated in a caring network organised in a modular fashion or like a geriatric hospital.","2332":"The burgeoning of interest in Alzheimer's disease since the early 1980s has resulted in the development of memory clinics to improve the diagnosis and management of patients with the disease. Some memory clinics, however, have a broader interest in memory disorders, especially in those associated with normal ageing. Some questions should be considered with regard to the activity of memory clinics: (1) should the patients be systematically subjected to a multidisciplinary team and standardized examinations or to a single specialist in charge of adjusting examinations and management to particular situations? (2) Who should be responsible for the financial cost of memory clinics: the patients, the National Health Service or research grants? Evaluation procedures should be set up as soon as possible to answer these questions.","2333":"","2334":"","2335":"The high prevalence rate of mortality in diabetic patients is explained by atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease. Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, chronic hyperglycemia, decrease of endothelial cells and of monocytes-macrophage cell functions, and hypercoagulability are the main side-effects which are involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic atherothrombotic disease. Its clinical manifestations are coronary heart disease, peripheral vascular insufficiency, cerebral vascular insufficiency and reno-vascular hypertension. The common characteristics are a clinical latent period, the frequency of acute complications and the widespread bilateral distal localisation of vascular insufficiency. The therapeutic strategy in diabetic atherothrombotic disease is becoming better codified, leading to screening and prevention. The evaluation of diabetic vascular risk could reduce the prevalence of thrombotic events.","2336":"","2337":"","2338":"Because of the relations between retinal endothelial cells and the nervous tissue, microangiopathy is considered to be the result of combined impairments of the choriocapillaris, the pigmented epithelium, the nervous layers, the pericytes and the vitreoretinal interface. The known effects of hyperglycaemia are: the accumulation of sorbitol, the reduction of myoinositol, the lower activity of ATPase NA\/K, the accumulation of AGE. The functional and structural changes are: impaired autoregulation of the blood flow, breakdown of the blood retinal barrier, thickening of the basement membrane, loss of pericytes and proliferation of endothelial and glial cells. Capillary closure is the first step in proliferating retinopathy via VEGF secreted from all the retinal cells. Normalization of the glycaemia is the only medical treatment which has been proved to be effective in the initial stages of the retinopathy. In the advanced stages, laser photocoagulation and vitreo-retinal surgery have been shown to be effective. The aldose-reductase and glycosylation inhibitors are still under investigation.","2339":"Diabetes produces dramatic changes in retinal microvasculature, triggering endothelial cell proliferation and microaneurysms. Capillaries become weakened, releasing blood into vitreal and retinal spaces. Photoreceptors become occluded and separated from the choriocapillaris, resulting in visual acuity decline, detachment and cell death. Several models have been developed that have proved useful for the study of this disease, resulting in a better understanding of the processes involved. Streptozotocin treatment affects the pancreatic beta cells, rapidly reducing them until insulin is no longer synthesized in sufficient amounts. The galactosemic model shifts metabolism away from glucose, increasing aldose reductase and retinal polyol metabolism. Finally, two weeks of cycled oxygen from high to low tension every 24 hours, followed by return to room air, triggers microangiogenesis in developing retinas. Use of these models, separately or in combination, as well as electroretinographic analysis, has begun to reveal the events taking place as diabetic retinopathy progresses. Endothelial cells become separated from pericytes as basement membranes thicken, and vascular endothelial growth factor increases, triggering their proliferation. Finally, early changes occurring within photoreceptors can now be studied.","2340":"The Ets1 transcription factor gene is expressed in endothelial cells during blood vessel formation under normal or pathological conditions. The proposed hypothesis aims to involve Ets1 in the regulation of angiogenesis processes by activating the transcription of genes encoding matrix-degrading proteases. In vivo experiments allowing specific manipulation of ets1 gene expression or activity within endothelial cells are necessary to investigate the functional role of Ets1. Two experimental models using retroviruses expressing ets1 mutants have been chosen: Chicken embryo development and tumour-induced angiogenesis in mice. Another approach targeted on the vascular endothelium has been developed in order to obtain transgenic mice expressing specifically in endothelial cells an ets1 transdominant negative mutant under the control of the tek and tie promoters. These tools should allow interference with Ets1 activity at defined stages during normal or pathological development.","2341":"","2342":"The detection of early atherosclerosis, accelerated by the presence of diabetes mellitus, is of major importance for improving the prediction and the prevention of subsequent clinical events. Three markers of atherosclerosis can be detected non invasively: arterial wall thickening, coronary calcification and arterial wall stiffening. Intima-media thickness can be measured by B-mode ultrasonography in common carotid and femoral arteries. Increased intima-media thickness has been found to be associated with both insulin-dependent and non insulin-dependent diabetes. Such thickening might be partly of atherogenic nature but may also be due to a non-atherogenic process such as medial hypertrophy possibly related to insulin effects. Coronary calcification, an anatomic marker of coronary atheroma, is detected radiographically by fluoroscopy or ultrafast computed tomography. Cross-sectional studies of asymptomatic high-risk populations have found independent associations between diabetes and the presence and amount of coronary calcium deposit. The mechanisms by which diabetes promotes coronary calcium deposit are unknown, but mineralization proteins, such as osteopontin and its genetic expression, might be implicated in the calcinosis process. Arterial wall stiffening, a marker of sclerosis, detected by pulse wave velocity measurement or by determination of arterial wall motion using an echotracking device, has been found to be associated with diabetes in several case-control and transverse studies. The mechanisms of such association may involve the effect of glycoregulation of bioelastomers in the arterial wall. The detection of early atherosclerosis in diabetic patients may be clinically relevant by helping to improve the prediction of vascular risk, the justification to treat, and the evaluation of the efficacy of antidiabetic treatment on the vessels.","2343":"","2344":"","2345":"Among numerous complications associated with diabetes, the alterations of the normal properties of various microcirculation circuits lead to important dysfunctions which may contribute to target organ damage. As the endothelium plays a crucial role in the microcirculatory circuits, it is suggested that diabetes may influence both the physical and endocrine properties of that cell layer. In 1995, we reported an important increase in plasma extravasation in a model of diabetes in rats treated with streptozotocin. The increase of plasma extravasation was particularly significant in the pulmonary, skin and splanchnic areas. In that particular study, it was of interest that inhibitors of neutral endopeptidases, such as thiorphan, phosphoramidon and SQ 28,603 (specific inhibitor of the recombinant neutral endopeptidases2) corrected almost completely the increase of plasma extravasation induced by diabetes when compared with control rats. It is also worthy of note that the three above-mentioned inhibitors failed to normalize in any case the hyperglycaemia associated with the diabetes in these animals. The present document is a summary synthesis of the putative role of neutral endopeptidases and of the beneficial effects of the inhibitors of these enzymes in diabetes-induced plasma extravasation in the rat.","2346":"","2347":"","2348":"Endothelial cell junctions are complex structures formed by transmembrane adhesive molecules linked to a network of cytoplasmic\/cytoskeletal proteins. At least three different types of endothelial junctions have been described: tight junctions, gap junctions and adherens junctions. These structures have some features and components in common with epithelium but also some which are specific for endothelium. We still know very little about the pathologic consequences of alterations in the functional behaviour or synthesis of endothelial cell junction proteins. It is possible that pathologies linked to altered endothelial permeability and vascular organization (e.g. hemangiomas, scleroderma, and other types of vasculitis) are associated with structural alterations in endothelial junction organization. In addition, changes in endothelial permeability properties are associated with the early stages of atherosclerosis and many inflammatory diseases.","2349":"Modifications of hemostasis and plasma lipids are an integral part of diabetes mellitus, and probably play a key role in the evolution of vascular complications. This review points to the important relationships between hemostasis and lipids and their modifications in diabetes, with a special attempt to link the abnormalities described with the pathogenic mechanisms of diabetes.","2350":"","2351":"","2352":"This review presents the major animal models usually used for the study of the pathological processes related to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and to the main diabetic complications. These models can be observed spontaneously or can be obtained by selective cross-breeding or toxic exposure (chemical or viral), as well as genetically induced. They reproduce some aspects of the human pathology without combining them all in a single model. Consequently, a pertinent pharmacological approach may compare the results obtained with several models. The examination of the recent results obtained with transgenesis does not allow these animal models to replace more classical ones but they may constitute a future challenge for gene therapy despite the multifactorial aspect of diabetic disease.","2353":"The absolute risk of cardiovascular events is three times higher in diabetics than in non-diabetics. This risk can be due either to specific microvascular complications, or to macrovascular complications, which are non-specific but more frequent, earlier, and of poorer prognosis in diabetics than in non-diabetics. The link between hyperglycaemia and microvascular diseases has been well established in insulin-dependent diabetes. Conversely, no specific treatment strategy has been established to decrease cardiovascular risk in non-insulin-dependent diabetes, especially taking into consideration the level of hyperglycaemia.","2354":"","2355":"After oral administration of Sandimmun, the bioavailability of cyclosporin can vary substantially especially in view of its narrow therapeutic index. As a consequence, optimal exposure of patients to the drug is sometimes difficult to ensure. The new formulation of cyclosporin, Neoral, improves the absorption of the drug. This results in an increase in bioavailability, a lower dependency on food, bile or pancreatic enzymes and a markedly reduced intra- and inter-patient variability in pharmacokinetic parameters. This allows an easier adjustment of patient exposure. The clinical efficacy of Neoral is equivalent to, or even better than, that of Sandimmun. The tolerability of the two formulations is comparable.","2356":"Tacrolimus (FK 506) is a new macrocyclic lactone immunosuppressant which possesses similar but more potent immunosuppressive properties compared with cyclosporin. It is able to inhibit T cell proliferation and the production of interleukine 2 (and other growth promoting cytokines). A major interest of tacrolimus is that it can be used as a rescue therapy since clinical trials have demonstrated its ability to be effective in some patients who develop rejection episodes refractory to current regimens, including corticosteroids. Tacrolimus is highly bound to erythrocytes and is largely metabolized, primarily in the liver, by Cyt P450 3A4. Its excretion pathway concerns the bile almost exclusively. Like cyclosporin, the drug is associated with a range of adverse effects including nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity and diabetes. Tacrolimus also exhibits a large inter- and intra-individual variability of its pharmacokinetics. Because of this variability and the narrow therapeutic index of tacrolimus, monitoring of tacrolimus blood concentrations would be useful for optimization of therapy. However, even if we know that by maintaining the residual blood concentration under 15 micrograms\/l it is possible to reduce dramatically the occurrence of adverse effects, we still have not determined the threshold value of clinical efficacy. This will be important for current and future clinical pharmacology investigations with tacrolimus.","2357":"Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is a new immunosuppressive drug used in clinical trials in combination with cyclosporine A (CsA) and prednisolone. Its immunosuppressive mechanism consists in a non-competitive inhibition of the inosine monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase which is the key enzyme in the conversion of inosine monophosphate to guanosine monophosphate. Depletion of the guanine nucleotide pool impairs DNA synthesis and thus inhibits the cell cycle progression of T- and B-lymphocytes. For monitoring of MPA and its metabolite mycophenolic acid glucuronide (MPAG), a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method, and for MPA an EMIT-immunoassay, were established. MPA HPLC and EMIT exhibit a linearity up to 10.00 mumol\/l (3.20 micrograms\/ml) and 46.95 mumol\/l (15.00 micrograms\/ml) respectively. Coefficients of variation for intra \/inter-assay bias were 5.3\/14.1 per cent for HPLC and 4.8\/12.3 percent for the EMIT assay. The correlation between both methods was: HPLC = 0.82 EMIT -1.85 (r = 0.955); limits of agreement between the methods were 13.6 and -5.12 mumol\/l. In 8 stable heart transplant recipients treated with 2 g mofetil\/day, mean and median steady-state MPA concentrations for HPLC and EMIT were 6.86 mumol\/l (2.19 micrograms\/ml), 4.77 mumol\/l (1.52 micrograms\/ml) and 10.88 mumol\/l (3.48 micrograms\/ml), 7.42 mumol\/l (2.37 micrograms\/ml) respectively, during a period of 3 months. Mean and median MPAG concentrations were 141.21 mumol\/l (61.40 micrograms\/ml) and 100.70 mumol\/l (43.78 micrograms\/ml) respectively.","2358":"Cystic fibrosis is a recessive disease that causes changes in mucus secretions, affecting different systems: respiratory, digestive, pancreatic, hepatic; resulting in obstructions and secondary infections. Transplantation may be used for the most severe forms and is then complicated by the pediatric context, the existence of malabsorption and secondary infections and the type of transplantation (pulmonary and\/or hepatic). The follow-up is characterized by pulmonary infections and pulmonary chronic rejection. In our experience, the initiation of the immunosuppressive treatment must avoid corticoids in the early post-transplantation days and have recourse to intravenous cyclosporin (CyA) 2 mg\/kg\/day, given on average for one month in an oral form. In case of persistent acute rejection, tacrolimus (FK 506) is instituted. Oral CyA (10-12 mg\/kg\/day) seems more sensitive to malabsorption syndrome than FK 506 (0.2 mg\/kg\/day). In both cases, the development of an inhibitory metabolic interaction in the presence of itraconazole must be taken into account: used against aspergillosis, itraconazole is metabolized as CyA and FK 506 by Cyt P450 3A4. The intensity of the interaction is twofold for CyA versus fivefold for FK 506. The strategy for the use of other recently available immunosuppressives such as mycophenolate is under evaluation.","2359":"Cyclosporin A-induced nephrotoxicity is a well known adverse effect but its mechanism remains unclear. The understanding of the toxicity mechanism is necessary since the new generation of immunosuppressant drugs (cyclosporin G, FK 506, rapamycin) demonstrates renal toxicity. A renal vasoconstriction occurs with the first administration of cyclosporin and involves several mediators (prostaglandins, renal sympathetic nerves, dopamine. NO, endothelin) which may explain the limited benefit of antagonists. Furthermore, the vasoconstriction explains only haemodynamic modifications and cannot explain histological lesions. New hypotheses involving an alternation of cellular calcium homeostasis suggest alternative investigations to elucidate cyclosporin A nephrotoxicity.","2360":"","2361":"","2362":"","2363":"","2364":"This round table discussion was devoted to the description of the tools currently available for the evaluation of drug risks and management during pregnancy. Five topics were submitted for discussion: pre-clinical data, methodological tools, benefit\/risk ratio before prescription, teratogenic or fetal risk evaluation, legal comments.","2365":"Like all new and emerging technologies, cell therapy has raised many hopes for the treatment of some severe diseases. However, its development needs first a clear ethical and legal framework. Because of the complexity and cost of these therapies, development has to be focused on fields where clinical benefits appear greater and where therapeutic alternatives are limited. Since 28 May, 1996 France has had a law (No. 96-452) which defines the 'biological products for therapeutic use' and therefore cell therapy. Many different therapeutic domains are concerned, depending on cell type. The level of development already reached and the number of patients concerned are quite variable. The grafting of hematopoietic stem cells and of expanded keratinocytes, which concerns in France 2500 and 100 patients per year respectively, are well characterized. The clinical trial of dendritic cells for vaccination is just starting but could represent a very large field of application with more than 10,000 patients per year. The grafting of hepatocytes, and the production of antiviral CTL and encapsulated cells (Langerhans islets of allo- or xenogenic origin), nerve cells, and myocytes are still at an early stage of development. Whatever the field, before entering clinical trials, a clear scientific and medical rationale must exist. The efficacy and security of the proposed treatment should be established on relevant models. Cell processing protocols must be well characterized and reproducibility proven with quality controls in place and the cell processing facilities approved by the relevant authorities. Partnership with industry could take many different forms. It should speed up development by providing access to reagents, growth factor of clinical grade, devices, cell processing technologies, etc., without preventing investigators from conducting their trial as planned.","2366":"Therapeutic benefit that can be induced by a pharmaceutical compound partly relies upon the profile of its biological action. Evaluation of the drug-induced effect profile in a given pathological condition begins with the determination of the relevant biological effect related to the therapeutic benefit, which is not always obvious. Evaluation itself is based on dose-effect relationships as a function of time. During chronic treatment, such a kinetic profile oscillates between peak and trough levels. Relationships that can be established between time-dependent effect profile and pharmacokinetic data lead to PK-PD mathematical model, whose main objectives are simulation, prediction of effect and ultimately dose optimisation. The therapeutic implications of the time-dependent effect profile are well illustrated in the cases of antibiotics, diuretics such as furosemide and anti-hypertensive drugs. During drug development, PK-PD approaches can be used in the initial clinical and even pre-clinical phases and can lead to a better definition of effective dose ranges, optimisation of large scale clinical trials or identification of high risk patients. This may favour a reduction of costs and duration of development. Validation of such an approach is easier in well known therapeutic domains but can be more difficult with innovative drugs. The implications of PK-PD approaches can however, be, limited when the relevant biological or clinical parameter cannot be assessed, when the cascade of events leading to pharmacological and therapeutic effects is complex or finally when such PK-PD models require a long time to be established during the early phase of drug development.","2367":"The working group (Giens 1996) discussed the (CPMP) note providing guidance for the clinical investigation of anticancer agents and in particular of cytotoxic agents. In Phase I trials, the methodology used relies on the assumption that active and toxic dosages will be closed (i.e. low therapeutic index) studies in normal volunteers are not required. the primary objective is the determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) taking into account any corrective measure and\/or prior cytotoxic chemotherapy. Characterization of frequent side-effects and of their dose relationship has to be assessed as well as the qualitative (target organ) and quantitative (predictability, extent, ...) toxicity of the drug. A recommended dose for Phase II trials has to be proposed. Phase II trials are characterized by the investigation of antitumour activity in patients with specific tumour types. Patient population (risk factors) should be clearly defined and the number of patients sufficient to meet the study objectives. Evaluation of toxicity and responses have to be documented according to international standards. Phase III trials are disease-oriented and are comparative in nature, and should allow for the full evaluation (including establishment of a treatment regimen) of the active agent selected at the end of the Phase II study. The primary endpoints are disease-free survival, overall survival and response rate. Several problem areas in the design of clinical trials have been reviewed.","2368":"The development and evaluation of new drugs often rely on surrogacy. An intermediate outcome becomes a surrogate outcome if it fulfils certain criteria, it should be easier to measure compared with the clinical outcome, a statistical relationship should exist between the clinical outcome and the surrogate outcome, a relation should exist allowing prediction of the degree of clinical effect based on the measured effect on the surrogate outcome. Development and authorization of drugs today often rely on so-called surrogate outcomes. Is this use sound? The validity of such outcomes has been reviewed in different therapeutic areas: hypertension, venous thromboembolism, AIDS, osteoporosis, hepatitis C. Based on this review, a pragmatic strategy is proposed which allows for the validation and proper use of surrogate outcomes.","2369":"The risk of drug-induced torsade de pointes, a potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmia, raises the problem of the early detection of the effects of any new chemical entity (NCE) on ventricular repolarization since prolongation of myocardial repolarization is a major trigger among others (hypokalaemia, bradycardia, congenital abnormalities in cellular ionic channels) for this arrhythmia. During pre-clinical studies, the effects of a range of concentrations (10(-9) M to 10(-4) M) of NCE on the duration of the action potential of Purkinje and left ventricular myocardial cells (guinea-pig and rabbit) have to be measured. If these effects are present, the duration of QT interval on ECG recorded in animal studies (dogs) has to be carefully measured and correlated with plasma concentrations of NCE and\/or its metabolite(s). During clinical trials, additional studies have to be performed in order to document QT interval-plasma concentration relationships and the influence of heart rate on QT interval duration. Ambulatory ECG recordings will attest to the safety of the NCE and precautions for use of the drug will be established according to our knowledge of predisposing factors for a proarrhythmic effect. Should there be a notification of a case of torsade de points after a new drug has been launched, urgent consultations with the drug file will be necessary in order to assess which pre-clinical and clinical studies may be needed for a better evaluation of the benefit\/risk ratio of the new drug.","2370":null,"2371":"","2372":"The aim of this open study was to determine a more rational therapeutic approach for psychotic patients treated with clozapine for several months, using measurement of plasma and red blood cell levels (P, RBC) of clozapine (cloza) and N-desmethylclozapine (descloza), the major metabolite of clozapine, which has been reported to be less active but more toxic (agranulocytosis) than clozapine itself. The RBC concentration may be considered as more representative of the free fraction drug. The study concerned 7 patients suffering from chronic paranoid schizophrenia according to the DSM-IV criteria. All of them were treatment-refractory schizophrenic inpatients (4 men, 3 women, mean age +\/- SD: 38.2 +\/- 8.4 years; mean duration of illness +\/- SD: 14.4 +\/- 5.1 years). They had received at least two different neuroleptics, for 6 weeks, before entering the study. Treatment started in our hospitalization unit with clozapine 25 mg up to a maximum of 900 mg\/d (mean stabilized daily dose +\/- SD: 507 +\/- 211 mg and mean daily dose per kg: 6.91 +\/- 3.08 mg). Clinical evaluations (Quality of Life Scale: QLS), regular blood monitoring and biological samples were conducted at the same time, weekly for 18 weeks and then monthly (duration of the study: 4 to 38 months; mean +\/- SD: 12.9 +\/- 11.5 months). Plasma and RBC (after lysis) levels were determined by reversed phase HPLC and UV detection after extraction with hexane. All the patients improved very quickly after the first week of treatment and six were able to leave the hospitalization unit and start outpatient care such as daily hospitalization, returning home or in sheltered accommodation. With the following plasma (P) and RBC levels: mean cloza +\/- SD: (P = 294 +\/- 146 ng\/ml; RBC = 110 +\/- 82 ng\/ml) and mean descloza +\/- SD: (P = 173 +\/- 106 ng\/ml; RBC = 76 +\/- 54 ng\/ml); none of the seven patients developed agranulocytosis. The blood levels, ensuring better surveillance, have a predictive value for clinical improvement. A linear pharmacoclinical correlation was only found between RBC cloza concentrations and the evolution of the QLS scores. Clozapine fulfils the criteria for therapeutic drug monitoring, and determination of plasma, and more particularly RBC, cloza and descloza levels may help to find the lowest effective dose with the fewest side effects.","2373":"To establish a reference for MAP Bayesian adaptive control of amikacin therapy in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients, 30 patients (age: 63.5 +\/- 10.1 years) were studied. Weight (84.2 +\/- 15.4 kg) and body mass index (28.0 +\/- 4.3 kg\/m2 for males and 30.5 +\/- 6.4 kg\/m2 for females) were stable during treatment.

For the a priori first doses determination, precision is higher with the new population. No difference in adaptive control was observed. In additive, the full joint density probability should be used to develop stochastic multiple model linear quadratic (MMLQ) adaptive control strategies.","2374":"Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug in the world. The major psychomimetic compound is delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol. The major effects consist in alterations of sensory perception, cognition, motor coordination and self-perception.

The traditional approach is to screen urine by immunoassay and to submit positive samples for confirmation by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. There continue to be many difficulties in interpreting the results because of the biotransformations of delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol.","2375":"We proposed a set of 9 criteria to evaluate computerized French drug data banks currently available on the Minitel, medical software, or the Web.

After a 3-week placebo run-in period, two parallel groups of hypertensive patients (188 patients in total) each received one treatment once a day for 6 weeks. Blood pressure was measured with a mercury sphygmomanometer and on two occasions by 24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Results indicate that both treatments have similar effects on casual blood pressure measurements, while ABPM recordings show that the lisinopril 20 mg\/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg combination is more effective during the last period of the dosing interval. Lisinopril 20 mg\/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg as combination antihypertensive treatment does not induce alterations in serum potassium and triglycerides.","2377":"In this double blind randomized study, blood pressure lowering effects and duration of action of two angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were compared using home self blood pressure measurement (SBPM). After a two-week placebo run-in period, 128 hypertensive patients received during four weeks a daily morning dose of either perindopril (P) 4 mg or trandoplapril (T) 2 mg. One week of SBPM was planned at the end of both the run-in and the treatment period. Three consecutive measurements, with printed results, were requested in the morning before drug intake and in the evening. Run-in period home systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures were comparable in both groups: 149.9 +\/- 14.5\/97.3 +\/- 8.1 mmHg in the P group (n = 63), 148.9 +\/- 14.3\/96.7 +\/- 6.9 mmHg in the T group (n = 65).

The purpose of this trial was to compare the effects of nicergoline and naftidrofuryl on the quality of life and the functional discomfort of the 131 patients with claudication. It was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind trial with parallel groups. The patients were asked to complete a quality of life questionnaire and a Visual Analogue Scale, and to evaluate the number of steps on flat ground before the pain began. After 6 months of treatment, we observed, for all treatments combined, a significant improvement (p = 0.0001) in the quality of life and in the functional discomfort. Three variables favoured nicergoline: the estimated time before the onset of the pain (p = 0.003), the functional discomfort quantified by the Visual Analogue Scale (p &lt; 0.05), the distance covered on flat ground (p = 0.013). The other variables, and especially the total score on the self-questionnaire, confirmed this impression, without reaching significance (p = 0.136). The data suggest that in terms of quality of life nicergoline is superior. The clinical tolerance is good and comparable between the two treatments.","2379":"This study compares the loop diuretic piretanide 6 mg in a slow-release formulation (PIR) with hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg (HCT) and the fixed combination altizide 15 mg-spironolactone 25 mg (ALT-SP) in hypertension. 1105 mild to moderate hypertensive patients entered a three-week placebo wash-out period; 899 were randomized in a 6-month, double-blind, parallel group treatment phase; 800 completed the study. Primary end-points; serum potassium concentration and quality of life at one month; secondary end-points: ionic, renal and metabolic variables; blood pressure (BP) measurements. HCT and ALT-SP were compared only to PIR using Dunnett's or chi 2 tests. No difference was found for the overall quality of life. No change of serum potassium concentration at one month was found in PIR while small decreases were detected with ALT-SP (-0.1 mM) and HCT (-0.26 mM). Serum creatinine concentration increased significantly in ALT-SP when compared to PIR. All the drugs were effective in reducing BP: HCT had a higher rate of responders than PIR with similar mean BP falls and ALT-SP induced greater falls in blood pressure. PIR proves to be a potent antihypertensive drug without significant effect on serum electrolytes, plasma glucose and lipids. HCT was slightly more potent but induced a fall in serum potassium concentration with a significant risk of hypokalaemia. The addition of SP to ALT led to a more potent diuretic with a higher level of serum potassium and plasma creatinine disturbances.

This dose-dependent toxicity can occur in all kinds of transplantation and is reversed with drug withdrawal. Cyclosporin A induces a vasoconstriction leading to an increase of renal vascular resistance and a reduction of glomerular filtration. Histochemical studies show mitochondrial alterations and an excess of cytosolic and mitochondrial calcium leading to a decrease of ATP synthesis. Two strategies can be evoked for limiting cyclosporin-A-induced nephrotoxicity. First, the use of drugs counteracting the vasoconstriction has been proposed. Second, drugs acting by restoration of ATP synthesis could also be of interest. For example, calcium channel blockers may be used for limiting the Ca2+ fluxes into cells. Another way to protect ATP synthesis is to inhibit the cyclosporin-A-induced increase of mitochondrial Ca2+ concentrations; Trimetazidine has shown its efficiency in vitro for protecting mitochondria against these modifications of Ca2+ homeostasis and is under clinical evaluation.","2383":null,"2384":"Mycophenolate mofetil is a new immunosuppressive agent which is indicated in combination with cyclosporin A and a corticosteroid for the prophylaxis of acute transplant rejection in patients receiving allogenic renal transplants. It is an ester prodrug rapidly hydrolysed to mycophenolic acid, an active metabolite. The mechanism of action of mycophenolic acid is different from that of other known immunosuppressive drugs: it inhibits the activity of inosine monophosphate deshydrogenase, an enzyme responsible for the de novo pathway of guanosine nucleotide synthesis in B and T lymphocytes and slows down their proliferative response. Should mycophenolic acid plasma concentrations be monitored? To date, all available data are assessed and more particularly:--the doses of 1 or 1.5 g administered twice daily,--a pilot, open-label multicentre study which showed a decreased incidence of acute rejection episodes in patients with steady state AUC0-12 h plasma levels &lt; 40 micrograms.ml-1.h.--adverse events (mainly gastrointestinal, blood and lymphatic disorders) which appear more frequently in patients receiving 3 g\/day than in patients receiving 2 g\/day and which do not seem to be correlated with plasma concentrations of mycophenolic acid. The examination of these data clearly shows that additional investigations are necessary to better clarify the relationship between plasma mycophenolic acid concentration and side effects in order to provide a scientific rationale for monitoring the plasma concentrations on a regular basis.","2385":"It is well known that methotrexate (MTX), used at high dosage in cancer patients, must not be combined with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) because of high risk of side effects; prescribed at low dosage (&lt; or = 15 mg per week) in rheumatoid arthritis patients, MTX is often combined with an NSAID. Some cases reported in the literature underline the potential toxicity of the association of low dose MTX with an NSAID, but most of the pharmacological studies do not confirm this hypothesis. Except for salicylates, NSAIDs do not affect the absorption, distribution, protein binding, area under the curve, half-life, or the elimination of MTX. Therefore, if necessary, MTX (&lt; or = 15 mg per week) can be combined with an NSAID during the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.","2386":"The fraction of oral methotrexate (MTX) absorbed averages 70 per cent at low doses (&lt; or = 10 mg\/m2), both fasting and after food. The mean binding of MTX to serum albumin is 42-57 per cent. Less than 10 per cent of MTX is oxidised to 7-OH-MTX. Furthermore, MTX is partly converted to polyglutamate derivatives which accumulate in some cells resulting in sustained efficacy of the drug in spite of its relatively short plasma elimination half-life. MTX is mainly excreted by the kidney as intact drug. Accordingly careful monitoring of renal function is justified. MTX undergoes bidirectional transport within the renal tubules leading to drug interactions. Oral, intramuscular and subcutaneous routes of administration were reported to result in comparable bioavailability. There is a marked interindividual variability in MTX disposition. Conversely, the intraindividual variability is moderate even over a long time period. Finally, no clear relationship between pharmacokinetic parameters and clinical response or toxicity has been found in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.","2387":"This paper introduces some comments on the complete text of Good Pharmacovigilance Publishing Practices, which forms appendix number 2 of the Good Pharmacovigilance Practices now published by the French Drug Agency, as was Good Clinical Practices.

The technical terms that are used in this text are presented according to the glossary in Good Pharmacovigilance Practices.","2388":"Drug surveillance data can be obtained from different sources: spontaneous French and European reporting, data from WHO, bibliographic analysis. We are more interested, in this paper, in the type of data obtained than in the surveillance of each antidepressant. Our study is focused on psychiatric and neurobehavioural effects of antidepressants. The French drug surveillance database was examined for reactions associated with fluoxetine. Psychiatric side effects are not the most frequent. The psychiatric safety profiles of the three SSRIs (fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and paroxetine) are similar. However withdrawal reactions with fluvoxamine and paroxetine occur in a greater proportion of reports (13 and 14 per cent) than with fluoxetine (1.5 per cent). In contrast, pharmacodependance was observed in 79 per cent of reports with amineptine. Tricyclic antidepressants do not seem to confer increased risk of teratogenesis. Preliminary data regarding risk of prenatal exposure to fluoxetine suggest that its use during pregnancy is relatively safe. Data regarding neurobehavioural effects of prenatal exposure are lacking for all antidepressants. Cognitive disorders induced by antidepressants are complex, due to the involvement of several factors that can intervene in the pathogenesis and evaluation of these disorders : most studies evaluate the modifications of neurobehavioural effects in healthy subjects, few studies concern chronic patients. Proposals are made to improve the evaluation of these side effects.","2389":"Treatment with low dose methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis is associated with serious side effects in about 5 per cent of cases (respiratory, haematological or infectious). The goal of a null risk seems unrealistic because of the idiosyncrasy of some of the risks and our poor understanding of others (enzymatic polymorphisms might be operational, and infectious agents could act as co-factors). However, risk can be greatly reduced by a careful selection of patients. Some contraindications are strict: poor compliance and the possibility of mistake in the timing of the administration; pregnancy or desire for pregnancy; treatment with trimetoprim; haemodialysis; renal insufficiency (clearance &lt; or = 50 ml\/min) (and therefore old age), alcoholism. Others remain relative although well established; hypoalbuminaemia, diabetes mellitus, obesity, past infection with hepatitis virus. Others are dubious: starvation, macrocytosis, surgical stress, NSAIDs. An extensive large study of side effects is warranted.","2390":"Self-medication can be defined as obtaining and consuming one (or more) drug (s) without the advice of a physician either for diagnosis, prescription or surveillance of the treatment. Self-medication accounts for around 5 to 10 per cent of drug sales in France. There are few data on side effects of self-medication in France. The side effects of drugs taken by self-medication and reported to the Midi-Pyrenees drugs surveillance centre between January 1993 and June 1996 were investigated in the present study. There were 65 reports, mainly in women (58 per cent), i.e. around 2 per cent of the reports to the regional drugs surveillance centre. The most frequent side effects are neurological (32 per cent: mainly headache, vertigo, agitation, etc.), dermatological (18 per cent, mainly allergy), hepatic (10 per cent), digestive (7 per cent, mainly diarrhoea). There were 10 cases of anaphylactic shock and\/or Quincke oedema. The drugs most frequently involved were analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (47 cases), neuropsychotropic drugs (7 cases), dermatological drugs (6 cases) or otorhinolaryngological drugs (6 cases).... 'Serious' side effects occurred in 40 per cent of the cases including 3 deaths. 'Severe' side effects were observed in 77 per cent of the reports. This study shows that the side effects of self-medication are relatively frequent and can be serious. They occurred more often in women than in men, mainly with analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs. These data permit a better analysis of the risk\/benefit ratio of self-medication. Drug surveillance studies of self-medication must be developed.","2391":"For several years, herbal medicines have been increasingly consumed by patients without prescription. They are traditionally innocuous but as medicinal products they require drug surveillance in order to identify their risks. However, the first concern is to give them a legal status, to evaluate their efficacy and to control their safety. Published data show that the risk is due either to a contaminant or to an added drug or falsification. Since 1985, the Regional Pharmacovigilance Centres have received about 341 reports of undesirable effects due to herbal medicines: among them 30 cases of hepatitis were reported associated with germander which has been now withdrawn from the French market. This example well illustrates the role of the national system and its responsibility for collecting and evaluating ADRs due to herbal medicines.","2392":"","2393":"","2394":"","2395":"","2396":"","2397":"","2398":"","2399":"","2400":"Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infections are the most frequent opportunistic infections in AIDS.

When used in monotherapy, clarithromycin (one gram twice a day) appeared as the most efficient drug while the effectiveness of azithromycin, clofazimine, rifampin and liposomal encapsulated gentamicin have not been truly proved. Due to its bacteriologic and clinical effects, the most interesting polytherapeutic scheme is the association of clarithromycin (1 g twice a day), ethambutol (15 mg per kg and per day) and rifabutin (600 mg per day).","2401":"Decision-making methods can be extremely useful in managing the large amount of information available on the complex effects of medication over various time spans. Event trees help to formulate data and visualise the medical strategies with the highest performance in regard to clinical benefits, adverse side effects, cost and cost-benefit ratios.

Nevertheless no study was sufficient to determine an optimal therapeutic schedule between sub-cutaneous (SC) unfractionated heparin (UFH), intravenous (IV) UFH and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). One meta-analysis showed a significant risk reduction of recurrent thromboembolic events (OR = 0.58, CI 95 per cent [0.34-0.99]) and a non-significant risk reduction of haemorrhagic events (OR = 0.78 [0.40-1.52]) with UFH SC compared to UFH IV, but homogeneity testing was significant (p &lt; 0.001). Some discrepancy was shown between the results of the three metaanalyses which compared LMWH to UFH according to the selection criteria of clinical trials used. With an exhaustive selection, LMWH involved a non-significant risk reduction of recurrent thromboembolic events (OR = 0.66 [0.41-1.07], p = 0.09), and a non-significant risk reduction of haemorrhagic events (OR = 0.65 [0.36-1.16], p = 0.15). So no definitive conclusion could be drawn but it seems that UFH can be recommended whatever the administration route or LMWH for deep vein thrombosis treatment.","2404":"Meta-analyses of Furberg's original data (after correction of two minor errors) were performed using six different methods. Only three of them gave significant results at p &lt; 0.05. The sensitivity analysis showed that taking into account some of the criticisms applied to the original meta-analysis did not change the results. When all the criticisms were considered together, the 95 per cent confidence interval of the odds ratio for mortality was [0.96; 1.31] instead of [1.06; 1.37] originally (p = 0.14 and p = 0.03 respectively), and the dose excess mortality relationship stressed by Furberg disappeared. When the selection of the studies to be entered in a meta-analysis is not straightforward, a sensitivity analysis should be performed.","2405":"Reliable syntheses are more and more needed by physicians. In the therapeutic field, this need is illustrated by the growing number of syntheses using meta-analysis tools. Some of these syntheses are based on individual patient data, and this offers three kinds of advantages: the favourable consequences of a collaborative approach, the enhancement of data reliability, and a more complete extraction of useful information thanks to wider analysis potential. Most often, achieving the first two advantages does not require the individual patient data to be available, and a wider analysis potential seems to be the major rationale of such an approach. For instance, the assessment of the variation of treatment effect with along time is more accurate, but may also raise doubts about the validity of some hypotheses, for example, those underlying classical analysis techniques, or at the basis of even acknowledged pathophysiological theory. Ultimately, the concepts of identifying responders (here defined in terms of quantity or quality of life) and identifying the therapy target population are concretely applied in a way that will affect classical medical practice. Tomorrow, drugs will not be prescribed to a hypertensive individual because of the blood pressure level, but considering the size of the predicted therapeutic benefit.","2406":"The efficacy of a drug is a quantitative concept rather than a qualitative one. This quantity is expressed by several efficacy indices. None of them meet all the requirements. However, that of absolute benefit is especially suitable for the patients because it tells them the exact gain they can expect from taking the treatment. The absolute benefit varies according to patients' profiles because it interacts with some components of these profiles. In theory, such interactions can be used to predict the size of the absolute benefit for each patient, as well to describe better than with the current tools the therapy target population. We explain why meta-analysis and effect models are means of improving the prediction of the size of the effect and the definition of the therapy target population.","2407":"The effect models are defined as the simple or complex relation that the risk in the treatment group follows when the risk in the control group varies. The standard statistical methods of meta-analysis are based on simple effect models. The use of these methods could induce inaccurate or erroneous results in more complex situations. In this case, it is necessary to adopt a more appropriate effect model, such as the linear effect model. The properties of this kind of model allow the possibility that a treatment can be beneficial and harmful at the same time, in function of the risk without treatment. From this observation, it is advisable to be careful with the use of simple effect models in meta-analysis which can submerge interesting information in the synthesis.","2408":"","2409":"","2410":"","2411":"The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the incidence and the characteristics of spontaneously reported aseptic meningitis (AM) in France following mumps vaccination with monovalent or multivalent vaccines containing the Urabe strain. Fifty-four cases of AM were reported to the regional drug surveillance centres or to the manufacturer from the time each vaccine was launched up until June 1992. Twenty cases were associated with the time off administration of a monovalent mumps vaccine and 34 with a trivalent measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR). A mumps virus was isolated in four cases in the cerebrospinal fluid and an Urabe-like strain was characterised twice by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A probable mumps origin was assumed in 17 other cases where the patients presented with other clinical or biological signs of mumps infection. The clinical outcome of AM was always favourable. The global incidence of mumps vaccine-associated AM was 0.82\/100,000 doses, which is significantly lower than the incidence in the unvaccinated population. Even considering that the actual incidence of AM is much higher when assessed by active surveillance studies, the risk\/benefit ratio of mumps vaccine remains in favour of vaccination. The incidence of mumps vaccines containing Jeryl Lynn (ROR Vax et Imu ORR) associated with AM needs to be evaluated.","2412":"A retrospective epidemiological survey was conducted to evaluate the incidence and characteristics of thrombocytopenic purpura (TP) reported in France following measles, mumps or rubella vaccination with monovalent or multivalent vaccines. Sixty cases of TP were reported i.e an incidence\/100,000 doses of 0.23 and 0.17 for measles or rubella vaccines respectively given alone, to 0.87 for combined measles-rubella vaccine and 0.95 for MMR vaccine. The mean age was 21 +\/- 12 months and the delay of diagnosis was 16 +\/- 6 days after vaccination. Thrombopenia was severe (mean platelet count: 8000 +\/- 6000\/mm3) and always associated with purpura. The immediate outcome was favourable in 89.5 per cent of cases. Vaccine-associated TP appears to be similar to acute childhood idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura but the clear temporal relationship between MMR vaccination and the occurrence of TP make a causal relationship highly plausible. Acute TP seems a rare complication of measles-rubella and MMR vaccination but clinicians had to be informed of the possibility of their occurrence. Acute TP following vaccination should be reported by physicians to their Regional Drug Surveillance Centre.","2413":"The aim of this trial was to test the hypothesis that a reduced number of doses improves compliance in current medical practice. Compliance with twice a day dosage was compared with compliance with three doses a day. Two bioequivalent presentations of nicardipine were used, the regular presentation (t.i.d.) and the slow-release (b.i.d.). The trial was controlled, randomized, open, in two parallel groups: (1)'t.i.d.' group: one tablet of regular nicardipine, 20 mg, three times a day, three months; (2) 'b.i.d.' group: one capsule of slow-release nicardipine, twice a day, three months. 2651 general practitioners randomized 7274 hypertensive patients. The primary criterion was documented in 93.7 per cent of the cases at the end of the trial. The remaining 6.3 per cent comprised treatment withdrawal (2.8 per cent) and patients lost to follow-up (3.5 per cent). The primary criterion study was compliance, assessed by a self-questionnaire filled in by the patient and a standardised interview by the physician. Compliance was slightly better in the b.i.d. group than in the t.i.d. group (p &lt; 0.001). Remaining pill count was also used but it was a failure. A random sample of investigators made on-site visits. Discordant data were infrequent and were limited to dates of visits. Difficulties with on-site visits were mostly due to a rather frequent lack of source records.","2414":"Using a structured approach to categorize pharmacological knowledge and a systemic analysis of prescribing practice, we identified the knowledge needed to optimally prescribe and manage treatments with drugs. The approach consisted in finding the branched chains of knowledge beginning with each operation required to solve each problem which arises in prescribing and managing drugs at the most elementary level. This elementary knowledge is then transformed into educational objectives. The next step is to share the educational objectives between basic medical training, continuing medical education and acquisition of therapeutic knowledge. The method could be applied in other medical teaching domains.","2415":"Orphan drugs (OD) qualify as drugs scientifically viable but not viable from an economic point of view either because the number of patients who might benefit is too small or because the populations concerned are too poor to afford the drugs. Sick people who could be treated by OD and their families have been fighting for years to induce authorities in charge of health to set up a programme to stimulate research into new treatment for rare diseases. The United States, initiated work in order to confer status on OD leading to the Orphan Drug Act in 1983. It defined the conditions for attribution of the OD status and also made attractive proposals to pharmaceutic industries in order to improve their development. More recently, in 1993, Japan took similar decisions, while the European Union and France are also on the way, as recent meetings of European ministers of health show. In contrast, developing countries are still excluded from medical research as very few tropical diseases have treatment. Legislation for OD, first planned to make up for the high costs of research and development, proved its efficiency. But ODs must move to a new status as some are now becoming the object of important economic stakes.","2416":"","2417":"In this review, the design and objectives of ongoing clinical trials in essential hypertension are discussed along with the main results obtained from previously published therapeutic trials. In a meta-analysis of 14 of the major primary prevention trials in hypertension, the difference in diastolic blood pressure between the intervention groups and the control groups was only 5-6 mmHg. This difference was associated with significant reductions in all stroke events (42 per cent), all coronary heart disease events (14 per cent) and in cardiovascular mortality (21 per cent). In elderly hypertensive patients, available studies have shown that antihypertensive treatment reduces the incidence of non-fatal cardiovascular events without significantly modifying cardiovascular mortality. Most of these results were obtained with beta-blockers or diuretics. Despite official recommendation as first line monotherapy, none of the three new antihypertensive classes has been shown to have beneficial effects on hard primary endpoints such as cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Several ongoing large scale randomized controlled trials vs. beta-blockers or diuretics are addressing this important issue. Moreover, other effects of antihypertensive treatment such as the 'J-curve phenomenon', the rate of change in the carotid wall thickness or the exact beneficial effects in elderly patients are being investigated in some of these studies.","2418":"Aplastic anaemia is a potentially fatal haematopoietic disorder whose aetiology is not yet clarified. In our preliminary study we have introduced cyclosporin in the aplastic anaemia treatment to evaluate its effect on the disease evolution. Ten aplastic anaemia patients, mean age 33.33 +\/- 20.01 years, were treated with cyclosporine (9 +\/- 2.35 mg\/kg\/d), prednisolone (0.5 mg\/kg\/d) and androgens (1 mg\/kg\/d). The prednisolone was always combined with cyclosporine. The androgens were administered concomitantly with the cyclosporine or alternately. Seven patients responded to the treatment after a median remission delay of 6 weeks (2-12 weeks). They became independent of blood requirements at a median of 36 weeks (8-108 weeks); the three other patients died during the first trimester without showing any improvement. Among the seven responders, two relapsed early and transiently. The rate of actuarial survival was 70 per cent. The median duration of survival was 10.5 months. The side effects observed included one case of malignant lymphoma, six cases of liver toxicity and five cases of kidney toxicity. This toxicity was reversible after dose adjustment of the cyclosporine. In our study, the introduction of cyclosporin in the aplastic anaemia treatment resulted in improved therapeutic response. Androgens should be used to maintain the haematologic response. This therapeutic protocol associated with drug monitoring seems promising and the side effects should not limit its use because of the severity of the underlying disease.","2419":"","2420":"","2421":"","2422":"","2423":"","2424":"","2425":"","2426":"","2427":"The aim of O.P.P.I.D.U.M. is the survey of products used by drug addicts. A five year survey, based on regular pools, has provided interesting results. 1,283 patients (80 per cent men, about 27 years old, 1\/4 employed) used 2,241 drugs. The most frequent was heroin, followed by benzodiazepines, cannabis and cocaine. Flunitrazepam was the most commonly misused product, taken by users who started consumption earlier, with a higher rate of unemployment and imprisonment. Cocaine was as often taken intravenously as by sniffing, and most often used before imprisonment. Ecstasy (M.D.M.A.) has appeared recently. Codeine taken alone was used by subjects older than the heroin users, more frequently employed and virtually never prison inmates: this suggests the existence of an unofficial detoxication and substitution process. Confidence of clinicians needs anonymity of the records and return of information. Such a campaign is about to be launched.","2428":"By 1990, the Clin Midy (SANOFI) laboratory had modified the dose of Cantor tablets: the content of active drug (minaprine) increased (50 to 100 mg). Therefore, acute intoxication by minaprine can be serious, with generalized seizures, resisting the classic treatment. We tried to evaluate the possible consequences of this change of dose for the gravity of suicide attempts. 1091 voluntary acute intoxications have been collected by the national French Poisons Centres data bank, 226 of them by the Poisons center of Marseilles. We have compared, by the chi 2 method, the frequencies of seizure and death, before and after 1990. Results are significant, confirming an increased gravity of these intoxications since the modification of dosage. Then, the laboratory reduced the number of tablets per box. We don't know if this measure will be efficient.","2429":null,"2430":"Drug-induced parkinsonism (DIP) is frequent. The list of drugs able to induce parkinsonism is long and probably incomplete, because new drugs, with previously unknown antidopaminergic activity, are constantly being added. Not all the drugs have the same potency for inducing parkinsonism. We classify these drugs in three groups: (1) drugs with obvious antidopaminergic activity which regularly induce parkinsonism; (2) drugs able to induce parkinsonism in particular individuals and (3) drugs which may aggravate Parkinson's disease treated with levodopa. The reports of isolated cases of parkinsonism induced by widely-used drugs (drugs in group 2) may be the result of either an idiosyncratic side effect or a misdiagnosis of parkinsonism. The antidopaminergic activity of the drugs of this group is weak and not sufficiently demonstrated. Maybe, in these cases, the blockage of other neurotransmitters different from dopamine plays a role in the induction of parkinsonism. Probably, the number of patients with DIP is higher than reported or detected, because many patients suffer from weak symptoms that quickly disappear after drug withdrawal. One of the main points of interest is knowing the list, because all these drugs, specially those of group 1, should be avoided or used with caution in the treatment of some common symptomatic problems in patients with Parkinson's disease, such as depression, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus and cardiac disorders. The precautions should extent to other populations especially susceptible to suffer from DIP, such as the elderly or patients with other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease.","2431":"There have been recently a prescription error and a dispensing error in our department due to drug names which look or sound alike. Errors of this type have frequently been quoted in the Anglo-Saxon literature. The method of choosing a drug trade name is recalled, and a table of French drug names which can involve errors of prescription and dispensing errors is provided.","2432":"","2433":"","2434":"","2435":"","2436":"","2437":"","2438":"In France, radiopharmaceuticals have been considered as drugs since 1992. Few adverse reactions with radiopharmaceuticals were described in the literature. Some authors have reported a rate of 1 to 6 reactions per 100,000 injections. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of radiopharmaceutical-induced side effects. A prospective survey was performed from November 1993 to May 1995 (during 18 months) in the Department of Nuclear Medicine of the University Hospital in Toulouse. There were 14,794 injections of radiopharmaceuticals (99mTc-phytate, 99mTc-microspheres of serum albumin, 99mTc-dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA), 99mTc-hydroxymethyldiphosphonate (HMDP), 99Tc-colloid, 99mTc, 99mTc-sestamibi, Thallium-201). Three side effects were reported: one case of necrosis at the injection site, one case of vomiting and one case of dizziness. All the cases occurred with Tc99m-pyrophosphate. According to the WHO definition, the first side effect was classified as 'serious'. The causal relationship was unlikely for the first and second case and probable for the third. The outcome of these side effects was always favorable.","2439":"Management of tuberculosis in a hospital environment is well systematized and may include chemoprophylaxis, which may be hazardous when used in psychiatric impairments. We examined retrospectively adverse events occurring during a 6-month period of antituberculosis treatment. Besides patients initially treated for active pulmonary tuberculosis, 16 other patients have benefited from chemoprophylaxis with isoniazid (INH) and\/or rifampicin (RFP). All these patients (mean age 53 years) had been institutionalized for several years. Fifteen of them still received a mean of 5.4 +\/- 2.2 drugs including 3.3 +\/- 1.4 psychotropic agents. During antituberculous treatment, 5 patients (29 per cent) presented side effects: hyperuricaemia with pyrazinamide, neutropenia, dysphagia and anorexia, dizziness and falls, diabetes and fatal fulminant hepatitis associated with INH. Drug interactions were systemically searched for. Three probably led to clinical manifestations: they implicated INH with carbamazepine, RFP with theophylline and RFP with haloperidol. Our results suggest a greater sensitivity for adverse effects and drug interactions in psychiatric institutionalized patients. They pose the problem of the appropriateness of antituberculous chemoprophylaxis in such patients, particularly because of communication difficulties and polytherapy. The INH-RFP regimen should be avoided and the clinical and biological follow-up reinforced.","2440":"This study concerns 169 women whose exposure to simvastatin (Zocor or Lodales) during pregnancy led to a request for information from pharmaceutical firms. The evolution of pregnancies (among which 2 were twins) was documented in 125 women: 66 women gave birth to normal babies, 40 requested and induced abortion, 12 spontaneous abortions occurred, and the 9 other known pregnancy issues were 4 premature newborns, 3 newborns with malformations and 2 fetal deaths. Apart from the 5 retrospective files concerning 5 spontaneous abortions, all the files were analysed prospectively. Except for induced abortions, regarding the prospective files, the pregnancy outcome was comparable with that of a general population.","2441":"With the up to date published data, the risk of clomiphene exposure during pregnancy cannot be determined. After a review of animal experimentation results, we will discuss the human data. Most of the publications with human exposition concern treatments given before the beginning of pregnancy. The questions addressed to the Centre de Pharmacovigilance of Paris F. Widal will be detailed. From May 1983 to July 1995 39 requests are available with only 25 cases of known outcomes. For these 25 cases, five elective terminations and three spontaneous abortions are reported. Only one defect was observed among the 17 births (9 females, 8 males): unilateral fibula agenesis the imputability of which is difficult to establish. These data seems reassuring; however, the number of patients studied is small. Other studies on clomiphene-exposed pregnancies are necessary in order to investigate this risk.","2442":"16 cases of acute methotrexate (MTX) poisoning were reported to the Paris Poison Control Centre and 62 others were published between 1974 and 1995. Until 1992, MTX was mainly prescribed for neoplastic diseases. Clinical features involve acute renal failure, pancytopenia, and cutaneous or mucous injury. These cases emphasise major risk factors responsible for misuse and overdosage. Since 1992, MTX has been increasingly used in rheumatological or pulmonary diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, steroid-dependent asthma). Most of the overdosages were due to a medical misuse (in the dosage regimen or a misunderstanding of the prescription by nurse, pharmacist or patient). All patients had a bone marrow suppression. The treatment is based especially on early administration of folinic acid rescue.","2443":"Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is currently used for an increasing number of indications where an immune-medicated disorder is suspected. It is considered as a safe and efficacious treatment but several cases of severe acute renal failure (ARF) have been described since 1987. We report four cases of IVIG-induced ARF and the literature on the subject is reviewed. The chronological and semiological characteristics of this rare adverse effect are analysed. A sudden and marked increase of serum creatinine within the 2 to 4 days following institution of IVIG therapy, especially when the patient becomes oligo-anuric, is very suggestive of IVIG renal toxicity. The recovery of renal function is often obtained in 10 to 15 days after discontinuation of the drug. Histological changes are characterized by osmotic nephrosis injuries. Patients generally presented numerous risk factors such as over 65 years, particularly in men, pre-existing renal disease, long-standing diabetes mellitus or hypertension, volume depletion, quick infusion rate, body-weight adjustment of IVIG doses in fat subjects. The mechanism of renal injury remains speculative but an oncotic overloading of kidney probably occurs. These results indicate the need for research and investigation of risk factors before starting IVIG therapy. Close monitoring of serum creatinine and diuresis should be carried out during and after treatment.","2444":null,"2445":"The systematic fungal infections are very serious diseases, the crude mortality in invasive aspergillosis reaches 75 to 100 per cent. Systemic mycosis tends to develop in immunocompromised patients with subsequent physiopathological state, causing a risk of impairment in their digestive absorption potential; in addition these patients are polymedicated and the emergence of multiple drug interactions is frequent. Itraconazole is a very potent antifungal drug with large safety margin and the drug monitoring to maintain a satisfactory plasma level. Immunocompromised patients with suspected malabsorption and treated with oral capsule itraconazole were monitored during two years. In such difficult patients (approximately equal to 500 cases), the result has shown good trough steady-state plasma levels in 72 per cent and insufficient in 28 per cent of the observed patients. However concomitant treatments with antacids produce, in a lot of cases (approximately equal to 48 per cent), a noticeable decrease of the itraconazole availability for these patients. A training program was established to perform the analytical determination of itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole in biological samples by HPLC method. Analytical validation procedures were associated to this training program which included 115 scientific, technical staff (pharmacists, biochemists ...) from 56 hospitals and institutes.","2446":"","2447":"The decisions of health authorities concerning adverse effects of drugs are usually notified following clinical observations, but are rarely associated to experimental data. The haematopoietic tissue is one of the most sensitive to these effects. In order to anticipate and to explain adverse effects, it becomes necessary to carry out in vitro assays on normal human haematopoietic progenitors. We had the opportunity to use human cord blood progenitors which are able to repopulate allogeneic aplastic bone marrow. Many advantages are associated with this model: numerous samples, non-invasive, absence of species bias, possibilities of mechanistic approach. The clonogenic potential of progenitors in soft agar, as well as their ability to expand in liquid medium after stimulation with specific growth factors, have been used. Evidence of dose-related toxicity by inhibition of colony formation or proliferation was analysed in the presence of reference molecules. Results were reproducible despite an intrinsic variability of progenitor density between samples. They were comparable to assays on bone marrow progenitors reported by us and others. Comparison of toxicity thresholds with plasma therapeutic ranges showed the potential risk for some molecules tested.","2448":"","2449":"The aim of this study was to research the optimal conditions to shift to oral from injectable administration route for the fluoroquinolone antibiotics and the pharmacoeconomic and therapeutic impact of such a shift. Two indicators were used: proportion of the two administration routes, and mean cost per administration. The published results of pharmacokinetic studies in healthy and diseased subjects, and the clinical and\/or pharmacokinetic studies including the notion of a therapeutic shift from the parenteral route to the oral route have been selected. The bioequivalence pharmacokinetic parameters of oral and injectable forms and the major clinical data of the therapeutic shift have been listed. Literature analysis reveals that there are few studies covering the specific assessment of the switch. The financial consequences of oral administration early use show the importance of such studies.","2450":"Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, available over the counter in most countries at analysis doses (600-1200 mg\/day). After several years of such use, it would seem worthwhile to review recent safety data for this drug compared to reference analgesics. Spontaneous reporting to drug surveillance systems suggests one adverse reaction for every 5 million (UK) to 25 million (USA) 200 mg tablets sold, with one reported fatality for 0.6 to 23 billion tablets sold. During clinical and post-marketing studies, the frequency of adverse events was similar to that found with placebo or paracetamol. In a meta-analysis involving 46000 patients, the incidence of digestive events was 5 per cent, with 0.02 per cent upper GI bleeds. A prospective trial in 84000 children reported 0.007 per cent GI bleeds. Case-control studies of upper GI bleeding found odds ratios of the association with ibuprofen between 1 and 3, lower than those associated with aspirin, even at the low 'cardiovascular' doses. Other risks, such as the risk of renal failure, appear equally low. In the case of voluntary overdose, there appear to be little renal or other risk for ingested quantities below 6 g (30 tablets). Less than 1 per cent of the intoxications are rated as severe, and there have been even fewer fatalities. The favourable safety profile of ibuprofen may be related to short term use of low doses in otherwise healthy young patients, associated to a short product half-life, and may be to specific product properties. The quality of patient information may also be an important safety factor. When the safety of the drug in overdose is considered, substitution of aspirin or paracetamol, by ibuprofen, may actually reduce overall risk for the population.","2451":"","2452":"","2453":"The availability of new drugs for Alzheimer's disease, with different pharmacological profiles, leads to a redefinition the relevant methodology for developing drugs in this indication, including the inclusion\/exclusion criteria, the duration of the studies, and therefore, the relevant guidelines.

Medical problems may arise from age-related changes in social and economic conditions. Furthermore, there is a complexity of influences on the physical and mental state by polymorbidity and polypharmacy, and by alterations in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Ethical problems may arise from a conflict of interests between different parties, e.g., between the patient's goal to get the best available treatment and the physican's goal to improve medical knowledge about a certain drug. A central problem in medical ethics is the conflict between two ethical principles: e.g., the principle of respect for the patient's autonomy and the principle of beneficence. The usual solution to this ethical dilemma is to make use of the concept of competence, but it is debatable whether competence is a binary or graded concept. The model of informed consent is based on the patient's competence. But for the purpose of drug treatment of mentally impaired subjects a proxy consent of a legally authorized representative was claimed.","2459":"","2460":"","2461":"","2462":"The French system of drug surveillance has analysed the notifications of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to fluoroquinolones since they were launched. Their frequency ranges from 1\/15,000 to 1\/208,000 case per days of treatment. Cutaneous diseases and tendon disorders predominate in France whereas cutaneous effects and neuropsychiatric disorders are predominant in the UK; tendon disorders take up only the 5th position. Among the most unexpected ADRs are the following: -shock represents 33 of the anaphylaxis reactions which range from 1\/5.6 x 10(6) to 1\/4.4 x 10(5) case per days of treatment. -acute renal failure is rare: one case\/80,000 patients treated by ciprofloxacin to 1\/320,000 by norfloxacin. The pathophysiology is not well known. Tendon ruptures represent 81 cases for 921 notifications of tendon disorders which are related in decreasing order to pefloxacin 1\/23,130 case per days of treatment, ofloxacin, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin 1\/779,600 case per days of treatment. Age and corticosteroids increase the risk of tendon rupture.","2463":"Between 1981 and 1994, 58 bioequivalence studies (b.s.) were performed in 885 healthy volunteers. 93.1 per cent were single-dose, mainly of two way cross-over design. According to ATC groups, 13 were of cardiovascular drugs(C), 11 musculoskeletal (M), nine alimentary (A), seven urogenital (G), seven antimicrobial (J), six haematological (B), three nervous (N) and two respiratory (R). 97.2 per cent of volunteers finished the studies. Out of 25 withdrawals, 14 did it by their own will, seven were excluded because of lack of compliance with the protocol, one because of an adverse drug reaction (ADR) (preputial oedema), one because of intercurrent illness, and two for other objective reasons. In 35 studies the probants have been males, in 23 both sexes. Subjects were between 18 and 40 years. 209 adverse events were reported in 18 studies (31 per cent). From 885 volunteers that came to first session at the time, 115 (13 per cent) had ADRs. The association of the drug and ADRs was defined as probable in 91 ADRs (45.9 per cent), definite in 66 (33.4 per cent) and possible in 41 (20.7 per cent). 73 (63.5 per cent) volunteers had one ADR, 22 (19.1 per cent) had two and 20 (17.4 per cent) more than two ADRs. The majority -117 (56 per cent)-of ADRs were mild, 78 (37.3 per cent) moderate and 14 (6.7 per cent) severe. The most frequent ADR was headache (22.9 per cent), followed by nasal congestion (12.9 per cent), sweating (12.4 per cent), nausea (6.7 per cent), restlessness (6.7 per cent), deafness and tinnitus (6.2 per cent), change of biochemical or haematological parameters (5.3 per cent) and other. An unusual and rare ADR was impotence and preputial oedema (two volunteers on frusemide). All studies of G group (7-100 per cent) had ADRs, followed by C group (5-38 per cent) and A (3-33 per cent). Glipizide (5 mg) had highest number of ADRs (64-30.6 per cent), bromocriptine (10 mg) had 31 (14.8 per cent) and frusemide (500 mg) 22 (10.6 per cent). The largest number of subjects with ADRs were on frusemide (13-72 per cent), glipizide (17-68 per cent) and bromocriptine (15-52 per cent). At a time when generic drugs are of increasing importance, the safety of b.s. is of considerable interest. Our data confirm their safety and indicate that the majority of ADRs are mild.","2464":"Although medications continue to be used extensively in the hospitalized paediatric patient, our knowledge regarding many of these agents remains limited. To date, apart from anecdotal case reports or studies involving a very limited number of patients, few data regarding the dosing and usage of medications in neonates and paediatric patients are available in the literature. This work has been conducted in order to provide sources of information on the intravenous administration of medication to these patients. All recommendations should be individualised in accordance with the clinical situation.","2465":"The present study investigates the potential of therapeutic drug monitoring databases to document co-medication as a possible risk factor for subtherapeutic or excessively high concentrations of psychotropic drugs. Exposure was defined with respect to co-medication including one of five agents known for their capacity to induce (phenytoin, phenobarbital and carbamazepine) or to inhibit (thioridazine and levomepromazine) the metabolism of psychotropic drugs. 87 patients exposed to such co-medication were matched by sex, age and monitored psychotropic medication with 87 patients randomly selected from a pool of subjects whose co-medication did not include any substance known to interact. Outcome was defined with respect to dose-normalized concentrations being below or above therapeutic range. When taking all psychotropic drugs together, the estimated relative risk to reach concentrations above the therapeutic range was 7.8 for patients exposed to phenothiazine co-medication. The relative risk to remain at subtherapeutic level was 2.7 for patients with inducers. When considering the different psychotropic drugs separately, a coherent picture was observed, with increased risk ratios for all substances.","2466":"Pharmacokinetic\/pharmacodynamic population approaches aim at establishing relationships between dose, drug concentration of active principles and clinical response, accounting for factors responsible for inter-individual variability. Additional difficulties in the presence of metabolites include the need to decide a priori which metabolites should be monitored according to their respective role in efficacy and\/or toxicity, the need to select appropriate selective analytical methods, and the requirement for more complex pharmacokinetic and\/or pharmacodynamic models. These points are discussed more extensively for psychotropic drugs, and in particular for the active metabolites of phenothiazines, for reduced haloperidol, for the desmethylated and hydroxylated metabolites of tricyclic antidepressants, and for the desmethyl metabolites of the serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors fluoxetine and citalopram.","2467":"Although the liver is the main site of drug metabolism, conflicting results have been reported on drug elimination during liver diseases. Drug metabolism may depend on histological changes in the liver (acute or chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis) but may also depend on their origin (viral, toxic or immunological). Drug metabolism is also influenced by the severity of liver dysfunction. Cytochrome P450 isozymes and conjugation pathways may be differently affected by these conditions, and specific probe drugs have to be used in order to study the effect of diseases on each enzyme of drug metabolism. Probe-based assays must be validated during disease, since the pharmacokinetics of the parent drug and\/or of its metabolites may be altered. Because of these limitations, therapeutic drug monitoring may be the most reliable way to adjust drug dosing at present.","2468":"Selective reporting of clinical trials to regulatory authorities could result in inappropriate marketing authorization decisions. The present study was conducted to uncover such potential bias, here called 'report bias'. In 1987 the number of clinical drug trials notified to Finnish National Agency for Medicines was 274. Up to the end of 1993, a final report or a statement that the trial had been suspended had only been received in the case of 91 studies. The outcome of 183 trials was not reported. These trials were not significantly different from those reported on, in their design, in blinding, or in the use of a comparator. The distribution in phases I to IV was similar in the reported and non-reported groups. Thus incomplete reporting was not caused by differences in the investigational plan.

These medications interfere with inflammatory pathways common to all atopic diseases and could affect asthma. To investigate associations between antiallergic and antitussive medications and the occurrence of asthma exacerbations and to assess the extent of use of these medications in asthma. Regular users of anti-asthma medications were identified in a drug dispensing database. A base-cohort of asthma patients was identified using age and exposure criteria. A nested case-control study was performed within the base-cohort: the outcome was defined as a new dispensing of oral corticosteroids and matched cases and controls were compared regarding exposure to antiallergic medications. Odds ratios (OR) were computed by conditional logistic regression and adjustment incorporated markers for asthma severity. 680 asthma patients were followed in the base-cohort for an average duration of 1390 days. Antitussives, antihistamines and nasal corticosteroids were used by respectively 40, 30 and 13 per cent of the asthma population. Among the patients, 134 cases were pair matched with controls. In these pairs, antitussives showed a significant association with asthma exacerbations, with an OR of 3.1. The association had borderline significance for antihistamines and was not significant for nasal corticosteroids. The results were not modified by adjustment for disease severity. This study confirms that antitussives and antihistamines are commonly used by asthmatics and indicates that both classes are associated with increased occurrence of asthma exacerbations; assessing causality from present data is, however, difficult. Nasal corticosteroids are used less often and are not associated with the outcome. Antihistamine and antitussive medications should be more thoroughly investigated in asthma patients. ","2471":"Local ethics committees (institutional review boards, or similar bodies) were established during the last decades at (bio)medical research institutions worldwide to serve as review bodies of the proposed research projects (inclusive protocols of clinical trials), and also to monitor if the ethical principles, including the requirements of good practice (clinical, laboratory, and scientific) are respected and fulfilled during the conduct of research projects. Existing pluralism of the philosophical background on which contemporary bioethics theories are developed is questioning seriously the ancient traditions of Hippocratic, non-utilitarian medical ethics, trying to promote more utilitarian and secular approaches. Individual physicians, or researchers, as well as the ethics committee itself, are faced today with complicated ethical dilemmas, that frequently have to be solved in the atmosphere of considerable social, collegiate, economical, and time pressures, and sometimes without helpful guidance of appropriate legislation. An interesting possibility of how to overcome some of the pitfalls of the ethics review process is to express a common ethical responsibility for the research project or trial protocol in a statement of most (or all) parties involved (such as the principal investigator, sponsor, ethics committee, the patient, \"society'). Such an approach has proven helpful in enhancing concrete deliberations of ethics committees-established in Slovakia since 1991 according to the requirements of the national guidelines issued by the Slovak Ministry of Health.","2472":"","2473":"The effect of age on human liver drug-metabolizing ability was investigated by using probe drugs, metabolized by specific isozymes in liver, as an index.

MEGX content in young subjects (men 57.8 +\/- 11.3 and women 52.9 +\/- 13.1 ng\/ml) did not diverge significantly but was reduced in elderly subjects (men 43.57 +\/- 15.8 and women 29.2 +\/- 13.6 ng\/ml, p &lt; 0.05 and 0.01, respectively). 7-OHC excretion at 2 h averaged 68.1 +\/- 13.1 per cent (men) and 65.0 +\/- 18.3 per cent (women) of the dose given in young subjects and was delayed in elderly persons (men 46.5 +\/- 16.3 per cent and women 44.8 +\/- 18.3 percent, p &lt; 0.01 and 0.05, respectively). The change in probe drug metabolism was related to age (MEGX, r = -0.473 (men) and -0.682 (women) and 7-OHC; r = -0.690 (men) and -0.565 (women)). MEGX formation was reduced by 0.92 microgram\/L per year and 7-OHC excretion by 0.85 per cent per year.

If the probabilities are not suitable, other mathematical concepts such as Markov process are interesting but are still being worked on. Multicriteria analysis, a branch of graph theory, is also a flexible and reliable tool allowing differentiation and ordering strategies.

Today, only inhibitors of the Phe-Pro cleavage have shown an antiproteinase activity specific for HIV. Clinical trials in HIV infection with saquinavir, indinavir, and ritonavir have demonstrated a decrease in viral load measured by plasma HIV-RNA PCR and an increase in CD4 lymphocyte counts.

This position and the exponential development of medical knowledge, constrains university professors of pharmacology to make teaching choices, since time-limited education is imposed in this subject. Thus, it is necessary to list specific educational objectives within a frame of well defined and clear hierarchized pharmacological concepts. General and practical pharmacology teaching is to be preferred since it provides the knowledge base for further acquisition of specialized pharmacology. The necessary data can be easily and rapidly taught by means of clinical observations and case reports in connection with basic pharmacological concepts and therapeutic strategy. The medical student has to acquire rational guidelines for proper drug monitoring. He also has to learn how to assess the efficacy of the prescribed treatment and how to supervise the compliance. When an adverse effect is observed, the future physician must be able to evaluate the benefit-risk ratio. Initiation into the analysis of published clinical trials is the best way to develop a critical sense. Concurrently, pharmacology teachers should make available technical and practical resources to facilitate access to updated scientific data.","2486":"The efficient dissemination of current research data requires a suitable information system and an ideal intermediary as the liaison between the data source and the targeted users, i.e. prescribers and consumers.

The patient may not appreciate the importance of good compliance if he\/she does not know what it is for. The pathway of specialised investigations can include unnecessary tests if it is not built up around the objective of identifying the therapeutic goal(s).

Although drug therapy often results in beneficial effects and improve functional status, drug related illness is a significant health problem, accounting for 5 to 23 per cent of hospitalization, 1.75 per cent of ambulatory visits and one in 1000 deaths. In most studies, drug-related illness is more common in the elderly. Four factors influence the likelihood that a patient will experience adverse effects from a drug: the type of drug prescribed, the characteristics of patients receiving the drug, the characteristics of physicians who are prescribing the medication, and health care system policy and practice. Cardiovascular drugs, psychotropic drugs and NSAIDs are the three groups of drugs that are most commonly implicated in drug related illness, probably because they are the three groups of drugs that are most commonly prescribed in the elderly. The risk of an adverse effect with drug increases with the number of drugs prescribed. Several mechanisms may account for this phenomenon including (1) increased sensitivity of diseased tissue to drug toxicity (2) potential drug interactions, and (3) difficulties in patient compliance with an increasing number of drugs. Physician prescribing habits can increase the risk of adverse drug effects through two mechanisms: (1) the prescription of drugs that are unnecessary for the treatment of ailments that might be better managed through non-pharmacologic management and (2) the inappropriate prescription of drugs that are either contraindicated or prescribed in combination with other drugs that produce potential drug interaction. Errors in prescribing accounting for 19 to 36 per cent of hospital admissions due to drug-related events and up to 72 per cent of drug related events occurring in the hospital setting. Health care system policies influence the list of drugs that are included in the formulary, the conditions under which they are accessible and payment policy, all of which strongly influence the likelihood that a drug will be utilized. Physician payment policy may also influence drug prescribing and the success of initiatives to discontinue drugs. Interventions to improve the optimal use of medication will need to target policy, patients and physicians. Better information needs to be provided to physicians and patients about the risks and benefits of drug therapy, and the problems of patient compliance and inappropriate and unnecessary prescribing need to be addressed.","2491":"This paper is aimed at highlighting some often overlooked aspects of the development of recommendations for clinical practice, and at addressing some of the key factors that can play a role as determinants of the acceptability of recommendations in clinical practice by the targeted health care providers. It is contended that, even in areas of clinical practice where clearcut recommendations could easily be drawn from the available evidence and apparently the issue at stake is just to transfer the appropriate message to the targeted audience, it is important to acknowledge--from the development stage of the recommendations--the complexity and the role of non-scientific key determinants (i.e. beliefs, values, vested interests) of clinical behaviour.","2492":"The discipline therapeutic information uses the concept of the level of evidence for source data concerning therapeutic efficacy, and its ordering before integration in syntheses. In this paper we will start by considering the problems raised by the definition of the level of evidence in terms of the dimensions it covers. We have differentiated three components: clinical pertinance of the question asked, the methods used to reply and the quality of the data collected. Second, we will examine the different criteria important for each of these three dimensions. There are many criteria possible which do not all have the same weight, and thus for any non-arbitrary tool developed to enable the level of evidence to be ordered, it is necessary to know the weight of the different criteria. Thirdly, we will present the techniques used for working with multicriteria situations in econometrics which represent a methodology we propose using to apply in our context. To do so we need to build a 'reference' base for the level of evidence using 'experts' opinions which will help us to examine the weights of the different criteria. This approach, in conjunction with some epistemological and sociological considerations, may contribute to a better understanding of the different dimensions of this concept.","2493":"To-date, most of the meta-analyses performed are exclusively based on published data; however, some are based on individual patient data of published and unpublished trials. This last method is the reference method, but it is time-consuming and costly. The quality of meta-analyses is varied and could partly explain the criticisms this method is subject to. The Cochrane Collaboration could help in the following fields: promotion of registries of trials and meta-analyses, methodological research on meta-analysis, improvement of trial search, trial data storage and pertinence of information in published trials, improvement of meta-analysis quality, and dissemination of results. The interventions of the Cochrane Collaboration could thus improve the quality and the time performance of meta-analyses, reducing expenses and enabling the widespread dissemination of regularly updated results.","2494":"The Cochrane Collaboration has undergone an unexpected growth since its inauguration during an international meeting in 1993. This collaboration was established in response to the criticisms of a British physician, Archie Cochrane, who criticised the medical profession because it had not organised a critical summary of all relevant randomised controlled trials. The driving force of the collaboration is the collaborative review groups who collect, sort and synthesize data concerning treatment efficacy in their particular area of interest. The Cochrane Centres and the Field Coordinations help them to do this and together the produce the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The need for international cooperation is obvious because the information necessary to this system is produced throughout the world, and only some of this information is published.","2495":"Hospital databases can be used to evaluate drug prescription quality with the help of drug utilization review (DUR). A DUR appraises the appropriateness of prescribing by means of explicit criteria established in accordance with evidence-based data, and then suggests interventions designed to modify prescriber's practice. On the one hand, the capacity of the review to show the variations, and, on the other hand, the assessment of the impact of interventions implemented to correct those variations, depend on the quality of hospital databases. This article has two objectives: to identify the required data, both to carry out a DUR and to evaluate its outcomes, and to define the essential qualities of hospital databases.","2496":"","2497":"The aim of therapeutic information is that people who need it have access to data of the highest level of evidence.

An example illustrates the importance of the form of a message. The difference between recommendation and message is highlighted.","2498":"We present the French medical references under their double characteristics of 'conventional' and therapeutic instruments. On one hand, they are conventional because they illustrate a phase of the relations between medical organisations and the health insurance fund (embodied in 'National Conventions'), of which they clearly illustrate the evolution towards the control of medical care. On the other hand, the last National Convention stipulates that medical references 'define medically unnecessary care and prescriptions', thereby being a prescription guide or guideline, all the more so as they are compulsory. We describe the evolution of the Conventions, and discuss the appropriateness of the references as therapeutic guidelines.","2499":"Within the limited resources available for health care, it is important to ensure that health care professionals provide effective patient care to achieve the twin objectives of improvements in patient outcome and the efficient use of resources. There are two pre-requisites for effective professional practice: the identification of effective health care interventions; and the use of effective dissemination and implementation strategies to ensure the adoption of effective interventions in practice. Systematic reviews and valid guidelines represent the most efficient methods of identifying effective health care interventions. There are many different dissemination and implementation strategies; however, traditional passive dissemination methods (for example, publication in professional journals, mailing practice recommendations to health care professionals) are generally ineffective. Greater attention needs to be given to co-ordinating active dissemination and implementation strategies to ensure effective professional practice.","2500":"The target population for drug treatment is composed of all patients likely to benefit from it. It is defined on the basis of all the data collected during the clinical evaluation of the therapy (on the studied population). The dissemination population comprises those patients who are given the therapy once it has been released. Several surveys have shown that these two population do not coincide, although they should. The consequences of this gap can theoretically be measured. However, in order to do such an evaluation, we need relevant indices representing the consequences in terms of lack of expected benefit for the patients. We constructed models that represent the gap and its impact on life span and explored them by simulation. It came out that the consequences can be assessed in practice provided that outcome measurement technology is applied.","2501":"Randomized clinical trial is the main source of evidence in medicine. Information from clinical trials, however, is limited because only a limited number of questions can be addressed with this approach and, in particular, the issue of drug effectiveness (in real life) remains unanswered. On the other hand, the literature about drug effects (through animal studies, model of effect, observational studies, etc) is very large, but provides little scientific evidence useful for drug prescription: most studies do not address relevant clinical questions or have methodologic problems. In practice, physicians are overwhelmed by thousands of new articles among which they have to select the few that are useful and valid for their practice. This task is difficult because physicians do not have enough time in their clinical activity and they are not trained for critical appraisal of the literature. Therefore, they are extremely dependent on the diffusion process that selects and synthesizes the information for them. Another important factor that has been shown to influence prescription is patient's opinion, as one of the main objective for physicians is patient's satisfaction. Some physicians also use prescription as a way to terminate a consultation or as a medical act independently from the drug which is prescribed (drug prescription being part of the physician-patient relationship). At least, the absence of real control over drug prescription is considered to be one of the main factors explaining the large discrepancy between numerous prescription guidelines (from consensus conference or expert opinions) and the reality.","2502":"","2503":"Doctors always seek to base their decisions on the best available evidence. Often this evidence represents extrapolations of pathophysiological principles and logic rather than established facts based on data derived from patients. The advent and proliferation of randomized controlled trials have led to a rapid increase in the quantity and quality of clinically valid evidence concerning clinical history taking and physical examination, issues of diagnosis, prognosis, therapy and other important health care issues. As a result it is becoming possible to make explicit much of the implicit non-verbal reasoning of expert clinicians, making their clinical reasoning more comprehensible and accessible to trainees. The ability to track down, critically appraise and incorporate evidence into clinical practice has been named 'evidence-based medicine'. As the quantity of valid evidence increases so does the requirement for each of us to develop the skills necessary to assimilate, evaluate and make best use of that evidence for patients. Often we fail to identify or address our daily needs for clinically important knowledge, leading to a progressive decline in our clinical competency. When we do seek knowledge traditional sources of information such as journals and text-books are often either too disorganized or out of date and we often resort to asking colleagues. The need to maintain and expand clinically important knowledge has been partially addressed by increasing demands for continuing medical education but how might this be best achieved? Recent evaluations suggest that three evidence-based medicine strategies help fulfill these goals. They include; learning evidence-based medicine, seeking and applying evidence-based medical summaries generated by others, and accepting evidence-based protocols developed by others.","2504":"It is well known that a number of medical interventions are still based on personal practitioner impression, non-systematic clinical experience or pathophysiologic rationale rather than solid scientific evidence, even when available. Evidence based medicine consists in systematically finding, appraising and using validated research results as a basis for clinical decision making. Access to evidence is essentially provided by randomized clinical trials. One can hope that medical practice supported by the best available evidence about diagnosis, prognosis and therapy will lead to some improvement in patient care. Nevertheless, the field of grey zones is still so large in clinical practice (where incertainty is mainly the rule) that evidence based medicine remains for the moment a positive mental attitude more than a pragmatic and generalizable approach.","2505":"","2506":"","2507":"","2508":"","2509":"This study looks into patterns of benzodiazepine prescription for patients attending a primary health care setting.

Patients receiving benzodiazepine treatment tended to be females (68.5 per cent), aged over 40 (84 per cent), married (63.8 per cent) and with primary education level (77.1 per cent). Most patients received long acting (48 per cent) or short acting (36.7 per cent) benzodiazepine treatment. In 46 per cent of the cases the treatment was longer than one year. Benzodiazepines were prescribed for anxiety (44.8 per cent), insomnia (23.8 per cent) and depression (10.1 per cent).

Many adverse effects are never reported and this under-reporting is variable. The capture\/recapture method can be used in drug surveillance to evaluate the importance of under-reporting for an adverse effect of a drug. This method, based upon the intersection of two different data sources with the aim of identifying the number of common cases, can estimate the number of unreported cases if at least two independent data sources are available. Scrupulous identification of each case and of common cases and study of the independence of the two systems are essential for this method. The application of the capture\/recapture method to spontaneous reporting permits the estimation of the total number of cases and the completeness of registration of the two data sources (the drug company and the French drug surveillance centres). This application of the capture\/recapture method needs to be validated by comparing the results to the results of prospective studies whenever possible.","2512":"Itraconazole is a new oral triazole antifungal agent that is effective against a wide range of fungal pathogens, including Aspergillus species. There has been a considerable increase in recent years in its use in prophylaxis of aspergillosis in neutropenic patients. A total of 74 trough concentrations of itraconazole+active metabolite were retrospectively analysed at steady state in 16 patients admitted to hospital for acute myeloid leukaemia (12) or malignant lymphoma (4). The minimum therapeutic concentration (itraconazole+hydroxyitraconazole = 1000 ng\/ml) was never reached in 31 per cent of patients (5\/16) and a constant efficient plasma concentration was obtained in only 19 per cent (3\/16) with a daily regimen of 400-600 mg. The plasma levels of patients at the same daily dose differed up to 15-fold. This study confirms the pronounced inter-patient variability of unchanged itraconazole concentrations previously found in volunteers and patients. The plasma levels in six patients during successive chemotherapy treatments also varied greatly. Intra-individual differences were more accurately examined in six patients given 600 mg itraconazole\/day during their first chemotherapy treatment. The trough plasma concentrations on day 15 and day 25 varied from -53 to +245 per cent. These results indicate that the plasma itraconazole concentration of neutropenic patients must be monitored to ensure that each individual is given a clinically effective dose.","2513":"Thirty five subjects (age: 45-69 years) with subjective memory loss, without any other neuropsychiatric or somatic disease, were recruited in a phase II study. This double blind randomized versus placebo controlled study compared the effects of minaprine (200 mg\/d) with placebo, in two parallel groups, during 2 months, on memory, attention and vigilance. Three psychometric tests were the main criteria of assessment: a standardized battery of memory tests (SM 5), the dual-coding test, the analysis of choice reaction times (CRT) and the critical flicker fusion point (CFF). A positive effect of minaprine was detected on words delayed recall (p = 0.028) and immediate recognition of words (p = 0.049). The global clinical tests (CGI, MacNair scale) were not statistically modified. Tolerability of minaprine and placebo were comparable. A positive pharmacodynamic activity on mnemonic performance is thus demonstrated in favour of minaprine (200 mg\/d) in this specific population characterized by a memory complaint. These results would lead to a phase III study in which the main criteria would be global scales in order to confirm the clinical reliability of the present results.","2514":"We have developed an artificial stomach-duodenum model made up of three compartments representing the stomach, (including a fragment of hog gastric mucosa), the proximal duodenum, and the distal duodenum. Gastroduodenal flow rates are controlled by a microcomputer capable of (1) adjusting gastric emptying and alkaline secretion in the proximal duodenum according to intragastric pH; (2) adjusting pancreatic alkaline secretion according to proximal duodenum pH; and (3) simulating acid response to food ingestion. Antacid drugs were added 90 min after simulated food ingestion in near-physiological or duodenal ulcer conditions. Aluminum phosphate-containing antacids resulted in a persistent antacid effect, due to their adsorption to the gastric mucosa; this prolonged the buffering capacity at pH 2.4 to 120 min. Aluminum+magnesium hydroxides and calcium+magnesium carbonate combinations mainly exerted neutralizing activity, inducing an increase in the gastric emptying rate. In the duodenal ulcer simulation, the pH of the gastric contents was lower and the antacid effect was shorter than in the 'physiological' simulation.","2515":"Antacid activity supported by citrate-bicarbonate complex of four effervescent ranitidine forms has been assessed in vitro using an 'artificial stomach-duodenum' model controlled by microcomputer. This model allows (i) maintenance of constant the rates of the fluxes throughout the experiments or (ii) simulation of gastroduodenal flux regulation, in the normal subject (NS) or in the duodenal ulcer patient (DU) situation. The four forms developed a theoretical maximal antacid capacity between 61 and 81 mmol with a maximum intragastric pH between 3.2 and 4.8. In the gastroduodenal flux regulation simulation, antacid activity duration was rapid and included between 85 and 118 min in NS situation (50 to 56 mmol H+ consumed) and between 75 and 93 min in DU situation (43 to 47 mmol H+ consumed). The reduction of acid load penetrating into the duodenum was contained between 36 and 50 per cent. Effervescent compounds exerted a neutralising activity and a buffering capacity close to pH 6.0 (5 per cent of total antacid capacity), related to antacid potency.","2516":"Assessment of memory performance is now well established. However, the normal form of assessment does not evaluate memory problems encountered during daily activities, a situation relevant to the evaluation of drug effects on memory components. The present study examines the ecological validity of psychometric tests. 49 individuals, from 20 to 89 years old without any identified pathology were included in the study, with the aim of establishing correlations between an autoquestionnaire of memory, a standard memory battery (SM9) and a daily memory video test (DMV). No correlation was found between self-estimation and objective tests or DMV. A strong correlation (r = 0.81) was found between SM9 and DMV. Imaged information and verbal coding appear to be essential parameters of objective tests. These results confirm the ecological validity of the objective psychometric tests and in particular of SM9.","2517":"Today all the pharmaceutical managers are convicted of the need for quality in clinical trials.

Recent evidence suggests that only some of the several catecholamine receptor subtypes are specifically involved in feeding control. They include the beta 1\/2-adrenoceptors, the alpha 1-adrenoceptors and the D1 dopamine receptors: stimulation of these receptors reduces feeding in rats. Stimulation of serotonergic 5-HT1B and 5-HT2C receptors reduces feeding and perhaps enhances the satiating effect of food. Recently, an interesting reciprocal relation between serotonin and cholecystokinin has been discovered in relation to feeding control. The serotonergic 5-HT2A receptors are involved in stress-induced anorexia and regulate the hyperphagia induced by neuropeptide Y in the nucleus paraventricularis of the hypothalamus. Both effects may involve changes in the secretion of corticotropin-releasing factor. These findings may help elaborate neuronal models of feeding control and perhaps facilitate progress in the pharmacotherapy of human obesity and eating disorders.","2520":"Lithium is the archetype of mood stabilizing drugs. Its narrow therapeutic index mostly accounts for the occurrence of acute intoxications. There is, however, growing evidence that lithium can induce long lasting neurological sequelae. These appear to be multifactorial, resulting mainly from overdosage, concomitant neuroleptic treatment, and hyperthermia. The most frequent clinical feature is a permanent cerebellar syndrome. As regards the few pathological data available, there is a striking loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells, which is present in all published neuropathological reports on this condition. It is suggested that lithium, cytokines, and neuroleptics synergize to disrupt calcium homeostasis in Purkinje cells, and to elicit calcium-mediated neurotoxicity. This model might help predict high risk clinical situations and define useful working hypotheses as well.","2521":"","2522":"","2523":"Pseudomembranous colitis (PMC) is a rare but potentially severe complication of antibiotic treatment, which is characterized by the proliferation of the bacterium Clostridium difficile in the colon.

The antibiotic treatment was often ambulatory (83 per cent) for a broncho-pulmonary infection (42 per cent). In 90 per cent of the cases, the treatment included a -lactam, frequently amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, and in 25 per cent of the cases, a fluoroquinolone.

Oestrogens receptors and metabolism or inactivation of oestradiol have been demonstrated in the skin, and the pilosebaceous unit is a target for sexual steroids. Could hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) be a treatment for the symptoms of skin ageing (dryness, roughness, burning and atrophy of the skin, itching, cold intolerance, wrinkles, hyperpilosity, alopecia)? In some experimental studies oestrogens increase the activity of fibroblasts and water, hyaluronic acid and collagen dermal contents. Some studies have demonstrated that oestrogen treatment increases skin thickness, mitotic activity of keratinocytes, and dermal collagen content in postmenopausal women. Thus HRT could theoretically treat skin ageing. It has been shown that HRT alleviates some symptoms of skin ageing (dryness of hair and skin) and that flushes disappear. We demonstrated that non-invasive measurements of physical parameters of the skin can reveal increase in skin thickness (+10 to +20 per cent) in women treated by HRT vs non treated, especially in the application area of oestrogen and in the non-sun-exposed areas. In our study HRT alleviated the hyposeborrhoea usually seen after menopause and could contribute to the amelioration of some complaints of post menopausal women such as roughness or dehydrated skin. Hormonal ageing is quantitatively less than actinic ageing, but its treatment is easier. Moreover HRT increases skin thickness, contributing to the prevention of atrophy (with fragile and fading skin) due to intrinsic ageing, and it limits the masculinization of facial hair and skin experienced by women as a sign of ageing. In conclusion HRT treats oestrogen deficiency and can be used to treat skin ageing.","2527":"The need to know about drug prescribing practices, in order to assess their relevance, has led us to perform a drug prescription study in two medical departments of Cardiology at 'Neuro-Cardiologique Hospital' in Lyon (France). In moving from theoretical project design to its practical achievement, important methodological problems, initially unsuspected, were encountered. For each main point of the study (choices regarding medical department, the person holding the inquiry, data collection, etc.) and any subsidiary operations (data key-boarding, codification and analysis), the main problems encountered are described after considering advantages and limits of potential solutions. We propose useful and relevant questions to be asked, before performing a drug prescription study, even a modest one, or interpreting the results of such a study.","2528":"To better evaluate the clinical practice of French practitioners regarding the treatment of hypertension and the use of diuretics, we conducted a study using quota method to select 240 general practitioners and 90 cardiologists. Diuretics are still widely used and are effective well known drugs. Their use is nevertheless restricted by some side effects such as increasing frequency of micturition and electrolyte disturbances. These side effects are reduced with the new lower dosages and slow release formulations. Analysis of the results of our study suggests that the use of diuretics depends more on old habits and industry communication on drugs than on the knowledge of the results of therapeutic trials on mortality and morbidity.","2529":"To test if calcium antagonists and converting enzyme inhibitors can act similarly on urinary albumin excretion of type 2, non-insulin-dependent diabetic subjects with hypertension, a 24 week, double-blind, randomized, parallel multicentre study was performed in 111 such patients allocated to nicardipine 50 mg slow release form (n = 57) or to captopril 25 mg (n = 54) twice daily. The efficacy of both drugs was similar on urinary albumin excretion (Westlake test p = 0.19). However, blood pressure was lower on nicardipine than on captopril (p &lt; 0.05), and the antialbuminuric effect of nicardipine was related to its hypotensive effect, while this was not the case for captopril. The two drugs were tolerated equally. Thus, nicardipine and captopril for 24 weeks can be equally effective on urinary albumin excretion of type 2, non-insulin-dependent diabetic subjects with hypertension, but the mechanisms of their anti-albuminuric effects may be different.","2530":"The combination of two antihypertensive drugs is recommended when mild to moderate hypertension is not controlled by sequential monotherapy. The aim of our study was to compare the efficacy and the safety of the combination enalapril 20 mg-hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg to that of enalapril 20 mg-nifedipine SL 20 mg x 2. Two hundred and forty four hypertensive patients not controlled (DPB &gt; 95 mmHg) by a single dose of enalapril 20 mg\/24 h, received for 4 weeks, one of these two combined therapies in a randomized double-blind trial. The efficacy was of same amplitude in the two groups (DBP: -10.8 mmHg enalapril-hydrochlorothiazide vs-10.3 mmHg enalapril-nifedipine). The side effects were less frequent in the enalapril-hydrochlorothiazide group (14 per cent vs 24 per cent, p = 0.04).","2531":"The aim of this study was to analyse the respective values of clinic and ambulatory blood pressure measurements in patients with treated hypertension. Twenty-eight patients with mild to moderate hypertension were studied (clinic blood pressure &gt; or = 160\/95 mmHg), treated with benazepril alone (n = 7) or combined with hydrochlorothiazide (n = 21). A 24 h ambulatory blood pressure measurement was performed before (d0) and after 8 weeks of treatment (d56). The treatment was effective on the ambulatory blood pressure in 19 patients (Staessen criteria) and effective on clinic measurements in 20 patients (WHO criteria). The results were concordant in 25 of the 28 patients. The decrease of the ambulatory blood pressure values during the day between d0 and d56 was not significantly related to the decrease of the clinic values. The comparison of the ambulatory blood pressure values at each hour between d0 and d56 showed that the treatment was effective during 24 h. The 'white coat' effect has been evaluated at d0 and d56 by the difference between mean daytime ambulatory blood pressure and clinic values. Clinic values were higher than mean daytime ambulatory values in benazepril (14 +\/- 12 mmHg and 7 +\/- 7 mmHg for the systolic and diastolic pressure) and benazepril-hydrochlorothiazide group (12 +\/- 12 mmHg and 0.2 +\/- 9 mmHg for the systolic and diastolic pressure). This 'white coat' effect was not modified during the treatment. Previous studies have emphasized a better assessment of the cardiovascular risk with ambulatory than with clinic measurements. The differences in the assessment of the efficiency of the treatment between clinic and ambulatory measurements shown in our study prompt us to use ambulatory measurements in patients with apparently uncontrolled hypertension.","2532":null,"2533":"We retrospectively studied 216 mild to moderate hypertensive patients receiving either an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or a calcium antagonist (CA), as a once-a-day monotherapy; their blood pressure had been measured using both a sphygmomanometer and an ambulatory blood pressure recorder. Numerous discrepancies were found between the two methods of blood pressure measurement with respect to systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), as well as pulse pressure (PP). Clinic blood pressure measurement did not show any significant differences between the effects of ACEI and those of CA, whereas ambulatory blood pressure measurements (ABPM) showed that in patients with normal ambulatory blood pressure (so-called 'white coat' hypertensive patients), ACEI only (but not CA) significantly lowered SBP, DBP and PP. Accordingly, a threshold of efficacy was sought: it appeared to be lower for ACEI than for CA (120\/80 vs 140\/85 mmHg). Furthermore, for a given degree of DBP lowering, SBP and PP were more lowered by ACEI than by CA, indicating a greater effect of ACEI on arterial compliance. Likewise, for a given level of mean blood pressure, SBP and PP were lower and DBP slightly higher in patients on ACEI than in those on CA. Our data are consistent with some recent papers, emphasizing a heightened activity of the renin-angiotensin system in 'white coat' hypertensive patients.","2534":"The long term reproducibility of ambulatory blood pressure measurements was evaluated over two 24 h recordings made under identical conditions 2 years apart in 20 normotensive and 13 essential hypertensive patients not receiving antihypertensive treatment. There was excellent agreement between the mean 24 h values of blood pressure as well as for the day time and night time means. The standard deviation of the differences was half that of casual determinations. On the other hand, the reproducibility of the mean hourly values was comparable to that of casual measurements. The reproducibility of the white coat effect was poor, as assessed by the difference between blood pressure on fitting the device and the mean day time value. These results indicate that the short term reproducibility of ambulatory blood pressure is maintained over the long term.","2535":"","2536":"","2537":"","2538":"","2539":"","2540":"","2541":"The pathophysiology associated with major burns is complex and subject to a state of flux (coexistence of pain, infectious diseases, multiple trauma, disturbances of metabolism and acid-base status, etc) which could affect the disposition and the pharmacokinetic behaviour of drugs. In current clinical practice, practitioners often use powerful antimicrobial agents; however, few pharmacokinetic studies are available in burns patients (of the order of 30 studies). Furthermore, the methods used are sometimes questionable. After dealing with the ethical and physiological context in which such research is undertaken, the authors report a review of the pharmacokinetic studies done during the last 15 years. Concerning both aminoglycosides and glycopeptides, no therapeutic recommendations are available (therapeutic schedules). However, in this case, therapeutic monitoring is available and represents a suitable tool to better master their use. In the case of beta-lactam antibiotics and quinolones, more data are available. Some investigations have shown the possibility of translesional diffusion of certain agents in burns (such as gentamicin, piperacillin\/tazobactam combination, or fosfomycin). This phenomenon could be a co-factor of success in treatment. Considering the relatively meager pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data available in burns, it is important in the future to refine our knowledge of the distribution and metabolism of drugs in burns patients in order to better master their use. Finally, ethical and methodological considerations need to be taken in account.","2542":null,"2543":"This report compares the drug surveillance systems in France and Spain. The Spanish causality assessment method is explained. The Spanish and French drug surveillance systems are rather similar, but with some variations in the data analysis and differences between causality algorithms used. Spontaneous reporting in two drug surveillance centres, Aquitaine (Bordeaux, France) and in the Spanish Basque Country (SBC) (type of reports, reporting form) is compared. Reports received by the two centres during the year 1992 are presented. The SBC Centre has received more reports and differences in the source and type of effects were observed.","2544":"The French drug surveillance (pharmacovigilance) system is based on a network of 31 regional centres which receive adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports from health professionals and are drug information centers. Cases are entered into a common database, with causality scores. This database contains large amounts of data, which may be used for pharmaco-epidemiological studies. As an example, all cases in which an antihypertensive drug, suspect or not, was cited were identified. ACE-inhibitor cough was also explored. Since 1985, &gt; 70,000 case reports have been entered into the database. 63 per cent were reported by specialists, 20 per cent by GPs. 54 per cent came from University Hospitals, 21 per cent from private practice. The most numerous age group was 60 to 69. The overall sex ratio (F\/M) was 1.28, the female preponderance being most marked at &lt; 39 and &gt; 70 years of age. 43 per cent took only one drug, 20 per cent two drugs, 13.4 per cent three, and 24 per cent &gt; three drugs. The most frequently reported effects concerned the skin and appendages (15 per cent), general status and central nervous system (9.5 per cent each), platelets, liver, and GI systems (6 per cent each). Outcome was favourable in 74 per cent. Dechallenge was positive in 71 per cent, rechallence in 6 per cent. 3.4 per cent of the patients died; in 2.2 per cent death was related to a reaction. Causality assessment indicated close temporal relationship (C2 or C3) in 69 per cent of cases; in 51 per cent of cases, no other obvious cause was found. 66 per cent of the reactions were labelled when reported. The database could also be used to explore drug utilisation: as an example, we studied the age and sex distribution of reports containing antihypertensive drugs, irrespective of their possible causal role in the reaction. Antihypertensives were mentioned in 14 per cent of the reports. The age distribution was skewed towards greater age, with a maximum of 70 years. F\/M was 1.57, with more M use &lt; 20 and 30-59, whereas F were more common between 20-29 and 60 years. beta-blockers were more often associated with patients under 70, whereas above 70 diuretics and centrally acting antihypertensive drugs were more often reported. This could be related to greater use or worse tolerance of these drugs. As an example of the exploration of a specific drug-reaction relationship, we explored the relationship between the use of ACE inhibitors (ACEI) and cough. ACE inhibitors were present in 6 per cent of cases, but in 75 per cent of reports of cough. F\/M was 1.29 (NS) for all reports concerning ACEI, 1.28 for cough unrelated to ACEI, 2.1 for cough with ACEI (P &lt; 0.05). Cough was present in 12 per cent of all reports concerning ACEI. There was no clear difference between ACEI for cough or sex ratio; women cough more with ACEI. This does not seem related to greater ACEI use by women or to greater sensitivity of women to cough. The reason for this sex difference remains to be explained. There are large amounts of essentially underutilized data in drug surveillance databases. How they can or should be used remains to be validated. ","2545":"","2546":"","2547":"For a long time, regrettable prejudices have slowed down the expansion of methadone treatment. The arrival of AIDS and the need to find new therapies for addicts have facilitated a reduction in the misunderstanding concerning methadone. Methadone does not induce a narcotic, analgesic, or tranquilizing state for dependant addicts, is medically very safe and is not necessarily a life-long cure. Methadone treatments have become the most efficient means of treating addicts who are not able or willing to start short term abstinence programmes or go to specialized institutions. An evaluation of methadone treatments at the Phoenix Foundation in Geneva has confirmed that these programmes were able to reduce heroin use, delinquency, prostitution, risk of AIDS, overdoses or suicides and to maintain a good medical and psychosocial stability for the majority of the patients.","2548":"Different methods have been developed in clinical abuse liability testing in man. Tolerance, psychic and\/or physical dependence must be investigated through clinical studies during drug development of a new substance. Adequate methodology is needed using double-blind, time-blind evaluations, comparisons of different dose levels and duration of treatment for a given drug, abrupt and gradual interruption of treatment, appropriate period of observation after treatment cessation ... The optimal scale to evaluate properly the symptoms occurring after drug discontinuation is still under investigation. These studies will or should permit the differentiation of rebound, withdrawal and recurrence. Methods developed to study reinforcing effects in post-addicts and healthy subjects are self-administration and choice procedures. In addition, the more traditional approach has been through assessing self-reported effects in which standardized questionnaires are used (Addiction Research Center Inventory or A.R.C.I.; Single Dose Questionnaire or S.D.Q.). A third focus of measurement has been discrimination studies performed in individuals with histories of drug abuse as well as healthy subjects. Abuse-liability testing of a new compound needs a multidimensional assessment to optimize the predictivity in defining the relative risk.","2549":"Since clinical and biological 'markers' in depressive disorders are missing, the antidepressive drug choice today is based on several classifications. The chemical classification separates antidepressive drugs according to their structure. Their activity mechanism and\/or specificity on brain neurotransmittors constitute the biochemical classification. Their sedative, median or stimulating activity provide the therapeutic classification. Which criteria should be used in choosing? The choice depends on clinical and biological data obtained from the patient. Chemical classification may be useful at a new molecule synthesis level. In the biochemical classification, anticholinergic and antihistaminic activities inducing side effects and sedation are taken in account. The therapeutic classification is usually used first, especially in case of first cure. An antidepressive drug will be prescribed according its initial effects on anxiety or holding up, facilitating the wait for its antidepressive action. A better definition of samples studied and of study aims, and improvement in knowledge about activity mechanisms of antidepressive drugs might provide answers regarding treatment choice in depressive disorders.","2550":"In recent years there has been a change in the risk-benefit ratio of antidepressants characterized by improvement in terms of side effects with second generation drugs and efficacy in new indications (anxiety disorders for example). However, no significant gain in terms of efficacy in major depressive disorders has been obtained. Some aspects of the risk-benefit ratio of antidepressants should be better assessed before being optimized: for example, onset of action, efficacy and safety of long term treatment, in particular dose and duration of treatment, suicidal thoughts and suicide in treated patients, effects of antidepressants in bipolar disorders, compliance and economic evaluation. In conclusion, the evaluation of risk-benefit ratio associated with antidepressants, drugs of proven efficacy in many indications, should take into account the risks of not treated depressive disorders (chronicity, social functioning and mortality).","2551":"The therapeutic drug monitoring of antidepressant drugs is of interest to adapt dosage regimens to reduce the number of non-responder patients, to reduce drug side effects and to detect non-compliant patients. A therapeutic range is defined for many of these drugs and their linear or non-linear kinetics are important parameters in clinical practice to define the posology. Some patients, because of when there is drug biotransformation polymorphism, are exposed to drug accumulation a deficit in isoenzymes of cytochrome P450. The existence of these isoenzymes explains the possibility of non-linear kinetics and drug interactions.","2552":"A great deal of data support the view that depression is frequently associated with a decrease in central serotonergic neurotransmission. Furthermore, this neurobiological alteration very probably contributes to depression because treatments known to increase the 'serotonergic tone', such as the chronic administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), have antidepressant properties. Extensive studies of the mechanisms of action of SSRIs led to the discovery of the key role of somato-dendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors in a negative control of serotonergic neurotransmission. From this finding, a new treatment of depression has been attempted which consists of the association of an SSRI with an antagonist (non-selective) of these autoreceptors. The potent antidepressant action of this association (with a shorter delay of action, even in depressed patients previously resistant to 'classical' therapies) should promote novel therapeutic strategies consisting of raising the 'serotonergic tone' by acting on different (but convergent) molecular targets.","2553":"","2554":"","2555":"","2556":"","2557":"","2558":"","2559":"","2560":"","2561":"","2562":"","2563":"","2564":"","2565":"","2566":"","2567":"","2568":"","2569":null,"2570":"The aim of the present study was to investigate the characteristics of adverse drug reactions reported by hospital doctors and nurses from Toulouse University Hospital between 1992 and 1993. During these two years, doctors and nurses reported 1498 and 164 adverse drug reactions respectively. Nurses reported significantly more cutaneous side effects than doctors (50 vs 24 per cent). Doctors reported significantly more neuropsychiatric, haematologic, hepatic or renal side effects than nurses. Imputability (causal relation) score of adverse drug reactions given by nurses was higher than that of doctors: nurses reported more observations with imputability equal to I3 (likely: 55 vs 46 per cent) and less with imputability equal to I1 (doubtful: 3 vs 23 per cent). Serious side effects (as defined by WHO) were more often seen by doctors (19 per cent) than by nurses (10 per cent). The more frequently suspected drugs were antiinfectious agents (35 per cent) and analgesics (7 per cent) for nurses, and neurotropic drugs (23 per cent) for doctors.

We report five cases with extrapyramidal disorders associated to a treatment with this drug for which the neuroleptic activity resulting from an interaction with D2 receptors is not always known by prescribers. One case consisted of acute dyskinesias and four of parkinsonian syndromes, one of these being associated with tardive dyskinesia. In these four cases, dosing recommendations were not respected.","2572":"Two cases of moderate neutropenia and 3 cases of severe neutropenia in the course of fusidic acid treatment for sepsis related to a hip prothesis or septic osteitis are reported. Neutropenia was always observed following routine blood cell count, after a mean of 21 days' treatment (16 to 27 days). Moderate fever was observed only once, in a patient with profound neutropenia. A complete recovery of blood cell count was noted in all cases, 5 to 9 days upon discontinuation of fusidic acid. A sternal bone-marrow aspiration was performed in 4 cases, showing normocellularity or hypercellularity in two cases, and moderate hypoplasia of granulocytic cells. The respective roles of other treatments are discussed. Overall, these five cases suggest that reversible granulocytopenia can be caused by protracted treatment with fusidic acid. Although nine different associated drugs could also have been involved in four patients, the causal relationship was less suggestive for three of them due to chronological events. In other cases, the drugs never or very rarely caused neutropenia. Finally, the possibility of vancomycin-induced neutropenia cannot be excluded in one case.","2573":"Hypersensitivity reactions associated with glucocorticoid treatment are rare but well known; the purpose of this study was to identify the responsible constituent (the excipient or the glucocorticoid). 32 cases published from 1970 have been analysed. In 75 per cent of cases, the patients received the glucocorticoid (hydrocortisone and methylprednisolone principally) by the intravenous route. Clinical manifestations reported were respiratory or cutaneous, with a short interval to onset. Skin tests were performed in 20 patients, but cutaneous challenge identified an agent responsible for hypersensitivity in only three cases. The heterogeneity of the test results in these 32 cases makes it difficult to identify a unifying explanation for the reactions, or propose a therapeutic schedule.","2574":"Since 1990, the 'Centre Regional de Pharmacovigilance' of Nantes has systematically monitored pregnant women exposed to drugs. To increase physicians' participation in this study (34 per cent), the protocol was modified in 1992. Phoned answers are confirmed by mail. At the supposed time of the delivery, the physician receives a questionnaire about the outcome of pregnancy. A second letter and phone call are planned. With this method, 89 per cent of the pregnancies were fully documented between March 92 and March 94. Answers are classified according to the type of the practice. Pregnancy outcome is studied according to the drugs and the moment of exposure during pregnancy. Quality of the information, motivation of the physicians, and the benefits and difficulties of this method are discussed.","2575":"The present retrospective study investigates the characteristics of drug-induced movement disorders notified to a Regional Drug Surveillance Centre. Among 4000 general side effects spontaneously reported to the Centre between 1989 and 1993, 122 were drug-induced movement disorders. Drug-induced parkinsonism (40 per cent) was mainly due to antidopaminergic agents (neuroleptics but also antiemetics or calcium channel blockers). Acute dyskinesia and dystonia (25 per cent) as well as tardive dyskinesia (14 per cent) involved mainly neuroleptics or antiemetics. Non-parkinsonian tremors (11 per cent) were related mostly to tricyclic antidepressants.

Side effects observed in 72 treated patients with chronic active hepatitis C are analysed in this retrospective study. Doses used were 3 or 9 M IU, three times a week, for 12 to 24 weeks. There were no contra-indications to the treatment and all patients had the factors predictive of a satisfactory therapeutic response. Apart from general debility, there were side effects in 65 of the 72 patients as follows: flu-like syndrome (n = 39), gastrointestinal (n = 29), dermatological (n = 24), haematological (n = 23), neurological (n = 20), cardiovascular (n = 6) and thyroid (n = 6) disorders. For 30 per cent of the patients, the dose was decreased (n = 6) or the treatment was withdrawn, temporarily (n = 5) or permanently (n = 10). These results are in accordance with those published and emphasize the need for clinico-biological monitoring during and after treatment. Indeed delayed thyroid disorders appear to be relatively common.","2577":"The purpose of this study was to define the characteristics and the frequency of antiarrhythmic drug-induced side effects. All patients referred for cardiological consultation and treated with antiarrhythmic drugs between April 1992 and October 1993 were prospectively investigated. 300 patients were included in the study: 41 (13.6 per cent) had drug-induced side effects, nine of which were serious: 5 proarrhythmic effects, 1 pulmonary fibrosis, 1 peripheral neuropathy, and 2 acute cardiac failure. Side effects led to discontinuation of treatment in 26 cases (7.6 per cent). Statistical analysis showed that side effects occurred more commonly with disopyramide (46.1 per cent, P &lt; 0.01) or propafenone (41.7 per cent, P &lt; 0.05) and less frequently with sotalol (2 per cent, P &lt; 0.01) than with the other drugs (flecainide 20 per cent; amiodarone 16.4 per cent; cibenzoline 4.8 per cent; hydroquinidine 4.3 per cent). Side effects were more common on bitherapy (39 per cent) than on monotherapy (13 per cent) in general and in the amiodarone-treated group in particular. In conclusion, side effects of antiarrhythmic drugs involved 1\/6 patients overall and led to discontinuation of treatment in 1\/14. The frequency of proarrhythmias (1.1 per cent) was lower than previously reported, suggesting that recently published clinical trials have modified the prescription habits.","2578":"The association between asthma exacerbations and use of antiasthmatics has been studied with a drug dispensing database. Exacerbations were identified through use of oral corticosteroids and the risk was determined for each medication. use of fenoterol and oral xanthines increases the frequency of exacerbations, but a channelling phenomenon is not excluded. This method could be used in the study of treatment combinations or new treatments, facilitating the monitoring of asthmatic populations. A second study collects ambulatory drug use data (POM and OTC drugs) of elderly patients. These data are analysed for the distribution of several variables, such as concomitant use of several medications of the same therapeutic class. As an example, about 15 per cent of NSAIDs users also use aspirin, exposing themselves to increased risk for gastrointestinal effects. These studies illustrate the use of drug dispensing databases in monitoring populations at risk and assessing treatment quality.","2579":"In recent years, endothelial dysfunction and arterial remodelling in various cardiovascular diseases have emerged as two key concepts, with numerous interrelationships. Both endothelial dysfunction and arterial remodelling occur in various pathologies including heart failure, atherosclerosis, restenosis after angioplasty, and pulmonary hypertension, and have modified the therapeutic approach by offering new pharmacological targets: specific receptors not only at the site of the vascular smooth muscle cells but also on the endothelial cells, growth factors that stimulate proliferation of smooth muscle, and receptors and enzymes of the extracellular matrix. Among the various substances under research, the present review will discuss angiotensin II receptor antagonists, endothelin receptor antagonists, nitrates-NO donors, potassium channel activators, and substances interfering with proteoglycans and other components of the extracellular matrix.","2580":"The dosage of drugs which might be used in children must be determined to avoid empirical use, even when no application has been submitted for a paediatric licence. Toxicological evaluation and assessment of the effects on growth, an adapted pharmaceutical form and paediatric pharmacokinetic and adult clinical data are essential before conducting trials designed to determine the paediatric dosage. The dose used during preliminary studies is extrapolated from the adult dose expressed in relation to weight, tested in a dose-effect study, and then more accurately defined on the basis of pharmacokinetic data in different age groups. Obtaining consent from both parents for studies whose direct benefit is not always obvious, as well as the global cost of these studies, constitute drawbacks to paediatric drug development. Incentives to determine a paediatric dosage could consist of public participation in funding, prolongation of the patent, and granting an advantageous price for a specifically paediatric pharmaceutical form or indication.","2581":"Do pharmacological models have a future? This was the question that had to be answered during seminar n.3 of the annual clinical pharmacology meeting in GIENS. The concept of 'model' is very extensive: it comprises both simple physiological testing and the replication in animals of human diseases. The main problems of pharmacological models are their predictive value and their validity in relation to the pragmatic target of finding new active molecules. Among numerous models proposed by the participants, three types have been selected as examples in this paper: a human model (cholecystokinin inducing panic attacks), the goal of which is to discover new molecules active in panic disorders. an animal model close to clinical features (coronary restenosis) which was to date unable to help in identifying molecules acting in human pathology transgenic animals as tools in drug development. The guidelines are very clear: models, however far they are from human pathology, are useful in predicting new molecular developments. Models are necessary steps to go from receptors to ill patients.","2582":"This paper considers the prerequisites for gene therapy. This new field of therapeutics has not yet proved its efficacity nor its safety. Use, as a drug of DNA molecules which can modify host genome and environment as well requires specific prerequisites; among them, animal experimental models are essential despite their limitations. The different preclinical and clinical steps in the design of gene therapy studies are also discussed.","2583":"In a workshop held in Giens in September 1994, representatives of drug companies and scientists met to discuss the place of women in clinical trials. They recommend that, in phase II and III studies, men and women should be included in a proportion equivalent to that observed for the condition studied. They also recommend that the impact of the gender on the results should be systematically studied.","2584":"The overall effect of antihypertensive drug treatment has been well documented. The proportion of patients who benefit varies according to their baseline cardiovascular risk, and is small for the majority of people treated. Some investigators propose limiting the treatment target population to patients at high cardiovascular risk, but several assumptions must be made to justify this procedure. The INDANA project is a meta-analysis based on individual patient data, and thus offers the opportunity to check the validity of these assumptions. Its main objective is to identify responders (and non-responders) in the drug treatment of hypertension. The rationale and methods for such an approach are presented here, with the solution for some technical problems. The conclusion of the data collection has shown that the project is feasible. The results of the main analysis should be available in 1996, and should contribute to the selection of responders and to the individualization of the treatment of hypertension.","2585":"In this paper we shall present the general principles of meta-analysis and will then discuss the various factors needed to evaluate a meta-analysis: description of the problem; definition of the outcome(s) (primary and secondary); methods for identifying and selecting trials for inclusion; statistical methods used; and the presentation and discussion of the results. We shall then examine other problems such as the detection of bias, the validity of the information provided by the meta-analysis, the problem of heterogeneity, the sensitivity and robustness of the meta-analysis, quality criteria for a meta-analysis, and how to locate published meta-analyses. Finally we present a decision algorithm which should help answer the question: should and can the results from the meta-analysis be integrated into clinical practice?","2586":"This review describes recent advances in our understanding of the pharmacology of excitatory amino acid receptors, and the application of this knowledge to the unravelling of the aetiology of neurodegenerative diseases, and to their therapy. Ionotropic excitatory amino acid receptors can be divided into two large families, the NMDA receptor family, and the AMPA\/kainate receptor family. Receptor cloning studies have shown there to be a large number of potential subtypes of receptors in both these families. Antagonists have been developed for the NMDA receptor which can interact with at least four independent drug recognition sites on the receptor. For the AMPA\/kainate receptor, two classes of antagonist have so far been identified. Reasonably potent, selective and brain-penetrating antagonists now exist for virtually all these sites, and compounds inhibiting the release of glutamic acid presynaptically have also been identified, such as riluzole. The ability of glutamic acid to kill neurons (excitotoxicity) seems to be mediated, in most cases, by an interaction with NMDA receptors, leading to an uncontrollable rise in intracellular calcium concentrations and thence cell lysis and death. The setting-up of glutamatergic loops seems to be a key process in the maintenance, spread and amplification of neurodegenerative foci. The existence of such processes has been amply demonstrated in animal models of stroke, in which both NMDA and AMPA\/kainate receptor antagonists have neuroprotective effects. Clinical trials are underway with NMDA receptor antagonists in stroke. Excitotoxic mechanisms probably also contribute to pathology in head trauma and viral encephalopathy. Ingestion of excitatory amino acids may play a role in neurological conditions of dietary aetiology, such as neurolathyrism and domoic acid intoxication. For chronic neurodegenerative diseases, the role of excitatory amino acids is much less clear, although there is some evidence for the existence of excitotoxic mechanisms in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Evidence from animal models suggests that drugs that block glutamatergic neurotransmission might be beneficial in Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but the relevance of these animal models to the human pathology is not clear. However, preliminary clinical results suggest riluzole to be efficacious in prolonging survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and certain weak NMDA receptor antagonists are currently used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. The next few years could witness a breakthrough in the treatment of neurological conditions as drugs that interfere with glutamatergic transmission become available for clinical use.","2587":"This double-blind placebo-controlled study was designed to compare the efficacy of benazepril 10 mg (BZ 10) and the low-dose combination benazepril 5 mg\/hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg (BZ + HCTZ) on exercise blood pressure in 71 patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 95 to 114 mmHg at the end of a 2 week placebo run-in). A significant fall of systolic (SBF) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure at rest was seen after a 4-week treatment period in the two active groups (-21.9\/-10.3 mmHg with BZ 10, -19.5\/-11.2 mmHg with BZ + HCTZ) and was greater in these two groups than in the placebo group (-7.5\/-2.5 mmHg, p &lt; 0.01). For each level of the exercise test on bicycle ergometer, SBP falls seen after 1 month were significant in the two active groups (from -15 to -23 mmHg depending on the level and treatment group). The evolution of the SBP\/heart rate slope was significantly different among the two active groups in favour of the BZ 10 regimen. The exercise test proved to be a valuable tool to show any difference between two treatments with comparable efficacy on SBP\/DBP at rest.","2588":"Among the methods developed in assessing abuse liability, the behavioural and subjective effects of drugs can be recorded using the Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI) in drug-experienced subjects and normal volunteers. Sixteen healthy volunteers with no history of drug abuse participated in the study. The subjective, behavioural and physiological effects of prednisone (30 and 60 mg) were compared with those of dextroamphetamine (15 mg) and placebo in a randomized double-blind Latin square design. The self-questionnaires (ARCI, Profile of Mood States, Visual Analogue Scales and Sleep Questionnaire) were completed before, 1, 2, 4 and 8 h post single oral dosing. Results showed that subjective effects of the two studied doses of prednisone did not resemble those induced by dextroamphetamine (15 mg). These results indicate that oral single doses of prednisone do not possess amphetamine-like subjective effects in a healthy population. The well established psychostimulant effect of amphetamine have been replicated on almost all subjective assessments.","2589":"The pharmacological challenge strategy involves giving a provoking agent under controlled rules to clarify some aspect of behavioural or biological function. Various agents such as sodium lactate, carbon dioxide, caffeine, yohimbine, isoprenaline and now cholecystokinin have been used as provoking agents in healthy volunteers as well as in panic patients. Results obtained in this field are updated, with emphasis on the potential mechanisms of action. It is concluded that there may be a final pathway between carbon dioxide, sodium lactate, and cholecystokinin inducing panic attacks.","2590":null,"2591":"Studies have revealed a partial deficiency of growth hormone (GH) secretion in the elderly. Aging has a central effect on the GH secretion and probably a peripheral effect on insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) or somatomedin C through changes in body composition. Simultaneously therapeutic efficiency of recombinant GH was confirmed in adults with GH deficiency. These notions have led to some controlled trials of GH treatment in elderly. Further studies of GH replacement are needed, examining issues such as dosage, tolerance (still inadequate) and efficacy before the widespread use of GH or IGH-F 1 in the elderly is advocated.","2592":"As a group, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) rank first among commonly prescribed drugs for serious adverse reactions. We conducted a cross-sectional survey in which 1072 French general practitioners (GPs) were evaluated for their basic pharmacological knowledge and practice of NSAIDs prescription. Results suggest that GPs have insufficient pharmacological knowledge and provide inadequate management of adverse reaction risk. Well-established risk factors for serious adverse reactions, such as age, are not taken enough into account, and tolerance is not correctly monitored. Drugs allegedly protecting against peptic ulcers are frequently associated but, most of the time, without any relevant justification, such as the patient's risk level or drug's efficacy. Our findings demonstrate a need for greater information among GPs about prescription and tolerance monitoring of NSAIDs.","2593":"In order to specify the frequency and the potential consequences of drug interactions in the elderly, we retrospectively analysed 409 discharge prescriptions. The possibility of drug interactions was screened out for each prescription in the software version of the Vidal drug compendium. It appears that prescriptions are mainly adapted to the elderly with respect to posology and pharmacokinetics. Potentially dangerous drug interactions ('contraindicated' or 'unsuitable' associations) were found in 6 per cent of prescriptions; after careful assessment, this frequency decreased to less than 1 per cent. The most common orthoergic side effects were sedation (15 per cent) and hypotension (14.5 per cent). This study points out the multiplicity of criteria to be considered in order to prevent drug interactions, and the gaps in available software.","2594":"The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of potential drug interactions in primary health care. It reports the analysis of 896 prescriptions for hypertensive patients collected from 237 general practitioners. The mean number of prescribed drugs was 4.55 +\/- 2.14, and each patient received, on average, 1.92 +\/- 0.92 antihypertensive drugs. All prescriptions were compared with a French computerized database of drug interactions (Micro-Vidal). A total of 1324 cases of potential drug interactions were found related to 552 patients (61.6 pour cent). Among the most dangerous interactions, there were 26 contra-indications and 168 unsuitable drug pairs. As reported in previous studies, there was a strong correlation between the number of prescribed drugs and the number of interactions. All in all, more than 16 per cent of prescriptions contained a contra-indication or unsuitable drug association. Potential drug interactions occur at a high rate in general practice. This raises questions about the best way to improve general practitioner training and to introduce preventive measures to reduce adverse drug effects.","2595":"Elderly people are particularly at risk for drug interactions, for several reasons. They are the part of the population who consume the most drugs: over 75 years the mean number of drugs on a prescription is 5.6. As they suffer from various associated diseases, they see several medical specialists, each of them adding a new prescription to the others. Self-prescriptions complicate the problem because they are rarely mentioned. Changes in pharmacokinetics in the elderly tend to increase blood concentrations of drugs. Elderly people suffer from altered homeostatic mechanisms to compensate for adverse drug effects. As a whole, such individuals are more exposed to the side effects of drugs. The drugs most often involved in these interactions are diuretics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, benzodiazepines, antiarrhythmics, cardiac glycosides, antihypertensive drugs, oral antidiabetics and antalgics. The clinical accidents most often occurring with these drug interactions are: malaise, orthostatic hypotension, loss of conciousness, amnesia, confusion, renal insufficiency, digestive problems. Since elderly people are less likely to recover easily, this problem of drug interaction should be looked for systematically.","2596":"Situations that require the use of systemic antibiotic therapy are common and drug interactions are potentially frequent. These interactions may be deleterious and lead to reduction of therapeutic index, enhancement of toxic risk or may be favourable, with optimization of pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. The mechanisms of these interactions are discussed.","2597":"Many diabetic patients take medications which can interfere with the effect of insulin or oral antidiabetic agents. Glucocorticoid administration is not contraindicated in diabetic subjects, but it usually necessitates a pharmacotherapic adjustment. Most of the other potential diabetogenic drugs do not show evidence of any significant changes in glycaemic control in diabetic individuals; however, their prescription does require appropriate monitoring of blood glucose. Low dose combined oral contraceptives have little or no effect on blood glucose level; however, their prescription is not recommended in diabetic patients because of modifications in haemostasis and lipid metabolism. Oestrogen replacement therapy in post-menopausal women does not reduce glucose tolerance and it may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Drug interactions which induce hypoglycaemia affect mostly non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients who take sulphonylureas. Combined insulin and sulphonylurea therapy is sometimes prescribed in poorly controlled type II diabetes. The efficacy of this combination is modest compared to insulin therapy alone. The influence of human insulin on symptoms and awareness of hypoglycaemia has been debated for several years. Today, the literature survey does not really support the hypothesis that the risk of severe hypoglycaemia is increased after transferring diabetic patients from animal insulin to human insulin. Many medications induce other side effects (e.g. orthostatic hypotension, hyperkaliemia, impotence...) in patients with diabetic complications.","2598":"The mechanism of action of new antidepressants is characterized by a specific inhibition of the serotonin reuptake at synaptic level. In France, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and more recently paroxetine are extensively used. Based on a review of the literature, the authors report the interactions of these new antidepressants with psychotropic and other drugs, that are frequently associated with them. All studies report the frequent occurrence of interaction when the new serotonergic antidepressants are associated with tricyclic ones. The increase of tricyclic drug plasma levels is often high with side effects as a consequence. If the pharmacodynamic aspects of these interactions are not well known, the pharmacokinetics are easier to understand, due to the power of these new antidepressants to inhibit cytochrome P450.","2599":"","2600":"Numerous of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions with antihypertensive drugs have to be considered. In this review, interactions are analysed in the major organ sites of these interactions and in cardiovascular target sites of arterial hypertension, with respect to the major antihypertensive drugs. Many antihypertensive drugs are metabolized in the liver (calcium antagonists, liposoluble beta-blockers, and some ACE-inhibitors) via the cytochrome-oxidase system. Phenytoin, barbiturates, and rifampin can accelerate the breakdown of these drugs; conversely, cimetidine, which inhibits oxidase system, can increase antihypertensive drug levels, resulted in greater therapeutic effect. Hepatic blood flow can be modified by propranolol and nifedipine with opposite effects. When combined with nifedipine the breakdown of propranolol is accelerated because of an increase of hepatic blood flow. In the kidney, some anti-hypertensive agents interact with other cardiovascular drugs by competing for renal clearance; calcium antagonists alter the renal clearance of digoxin, but the mechanism remains unclear. In vascular muscle cells, excess vasodilatation or vasoconstriction can be observed. The combination of an alpha 1-blocking agent with a dihydropyridine can induce hypotension, which is sometimes severe. Non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are able to lessen the antihypertensive effects of beta-blockers, diuretics and ACE-inhibitors, via vascular prostaglandin inhibition. The cardiac pharmacodynamic interactions of beta-blockers and calcium antagonists, verapamil and diltiazem, at the sino-atrial node, atrio-ventricular node, conduction system and myocardium are well established and must be avoided. The main interactions with beta-blockers concern calcium antagonists, class I antiarrhythmic drugs and NSAIDs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","2601":"","2602":"The task of the Drug Interactions working party of the French Medicines Agency is to select the clinically relevant interactions. This selection is carried out on the basis of an analysis of published and unpublished observed cases (pharmacovigilance), a follow-up of interactions which could be subsequently selected in view of new data, and an update of the labelling of interactions which have been already selected. The conclusions of the working group are subjected to approval by the French Medicines Registration Committee. This leads mainly to: a harmonization of the Drug Interactions heading, in the Summary of Products Characteristics, for drugs of the same pharmacological class; the yearly publishing of an addendum to the Vidal relative to 'Drug Interactions', which reflects precisely the working group's conclusions; the acknowledgement, at Community level, of the above mentioned drug interactions labelling, i.e. clinically relevant adverse drug reactions, pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic mechanism of action (if known), recommendations (four levels), and corresponding co-prescription management, if necessary.","2603":"","2604":"Interactions of alcohol with drugs are numerous, varied sometimes with an inverse effect according to acute or chronic consumption. These interactions result from kinetic or dynamic modifications. Considering pharmacokinetics, alcohol modifies the drug bioavailability, slows down (acute alcohol toxicity) or accelerates (chronic alcoholism) its metabolism. Then the pharmacological (or toxic) activity of drugs (or their metabolites) can increase or decrease. Pharmacodynamic modifications mostly occur during acute alcohol consumption. There is only an increase in drug (or metabolite) activity when this is similar to alcohol pharmacological or toxic activity. The result of these interactions is difficult to predict. Sedative drugs and drugs with a narrow therapeutic range are especially involved.","2605":"","2606":"Preservatives and additives are needed to prepare stable solutions for injection. They may provoke physiochemical reactions when these solutions are mixed. End-products may be either inactive or toxic to the patient. Information on allowed mixtures is scarce. Compatibility analyses are difficult to perform in a short time and are usually expensive. The best way would be to inject the drugs separately with 50 or 100 ml infusions. Moreover, some laboratories supply prepared infusion solutions such as buflomedil, pefloxacine, metronidazole.","2607":"Cyclosporin A is potentiated by ketoconazole, mainly by inhibiting its P-450 dependent biotransformations. The other interest of ketoconazole is related to its antifungal effect, which is often used in immunodepressed patients. Thus for both pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic reasons, the combination of the two drugs is of interest. Another advantage is that whereas ketoconazole is a cheap drug, cyclosporin A is an expensive one, thus their combination may save a part of the cyclosporin A cost. Various questions remain to be solved: is it useful to combine in the same tablet selected amounts of the two drugs and if so in which ratio? Such a strategy supposes that intra and inter-individual variability of cyclosporin A metabolism in humans can be tightly monitored. Is it without risk to definitely inhibit some P-450 isoenzymes? Could not the expected simplification of drug dosages generate the need for more cyclosporin A blood level assays, thus leading to an additional cost?","2608":"The prevalence and severity of chronic vascular leg disease explains the necessity to clarify methods for assessing it. Today the methods are both clinical and paraclinical. Clinically, they are based on the Fontaine and Leriche classification and appearance of ischaemic pain. Paraclinically, they are measuring distal blood pressure, artery output, micro-circulation, rheology, and tissular metabolism. But this approach must be also global, assessing coronary and carotid disease. Trials methodology includes a first step of explanatory studies by paraclinical ways and lastly pragmatic efficacy and tolerability studies. We recommend an accurate selection of patients and a stratification. The disease must be stable and the treatment and diet too. The trials should be randomised vs placebo. In conclusion we propose a multiparametric classification of the disease.","2609":"Patients with chronic occlusive arterial disease of lower limbs have an excess mortality due to associated cardiovascular diseases or cancer. They also have an important morbidity with a high prevalence of coronary artery diseases and strokes. In this context, the only benefit of peripheral vasodilators devoid of any effect on morbidity and mortality, could be only on quality of life. Haemodynamic effects of these drugs have been evaluated by several reproducible techniques in order to measure the peripheral blood flow (plethysmography, 133Xe clearance, transcutaneous oxygen-pressure, electromagnetic debimetry). An increase in blood flow has been demonstrated in patients receiving pentoxifylline, naftidrofuryl, or blufomedil in phase II clinical trials using these different methods. No general haemodynamic effect has been observed with these drugs which were better denominated vaso-active drugs. However the most relevant criteria remained to confirm a clinical benefit, particularly on intermittent claudication. Number of positive clinical trials in patients with intermittent claudication have been published, but from a methodological point of view few of them were suitable and demonstrated a statistically significant benefit. Criticisms were mainly related to the type of trial (cross-over is not recommended because of the drug-period effect), the lack of 'intention to treat' analysis, the inhomogeneity of the compared groups (for example different percentages of diabetics and excess of drop-outs). In spite of an established haemodynamic effect and of a demonstrated benefit in claudicants, peripheral vasodilators appear to have a slight interest in the global care of patients with occlusive arterial disease of lower limbs mainly on functional symptoms.","2610":"","2611":"","2612":"","2613":"","2614":"","2615":"","2616":null,"2617":"Drugs are capable of producing a wide spectrum of hair loss, ranging from barely detectable shedding to irreversible baldness. Drug-induced alopecia is usually described as a diffuse non-scarring alopecia which is reversible upon withdrawal of the drug. Only a few drugs (mainly antimitotic agents) routinely cause hair loss whereas many drugs may be the cause of isolated cases of alopecia. Some psychotropic drugs are likely to induce a drug-related alopecia. Case reports with tricyclic antidepressants rarely appear in the literature. It has been reported that 15 per cent of patients taking lithium developed hair thinning. Hair loss is reported secondary to some anticonvulsant agents mainly valproic acid. Among antihypertensive drugs, systemic or topic beta-adrenoceptor antagonists should be considered as possible  causes of hair loss. Hair loss from salicylates or nonsteroidal analgesics occurs in a very small percentage of patients. All anticoagulant and antithyroid drugs can produce hair loss. Diffuse hair loss can also be associated with the use of oral contraceptives, while receiving the pill and after stopping the drug. There is a long list of drugs that on occasion have been cited as causing hair loss: cimetidine, retinoids, amphetamines, bromocriptine and levodopa. A few isolated cases have been reported with some hypocholesterolaemic or anti-infectious agents. Diagnosis of drug-induced alopecia remains difficult. The only way to confirm it is to see if an improvement occurs after cessation of the suspected drug. This side effect must be recognized because it may be a source of poor compliance in some patients.","2618":"The pharmacokinetics of Ginkgolide A, Ginkgolide B and Bilobalide, which are compounds extracted from the dried leaves of the Ginkgo biloba tree, were investigated in 12 young healthy volunteers (six men and six women; mean +\/- SD age = 25 +\/- 5 years) after single-dose administration of Ginkgo biloba extract. Subjects were given, on three occasions, Ginkgo biloba extract as a solution either orally (in fasting conditions and after a standard meal) or intravenously; corresponding to single doses of Ginkgolide A, Ginkgolide B and Bilobalide ranging from 0.90 mg to 3.36 mg. After each dosing, blood and urine samples were collected for up to 36 h and 48 h, for measurements of Ginkgolide A, Ginkgolide B and Bilobalide. Plasma and urine concentrations of these compounds were quantitatively measured by gas chromatography\/mass spectrometry using negative chemical ionization, by applying a very sensitive method which allowed plasma concentrations as low as 0.2 ng\/ml of each compound to be measured. When given orally, while fasting, the extents of bioavailability are high, as shown by bioavailability coefficients (FAUC) mean (+\/- SD) values equal to 0.80 (+\/- 0.09), 0.88 (+\/- 0.21) and 0.79 (+\/- 0.30) for Ginkgolide A, Ginkgolide B and Bilobalide respectively. Food intake does not change AUC quantitatively but increases Tmax. For the three compounds of interest, after oral dosing while fasting, differences can be noted for the elimination half-lives (T1\/2Z), which exhibit mean values equal to 4.50, 10.57 and 3.21 h, as well as mean residence times (MRT), equal to 5.86, 11.25 and 4.89 h, for Ginkgolide A, Ginkgolide B and Bilobalide respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","2619":"The lipophilicity of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) available in France has been compared using two complementary methods. Studies have been performed both on active ACE-I and prodrugs. The first study used reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in order to measure the n-octanol water partition coefficients. They were measured at 3 pH values (2.5, 4.7 and 7.4). The second study was performed on the basis of computer drawn chemical formula. The lipophilic area to hydrophilic area ratio was calculated from the three dimensional structure of each ACE-I. A calculated n-octanol water partition coefficient was then determined. Whatever the method, a broad range of values was seen. The HPLC n-octanol water partition coefficient ranged from -1.86 (captopril) to 1.02 (trandolaprilate). The lipophilic to hydrophilic ratio ranged from 1.33 (captopril) to 2.74 (trandolaprilate) and the computer determined n-octanol water partition coefficient ranged from -0.36 (perindoprilate) to 0.69 (quinaprilate). A strong correlation (r = 0.97 p = 0.0001) was found between the lipophilic\/hydrophilic area ratio and the HPLC partition coefficient. The classification of the ACE-I was very close whatever the mode of determination. The less lipophilic ACE-I are lisinopril and captopril and the most lipophilic are quinalapril and trandolapril. Clinical consequences of such differences remain unknown.","2620":"Silent myocardial ischaemia is the most frequent consequence of coronary artery disease and occurs in almost 70 per cent to 80 per cent of ischaemic episodes. In some studies, it has some predictive value of cardiovascular events either in stable or unstable angina or after myocardial infarction. In this last case, one year mortality is 30 per cent and 11 per cent respectively with and without silent ischaemia that has been recorded on the 8th day after myocardial infarction. This review has focused on controlled studies in patients with angina and Holter recorded ischaemia. Nitrates are very likely to be active substances on Holter recorded angina but no controlled studies have been performed to really demonstrate it. The efficacy of beta-blocking agents is well established with a 60 per cent reduction in the number of ischaemic events and a 80 per cent reduction in total ischaemic duration. Nifedipine efficacy appears lower than that of beta-blockers with an evaluated mean reduction of 39 per cent for the number of events and of 43 per cent for duration of episodes. Diltiazem induces a 48 per cent reduction of both ischaemic parameters. For drug associations, addition of a calcium antagonist to a beta-blocking agent provides only little benefit. The relationship between anti-ischaemic efficacy and long term prevention of cardiovascular events remains to be established for a given anti-ischaemic therapy.","2621":"Each year, Royat (Auvergne) receives about 20,000 patients (80 per cent with intermittent claudication), treated by thermal gas (99.5 per cent of CO2). CO2 therapy is dispensed with thermal water or with dry gas (general or local immersion and local subcutaneous injections of gas) during 3 weeks. Local vasodilator effects of CO2 have been demonstrated with several methods in Royat. Physiological and therapeutic effects of thermal CO2 therapy, also used in Germany and Central Europe, were precisely reported during the Consensus Congress of Fribourg in Brisgau (1989); more particularly, this treatment seems provide a reduced ability of haemoglobin to fix oxygen, and therefore a release of oxygen within the cells. Patients with peripheral arterial disease (stage 2) have a walking distance increased and post-exercise ankles' pressures improved after a thermal course of treatment in Royat, while a control group has no significant changes. The discussion will concern also the socio-economic aspects of thermal treatment of arterial diseases.","2622":"The lack of knowledge of the origin of venous thrombosis (VT) causes frustration and distress to the clinician. Some results published in the literature suggest a lot of potential aetiologies. Anyhow, we are far from getting a proof that a systematic and exhaustive search for a potential cause, for instance impairment of blood coagulation or infraclinical cancer, could be of benefit for the patient and could present a good cost\/efficacy ratio. Consensus recommendations limit the extent of blood coagulation studies only to some precise clinical situations. New biological data evidencing a resistance to activated C protein in 20 to 50 per cent of VT cases, will likely bring new rules. As far as infraclinical cancers are concerned and whether their relationship to idiopathic VT is well-established, it is still doubtful that such systematic heavy and expensive checking up could be of any benefit.","2623":"Dihydropyridines are the most numerous available calcium antagonists. While belonging to the same group these drugs have physical, chemical, pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties which are sometimes specific and can explain differences in the targets and the vascular selectivity. These properties can be related to lipophilic or hydrophilic characteristics, existence or lack of 'use-dependence', possible liaison to membrane phospholipids, and differences in elimination half lives. Selectivity of dihydropyridines also depends on the nature of the target structure (amount of intra-cellular calcium storage and mechanism of its release, electrophysiological properties of these cells) and of its pathological state (atherosclerosis and\/or hypertension). Some of these properties could explain the anti-atherogenic effects, myocardial impact, cerebral and renal vascular flow and action in some pathological situations (Raynaud's syndrome, chronic arteriopathy, migraine...). A better knowledge of these different properties could lead to a more accurate choice of the drugs and to a decrease in the incidence of their side effects.","2624":"Physiological and pathological effects of kinins result from the activation of specific receptors which are present in various organs. Kinin receptors have been characterized through studies on isolated organs in vitro and have been classified as B1 and B2. A careful analysis of B2 receptors led to the identification of two subtypes, namely B2rb (in the rabbit) and B2gp (in the guinea-pig). The distinction between B2rb and B2gp receptors is primarily based on differences in the activities of selective agonists and particularly on differences in affinities of competitive antagonists, namely DArg[Hyp3,DPhe7,Leu8]BK and the non-peptide compound, WIN 64338. The non-competitive antagonist, HOE 140, has shown the same affinity on B2rb and B2gp. The potential role of B1 and B2 receptors in physiopathology is analysed on data obtained with specific and selective antagonists of the B1 (desArg9[Leu8]BK) and B2 (HOE140) receptors. The therapeutic potential of endogenous kinins as mediators of the therapeutic beneficial effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or the potential of the use of exogenous kinins in the vascular permeability are discussed together with the therapeutic potential of B1 and B2 receptor antagonists.","2625":"Drug utility in the treatment of intermittent claudication is controversial, mainly because of data heterogeneity and not too obvious benefit in the clinical trials. Pentoxifylline is the world's largest prescribed drug for intermittent claudication. In an attempt to define its benefit in the global care of the claudicants, we have analysed all the randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trials listed from the international data-bases. Methodology of these trials have been compared with the European and FDA guidelines. In this respect, the 3 best suitable studies are consistent with one other and with a statistical benefit of pentoxifylline on the claudication distances. Although this effect is not truly predictive of the long term benefit-risk ratio of the drug, it seems clinically useful, especially when considering stable patients and when using the drug after previous physical training.","2626":"The authors reviewed the drug side effects observed in their ward during the 5 last years (1988-92). These alleged effects occurred at a very low incidence, 3 per cent, (116 cases on 3809 hospitalizations). As mentioned in the literature, the occurrence was higher in females (60 per cent), than in males. The age seemed not to be a risk factor in that population, the mean age being 44 for the men and 45 for the women. All side effects disappeared after decreasing or stopping the suspected drug. In 6 cases the suspected drug was not a psychotropic agent. The authors presented some of the more often reported cases, and some of the more recently known, such as extrapyramidal side effects with antidepressants, increase of the libido with serotonergic antidepressants. The problem fo polytherapy is discussed. In half (59\/116) of the cases there was a psychotropic association. The side effect may be due to a pharmacokinetic interaction in 16 cases, either with enzymatic inhibitors like dextropropoxyphene, valpromide, valproic acid, fluvoxamine and fluoxetine, or with enzymatic inducers like carbamazepine. The authors compared the side effects of the antidepressants mainly used in their ward (amitriptyline, clomipramine, fluvoxamine and fluoxetine).","2627":"In 1983, the risk of developing severe shock during anaesthesia was estimated to be 1 case in 4600 procedures with an associated mortality rate of 6 per cent. The incidence of severe accidents has further increased since this time. This review focuses on the aspects of anaphylactoid shock (AS) in the context of iatrogenic responsibility involving drugs or substances used during anaesthesia or placed in contact with viscera. The elements predictive of anaphylactoid shock are described together with the arguments involved in a biochemical conception and a physiological conception. The authors emphasize the importance of the operative report and anaesthetic sheet to retrospectively establish the chronology of the events and to facilitate the allergologic work-up. The treatment of AS is an emergency. The therapeutic protocol is relatively well defined and, in addition to IV fluids, adrenalin is the drug of choice during the acute phase of AS. The therapeutic approach to certain particular cases is discussed and future therapeutic concepts are proposed. The aetiological agents of AS are discussed together with their respective frequencies in the specific case of the anaphylaxis reaction. Muscle relaxants are the leading cause of anaphylaxis (70 per cent of cases), especially suxamethonium, vecuronium and atracurium (43 per cent, 33 per cent and 6.8 per cent of cases, respectively). Latex present in various materials, especially surgical gloves, has become the most disturbing substance, responsible for 0.5 per cent of AS in 1989 vs 12.5 per cent of cases in 1991. Hypnotic drugs, although very widely used, are much more rarely incriminated.","2628":"Vitamin B1, B6 and B12 are frequently prescribed in rheumatic diseases as analgesic drugs. If some fundamental data suggest their analgesic potential, especially in animal models, there are very few clinical trials in human demonstrating their efficacy in rheumatology. Looking at these data from the literature, we should reconsider our prescription of vitamin B.","2629":"SR 48692 is the first non-peptide antagonist of neurotensin receptors. It is potent and selective vs the high-affinity binding sites and with a small activity on the levocabastine-sensitive binding sites. It is active on several species including man without partial agonist properties. In vivo, it is active by oral route with a long duration of action and it is able to cross the blood-brain barrier. As an antagonist of neurotensin receptors, SR 48692 modulates central dopaminergic neurons. Thus it might be considered as a good tool for investigating the pathophysiological role of neurotensin in psychiatric diseases.","2630":"Thirty healthy volunteers received piretanide SR 6 mg\/day (n = 15) or placebo (n = 15) in a 10-day double-blind parallel-group comparative trial. 24-h urine output was significantly greater with piretanide than with placebo on D1 (1919 +\/- 434 ml and 1160 +\/- 335 ml respectively, p = 0.001 one-sided) as on D10 (1563 +\/- 538 ml and 1236 +\/- 435 ml respectively, p = 0.04 one-sided). Nevertheless the evolution of urinary output from D1 to D10 was significantly different (p = 0.008): it remained stable with placebo but diminished with piretanide. The diuretic effect of piretanide was apparent with a supplementary miction between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. both on D1 and D10. Between 4 p.m. and 8 a.m., the number of mictions was the same in both groups. Thus piretanide SR 6 mg has a mild effect on the number of mictions; it should not alter patients' well-being.","2631":"We performed a survey to assess the feasibility of a placebo-controlled clinical trial of the treatment of recurrent ENT\/respiratory tract infections in children, to assess the diversity of the drugs prescribed, and the acceptability of a clinical trial to homeopathic physicians. A mailed questionnaire was sent to 237 homeopathic physicians, asking for details of prescriptions for 10 consecutive children consulting for ENT\/respiratory recurrent infections, and for two simulated cases. We also asked for their opinion about homeopathic treatment evaluation. Only 48 (20 per cent) questionnaires were returned completed. These gave 309 different acute treatments and 422 different preventive treatments for the 10 consecutive patients and 87 different prescriptions for the simulated cases. A total of 467 different drugs were used. The physicians who replied were favourable to the evaluation of homeopathic drugs, reluctant for the use of a placebo; and they would like to receive training in drug evaluation. Setting up a clinical trial in this field would require specific methodological and logistical adaptations, and a detailed training programme for the homeopathic doctors beforehand.","2632":"46 general practitioners of the vicinity of Nancy carried out a randomised, parallel and double blind study comparing the efficacity and the tolerance of two drugs: roxithromycin (Rulid) 300 mg per day, and minocycline (Mynocine) 100 mg per day in the treatment of adult acute bronchitis, in clinical practice. 124 patients were included from January 1992 to June 1992. Efficacy of the treatment was estimated by both practitioners and patients to be good and excellent at the same time in 90 to 95 per cent of cases, in the two groups. Clinical tolerance was estimated to be excellent (90 per cent of cases) in the two groups. Roxithromycine and minocycline are effective and well tolerated in the treatment of adults acute bronchitis in clinical practice. Among the two drugs, we prefer to use minocycline because it is 2.5 to 5 times less expensive than roxithromycine.","2633":"","2634":"","2635":"","2636":"","2637":"","2638":"","2639":"","2640":"","2641":"","2642":"","2643":"","2644":"Polytherapy is often used in clinical practice. The drug associations may lead to pharmacokinetic and\/or pharmacodynamic interactions, with clinical implications. The authors reported a quantified illustration of 2 types of interactions in a depressed patient: between antidepressants, amitriptyline and fluoxetine, between these antidepressants and antituberculosis. Firstly, when fluoxetine was added to amitriptyline, it was observed, as expected, an increase of the tricyclic and its metabolite plasma levels, despite a decrease of its dosage. Secondly, when antituberculosis were added to the 2 antidepressants, it was observed a decrease of the tricyclic drug plasma levels. These levels remained below the therapeutic window even when the tricyclic antidepressant dosage was increased. It seems that the fluoxetine interaction disappeared. The competition between the inhibitory effect of fluoxetine and the induction of rifampicin, on the metabolism of amitriptyline is discussed.","2645":"Several drugs and environmental pollutants can cross the blood-brain barrier and reach the brain. This organ possesses an enzymatic equipment able to metabolize xenobiotics, therefore facilitating their elimination and maintaining brain homeostasis. This metabolism may result in the formation of toxic metabolites, which endanger neuronal integrity and may result in neurological disturbances. The main function of the conjugation enzymes present in the brain parenchyma and blood-brain or blood-cerebrospinal fluid interfaces is the detoxification of these reactive molecules, thus protecting the central nervous system. This review presents the main cerebral conjugating enzymes, and shows the interest for the design of new drugs of the knowledge of their activities.","2646":"Pregnancy is a specific dynamic state and the potential usefulness of caring for a fetal and\/or adjacent disorder by treating the mother is now well established. Pregnant women being excluded from the investigational field of clinical trials, only few studies exist concerning evaluation of the pregestational metabolism or transplacental transfer (TPT) of drugs. Questions are extensive and complex. Does TPT occur at a given gestational age (GA), in the context of a particular type of pathology, when a drug is administered by a certain dosage regimen? If this is the case, what is the rapidity of penetration of the products of conception by the drug (bearing in mind its physical-chemical characteristics)? Need harmful adverse effects on the child be feared? Is such penetration desirable, of no consequence or dangerous? Does the possibility exist of accumulation in the placenta, fetal tissue or amniotic fluid? Should such findings modify the therapeutic regimens of drugs given to expectant mothers? After dealing with the ethical and physiological context in which such research is undertaken, the authors review methods for the study of TPT developed both in vitro and in vivo. The current review covers the period between 1972 and 1993. Exchange mechanisms are complicated and models developed in vitro only partially reflect the actual equilibria which develop. These include: 1) the perfused cotyledon model, which while simple, elegant and inexpensive, offers only a localized and fixed view of pregnancy; 2) the necessary study, using microsomes, of placental metabolic capacity (enzyme cartography). In vivo study of TPT is based upon various multicompartmental pharmacokinetic models, some of which have been relatively validated in animals. The simplest indicator for the in vivo evaluation of TPT of a drug in the human species is determination of a feto-maternal blood concentrations ratio (usually performed at the time of separation). The usefulness and limitations of this parameter are controversial, and it would seem preferable to associate it with a kinetic profile of variations in blood concentrations established in the mother. Any extrapolation of a single result to fetal and adjacent tissues must be done with the greatest caution. Study of the TPT of therapeutically useful agents is essential to the understanding of their metabolism and is a prerequisite to the use of medications during pregnancy, bearing in mind that any such use must always be with the greatest care and with extremely well-founded indications.","2647":"","2648":"","2649":"","2650":"","2651":"","2652":"","2653":"","2654":"","2655":"","2656":"","2657":"","2658":"","2659":"","2660":"","2661":"","2662":"The new module of Theriaque data base deals with side effects of drugs.

However, it decreases when the Regional Pharmacovigilance Centre sends informations to the prescribers. In the University Hospital, the regional pharmacovigilance centre is the more used source of drug information by residents.

There were 9 healthy babies, one spontaneous abortion (the woman had an uterine malformation) and one infant with multiple malformations (but the mother was not treated with mesalazine during organogenesis). Because of the relatively small number of pregnancies exposed to mesalazine (Pentasa) in this study, these data need to be confirmed by other studies.","2666":"During a five year period (1988-1992) 70 cases of seizures were collected by the Adverse Drug Reaction Monitoring Center of Clermont-Ferrand (3.58% of total collected cases). 31 cases (22 M and 9 F) occurred after a drug withdrawal. Benzodiazepines--either alone or in association--were the most often involved. Mean age was 48.8 +\/- 2.6 years in this group and additional factors (alcohol abuse and\/or association of drugs that lower the seizure threshold) were associated in 26 cases. 39 cases (14 M and 25 F) occurred on the course of various treatments. The most frequently involved drugs were neuropsychiatric, antiinfectious (especially beta-lactam antibiotics, fluorquinolones and isoniazid) and theophylline. Mean age was 56.5 +\/- 3.8 years and additional different factors (high dosages, antecedents of epilepsy, underlying diseases) were present in 22 observations.","2667":"Central neurological diseases caused by beta-lactamins are usually associated with excessive dosages in patients with renal failure. Two case reports of convulsive encephalopathy in patients treated with ceftazidime, show the absolute necessity of adapted posology, in case of renal dysfunction.

The non-respect for the methods of prescription of bepridil leads to serious trouble in the rate of heartbeat and can threaten vital prognosis. So, it is advisable for the practicians to be warmly and precisely informed and prescribe another anti-angina-pectoris treatment in high risk-patients.","2669":"The evaluation of the rate of gastroduodenal toxicity of anti inflammatory drugs is a difficult problem. We tried to analyse that question by studying the general endoscopic registers of the Gastro-Enterologic department of the hospital. This retrospective study concerns 2,945 endoscopies performed during the year 1988 and 1992 randomly chosen among the last 5 years. 992 results show injuries suggestive of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAID) toxicity, however only in 65 cases the potential role of an anti inflammatory drug is mentioned: 36 men and 29 women, mean age: 50.6 +\/- 19.6 years. Concerning the drugs, only the pharmacological classes they belong to are mentioned except for Aspirin. Acetyl salicylate acid 7 cases, NSAIDS 36 and Steroids 22. In the drug group 63% of injuries are located to the stomach (ulcers 13%, gastritis 50%), 37% to the duodenum (19% ulcers, 18% duodenitis). Compared to the groups with the same kind of injuries, but without any mention of drugs, there are no statistical difference in the proportion of ulcers. Aging and sex are not influent in our results on the genesis of drug induced ulcers. These results must be discussed because a lot of datas are missing in the registers and so the number of patients taking drugs is probably underestimated. This means that unless a prospective study is held with someone enquiring for all the risk factors, the study of the general endoscopic registers is not a good way to estimate gastrointestinal damages due to drugs.","2670":"The authors present the results of a ten year retrospective analysis about amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity.

It shows three another points: pulmonary disease is more frequent during first and fourth years of amiodarone treatment, pneumopathy occurs more rapidly in patients with a previous history of pulmonary disease, and patients with amiodarone lung toxicity may have elevation in lactate dehydrogenase activity.","2671":"","2672":"","2673":"","2674":"","2675":"","2676":"","2677":"","2678":null,"2679":"Dysregulation of free radical metabolism has been supposed to be involved in schizophrenia etiopathogeny.

The study included 28 in-patients suffering from acute positive psychosis who were compared with 15 controls. We confirmed the results of Wang. We found a significantly red blood cell Super oxide dismutase increase in positive psychosis, in comparison to negative psychosis and controls (p = 0.0001). This SOD increase was in relationship with the degree of clinical psychomotor excitement. After 21 days of neuroleptic treatment, SOD activity decreased and reached standard values. These results support the hypothesis of striking relationships between catecholaminergic hyper-metabolism and SOD increase, in positive psychosis. These could account for psychotic positive symptoms improvement with neuroleptic treatment, which blocks dopamine pathways.","2680":"Colchicine has been widely used in the treatment of gout and familial mediterranean fever.

It shows evidence of the importance of various antibiotics in the etiology of pseudomembranous colitis (89% of the identified cases). The following is the list of antibiotics or antibiotic classes, in increasing order of their association with the development of pseudomembranous colitis: macrolides which are very rarely associated, a group represented by cefaclor, cefuroxime axetil and cyclins, which are rarely associated, a third group constituted by amoxicillin, ofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole which appears to be 2 to 3 times more frequently associated than the previous group, and a fourth group of antibiotics, represented by cefixime and the association amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, which is 7 times more frequently associated than antibiotics of the second group.","2683":"The pharmacokinetics of lithium in healthy volunteers receiving low doses of lithium as Lithium Oligosol by sublingual route were investigated in two randomized crossover studies (lithium vs placebo) with a two week wash-out period. In the first study, 8 volunteers received a single dose (1.68 mg) of lithium and in the second 8 another volunteers received repetitive doses of lithium (0.56 mg twice a day) during 11 days. The plasma concentration of lithium was determined by an electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry. The plasma concentrations of lithium measured during the placebo period were about 1 microgram\/L, the peak concentration was 99.4 +\/- 22.2 micrograms\/L in the single dose study and 49.6 +\/- 5.4 micrograms\/L in the multiple doses study.

End of treatment quit rates at 3 months with nicotine patch vary between 14% and 39% and one year quit rates between 9% et 26%. Studies with nasal nicotine spray give similar results but nicotine spray is less well tolerated than nicotine patch. The therapeutic effectiveness of nicotine patch seems to be insufficient and there is only one report of long term (&gt; 1 year) results which should be the main goal of treatments used in smoking cessation. A therapeutic approach with psychotropic drugs founded on a better characterization of dependent smokers' psychopathology (depression, anxiety...) may be a more promising research field.","2685":"The information on therapeutics is moving at a high path for various causes.

The aim of this study was to know if the inter-individual variations in the hepatic concentration of cytochrome P-450 3A, that metabolizes cyclosporine into several metabolites with very limited immunosuppressive activity, could be associated with cyclosporine toxicity. 59 consecutive liver transplant recipients were studied. Immunosuppression was with cyclosporine, azathioprine and methylprednisolone. The relative concentration of P-450 3A was assessed by immunoblot analysis using a specific monoclonal antibody on liver graft biopsy. Twelve patients experienced toxic neurological and renal complications. Six of these patients had cyclosporine levels in the therapeutic range. There was an excellent correlation between the occurrence of complications and cyclosporine whole blood levels (P &lt; 10(-4), the first day post-op after a standard dose of cyclosporine (1 mg\/kg). Cytochrome P-450 3A hepatic content assessed in a groups of 34 patients exhibited a 10-fold variation (m = 94 +\/- 47 AU (Arbitrary Units)\/mg). Eight of these patients who developed cyclosporine toxicity had a lower graft P-450 3A levels (m = 52 +\/- 19 AU\/mg, P = 3.10(-4), cf. patients with no toxicity). This highlights the importance of the first dose of cyclosporine and indicates that cytochrome P-450 3A can provide information which should allow individualized immunosuppression with cyclosporine maintaining therapeutic levels but avoiding toxicity in susceptible individuals.","2687":"Differences in the response of graft recipients to the immunosuppressive effect of cyclosporin A (CsA) represent a major factor of allograft acceptance. Response to CsA was investigated in vitro in 59 healthy subjects by measuring the inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production. Marked differences were found comparing individuals: 61% of the subjects responded with half inhibitory doses ID50 &lt; 200 ng\/ml (responder group), 20% with ID50 within 200-400 ng\/ml (intermediate responder) and 19% were non responder with ID50 &gt; 400 ng\/ml and sometimes over 1,000 ng\/ml. To explain these differences, the CD28-B7, co-stimulatory pathway for T-cell activation was explored since it is the only CsA-resistant pathway known so far. Both responder and non responder individuals showed increased proliferative response and IL-2 secretion by co-stimulation with CD3 and CD28, resulting in increased ID50 by a similar factor. The percentage of CD28+ cells within T-lymphocytes varied markedly among subjects (48.5 +\/- 28.9% of the CD8+ cells). However we could not correlate the inter-individual variation of sensitivity to CsA to the size of the CD8+CD28+ T cell subset nor to divergent response to CD3 and CD28 co-stimulation.","2688":"","2689":"","2690":"","2691":"","2692":"","2693":"","2694":"Several studies have suggested that beta-blockade could provide functional benefit in heart failure, suggesting a deleterious role for the compensatory sympathetic stimulation. Beta-blockade induced benefit could result from either antagonism of any myocardial beta-adrenergic stimulation or on the opposite a paradoxical cardiac beta-adrenergic responsiveness secondary to beta-adrenergic receptor up-regulation. Two recently completed large scale multicentric placebo controlled studies, the MDC trial with metoprolol and CIBIS with bisoprolol, have confirmed that beta-blockade could functionally improve patients with heart failure. The observed survival improvement in non ischemic patients was observed only in the CIBIS trial. Such a result must be confirmed with additional studies.","2695":"Several controlled studies with the best methodology had showed that digoxin improves the symptoms of patients with chronic heart failure and sinus rhythm, whose ventricular systolic function is impaired. The Proved and Radiance studies show that in patients receiving diuretics and digoxin, or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, diuretics and digoxin, the withdrawal of digoxin results in clinical deterioration and worsening of exercise tolerance. In addition to an inotropic action, digitalis exerts effects in the neurocardiovascular axis, produces reduction in plasma norepinephrine, renin, aldosterone, vasopressin activity and restores a more normal sympathetic-parasympathetic autonomic balance and baroreceptor function. ACE inhibitors reduce mortality, improve symptoms and exercise tolerance in patients with chronic heart failure in class IV (Consensus I trial), in class II and III (SOLVD, treatment trial) and prevent the development of heart failure in asymptomatic patients with ejection fraction &lt; 35% (SOLVD, prevention trial). When ACE inhibitors are administered per os, more than 3 days after acute myocardial infarction they reduce mortality, severe heart failure, re-hospitalization, and induce an unexpected reduction of recurrent myocardial infarction (SAVE trial). However, the early administration, within 2 hours after the onset of chest pain, of ACE inhibitors by intravenous infusion, does not improve survival; the hypotension may be responsible of increased mortality (Consensus II trial).","2696":"Antiarrhythmic drugs (AA) are useful in some critical situations but their use remains questionable. Evaluation of their efficacy and possible side effects required accurate knowledge of various methods. ECG gives relevant informations on the conduction intervals alterations caused by AA. Holter monitoring allows evaluation of the efficacy and\/or proarrhythmic effects throughout 24-48 hour periods provided that spontaneous variability is taken into account. Ambulatory sequential loop ECG allows a longer monitoring of treatment in patients with symptomatic arrhythmias. Provocative electrophysiological testings give good evaluation of AA efficacy in some supraventricular or ventricular arrhythymias but predictivity of efficacy or proarrhythmic effects is sometimes problematical. Use of effort testing is limited to evaluation of antiarrhythmic effects of drugs in major dysrythmias and in some frequency-dependent dysrythmias, but this technique allows also detection of proarrhythmic incidence in those extremely altered autonomic nervous system tone. Other techniques of evaluation (Signal averaged ECG, automatic implantable cardiovecter defibrillator with holter monitoring, drug plasma concentration monitoring) are still under discussion.","2697":"Quality of care assessment is based on three main prerequisites: to describe precisely patients or case-mix, to measure the level of care, to evaluate the outcomes and finally to consider the relationships between these parameters. Indicators to measure the level of nurses' workload have been developed from different concepts and methodologies: The range of nurses' activities is very wide, such as cares achieved in the presence of patient, cares achieved after medical prescription or specific nurse cares, administrative tasks, research activities, etc. Indicators may take into account a more or less important part of this field, but most of them are usually focused on patient's care. The value of each parameter may be a calculated coefficient or a time unit. If one considers the time as the best unit to measure the intensity of work, it is also an underlying concept to differentiate the actual time, obtained by timing, from the required time, necessary to achieve correctly the action. In the same way, required cares are also the best to consider. Indeed measuring required time for required cares is necessary to reach quality aim. The nurses' workload may be directly calculated with a specific indicator or indirectly estimated from a severity or disability scoring system. The selection of the indicator depends of the purpose of the evaluation process. If the question is to improve and develop quality of care and professional practices, the indicator has to take into account the required cares. The PRN system (Project de Recherche en Nursing) developed in Canada is probably the reference indicator.

It's a good evaluation method for the topics where there are non medical sides, inappropriate medical options or different clinical practices in spite of sufficient scientific datas. Consensus conference use three distinct groups: organization committee, jury and experts. The lectures of the experts and the guidelines must distinguish and clarify which is scientifically proved. Use of biomedical databases and critical analysis of biomedical articles are useful. Practice guidelines must be clear, precise, explicit and useful for clinical practices. Measurement of the real usefulness of consensus conference is difficult: it's the problem of the impact of guidelines on care. Usually it could be realized by survey of clinical practices or drugs consuming. The impact will be better with a large use of media, dissemination of the guidelines in the medical faculties and during professional workshops.","2700":"Scoring systems give a check-list and methodological informations which have to be found in controlled therapeutic trials reports and papers. These systems try to quantify each item to give a global score. The Chalmer's list is the most wellknown. It allows a balance in scoring taking in account the quality of the endpoints. Other lists are more simple. Many check-lists allow the scoring of the methodological design or the statistical analysis. In all systems the major methodological points are: the randomization, the description of the population, the double blind, the estimation of the sample size, the handling of withdrawal and drop out, the major endpoint, the patients follow-up, the statistical analysis and the data presentation. All these scoring systems have several limits: the quantitative evaluation of each item is subjective and the point scoring has never been validated, some scoring systems are old and don't integrate new methodological methods, the scores never included the clinical interest of the trial, some items are questionable, others are forgotten (intention to treat analysis, steering comity...). Scoring systems allow a control of the methodological quality of clinical trials but don't include the clinical or scientific interest of the study. These systems are a useful methodological tool for publication process in medical journals and for new drugs authorization.

Among serious side effects, 3 toxic epidermal necrolysis (2 with cotrimoxazole), 16 pseudomembranous colitis (11 with beta-lactam antibiotics, 4 with macrolides and lincomycines and 1 with vancomycin), 14 neuropsychiatric reactions (seizures, confusions and hallucinations with beta-lactam antibiotics and fluoroquinolones) were notified. Five antibiotic-induced side effects led to the death.","2728":"The Pharmacovigilance and Poisons Center in Lyon undertook an analysis of their data on antidepressant (MAOI excluded) exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. From 1986 to 1991, 151 prospective enquiries were collected of which 145 exposures occurred during the first trimester of pregnancy. The outcome of pregnancy was known for 114 of these cases. Voluntary or medical abortion was decided in 24 cases, spontaneous abortion occurred in 11 patients and fetal death, unrelated to drug exposure, was noted in one case. Delivery was reported in 78 cases including 69 (88.5%) normal infants, with obstetrical complications not related to the treatment in 7 of these cases. Neonatal complications were noted in 5 (6.4%) cases, including withdrawal symptoms possibly related to the treatment in 3 cases. Congenital abnormalities were identified in 4 cases (5.1%) with one case of major malformation (membranous ventricular septal defect). Such a study is not an exhaustive survey of antidepressant exposure during pregnancy, but a collection of inquiries received by our centre. Even though our study's ability to detect an overall increase in the risk of malformations is too low and limited the extent of our conclusion, our results are in agreement with the literature data as no important increased in major birth defect was observed.","2729":"Although comparison with a placebo is necessary to demonstrate the \"true\" effect of a drug, neonatologists are usually reluctant to use a placebo. The reason given is the lack of placebo effect in neonates. We studied heart and respiration rates and behaviour in normal neonates during heelstick for diagnosis of phenylketonuria. In this open randomized study we compared no treatment with an \"analgesic\" treatment consisting of water and sucrose. There was no difference in heart and respiration rates and behaviour between the two groups. These results do not demonstrate a \"suggested\" placebo effect and can in part be explained by the model and tools used to measure pain. The results do not support the non-use of placebo in drug evaluation trials in children.","2730":"The consequences of sleep deprivation on vigilance and mood were evaluated in six healthy medical students the day after being on night duty and the following day, after recovering from a full night's sleep. Diurnal vigilance was studied using the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and mood was assessed on an anxiety self-evaluation scale. The study was conducted by means of a double-blind randomized trial to measure the effects of benzodiazepine (lormetazepam, 2 mg) compared to a placebo administered before the night recovery\/full night's sleep. Sleep deprivation induced a significant decrease in vigilance the day following the night duty. Sleep latencies were shortened during the morning following the night of recovery\/full night's sleep. The values obtained after administering the lormetazepam did not differ significantly from those obtained after administering the placebo. There were no considerable differences in the anxiety evaluation scores before and after the night of recovery\/full night's sleep between the two sequences of the trial. This study suggests that a significant lack of sleep (a 36-hour sleep deficit) modifies diurnal vigilance over two nyctohemeral periods. Administration of benzodiazepine with a short half-life after occasional sleep deprivation does not change the reorganization of the sleep-waking cycle.","2731":"For curative treatment of deep vein thrombosis, all trials have shown that twice a day low molecular weight heparin were at least as efficacious as unfractionated heparin on clot reduction or stabilisation. Through the unit cost of low molecular weight heparin is higher, the real cost of treatment should take into account not only the cost of the drug, but also the cost of materials used and lab tests as well as the time necessary. We have therefore prospectively compared the operating and overall costs of nadroparin and intravenous heparin treatment of deep vein thrombosis in hospitalised patients (21 with unfractionated heparin and 19 with nadroparin). The results show that low molecular weight heparin is no more expensive than treatment with unfractionated heparin (336 +\/- 74.9 F for unfractionated heparin and 344.9 +\/- 44.05 F for nadroparin). In addition, using nadroparin rather than heparin saves approximately one hour per patient per week nursing time (42 +\/- 7 minutes vs 104.0 +\/- 10.7 minutes, p &lt; 0.05). The methodology of this study should be repeated with other low molecular weight heparin and low molecular weight heparin compare not only to standard i.v. heparin, but also to standard SC heparin.","2732":"The main accusation against package inserts is that they are not understood by the patients: the vocabulary used is uncommon and the information is not always relevant. A recent European directive on package inserts for drugs concerning human use specifies the items that must be mentioned. Following this directive and regarding patient interest, a presentation for notices is proposed in which the subject headings are presented as questions and the text is a guide to drug practical use to provide the elements of surveillance. A summarized version added to this detailed notice for the convenience of the patient is also proposed, which should be translated into the language of each European Community's member state.","2733":"","2734":"Serum levels of haloperidol and reduced haloperidol as well as the reduced haloperidol\/haloperidol ratios were determined in nine acute schizophrenics on oral haloperidol medication and correlated over 21 days with psycho pathology and extra-pyramidal symptom scores. We have investigated red blood cells haloperidol reductase activity in the group of patients. Significant correlations were found between haloperidol plasma levels and positive sub scale for each patient (r = 0.86 and p &lt; 0.01; r = 0.70 and p &lt; 0.05). We found a correlation between red blood cells reductase activity and the improvement of the psychotic anxiety scale (r = 0.64\/and p &lt; 0.05; r = 0.67 and p &lt; 0.05), but not with reduced haloperidol\/haloperidol ratios in plasma. The knowledge of reductase activity could predict the treatment response in acute schizophrenic patients. We suggest that the reported inter individual and inter ethnic differences in haloperidol and reduced haloperidol and in clinical response and adverse effects may be a reflection of genetic control of the two oxidative pathways mediated by cytochrome P450 isozyme and\/or the reductase pathway mediated by haloperidol reductase in individual subject.","2735":"","2736":"","2737":"","2738":"","2739":"","2740":"","2741":"","2742":"","2743":"","2744":"Cefixime is an orally administered cephalosporin with physicochemical properties able to account for a possibly significant biliary excretion. In addition, over 50% of total clearance of the drug has been shown to operate through extra renal pathways in healthy volunteers. The aim of the study was to quantify and to delineate the kinetics of cefixime biliary elimination in ten patients provided with external drainage. Following a single 200 mg oral dose of cefixime, biliary clearance of the drug appears to vary from 0.85 to 27.3 ml\/min. Contribution of the latter to the apparent total clearance is relatively low since ranging from 0.8 to 18.6% (mean 5%). Additionally, biliary clearance kinetics of the drug proves non linear and well described according to a sigmoidal model. On account of these results, and given the dianionic charge of the molecule as well as the absence of any metabolite reported so far, an intrahepatic binding and accumulating process, mediated by ligandin, seems to underlie the hepatobiliary excretion of cefixime, as previously reported for other anionic beta-lactam antibiotics.","2745":"Using a new computer program SPHERE, amikacin concentrations have been computed at various layers of simulated endocardial vegetations. Inputs are the computed serum (central compartment) concentrations of either population pharmacokinetic models or of individualized patient-specific models utilizing Bayesian fitting to data of doses given and measured serum levels, using the USC*PACK PC Clinical Programs. The vegetation is modeled as an isotropic homogeneous sphere. Fick's second law of radial diffusion was applied to compute the in situ antibiotic concentrations. Examination of factors affecting concentrations in vegetations shows that in situ peak concentrations are less when the vegetation is larger, and when the antibiotic dose, serum concentrations and diffusivity are all less. The results show that early and aggressive treatment of infectious endocarditis is required with high doses of concentration-dependent antibiotics, such as aminoglycosides, to achieve the desired high peak serum levels and to reach effective concentrations deep inside the vegetations.","2746":"Pharmacological studies revealed that SR 25776 possesses marked stimulant activity characteristic of a partial inverse agonist of benzodiazepine receptor. The effects of SR 25776 500 mg alone and in combination with triazolam 0.25 mg on psychomotor performance and memory were assessed in 8 healthy consenting male volunteers in a double-blind placebo controlled trial. Treatment effects were monitored before and two and half hours following oral medication. The present study suggest that at the studied dose SR 25776 may incompletely antagonize the sedative and amnesic effects of a benzodiazepine agonist without producing marked effects of its own.","2747":"The main objective of this multicenter study was to compare the efficacy of an increase in dose and of a synergic combination in the 68 patients out of 126 (54%) with hypertension (DBP between 95 and 120 mm Hg after 2 weeks of placebo) who did not respond (DBP &gt; or = 95 mmHg) to a 4-week treatment of 20 mg per day of lisinopril. Patients were randomized to receive a 4-week double-blind treatment of either 40 mg per day of lisinopril or the combination of 20 mg of lisinopril and 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide per day. Mean reductions of systolic (inter-group comparison: p = 0.08) and diastolic BP (p = 0.006) as well as the proportion of responders (82% versus 45%, p &lt; or = 0.01) were greater with the lisinopril-hydrochlorothiazide combination than with 40 mg of lisinopril. Tolerance was good in the 3 groups. The administration of a synergic combination is justified when hypertension is not controlled by a monotherapy.","2748":"","2749":"The interrelationships between magnesium and carbohydrate metabolism have regained considerable interest over the last few years. Insulin secretion requires magnesium: magnesium deficiency results in impaired insulin secretion while magnesium replacement restores insulin secretion. Furthermore, experimental magnesium deficiency reduces the tissues sensitivity to insulin. Subclinical magnesium deficiency is common in diabetes. It results from both insufficient magnesium intakes and increase magnesium losses, particularly in the urine. In type 2, or non-insulin-dependent, diabetes mellitus, magnesium deficiency seems to be associated with insulin resistance. Furthermore, it may participate in the pathogenesis of diabetes complications and may contribute to the increased risk of sudden death associated with diabetes. Some studies suggest that magnesium deficiency may play a role in spontaneous abortion of diabetic women, in fetal malformations and in the pathogenesis of neonatal hypocalcemia of the infants of diabetic mothers. Administration of magnesium salts to patients with type 2 diabetes tend to reduce insulin resistance. Long-term studies are needed before recommending systematic magnesium supplementation to type 2 diabetic patients with subclinical magnesium deficiency.","2750":"Immunotherapy of drug intoxications is based on intravenous administration of antibodies or antibody Fab fragments specific to a drug. Mechanism of action involves toxin complexation in the antibody distribution space resulting in a gradient efflux of the toxin from its binding site by dissociation of toxin-receptor to the vascular space. Reversal of toxic effects by specific Fab fragments has been demonstrated experimentally for digitalis, colchicine and tricyclic antidepressants. The intravenous administration of antibodies or Fab fragments alters toxin pharmacokinetics including tissular depletion, plasma redistribution and decrease of systemic clearance. Benefit of this therapy in clinical toxicology has been clearly shown for cardiac glycosides but has to be confirmed for colchicine and tricyclic antidepressants. Safety and efficacy of specific Fab fragments should permit an extension of this antidotal procedure towards other toxins.","2751":null,"2752":"The calcium antagonists (CA) which are at our disposal are a pharmacological class potentially active on the calcium homeostasis at the central nervous system level. Instead of reviewing the whole possibility of therapeutical potential targets, the authors review the 3 main possible and up-to-date impacts of these compounds: cerebral vasoactivity, neurotransmission, cell death. The actual lack of good clinical trials in those fields is stressed as well as the consequent necessity to stimulate the undertaking of such trials in humans in order to avoid to limit the use of CA in the only cardio-vascular spectrum.","2753":"Since transmembrane myocardiac calcium-exchanges play an important role in myocyte electrogenesis as well as in triggering and maintenance of some cardiac arrhythmias, it might be true that calcium antagonists possess antiarrhythmic properties. However, use of calcium antagonists as antiarrhythmic agents is only possible if the drug is devoid of sympathetic reflex stimulation and possesses use-dependence properties. These drugs are of most efficiency in cardiac arrhythmias (especially of supraventricular origin), caused by reentry phenomena in which part of the circuit is governed by calcicosodic cells. The use of calcium antagonists for ventricular arrhythmias is limited to some specific indications (idiopathic ventricular tachycardia with right bundle branch block and left axis, reperfusion arrhythmias...). Choice of the type and the route of administration of calcium antagonists has to take into account their pharmacokinetic specificities which can alter their antiarrhythmic potency.","2754":"We performed a meta-analysis on data from trials of calcium antagonist drugs in the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction. Nifedipine (9,033 patients) increased total mortality non significantly by 12% at the end of follow-up, and by 62% (p = 0.02) before 21 days, with no significant change in the risk of reinfarction. Diltiazem or verapamil did not change total mortality significantly; each of them decreased the risk of reinfarction not significantly (p = 0.06) by approximately 20%. Treatment by either diltiazem or verapamil (8,356 patients) decreased the risk of reinfarction by 21% (p = 0.009). No benefit has been demonstrated with nifedipine in the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction. Verapamil or diltiazem may be an alternative to beta-blockers when these lasts drugs are contra-indicated, although one cannot reasonably expect from the first two drugs a decrease in mortality.","2755":"Calcium antagonists share common property of blocking calcium influx and decreasing intracellular calcium in cardiac and vascular smooth muscle cells. They however differ from each other by their pharmacological properties. All calcium antagonist induce coronary and systemic vascular relaxation, thus increasing myocardial oxygen supply and decreasing myocardial oxygen demand, respectively. Only subgroups of diltiazem and verapamil, however, can exert negative chronotropic and\/or inotropic effect which contribute to a further decrease in myocardial oxygen demand. In this pharmacological context, long term clinical studies in large groups of patients show that vasospastic angina is the first choice therapeutic indication of calcium antagonists. Furthermore, stable angina is a good indication only for subgroups of diltiazem and verapamil, and unstable angina is a contra-indication for the actually known phenyldihydropyridines, thus confirming the heterogeneity of this class of drugs and probably the major role of myocardial tropism in their antiischemic properties.","2756":"Calcic ions play a role in the initial and chronic development of atherosclerosis lesions. Demonstration of anti atherogenic properties of calcium antagonists has open a new therapeutic approach of atherosclerosis and of its complications. Mechanism of protection remains unclear but it is essentially a preventive effect requiring very early administration before onset of lesions. Several experimental studies have shown that calcium antagonists could reduce cholesterol content of arterial wall without any modification of lipid plasma or profile. Several other mechanisms have been proposed but none of them can actually explain the observed preventive effect of these drugs. The clinical relevance in human of such a preventive effect of calcium antagonists requires further investigations.","2757":"The pharmacological class of calcium channel antagonists (CCA) is, with beta-adrenergic antagonists, diuretics, converting enzyme inhibitors and alpha-adrenergic antagonists, one of the first line monotherapies of essential hypertension, according to the recommendations of the \"Fifth Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of Hypertension\". CCA have several advantages for the treatment of hypertension: the blood pressure lowering effect is due to a reduction of total peripheral vascular resistance, which are primarily abnormally increased in hypertension; the antihypertensive efficacy of CCA is comparable to that of other commonly used antihypertensive drugs; CCA induce a significant regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, a factor of morbidity and mortality which is considered to be independent of the level of mean arterial pressure; CCA have vasodilating properties on the coronary circulation; CCA are generally well tolerated, from both clinical and biological points of view. The challenge for CCA concerns three domains related to the morbidity\/mortality of hypertension (coronary and cerebrovascular events) a better antihypertensive efficacy for the whole period of 24 hours, a better prevention of cerebrovascular events and an effect on the development of atherosclerosis.","2758":"Pharmacokinetics of the three main classes of calcium antagonists are similar for resorption, protein binding, hepatic metabolism. However, their plasma elimination half lives differ considerably and distinguishes: those that have a short or intermediate plasma half life (nifedipine, verapamil, diltiazem, nicardipine, nitrendipine, felodipine) with once or twice daily administration, most often thanks to slow-release forms, and those whose administration is once daily, either because of prolonged half-life (amlodipine) or because of prolonged duration of action due to accumulation into the cellular wall (lacidipine). These different formulations ensure better patient compliance and plateau plasma concentrations resulting in better clinical efficacy and fewer side-effects.","2759":"Calcium antagonists (calcium channel blockers) constitute a chemically heterogeneous group of drugs which block voltage-operated calcium channels of L-type. They specifically interact with the alpha 1 subunit of the calcium channel. Their mechanism of action has been demonstrated using pharmacological, electrophysiological and radiochemical techniques. Their therapeutic effects are not only related to their hemodynamic action but also to their remodeling effect in hypertrophic heart and arteries, to their anti-ischaemic action and to the preservation of vascular integrity during several pathologies. Drugs belonging to the second generation of calcium antagonists show various pharmacological profiles responsible for their tissue selectivity. The latter is a rational basis for novel therapeutic indications including atherosclerosis and cardiac failure.","2760":"","2761":"10% of young male healthy volunteers have a total bilirubin value over 20 mumol\/l; thus such a value appears not relevant as screening cut off point in clinical pharmacology. This study was intended to confirm if a 27 mumol\/l cut off point previously defined by the authors does not support a risk. This study dealt with 487 subjects who had together measurements of total bilirubin value and lab. tests of liver cytolysis, cholestasis or hemolysis during the selection process. 48 subjects (9.8%) had a total bilirubin value over 20 mumol\/l. Correlation tests do not provide arguments of cytolysis, cholestasis or hemolysis and there was no argument in favor of Gilbert's syndrome. Out of 48 hyperbilirubinemic subjects only 22 were included in clinical pharmacology studies. In more than 60%, the total bilirubin value returned to normal spontaneously and in no case appeared a significant clinical, biological, pharmacokinetic or dynamic abnormality. Except a possible increase of slow acetylor frequency, the medical literature analysis does not show any relevant modification in metabolism, pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics until a 40 mumol\/l value of total bilirubin. Thus, the 27 mumol\/l value of total bilirubin previously proposed is confirmed as a useful limit that does not lead to an additional risk.","2762":"Products used in a toxicomaniac way are in rapid change, and different from different area. Users too have to be better known. Authors present a simple survey method of these products, based on sample use. First results seem to be correct. These method may be used, associated with others, in a network as those existent for many years in the United States.","2763":"There is no univocal clinical cardiovascular pattern associated with magnesium deficiency. Only an acute hypomagnesaemia gives the evidence of a real magnesium deficiency. Arrhythmias corrected by magnesium are associated with potassium deficiency. Magnesium deficiency appears to be one risk factor of arrhythmias and coronary spasms. The influence of intravenous magnesium salts was clearly evaluated on cardiovascular electrophysiology allowing protocols infusion. The major beneficial effect of magnesium on total incidence of arrhythmias appears to have been due to a reduction in supraventricular tachyarrhythmias and especially in \"torsade de pointes\". Antiarrhythmic mechanisms still remain to be clarified. It is likely that magnesium influences cardiac conduction and refractoriness by affecting calcium dependent processes as if acting as an indirect inactivator of slow inward calcium current, probably secondary to an inward shift of the background potassium mediated current. Recent studies demonstrated beneficial effect of intravenous magnesium treatment in acute myocardial infraction, both as to mortality and to early cardiac insufficiency. Beside antiarrhythmic and vasodilatator effects, magnesium seems to show cardiac cells protective action against ischaemia.","2764":"The discovery, during the last ten years, of Platelet Activating Factor (PAF) antagonists with different frameworks, but efficient on platelets tests, led the authors to study their activity in vivo against PAF-induced effects. These antagonists inhibit, with various potencies, the effects of PAF administration such as hypotension and bronchoconstriction in different animal species. Since PAF is assumed to play a central role in many diseases, effects of its antagonists have been studied in experimentally induced pathologies and in few clinical studies. We have been particularly interested in their effects on the first manifestation of asthma which is hypersensitivity. This manifestation is experimentally reproduced by anaphylactic bronchoconstriction, usually in the guinea-pig. Our results showed that different sensitization procedures may determine the relative efficiency of a PAF antagonist on subsequent antigen challenge. Indeed, the booster injection of antigen to a pre-sensitized animal could account for the refractoriness of anaphylactic bronchoconstriction to PAF antagonists. This booster injection mimics the clinical situation of atopic patients repeatedly exposed to allergen. Thus, it seems that immediate hypersensitivity could not be treated by the unique administration of a PAF antagonist. However, those antagonists may have more benefit in the clinical management of the late phase of asthma and of hyperreactivity and could thus provide anti-asthmatic drugs. PAF antagonists may have also therapeutical effects in septic shock, in myocardial ischemia and cardiac rhythm disturbances, in brain damage following cerebral ischemia and neurological trauma, in gastric and intestinal damages or in some inflammatory reactions.","2765":"Cytokines were first characterized as high-molecular weight modulators of the immune response. However they also play an important role in the CNS. Thus, some cytokines could influence the synaptic transmission or modulate the neuronal and glial growth during brain development or after brain injury. Activated glial cells appear to be the major cytokines producing cells. Some of these cytokines are glial cells mitogens, whilst others have a direct neurotrophic activity. These effects seem to be mediated by receptors similar to those of neurotrophic factors. Cytokines might be crucial factors in the evolution of different acute or chronic neuropathological processes such as ischemia, brain trauma, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. Control of their effect on brain cells could allow prevention of brain damage observed in such pathologies.","2766":"A lot of progress has been performed in ocular surgery for the last 20 years. Development of surgical procedures allows a precise action on the different ocular membranes: cornea, lens, irido-corneal angle, vitreous and retina. Inflammatory reaction and fibrosis can be observed after these procedures. Different methods are now available to prevent inflammatory reaction and the fibrosis. The association of an appropriate medical treatment to a surgical procedure is there to be done according to each case.","2767":"Open angle glaucoma is an optic neuropathy, the etiology of which is still unknown and which has not yet satisfactory therapy. Intraocular hypertension due to a decrease in trabecular out flow facility, is a risk factor. The side effects caused by ocular hypotensive treatments justify the search for better-tolerated drugs. A survey of the new approaches is reported: carbonic anhydrase inhibition, renin-angiotensin system inhibition, glucocorticoid antagonism, the use of prostaglandins etc. are evoked, as well as other more speculative ways: antioxidant treatments. Glaucoma which is characterized by ganglion cell degeneration probably related to a vascular defect, deserves to be studied from this point of view. Recent data on vascular and haemorheological abnormalities and the possible involvement of excitotoxic neurotransmitters in pathological process open a novel way for really innovative pharmacological research.","2768":"During the millennia of evolution, animals have been subjected to a relentless biological warfare mounted by the plants that they ingested. By duplication of an ancestral gene, divergent evolution of these 2 genes, and so forth, surviving animals have been endowed with multiple cytochromes P450s which can metabolize (and thus eliminate) a multitude of environmental liposoluble xenobiotics. A disadvantage of this system (fortunately limited by the concomitant installation of several protective systems) is that cytochrome P450 transforms some of these xenobiotics into chemically reactive metabolites. These free radicals or electrophilic metabolites attack tissue constituents, and may lead to mutation, cancer or tissue necrosis. Tissue necrosis affect mainly the liver, whose content in cytochrome P450 is particularly high. Indeed, reactive metabolites are usually extremely unstable, and react mainly in situ, in the same organ that forms them. When the formation of reactive metabolites is extensive, protective mechanisms are overwhelmed, extensive alterations of diverse hepatic constituents occur, and toxic hepatitis ensues. When the formation of reactive metabolites is moderate, severe toxic lesions do not occur. However, the covalent binding of reactive metabolites to hepatic proteins modifies the self of the subject. In some subjects, the presence of this modified self triggers immunization, and leads to immunoallergic hepatitis. The immune response may be directed either against protein (or peptide) epitopes modified by the presence of a reactive metabolite (reaction against modified self) and\/or against normal, unmodified, epitopes of proteins (autoimmune reaction against the self, triggered by the modified self). Both metabolic factors, and the HLA phenotype, appear to modulate the likelihood of immunization.","2769":"Induction of drug metabolism enzymes is defined as a de novo synthesis of an enzyme protein. Not all, but a certain number of sub-families of cytochromes P450 are inducible among 27 families. Each group of inducers is relatively specific of one corresponding P450 subfamily; Polycyclic hydrocarbons and P4501A; Phenobarbital and P4502B; glucocorticoids and P4503A; Ethanol and P4502E; Peroxisome proliferations and P4504A. P450 induction has pharmacological implications specially concerning drug interactions, and inducers are themselves drugs of environmental compounds. Last 10 years have offered progresses in the knowledge of molecular mechanisms of induction such as mediation by receptors (Ah or PPAR), transcriptional regulation; Stabilisation of RNAm or of enzyme proteins. Repression of P450s synthesis is for less understood, as an example cytokines repress more than one P450-subfamily. At least transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms are involved.","2770":"Cytochromes P450 (P450) are hemoproteins which catalyze essentially monooxygenation reactions. These enzymes may metabolize either endogenous compounds such as steroids, or exogenous compounds. This review will concentrate on P450 metabolizing xenobiotics. They are found mainly in endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes. Purification and cloning of the different isoforms allowed to set up an international nomenclature based on sequences similarities between these P450. Ten families are known in mammals and 4 (CYP 1 to 4) metabolize xenobiotics. Each family may include several subfamilies (A, B, ...). Numerous factors cause variations in the expression of these P450: genetic, environmental, physiopathologic. Several genetic polymorphism have been described, P450, 2D6, 2C and may be 1A2 and 2E1. Some P450 (3A, 1A, 2E, ...) are inducible by compounds such as phenobarbital, rifampicin, aromatic hydrocarbon, ethanol, or omeprazole. Finally, P450 expression and inducibility vary depending on tissues. It is now possible to determine which isoform(s) is (are) responsible of the production of a metabolite. Specific tests are now available to evaluate the level of P450 in vivo in man (1A, 3A, 2D6, 2C).","2771":"The eye contains nerves that are derived from the central and peripheral nervous system. Every neurotransmitter or neuromediator of the brain is present in defined neurones of the retina which is also part of the central nervous system. Nerves innervating the iris, ciliary processes, cornea, choroid and parts of the eye other than the neuronal retina belong to the peripheral nervous system. These nerves contain catecholamines, acetylcholine and a variety of neuropeptides. The receptor-types shown to exist in the retina, iris, ciliary processes, cornea and other areas of the eye are numerous. In some instances the presence of specific types of receptors is associated with nerves containing the natural ligand while in other instances this is not the case e.g. for serotonin in the iris\/ciliary processes. Thus certain receptor-types in the eye may be specifically controlled by hormones or mediators released locally from non-neuronal cells such as glial cells or retinal pigment epithelial cells. Evidence that noradrenaline has a functional role in the retina comes most convincingly from the finding that beta, alpha 1 and alpha 2-type receptors are present. Binding studies and agonist-induced effects on the secondary messengers cAMP and inositol phosphates show the beta receptors to be positively coupled to adenylate cyclases whereas alpha 2 receptors are negatively coupled to the enzyme. Stimulation of alpha 1 receptors triggers the production of inositol phosphates. A number of recent studies have shown that endothelin (ET) is an important vasoactive ocular peptide. We have focussed on determining the nature of ET receptors in the front of the eye. Autoradiographic studies have shown that specific 125I-ET-1 binding sites are associated with the iris, ciliary processes and corneal endothelium. The ETs stimulated inositol phosphates accumulation and decreased the synthesis of cAMP in the iris\/ciliary processes. Thus is would appear that at least two types of ET receptors are present. Studies utilising the polymerase chain reaction provided evidence for the presence of ETB receptor subtype in the rabbit iris\/ciliary body.","2772":"","2773":"","2774":"","2775":"","2776":"","2777":"","2778":"","2779":"","2780":"","2781":"Cholesterol-lowering drugs include three major pharmacological classes: a) fibrates, b) statines, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and c) cholestyramine.

Among 3,506 out patients who received cholesterol-lowering drugs, 36 side effects were reported (i.e. 1 side effect for 98 out-patients). Most of the side effects were observed with statines (61%). The most frequently observed side effects were gastralgia (19.5%) observed with the three classes of drugs and hepatitis with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (8.5%) or fibrates (3%) whereas myopathy (12%) only occurred with statines. The other side effects were cutaneous (14%: eczema, skin rashes) or neuropsychiatric (11%: insomnia...) ones.

Alternatively the CART-(classification and regression tree) technique was used. Both techniques showed diastolic blood pressure &lt; or = 70 mmHg to be the single most significant risk factor. CART-analyses showed also pretreatment with nitrates and systolic blood pressure &lt; or = 120 mmHg to be of prognostic relevance. Thus CART is a valuable complement when looking for prognostic factors.","2800":"We analyzed the users of the Bordeaux Regional Centre--defined as any person calling the Centre for an inquiry--between 1986 and 1991. During this 6-year period, 3,046 different users called our Centre. Among them, 2,578 (85%) called the Centre for the first time during this period and among them, more than 700 became regular users. The Bordeaux Centre works in regular cooperation with approximately 1,200 health professionals. This corresponds to the surveillance of 500,000 inhabitants.","2801":"Omeprazole has been marketed in France since 1989, for the healing of peptic ulcers, erosive reflux esophagitis and the Zollinger Ellison syndrome. It is a proton pump inhibitor which inhibits the acid secretion in the stomach. In the majority of the clinical trials, omeprazole has been found to be well tolerated: headache, dizziness, skin rash, constipation have just been noted. Since September 1989, 143 adverse reactions have been reported to pharmacovigilance centres and Astra France: 37 neurological and psychiatric side effects, especially confusion in patients with hepatic diseases and\/or advanced age; 35 cutaneous reactions, generally rash and urticaria; 22 hematological effects: leucopenia and agranulocytosis have been reported but the relation with omeprazole is very uncertain; 10 gastrointestinal effects, generally diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain; 8 hepatic disorders, especially moderate elevation of aminotransferases. This study confirms the safety of this drug, during short treatment; the frequency of notified adverse effects is about 1\/12 200 treatments of 4 weeks. The ministry of health, has decided, in november 1991, to inform the prescribers of this potential toxicity of omeprazole, particularly, of the risk of confusion, hepatotoxicity and leucopenia.","2802":"The Swiss Drug Monitoring Center SANZ operates the spontaneous reporting system in Switzerland and is a private institution founded and funded by the societies of the Swiss health professionals and the Swiss pharmaceutical industries. The goal of SANZ is to collect and evaluate ADRs and thus to create signals. In 1991 SANZ received 792 reports. SANZ informs the health professionals periodically on drug safety problems. Reports on serious ADRs are exchanged with the regulatory authorities.","2803":"Quality of Life is a new clinical dimension with the objective of evaluating the impact of a disease or of a treatment on patients well being. Quality of life is a measure of increasing interest. It is a global and cumulative measure, relevant for the evaluation of the therapeutic benefit of a treatment. It can be measured through \"specific\" or \"generic\" tools. Very few experimental literature exploring the impact of pathologies over the sexual sphere exists today. Only generic scales have been used, because no specific scale has been developed up to now. The impact of certain pathologies such as depression or diabetes has been documented, but very little objective information exists concerning the sexual repercussion of the chronic use of drugs (anti depressive, anxiolytics). Sexual quality or life as a risk factor for disease development is also dimension that has been explored, but only superficially. In a general way, no evidence exists concerning a reel correlation link between pathologies, treatments and sexual quality of life and this specific dimension of the quality of life still remains to be explored further.","2804":"","2805":"Some oral contraceptive (OC) users experience sexual dysfunction. For example, recent studies on sexual dysfunction suggest that 0.5-1% of OC users experience a decreased libido, and 33% of them drop-out of the studies.  Even though there are many OC users, researchers have not exerted much energy in studying sex al dysfunction.  Sexuality surveys do not tend to yield reliable data. Researchers tend not to consider OCs as normal drugs. Thus, it is difficult to understand the link between adverse effects and OC use. Problems in studies of female sexuality revolve around assessment criteria. Clinical criteria related to female sexuality in the literature are usually decreased libido, vaginal dryness, and lack of orgasm. Yet, the studies rarely scale, standardize, or really validate the severity of these criteria. Various questionnaires used to assess female sexuality in OC users include well-being, sexual interest questionnaire, sex role behavior scale, sexual experience scale, and questions addressing sexual daydreaming and sexual fantasies. They tend to go beyond basic clinical parameters and raise more questions than they provide solid answers. To concretely compare OC users and nonusers, researchers need to obtain a baseline value on sexual activity 1 month before cases begin OC use. No large study with solid assessment criteria has yet included both comparable groups and placebo groups. Thus, both biases and confounding factors render the data unreliable. Perhaps the way to expand knowledge on OCs' relationship with female sexuality is to consider quality of life, i.e., sexuality as a parameter that can be improved or worsened. Standard studies and common methodology do not lend themselves to investigating OC use and female sexuality.","2806":"Symptoms can be assessed by the subject or the patient himself. Drug-related sexual dysfunction may be of clinical relevance for medication compliance. Three kinds of self-rating scales are available: yes\/no questionnaire, multiple choice questionnaire and visual analogue scales. Self-rating can be absolute (intensity score) or relative (improving or worsening score), over last rating or over baseline. Self-rating necessarily implies: comprehension of the vocabulary and the instructions by the subject; cooperation of the subject; and careful checking of the answers by the clinician. Main metrologic qualities are sensitivity, reliability and validity. To assess changes in sexual function, the \"golden\" sexual function questionnaire does not seem to exist. Separate questionnaires are provided for men and women with appropriate changes for specific items. The number of questions varies from 4 to 20 even more. Several aspects of the male and female sexuality must be studied. Two main questions can be raised: 1) is there any relation between responses obtained with self-reported questionnaire and responses to questioning by a clinician? is there any relation between self-reported sexual dysfunction and objective measures of sexual function like plethysmography?","2807":"","2808":"","2809":"","2810":"The effects of drugs is mainly explained by their action on specific receptors located on target cells. However, the receptors are can be regulated by changes into the levels of the physiological neurotransmitter and\/or by drugs. A chronic treatment by an agonist induces a desensitization leading to a decrease in cellular response. The desensitization is \"homologous\" when it only involves the activated pathway and \"heterologous\" when a decrease in the response to other factors (transmitters, drugs) appears. At the molecular level, desensitization is explained by covalent modification of the receptors by phosphorylation catalyzed by a variety of protein kinases. A long term stimulation elicits an internalization of the receptor followed by degradation: this mechanism is called \"down regulation\". In contrast, treatment with antagonists can induce hypersensitization (i.e. increase in the cellular response) with up regulation. The consequences of these notions are discussed in term of both clinical pharmacology and pharmacovigilance.","2811":"A review of the available literature concerning sudden withdrawal of drugs shows that withdrawal syndrome have occurred with centrally antihypertensive drugs, beta-blockers on anginal patients, antiparkinsonian drugs and glucocorticoids. Because of a lack of controlled trials led among a large number of individuals, the correct frequency of this withdrawal syndrome is unknown. In most patients, it's hard to distinguish a return to a previous state from an overshoot phenomenon. In that way, gradual and supervised withdrawal of these agents should prevent the complication of sudden cessation of these therapy.","2812":"","2813":"A comparative study of the various classes of antiarrhythmic drugs as agents protecting against ischaemia-induced ventricular fibrillation was undertaken in the pig in situ heart, in anaesthetized animals which were subjected to complete temporary occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. This occlusion resulted in fibrillation after a time which varied in inverse ratio to vulnerability to fibrillation. However, as this time did not exceed a few minutes, time to onset of fibrillation could be repeatedly measured in the course of an experiment, in the absence or in the presence of an antiarrhythmic drug. Under ventricular pacing at a constant rate, 180 beats\/min, all the class I antiarrhythmic drugs, flecainide, disopyramide and lidocaine, in clinical dose range, reduced time to fibrillation to a large extent (25 to 50%) at the maximum of their action, with gradual return to control values within less than one hour. The enhancement of vulnerability to fibrillation was accompanied by reduction in intraventricular conduction velocity and fibrillation rate. With the same ventricular pacing, no change was observed in time to fibrillation under the influence of propranolol or amiodarone. As for verapamil, it lengthened this time considerably, up to 600%. However, bradycardia produced in usual circumstances ensures a real protection against ischaemic fibrillation with propranolol and amiodarone and enhances protection directly exerted by verapamil.","2814":"The obesity-induced kinetic changes have been studied only from twenty years, despite the frequency of such a pathological state; thus many work need to be done in this area. The tissular distribution of drugs may depend on the obesity-induced changes in the body composition taking into account the degree of drug liposolubility. Some other factors such as protein binding and regional blood flow may also be involved in tissular diffusion of drugs in obesity. Drug binding to albumin does not seem to be modified in obesity. On the contrary, the protein binding of some basic drugs is increased because of the rise of the plasma alpha 1 glycoprotein acid levels in obesity. Although the cardiac output and the total blood volume are increased in obese patients, the blood flow recalculated according to the adipose tissue weight, is less than in non obese subjects: this point could reduce the diffusion of some lipophilic drugs. More complex are the obesity induced changes in the hepatic clearance of drugs: some reactions such as oxydo-reduction and acetylation do not vary, some others such as sulfoconjugation or glucuronoconjugation are increased. The renal clearance is increased for drugs totally eliminated by glomerular filtration and for drugs which are both filtrated and secreted. According to the liposolubility characteristic of a drug and its clearance, one can calculate the loading dose and the maintenance dose.","2815":"We investigated acetaminophen pharmacokinetics in CSF in twelve operated arteritics patients with continuous spinal anesthesia. Nine men and three women aged 77 +\/- 7 years and weighing 66 +\/- 15 kg entered in the study after expressing verbal informed consent. They received intravenously a single dose of acetominophen (equivalent to 1 g). Fifteen minutes to six hours after the intravenous injection, blood and CSF samples were withdrawn every thirty minutes, except during the second to the third hour were it was every fifteen minutes. Acetaminophen concentrations in blood and in CSF were assayed by HPLC. Acetaminophen was detected in the earliest samples (1.32 +\/- 1.32 micrograms.ml-1) and then increased up to 8.16 +\/- 3.04 micrograms.ml-1 at 186 +\/- 56 minutes. From 135th to 345th minute, acetaminophen concentration in CSF stay at about 6 micrograms.ml-1, which is the duration of its maximal analgesic central effect.","2816":"In order to investigate whether smooth muscle intracellular calcium levels ([Ca2+]i) are related to hypertension and drug-induced changes in blood pressure, we studied basal perfusion resistance and basal [Ca2+]i and increases in perfusion pressure and [Ca2+]i using the fluorescent dye, fura-2 (dual wavelength excitation) in perfused tail artery. These were removed from 6 month old SHR previously treated (CAP + HCZ) for 10 weeks with captopril plus hydrochlorothiazide (44 and 22 mg\/kg\/day po, respectively). Separate groups received captopril (CAP) or hydrochlorothiazie (HCZ) alone, at similar doses, or no treatment (SHR). A fifth group of WKY normotensive rats did not receive any drug. Following determination of systolic arterial pressure (SAP) in awake rats, tail artery segments were removed and perfused at a constant flow rate with physiological salt solution plus fura-2\/AM. Basal resistance and [Ca2+]i were determined. Then a dose-response curve for calcium chloride in the presence of a depolarizing concentration of potassium chloride was constructed. SAP was lowered in groups CAP + HCZ or CAP, but not in the group HCZ. Basal [Ca2+]i were similar in treated and untreated SHR and in WKY. Basal resistance to flow was lower in groups CAP + HCZ or CAP, and in WKY, than in untreated SHR. In depolarized arterial segments, vasconstrictor responses to perfusion with calcium chloride were lower in groups CAP + HCZ or CAP, and in WKY. Increases in [Ca2+]i were diminished in WKY rats. SAP measured in awake SHR and WKY was significantly correlated to basal and stimulated intracellular calcium-vasoreactivity coupling measured in vitro.","2817":"The metabolism of zidovudine (AZT) and its modulating factors have been studied in human liver microsomes. In a first step, we demonstrated the involvement of UDP-glucoronosyltransferase (UDPGT) 2 form in AZT glucuronidation. In a second step, in order to predict drug interactions, we screened the effect of 52 drugs, representative of 17 different therapeutic classes, on AZT glucuronidation. We demonstrated that about twenty molecules glucuronidated or not are able to inhibit AZT glucuronidation. Finally, the NADPH-dependent reductive metabolism of AZT which produced a toxic metabolite, 3'-amino-3'-deoxythymidine (AMT) has been studied. Our studies demonstrated that AMT was formed only under anaerobic conditions and that its formation is catalysed by the NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase.","2818":"Non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) contain a chiral carbon alpha to carboxyl function. Except for naproxen, chiral NSAIDs are marketed for clinical use as racemate, ie an equimolar mixture of the two enantiomers R(-) and S(+). However, in vitro studies have shown that the anti-inflammatory activity exists almost solely in the S form. The unbound fraction is able to diffuse into tissues and to reach sites of action. It represents also the pharmacological active form. Stereoselective protein binding studies carried out at various concentrations of NSAIDs and albumin are used to evaluate the free fraction of the active enantiomer. Two optical isomers do not interact in the same manner with proteins and this binding stereoselectivity depends on NSAID and experimental conditions. Thus, it seems difficult to predict the in vivo free concentration of each enantiomer and protein binding experiments should be achieved taking into account the physiopathological parameters which influence this biological process. This enantioselectivity is determinant for the pharmacokinetic properties and could be responsible of the parameters variation obtained for each enantiomer. It could explain the variability in response to NSAIDs too. In fact, the anti-inflammatory effect is directly function of the free concentration of the S isomer. To correlate the NSAID dose with its activity, it should be better to determine this free fraction in the site of action, in particular in the synovial fluid. But the clinical response, as for example the antalgic effect, remains very far from the pharmacological activity, ie the cyclooxygenase inhibition.","2819":"","2820":"","2821":"Beta-blockers are frequently used in the treatment of hypertension. However their long term use has been associated with an increase of serum triglycerides and a decrease of HLD-cholesterol concentrations which could diminish the benefit drawn from their hypotensive effect. The effect on lipid metabolism is less unfavourable when beta-blockers exert an intrinsic sympathomimetic activity or are said to be cardioselective. Mechanisms involved are complex and poorly understood.","2822":"","2823":"","2824":"","2825":"","2826":"","2827":"Successful suicide attempts by rifampicin are not commonly reported in literature.

Criterias of prognostic value are discussed: clinical signs in particular the redman syndrome, and biological data. None of them allows us to prevent fatal issue but, since cardiac arrest of unknown origin may rapidly occur, admission in intensive care must be carried out promptly with a total dose absorbed of 12 g and\/or evident clinical signs.","2828":"","2829":"A one day long survey of antalgics and antipyretics consumption was carried out in 6 pharmacies of a middle-size city. It first shows the majority of medical prescription (62.2%) over self medication (29.4%) and over pharmaceutic advice (8.4%) at the drug delivery. Women are the main consumers, especially in the youngest ones (20-40 years old). Paracetamol is the most used drug; in this indication, the search for the less expensive drug seems usual. Drug abuse cannot be demonstrated in this survey; the consumption of this category of drugs appears as important although for a short duration; and most of the time for pain considered as moderate and trivial. The possibility to carry out such surveys and possibly clinical trials in private pharmacies appears as an opportunity.","2830":"An intensive pharmacovigilance survey was carried out over the course of 1 year in cardiology department which revealed 64 reports of adverse drug reactions among 61 hospitalised patients, giving an overall incidence of 2.3%. Most of the patients in whom adverse drug reactions were recorded were elderly and female. The most common adverse events were cardiovascular (72%) and haemorrhagic (9%), and related to drugs given for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders. The symptoms originating from drug therapy were dominated by sinus arrhythmias (25 cases), linked to drugs co-administered that have potentially similar cardiac pharmacodynamic effects. Seven cases of \"torsades de pointe\" were also observed.","2831":"5-fluoro-uracil (5-FU) cardiotoxicity has been often reported during chemotherapy.

Blood pressure, plasma potassium, exchangeable potassium, ventricular premature contractions measured by Holter and plasma magnesium were monitored. Blood pressure was brought to normal in both treatment groups (p &lt; 0.001). Plasma potassium fell by 0.19 mmol\/l with A (NS) and 0.35 mmol\/l (p &lt; 0.01) with E. Changes in potassium pool were not significant. There was a non-significant reduction in the number of ventricular premature contractions in both groups. There was no correlation between the few cases of frank hypokaliema, fall in potassium pool and complex ventricular premature contractions. A review of the literature offers no solid arguments suggestive of significant potassium risk associated with these diuretics. Any such risk can be eliminated by the use of low doses, combined if necessary with a potassium-sparer or a hypotensive agent of another group.","2833":"In order to evaluate what doctors think about clinical trials in general, 867 of them practicing in western Normandy were polled by telephone. The majority of the doctors questioned (68.6%) said they were interested in participating in clinical trials. Moreover, a number of them (71.7%) had already taken part in such studies, most of which were non-comparative studies on drugs already on the market. 66.2% of the doctors said they were willing to participate in such trials but only 10% of the doctors questioned knew anything about Good Clinical Practice. Doctors practicing in this part of France appear to know little or nothing about Good Clinical Practice, however, while they are willing to take part in clinical research, they are insistant that trials should be of worthwhile interest.","2834":"Phase I and II clinical studies performed in healthy elderly volunteers appear as a necessity in the design of any drug development. This is particularly true for drugs which will be indicated in age-related disorders. The essential aim is to obtain a maximum of results on kinetics, dosage and tolerance in this target population. Difficulties and specificities of these studies will be developed. This issue will contribute to improve the quality of Phase III studies and appears as a money-saving strategy.","2835":"The French selegiline (S) multicenter trial was conducted in 1990 to test the possibility to improve symptomatology of de novo parkinsonian patients (PP) during the first three months of treatment by monotherapy S 10 mg\/day. A randomized double blind placebo, parallel controlled trial was carried out on 93 patients in 13 neurologic centers. S appears superior to placebo. Global scores and motor subscores of UPDRS are improved (p &lt; 0.001, p &lt; 0.01) from the first to the third month. Side effects are minor (nausea, dysgueusia, vertigo, lipothymia) and hardly different in both groups. S thus appears as inducing a rapid and moderate symptomatic effect in de novo PP, during a 3 months long period of treatment.","2836":"The incidence of ectopic pregnancies (EP), has increased significantly in the past 20 years. Conservative tubal surgery has long been the treatment of choice. However, non-surgical treatment of EP has recently become an alternative to surgery. This pharmacological approach uses chiefly methotrexate but attempts have been reported using prostaglandins, actinomycin D, potassium chloride, mifepristone and anti-hCG monoclonal antibodies. Early diagnosis and close follow-up of EP by methods including transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound examination and serial measurements of hCG allow to choose the more appropriate treatment of EP. The present article gives an overview of the pathophysiology of EP, followed by a review of the various pharmacological treatments available. This review is centered on methotrexate as the best known drug in this indication. Published data on local and general tolerance, efficacy and pharmacokinetics are reviewed. A pretherapeutic assessment score using six criteria is also discussed, the objective of which is to better define the surgical and non-surgical indications. The non-surgical treatment of EP can provide a safe and effective alternative to surgical treatment. However, further studies are needed to assess the effects of these pharmacological treatments on both fertility and risk of recurrence of EP.","2837":"The draft guidelines for the clinical evaluation of antidementia drugs give an important series of advice on all trials phases: the main objective, in the present state of knowledge, is to improve memory. patients must have a confirmed dementia, and other causes than Alzheimer diseases must be excluded by appropriate investigations. They should not be too severely ill, but they should be institutionalized, at least during the first phase of treatment, the placebo controlled trial and the dose-effect relationship are necessary, the cross-over trial is not advised, the treatment duration should be at least 3 to 6 months, two strictly independent evaluations are necessary: cognitive tests, and clinical global impression based only on interviews of the patient, the file must contains at least 1000 cases with at least 300 cases treated 3-6 months with at least the median dose.","2838":"For many years, all application dossiers sent to the Ministry of Health for use in Alzheimer's disease focused on the correction of cognitive disorders. Discussions were centered on the choice of cognitive evaluation scales and psychometric tests. The situation has since evolved and in addition to the cognitive disorders, applications must also consider daily life activities and comportmental disorders. Animal experiences remain classical, the use of aged animals not bringing much information and being extremely expensive. Phase I does not need to be modified at this stage. Phase II, however, must be done with extreme methodological rigor, and especially with an evaluation of pertinent clinical benefit in the cognitive and non-cognitive fields. The simple statistically significant improvement in one scale or another was not found sufficient by the Commission. The pharmaceutical company therefore has to find the benefit risk ratio that has real therapeutic interest. If this ratio seems pertinent to the Ministry, then phase III studies can be done to confirm longterm efficacy on enough patients. The study of drug action is very interesting to advance research or even in the application dossier, but in all cases, the ratio of pertinent clinical benefit to the risk of side effects remains the cornerstone of the decision.","2839":"Therapeutic trials conducted in Alzheimer's disease have benefited from the standardization of diagnostic criteria based on internationally recognized scales (DSM III-R, NINCDS-ADRDA) which ensure more valid inclusions. Well specified exclusion criteria are also of the utmost importance, in particular depression, vascular dementia and concomitant psychotropic drugs. Cognitive and\/or functional scales allow an appreciation of the severity of the disease. Due to the heterogeneity of Alzheimer's disease stratification methods on identified prognostic factors i.e. aphasia, extrapyramidal symptoms should be performed. Selection of responders during an enrichment phase has still to be discussed. Multicentric studies become imperative because of the large number of patients required and the difficulties in selecting the adequate patients. These raise the issues of investigators' experience, coordination and between center variability.","2840":"In this paper, a critical review of psychometric tests is proposed. The first part describes several aspects of modern, theoretical psychometry and the influence of cognitive psychology. The second part focuses on application of tests to dementia and preliminary results of a longitudinal study of cognitive evolution of patients with mild dementia. Based on this longitudinal study, the batteries of tests to be used for diagnosis, or experimental research, or clinical trials are described. The authors underline the fact that tests are not \"good\" or \"bad\" in themselves, and suggest a number of rules for selecting inclusion, evaluation and improvement criteria, related to drug treatment.","2841":"NINCDS-ADRDA criteria are currently used to include patients into therapeutic trials in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, specificity of these criteria is not very high (from 64 to 87% of diagnosis accuracy). The main causes of errors are the other degenerative dementias such as Frontal Lobe Dementias and Diffuse Lewy Body Disease. On the other hand, clinical heterogeneity of the patients fitting the criteria is large. To increase the power of therapeutic trials it is suggested: 1) to use specific criteria to rule out the other degenerative dementias when the efficacy of the tested drug is presumed to be specific for AD (cholinomimetics, inhibitors of beta-amyloid deposits...); 2) a better definition and assessment of the target symptoms when symptomatic improvement is the goal of the trial.","2842":"Epidemiological studies of Dementia have major methodological problems, particularly in France: selection of the studied sample, difficulties for contact with elderly people, heterogeneity of place of residence, inaccuracy of the diagnostic procedures. In spite of these problems, the Paquid Research program allowed to give estimations of prevalence and incidence rate of dementia in the French population. On the basis of these results, one can estimate that there are actually about 360,000 prevalent cases of dementia in France, of whom 270,000 are of Alzheimer type. There were also 150,000 annual-incident cases of dementia. However, many of these cases were not considered as demented by the medical system because of the absence of cognitive complaints.","2843":"Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the presence of two types of brain lesions: senile plaques and neurofibrillary degeneration. A peptide named beta A4 is the major component of the amyloid substance that constitutes senile plaques. beta A4 is part of a much larger membrane-associated protein known as the amyloid protein precursor (APP) whose gene is on chromosome 21. Mutations on APP gene have been linked to several early-onset AD families, demonstrating the pathogenicity of APP. The amyloid substance, likely neurotoxic, provokes a cascade of biochemical dysfunctions that leads to neurofibrillary degeneration (NFD). NFD is characterized by an intraneuronal filamentous accumulation of abnormally phosphorylated Tau proteins and is followed by cell death. NFD probably first affects the hippocampal region and spreads later to the entire isocortex, progressively provoking an intellectual impairment. Together, these observations show that experimentally-induced lesions in animal or cell models, already at our disposal, will open diagnostic and therapeutical perspectives.","2844":"In order to compare two titrations of Parlodel in early combination with levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease a multicentre randomized open study was performed with a fast titration in group A (15 mg\/day for 3 weeks) and slow in group B (15 mg\/day for 5 weeks). 153 patients were included: 77 in group A and 76 in group B. The recommended titration was observed in 76% in group A and 88% in group B, the difference was not significant. The efficacy assessed by the Webster Scale was remarkable and similar in the two groups. This study confirms the additive benefit of bromocriptine on the symptoms and long term complications of levodopa therapy, but no absolute conclusion can be drawn regarding the best titration.","2845":null,"2846":null,"2847":"The goal of our study was to explore the impact of various antidepressant drugs on the relative risk of work loss in depressed patients. 1,852 depressed patients (DSM III-R) were observed using a \"cross-sectional\" design. Patients were included into five groups: patients without antidepressant treatment, patients treated with one of the main antidepressant drugs in France (amineptine amitriptyline, clomipramine and fluoxetine). Primary variables were the depression intensity (Hamilton scores) and job status (work loss). The other parameters (clinical, demographic, economic, therapeutic) were used as potentially predicting variables. Data have been collected through a network of 295 physicians (GP, Psychiatrists). The main socio-demographic characteristics of treated and untreated depressive patients, either working or absent from work, were predominantly female and city dwellers. A significant difference was found between working patients and work loss in terms of professional characteristics, i.e. type of employment (p &lt; 0.001), type of employer (p &lt; 0.05), level of responsibility (p &lt; 0.01) and type of remuneration (p &lt; 0.01). We found a positive correlation between depression severity and the risk of work loss (R2 = 0.86, p &lt; 0.001). This risk was significantly lower with fluoxetine compared to other treatments.

Individual variations of skin blood flow are great (up to 1,400%); this could be related to spontaneous variations and\/or to the occlusive effect of the probe. Skin blood flow was significantly increased in 35% of the subjects after the application of the probe alone, and in 70 to 90% of the cases after topical application of water or ethanol (20 to 50 microliters). Lag times before vasodilatation measured only when the probe was applied on the skin were between 7.4 and 27 minutes, they were reduced between 5.2 and 8.3 minutes when the vehicles were applied.

Although the supply of such drugs remains excessive, a trend towards more rational standards has been apparent: 20 specialties out of 53 existing in 1983 have been withdrawn (10 fixed-dose combinations and 10 obsolete drugs). The overall use of lipid-lowering drugs rose from 2.51 DDD\/1000 inhab\/day in 1983 to 8.47 DDD\/1000 inhab\/day in 1991. The increase was mostly attributable to the subgroup of fibric acid derivatives (1.23 DDD\/1000 inhab\/day in 1983 and 6.14 in 1991). The bile acid sequestrants accounted for a small fraction of the overall use (0.23 DDD\/inhab\/day in 1991), in spite of its increasing consumption. The use of the two subgroups, nicotinic acid derivatives and fixed-dose combinations, has declined. The introduction into the market of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in 1991 contributed to the increase of the overall use in 1.28 DDD\/1000 inhab\/day but it seems not to have any negative influence on the use of other subgroups. Although the prevalence rates of hypercholesterolemia are similar, the use of lipid-lowering drugs in 1991 in Spain was 3 to 8 times higher than that of the Nordic countries. In conclusion, our data suggest that lipid-lowering drugs are highly used in Spain, at least in comparison with other western countries, and that the pattern of drug use is not in accordance with international recommendations.","2856":"The eighties were characterized by the introduction of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and calcium channel blockers (CCB) in the treatment of arterial hypertension. The present study investigates the side effects of antihypertensive drugs in the Toulouse University Hospital (France) between 1981 and 1990. Most of the side effects involved ACEI (45%), CCB (22%) and diuretics (18%). Central antihypertensive agents and beta-blocking drugs were involved in 8 and 9% of side effects respectively. During these 10 years, 197 side effects were reported in our hospital (3300 beds). Some of them were found more frequently: renal insufficiency (15%) or cough (9%) with ACEI, constipation (3%), gingivitis (1%) or lower limb oedema (4.5%) with CCB, hemolytic or autoimmune anemia (2.5%) and confusional state (1.5%) with central antihypertensive agents, nightmares (1.5%) with propranolol. The most frequently side effects were dermatological (20%), hydroelectrolytic (10%) and neuropsychiatric (9.6%) disturbances. In spite of the methodological problems of this kind of study (retrospective evaluation, under-notification of the side effects and different scores of imputability), these data indicate the most frequently observed side effects of antihypertensive agents during the eighties. It allows to estimate an approximate frequency of these side effects: among the antihypertensive drugs, CCB and diuretics seems the less frequently involved in the occurrence of reported side effects.","2857":"Drug-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis (Lyell's syndrome) is a rare, potentially lethal disease that is characterized by the sudden necrosis of the epidermis and frequently associated with mucous and systemic involvement. Even though the etiology of the disease is probably multifactorial (including viral infections and anomalies of drug metabolism), its iatrogenic origin is the principally recognized cause. We have drawn up a substantial list of the culprit drugs showing their frequency of involvement in the syndrome.","2858":"13 cases of zidovudine overdosage have been previously published; 30 have been notified to Paris Control Poison Centre up to January 1991. This analysis shows that acute toxicity appears infrequent and mild when ingested dose is lower than 25 gr. However it appears from this series that an haematologic monitoring is needed because of the risk of myelosuppression.","2859":"The economical aspects of pharmacovigilance in the pharmaceutical industry can be assessed by two ways. First the balance between cost of avoiding adverse drug reactions (ADR) and cost of ADR should be evaluated during the development. The company will have to take into account both efficacy and safety of its compound. However if it increases the costs of avoiding ADR it will reduce the costs of avoiding ADR occurring after commercialisation. On the other hand the cost of side effects of a marketed compound can also be appreciated. This assessment will always have to be comparative with an other drug and to take into account the benefit of both drugs, if their efficacy is not deemed identical.","2860":"The influence of dimeticone (Gel de Polysilane Midy) on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral ethyl biscoumacetate was studied in 6 healthy volunteers in a randomised single dose, two-way cross-over study. Each volunteer received at one week interval a single dose (300 mg) of ethyl biscoumacetate, either alone or with dimeticone. Ethyl biscoumacetate levels were measured in plasma for 24 hours. Pharmacodynamic parameters were measured for 96 hours. Ethyl biscoumacetate peak concentration was significantly higher when administered with dimeticone (40.3 +\/- 25.3 mg\/l vs 31.0 +\/- 25.7 mg\/l; p = 0.031), without significant change in the area under curve. Other pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters did not differ significantly. The slight increase of the ethyl biscoumacetate bioavailability with dimeticone in repeated dosing might have pharmacodynamic consequence; a clinical trial should address this question.","2861":"Pharmacokinetics of prazosin was investigated after single dose administrations of four different formulations, according to a randomized trial, to 24 young healthy volunteers: immediate release tablets (3 x 1 mg) used as reference (Treatment A), two new Gastro-Intestinal-Therapeutic-Systems (GITS) containing 2.5 mg (Treatment B) and 5 mg (Treatment C) of prazosin, and a traditional sustained release formulation (4 mg, treatment D). Relative bioavailability of prazosin administered as GITS was only 49.4 +\/- 19.5% (B) and 45.5 +\/- 18.7 (C) versus 73.8 +\/- 13.9% (D) (area under the curve normalized at 3 mg dosing); but absorption was sustained and plasma concentrations were maintained at a virtually constant level for a time period close to 24 h. As a result, mean residence time (MRT) of prazosin was considerably increased after GITS administration: 21.6 +\/- 1.0 h (B), 22.5 +\/- 1.6 h (C) instead of 5.9 +\/- 0.2 h for the reference formulation (A) and 10.8 +\/- 0.8 h for the traditional sustained release formulation (D). Although extrapolation to multiple dosing situations is difficult, this study demonstrates the potential suitability of prazosin GITS for once daily administrations.","2862":"Doses and dosing interval of analgesic drugs in renal failure are not always available in the data sheet compendium. The aim of the article is to analyse literature references and to present main pharmacokinetics modifications for each analgesic drug in renal failure. Pharmacokinetics parameters, doses and dosing intervals depending on creatinine concentrations are presented for each drug in a table.","2863":"Ro 5-3335 is a new benzodiazepine highly active in vitro (IC50 = 0.1-1.0 microM [corrected]) against HIV-1 viruses of AIDS resistant or non-resistant to zidovudine (AZT). It is also active against HIV-2. Ro 5-3335 is original by its mechanism of action, acting on the trans-activation factor of transcription (TAT) and non on the reverse transcriptase. Such as, it could prevent proviral DNA to express in both evolutive and silent AIDS resistant or non-resistant to AZT or to other anti-reverse transcriptase series. In addition, in antagonizing extracellular TAT's actions, Ro 5-3335 could alleviate the syndrome commonly associated with AIDS as Kaposi's syndrome. In rodent test, Ro 5-3335 has no diazepam-like central effects and presents in comparison to AZT a more favorable therapeutic index. In dog, the elimination half-life, peak concentration and availability are 2 h, 0.8 microM and 85% respectively, after a 1 mg.kg-1 oral dose of Ro 5-3335. Theoretically, Ro 5-3335 and now its analogue Ro 24-7429 seem to possess all virtues to antagonize evolutive and latent AIDS. Its arrival is timely to cope with the ever increasing resistance phenomena, lengthy development of AIDS vaccines, exponential contamination of populations worldwide and last but not least possibly to impede evolutions of the disease. Ability to manipulate TAT-mediated activation of HIV-1 genes paves the ways to study conceivable corrections of abnormal gene expressions of neurotransmitters, hormones, oncogenes and key enzymes.","2864":"","2865":"Interferon can be used for VIH+ pregnant women, to decrease materno-fetal contamination. Added to maternal circulation, its behaviour was studied by human placental cotyledon ex vivo perfusion. Human recombinant IFN 2a and reference substance 3H2O were injected in intervillous chamber and their behaviours in venous fetal and maternal circulations was followed. At steady state, in fetal circulation 3H2O concentration was 37% of injected rate whereas no IFN transfer rate was observed. In both venous circulations IFN amounts were lower than injected ones 56% versus of 82% for water (p &lt; 0.05).

OST has been applied to the determination of bioavailability parameters [area under the curve (AUC), maximal concentration (Cmax), time to reach maximal concentration, (Tmax)]. Three different Monte-Carlo simulations in twelve subjects have been performed, corresponding to different pharmacokinetic models: one-compartment with or without a lag time, two-compartment. Bioavailability parameters were estimated using a non-compartmental method (with 12 to 16 sampling times) and OST method (6 to 7 sampling times). Estimates were compared with true values. Bias and RMSE were similar with both methods for AUC and Cmax, while Tmax was better estimated using OST method. However, when a posteriori identifiability of the model was poor, use of a maximum a posteriori Bayesian estimator improved considerably the efficacy of OST method. Potential interest of OST for increasing statistical power of bioequivalence studies at the same cost is discussed, as well as possible limitations.","2869":"","2870":"","2871":"","2872":"","2873":"","2874":"","2875":"","2876":"","2877":"","2878":"","2879":"","2880":"In elderly with the risk of side effects of drugs is more important due to the age-related changes in organs and the drug interactions. It's why 26 gerontologic centers performed a multicentric survey about side effects (SE) incidence during a short period of 15 days. This survey was realised by REGATES (Network of Evaluation in Gerontology of Activity of Treatments and Side Effects). 2829 patients were included (8% acute patients, 23% Geriatric medicine, 69% nursing home). 74 SE were noticed in 64 patients among 21 centers. There were 23 men and 41 women with an average age 81.2 +\/- 6.5 y. taking 5.7 +\/- 1.6 drugs\/per day. The main SE were neurological or cardiovascular (26% each). SE incidence is high with extrapolation 636 SE per year for 1000 geriatric patients. Considering the 100,000 hospital beds for elderly, we may measure the lack of informations which don't reach the pharmacovigilance centers, in relation to the weak medical density.","2881":"The purpose of this paper is to show the problems with family data collection in a pharmacogenetic study, the aim of which was to study the genetic polymorphism of inducibility of cytochromes P4501A by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). Data were collected from 76 smoker nuclear families (315 volunteers). A caffeine test, a blood sample and answers to a questionnaire were obtained from each healthy volunteer. It was a crucial problem to recruit nuclear families with healthy smoker father and\/or mother and 2 smoker children. On 127 answers, 22 families were not eligible, 27 refused and 10 had a single child, that meant secondary refusals. Problems differed with origin of the recruitment. Included were 40 families obtained from 3 antismoking outpatient departments, 29 from general practitioners but 6 only from students. The family rates with 2 parents\/2 children were significantly higher with general practitioners (p &lt; 0.01). This emphasized their part in epidemiologic studies. Problems with the use of methodology were bound to acceptability of the tests which were better in females (p &lt; 0.05), and a change in caffeine form could improve this acceptability. Lastly, difficulties with laboratories constraints required a very good coordination between families, nurses and laboratories.","2882":"Evaluating a teratogenic risk remains a difficult problem, since the existing data in this field is fragmentary. One can consider using the material obtained by the follow-up of pregnancies which have motivated a telephone consultation to an Information Center. The material could, within limits, be used to give some security. If the present numbers do not change, it would take around four years to obtain data concerning 150 women exposed during the first trimester of their pregnancy.","2883":"To collect informations about drugs prescribed during pregnancy in France we carried out a retrospective survey from august to december 1989. This study was based on a questionnaire at delivery for 225 women. Socio-economic status, obstetrical past history and patterns of prescribing medications were studied. 99.5% of the women were found to have used drugs during pregnancy with a mean of 6.84 medications per woman. There was no influence of age, geographic origins, number of previous pregnancies on drug consumption; socio-professional status was also found to have a poor correlation with drug intake. Patterns of prescribing were compared to those of a previous French study made in 1976: changing pattern of prescribing were found for progestatives, corticoids, neurotropes, aspirin and beta adrenergic agents. We also pointed out that self-administered drugs decreased from 25.9 to 17.9%. This evaluation supports the need of further epidemiological studies in our country.","2884":"Zopiclone is the first of the cyclopyrrolones, a new class of psychotropic agents which is chemically different from the benzodiazepines (BZD). From an experimental point of view it has qualitatively the pharmacological profile of the tranquilizer-hyponotics, and activity quantitatively differs from hypnotic BZD by its lower myorelaxant. The electroencephalographic studies also demonstrated that its power spectrum is characteristic of a product having a tranquilizing hypnotic potential. The cyclopyrrolones interact with GABA ergic neurotransmission, and have a high affinity for GABA receptor complex. They act on sites close to BZD sites, but physically different. The sleep polygraphic studies have shown that zopiclone has a specific profile. It respects the sleep architecture, specially the delta sleep which is even increased, in some studies. Its residual effects are absent or minimal, and its acceptability is good in the usual conditions of hypnotic prescription.","2885":"The purpose of the study was to develop and to test a new form of rectal systemic gel for methohexitone administration in children undergoing minor surgery. Pharmacokinetics of methohexitone were determined in children following intravenous or intrarectal administration either at low or therapeutic dosage. Anaesthesic efficacy of this gel was performed in 11 patients receiving a therapeutic dosage (25 mg\/kg). Pharmacokinetics of methohexitone appears independent of both dosage and route of administration in children. The bioavailability of the rectal gel appears sufficient to provide efficient clinical plasmatic concentrations. As a consequence of the rapid and good resorption of methohexitone from rectal lumen and of the low variability of plasmatic concentrations, a rapid and reliable sedation was observed in all patients. The clinical anaesthesic efficacy of the rectal hydrophilic gel associated with the absence of an apparent local intolerance and important side effects, make this new form suitable for methohexitone administration in children.","2886":"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the plasma pharmacokinetics of acipimox and of its N-deoxy metabolite (5-methylpyrazine-2-carboxylic acid, MPCA) following single and repeated administration of 250 mg acipimox (thrice daily, for 6 days) to ten healthy volunteers. Mean maximum concentration, the corresponding time, area under the curve extrapolated to infinity and elimination half-life values of acipimox after single administration were equal to 5.74 micrograms\/ml (range 2.56-8.38 micrograms\/ml), 1.7 h (1-3 h), 16.99 micrograms\/ml.h (11.28-22.17 micrograms\/ml.h) and 1.15 h (0.79-1.48 h), respectively. Mean area under the curve over one dosing interval (8 h) and elimination half-life values of acipimox after repeated dosing were not significantly different from the corresponding values after the single dose. No significant accumulation was observed following the repeated treatment, since the mean accumulation ratio was 1.08 (range 0.74-1.52). The mean maximum concentration and corresponding time values in the 7 out of 10 subjects with detectable metabolite levels after the single dose were 0.19 microgram\/ml (0.10-0.34 microgram\/ml) and 6.7 h (3-12 h), respectively, whilst after the repeated treatment, detectable concentrations of the metabolite were observed in all subjects, the mean maximum concentration value being equal to 0.48 micrograms\/ml (0.11-1.19 microgram\/ml). The average ratio of the parent\/metabolite area under the curve values (8 h) after repeated dosing was equal to 14 (range 2-56). Inter-subject variability in the extent of metabolite formation was very high.","2887":"To declare bioequivalent two different formulations of one active drug, bioavailability studies are conducted, usually based on area under the plasma concentration-time curves and peak concentrations. The decision follows a statistical basis with right statement of the hypotheses of bioequivalence that are described. This procedure allows to control the consumer risk of falsely accepting bioequivalence while minimizing the new formulation risk of erroneously rejecting bioequivalence. Six decision rules meeting these criteria are reviewed and compared with numerical data: classic confidence interval; symmetric confidence interval; Hauck-Anderson method; two one-sided tests procedure; bayesian method; non parametric confidence interval. The six rules all have very similar performance. However, the bayesian procedure which gives a probability of the location of the true relative bioavailability could likely complete the two one-sided tests procedure and\/or the classic confidence interval method that are recommended in regulatory guidelines. Some other statistical points that have received different interpretation in the international regulations are finally evoked and discussed.","2888":"The determination of the area under concentration-time curve (AUC) is the most important parameter of a non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis. The calculation of AUC is usually performed by the trapezoidal rule. The aim of this work is to examine the reliability of this method still considered as a reference. The trapezoidal rule was compared to a selection of calculation methods often owning to other fields of research i.e., rectangular rule, Simpson and Tchebychev rules and log trapezoidal rule. The specific interest and limits of each method were discussed according to the kind and the type of pharmacokinetic profiles i.e., logarithmic or nonlogarithmic and the number of concentration-time couples. We obtained the following results: 1) The rectangular rule is the most simple and less effective method. 2) The trapezoidal rule remains an interesting method particularly when the profile is monologarithmic or nonlogarithmic. The efficacy of this method increases with the number of points of the pharmacokinetic profile. 3) The Simpson and the Tchebychev rules give very good results particularly when the number of points is higher than 7 and 6 respectively. 4) The log trapezoidal rule is an excellent method for the treatment of a logarithmic profile. 5) Both Tchebychev and log trapezoidal rules give accurate results when compared to the true AUC values. Further, it must be pointed out that this determination is depending on an arbitrary choice of points. Finally, the trapezoidal rule is not always the best method to determine AUC. If the analyst has only a pocket-calculator, he will obtain best results with the Simpson method than with the trapezoidal rule.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","2889":"It is commonly recognized than opioids analgesics have an major place in the treatment of pain. In spite of guidelines, opioids drugs remain underutilized in chronic cancer pain and acute severe pain. Among the possible factors, involved in the insufficient use of opioids drugs, is the fear (opiophoby) of physicians, nurses, patients and family to induce or to maintain an addiction. This review examines the potential of iatrogenic addiction. We will examined the place of morphine-like drugs in the treatment of severe acute pain and chronic cancer pain, the definition of dependency in pain patients, the assessment of the dependency potential in patients treated for pain. Available studies indicate that iatrogenic addiction is quite scarce and that the risk for a major tolerance is very small. Further studies will be necessary, since opioids analgesics may also be useful in some non-cancer chronic pain.","2890":"This study evaluated the effect of injection time on pharmacodynamic of a single subcutaneous bolus of nadroparine (7500 anti-Xa IC U) evaluated by anti-Xa activity (Hepaclot and Heptest) and by activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT by auto PTT reagent). 10 healthy male volunteers were studied at 4 different 24 hours periods with 4 different injection times (6 am, 12 am, 6 pm, 12 pm) and with a one week wash-out period between each period. No chronopharmacological variation of the anti-Xa activity evaluated by Hepaclot was found. However the anti-Xa activity evaluated by Heptest was higher at the sixth hour after 12 am injection (p = 0.0022). No difference on APTT values was observed whatever the injection time. So the injection time of nadroparine has a weak influence on anti-Xa activity and no effect on APTT; Before to conclude on the lack of chronopharmacological effect of nadroparine, it seems necessary to evaluate such a possibility with higher dosage, with sick and older subjects.","2891":"Since the demonstration that imidazoline and guanidinium alpha-2 adrenergic agonists induce some of their functional effects by a \"nonadrenergic\" mechanism, many efforts have been done to identify an imidazoline receptor. Binding studies have allowed to characterize two classes of potential imidazoline receptors: the \"(p-amino)clonidine\" and the \"idazoxan\" binding sites. These last, that we named \"imidazoline-guanidinium receptive sites\" (IGRS) on the basis of their ligand-recognition properties, have been identified, for the first time, in the proximal tubule from rabbit and human kidney. In the present report we will summarize the studies that led us to the characterization of IGRS.","2892":"Opioid substances act, both in the central and peripheral nervous systems, by regulating--via a specific receptor of the mu, delta or kappa type and a G protein--the activity of either of three recognized cellular effectors: adenylate cyclase, a K+ channel and a Ca++ channel. In the short term, opioid effects are of a neuromodulatory origin: they are likely to reflect opioid inhibition of neurotransmitter release (e.g.: of substance P in the spinal cord). In the long term, opioids induce the two adaptative phenomena known as tolerance and dependence whose mechanisms are considerably less well understood. Tolerance refers to a decreased responsiveness to the opioid upon repeated administration of the drug. Tolerance might reflect desensitization, a process which involves uncoupling of opioid receptor and of G protein (in the case of homologous desensitization) and, possibly, down-regulation of a G protein which the opioid receptor shares with other types of receptor (heterologous desensitization). Dependence refers to a latent, opioid-induced physiological state which expresses itself as a typical excitation syndrome upon withdrawal of the drug or administration of an opioid antagonist. The molecular events whereby dependence develops are unknown, yet they may involve (i) adenylate cyclase supersensitivity, an adaptation reaction where upon withdrawal of the inhibitory opioid induces an enhanced activity of the enzyme and, (ii) increased release of neurotransmitter (presynaptic facilitation).","2893":"Buprenorphine, a synthetic central analgesic, marketed since 1987, was rapidly suspected to be subject to abuse. We tried to confirm this abuse in the context of our analytical activity at the Drug Dependence Evaluation and Information Centre. The study was based on 50 drug addicts admitted to Marseille Hospital between June and October 1992. Buprenorphine and its N-dealkylated metabolite were identified in the urine by high performance liquid chromatography equipped with a diode array detector. Nine (18%) of the 50 samples analysed were positive for buprenorphine and\/or norbuprenorphine, with a confidence interval of 8 to 28%, which confirms the existence of abuse of this analgesic.","2894":"","2895":"The following article deals with the quality control program proposed since 1988 to the French laboratories performing the measurement of cyclosporine concentration in whole blood or in plasma. First, we describe how the program was organized and its evolution over time. Second, we discuss the main results generated. Those results enable us to state positively that the methods in use at present in the laboratories are precise and give highly reproducible results.","2896":"The term cholecystokinin (CCK) refers to a family of related peptides whose members play hormonal roles in the gastro-intestinal tract. The sulfated octapeptide CCK-8 [Asp-Tyr(SO3H)-Met-Gly-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2] is also abundant throughout the central nervous system where it satisfies the criteria for a neurotransmitter. CCK interacts with at least two types of receptor called CCK-A and CCK-B receptors. These binding sites can be distinguished on the basis of their affinities for different molecular forms of CCK. Moreover, selective nonpeptide antagonists have been developed for CCK-A and CCK-B receptors. CCK-A receptors occur predominantly at the peripheral level where they are responsible for the digestive effects of CCK: intestinal and biliary smooth muscle contraction, pancreatic enzyme secretion, trophic effects on gastric and intestinal mucosa and regulation of feeding. Some brain CCK-receptors belong to the A-type, but the majority of them are CCK-B receptors. High densities of brain CCK-B receptors are present in cortical and limbic areas such as the amygdala and the hippocampus. At the peripheral level, CCK-B receptor antagonists are active on gastrin receptors, and these two receptors are similar if not identical. Experimental evidence suggests involvement of brain CCK processes in 4 domains: modulation of dopaminergic function, control of pain sensation, anxiety and memory formation. Thus, CCK-B antagonists may be useful to treat certain neuropathological conditions associated with CCK dysfunction.","2897":"Potent and selective CCK-B agonists with good bioavailability have been designed by modifying the natural CCK-8 peptide. Thus, BC 264 [Boc-Tyr(SO3H)-gNle-mGly-Trp-Me(Nle)-Asp-PheNH2] is a highly potent (0.15 nM) and selective agonist for CCK-B receptors which cross the blood brain barrier. Following i.v. injection of [3H]pBC 264 in mouse, the ligand was found in its intact form in brain tissue. Analgesic studies and in vivo binding experiments have shown that the CCKergic system could modify the release of endogenous enkephalins, whereas mu and delta opioid receptor activation modulates the release of endogenous CCK. Behavioural studies performed after local injection of CCK-8 or BC 264 into the postero-median part of the nucleus accumbens have shown the involvement of CCK-A receptors in motivation and\/or emotional states of rats. In the anterior part, CCK-B receptor stimulation could be involved in attention and memory processes. BC 264 systemically administered in mice increased fear and\/or \"anxiety\" in the black and white box test. In the elevated plus maze, BC 264 increased the emotional responses of the \"anxious\" rat and decreased these responses in \"non anxious\" animals. These results suggest that endogenous CCK could play a critical role in mood modulation through CCK-A\/CCK-B receptor stimulation. Dysfunctioning of the CCK-A\/CCK-B pathways could be implicated in anxiety and panic attacks.","2898":"To explain the central hypotensive action of clonidine- and rilmenidine-type drugs, a recent hypothesis suggested the involvement of imidazoline preferring receptors (IPR) insensitive to catecholamines. Binding studies performed on neuronal membranes prepared from the human Nucleus Reticularis Lateralis area (NRL) showed that rilmenidine was twice as selective as clonidine for the medullary IPRs. Voltammetric experiments revealed that these substances preferentially inhibited the activity of catecholaminergic neurones within the NRL, privileged site for their hypotensive action, rather than the activity of the neurones of the Locus Coeruleus (LC) where these drugs induce their sedative effect. The mechanism of the inhibitory action of these compounds upon the neurones of the NRL definitely involved IPRs when the inhibition of the LC neurones involved classical alpha-2-adrenoceptors. These functional studies also showed that rilmenidine exhibited a selectivity twice as important as clonidine, the reference substance. Poly- and monoclonal anticlonidine antibodies cross-reacting only with imidazolines allowed to detect and immunoreactive substance in the human serum. The amounts of that substance thus measured were higher in some hypertensive patients than in normotensive subjects. The identity of that immunoreactive substance with \"endazoline\", the endogenous ligand of the IPRs, is presently analysed.","2899":"There is an increasingly body of evidence, obtained both in vitro and in vivo, showing that exogenous opioids have a variety of effects on cells of the immune system. The consequence is that opiates at pharmacological concentrations suppress cell-mediated immunity, as reflected by depressed T-dependent antibody production by B lymphocytes, altered T lymphocyte functions such as proliferation, delayed-type hypersensitivity, graft-versus-host responses and decreased cytotoxic NK cell activity. The macrophage\/monocyte oxidative burst and phagocytosis are also impaired, effects probably mediated by various opioid receptor types as they are blocked or reversed by naloxone, an opioid antagonist. Other possible mechanisms of interaction remain to be elucidated: exogenous opioids can act on neurons of the central nervous system, thereby activating the neuroendocrine system with a subsequent increase in serum glucocorticoid levels. Another potential link between the central nervous system and lymphoid tissue is the sympathetic nervous system, via which opioid-induced activation could result in noradrenergic inhibition of the immune system. The clinical consequences of these suppressive effects on the immune system are seen in the striking increase in the incidence of infections in intravenous opioid addicts. The advent of AIDS and the identification of intravenous drug abusers as a critical risk group have propelled interest in this area. Data obtained both in vitro and in vivo with various experimental models shows that morphine increases susceptibility to bacterial and viral infections, the latter effect possibly being related to a depressive effect of opioids on gamma-interferon levels. The dosage and time of administration strongly influence the results: it appears that chronic opioid treatment in vivo induces a state of immune tolerance, with normal resistance to viral infections, whereas short or single administration has a detrimental effect. In the former context, other factors such as a morphine-induced increase in CD4+ cell numbers may tend to enhance the infectivity of HIV-infected subjects.","2900":"Cancer pain in general responds in a predictable way to analgesic drugs and drug therapy is the mainstay of treatment, successfully controlling pain in 70 to 90% of patients. Some pains do not respond so well but can usually be ameliorated by the judicious use of adjuvant analgesics, non-drug measures and the active involvement of the multi-disciplinary team.","2901":"The aim of this paper is to study the analgesic effects of meperidine (pethidine) on nervous trunks. First we compared the analgesic effect of pethidine in surgery of knee and femur. Meperidine was randomly administered either by femoral block or intravenously. The onset of analgesia was shorter with femoral block (5 minutes against 146 minutes). In the surgery of shoulder, nerve block with meperidine was performed using intersclalenic block. Plasma concentrations ar lower (maximum of 0.29 mg per liter) than intravenous therapeutic concentrations (between 0.5 and 0.7 mg per liter). So we can conclude as do other papers, there is a direct effect of meperidine on nervous trunks. This effect is probably mediated by receptors located on nervous trunks.","2902":"Several drugs and techniques have been developed to improve the quality of post operative analgesia. Opiates are always the first intention drugs, specially with new molecules (buprenorphine, nalbuphine ...). Paracetamol and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can be efficacious in the post operative period alone or as adjuvants. The alpha 2 adrenergic agonists use must be specify. The patient auto-controlled administration and the transdermal administration of opiates are useful techniques to provide effective analgesia with optimal safety.","2903":"Should certain drugs be contraindicated in children who have had febrile seizures or who present a risk of convulsions? There are no publications dealing specifically with this problem. However, many drugs can induce convulsions and may be dangerous if they are associated with another determining factor (e.g. fever). Camphor known to be toxic and its use must be avoided in young children. Other terpenes given to children with colds may be convulsant if they are used for prolonged treatment or associated with other convulsant drugs (sympathomimetics, piperazine derivatives, antihistamines, etc.). On the basis of a retrospective study of 23 cases of febrile convulsion among 343 cases of infantile convulsion reported to the Poison Control Center and the Pharmacovigilance Center of Marseille between 1973 and 1991, we propose that camphor and sympathomimetics be avoided and that potential convulsant drugs and their association be used with caution.

Over a 9-month period, the center received 115 requests from members of the public for information. 82.6% of callers were not members of the health professions and wanted information for themselves (61.7%, 67.6% women) or their children (26.08%). The questions mainly involved drug interactions (28.7%), side-effects (26%) and precautions for use in particular circumstances (20%). 178 proprietary drugs (47 of which had been bought over the counter) were mentioned. The main therapeutic classes were neuropsychiatric drugs (n = 41), cardiovascular drugs (n = 17) and analgesics (n = 16). A number of communication difficulties and problems of a deontological nature were encountered. Full information was provided in every case, together with advice on prevention to about half the callers.","2922":"Life-threatening accident during anesthesia scarcely happen but the consequences may be dramatic. We report our experience of an allergo-anesthesia consultation created since 1985 in Nice hospital. 452 patients have been investigated: 1) 109 for life-threatening anaphylactic and anaphylactoid drug reactions. They have been investigated by: skin tests intradermal reactions (IDR) and prick tests with substances used during anesthesia (drugs and latex) and for all the muscle relaxants; the radioabsorbent test (RAST) for the muscles relaxants, propofol and latex; the human basophilic degranulation test (HBDT) for all the other drugs. We used the imputability decision table to classify the reactions. When anaphylaxis diagnosis was established (14) an \"allergy card\" was given to patients which identified the drugs to which they had a positive reaction. 62 patients have presented an anaphylaxis: 57 due to muscle relaxants (37 due to suxamethonium), 4 to latex and 1 to a gelatin. Patients were subsequently contacted and 50 of the 58 have responded. 18 of these patients have received 22 new anesthesias. Without exception, the advises to avoid a drug have been followed, 17 patients have a positive reaction to a muscle relaxant. In four of these, another muscle relaxant (skin test negative) was used without any trouble. For the other 13 who had shown a cross reactivity, all the muscle relaxants had been rejected and another anesthetic technique have been used: local anesthesia (3 cases), epidural (2 cases) associated or not with narcotics (propofol, midazolam), general anesthesia (propofol, midazolam, droperidol, phenoperidine). These drugs were all skin test negative.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","2923":"Pefloxacin (Peflacine) can give rise to thrombocytopenia, although the responsibility of the drug can be difficult to demonstrate in infectious patients and those receiving other drugs simultaneously. We have collated 18 cases in which the responsibility of pefloxacin was suspected. In 13 cases, the patients were also taking other drugs which may have been contributory (heparin, Bactrim, Augmentin, ranitidine,...). The remaining five cases were of particular interest as pefloxacin was the only drug administered. The mean age of the patients was 75 years, and the mean bodyweight 56 kg (range, 47-65 kg). The pefloxacin dosage was 800 to 1,600 mg\/day i.v. or p.o., i.e. 13-18 mg\/kg\/day. Thrombocytopenia occurred from five to 19 days after beginning treatment and resolved between 7 and 12 days after drug withdrawal. A number of factors argue in favor of dose dependency: 1 patient had high plasma concentrations (peak and residual); thrombocytopenia occurred in one patient when the previous, well-tolerated dosage of 800 mg\/day (for 15 days) was increased to 1,600 mg\/day; thrombocytopenia resolved in one patient when the dosage was reduced to 400 mg\/day (1 tablet) and continued for a further 10 days. This toxic reaction may be avoided by reducing the drug dosage to 400 mg\/day in elderly patients with a low bodyweight. Differential blood counts appear to be warranted for patients at risk.","2924":"Neurological side-effects were a limiting factor with older quinolones. Although they appear to be less frequent with the newer fluoroquinolones, we observed nine such cases at Amiens University Hospital over a four-year period. The patients were six women and three men, with a mean age of 61 years. They received a mean dose of 800 mg\/day of pefloxacin. Four had septic shock, one left ventricular failure, and seven had signs of cholestasis (signs of liver failure were absent). Neurological manifestations occurred between 24 hours and seven days after starting treatment and disappeared within 24 to 48 hours of stopping the drug or reducing the dosage. They included myoclonia (3 cases), convulsions (2 cases, one with concomitant theophylline), delirium and agitation (2 cases, one in a patient on steroids) and confusion (3 cases). Plasma drug levels were determined in six patients and were above normal peak levels (10 micrograms\/ml) in five. Pefloxacin was measured in the cerebrospinal fluid in two cases (8.7 and 15.0 micrograms\/ml). Neurological manifestations during pefloxacin treatment are probably related to overdose (plasma levels were above normal in 5\/6 cases), possibly being favoured by cholestasis (7\/9 cases) and\/or hemodynamic factors (5\/9). Symptoms can resolve when the pefloxacin dosage is reduced.","2925":"Benign intracranial hypertension (BICH) is a rare adverse event. We report the case of a 31-year-old female drug addict who had been seropositive for HIV since 1987. She had stage IV C1 AIDS, and was receiving intravenous amphotericin B for generalized cryptococcosis with no neuromeningeal involvement. She developed BICH that regressed when the antifungal drug was withdrawn and treatment for cerebral edema was started. BICH is a clinical entity involving intracranial hypertension with no focal neurological signs or detectable intracranial lesion. The manifestations include headache, transitory or permanent visual disturbances (diplopia, loss of visual acuity) and the perception of intracranial noise. The cerebrospinal fluid is under increased pressure but the composition is normal. The eye fundus examination shows papillary edema, and the neuroradiological workup is normal. BICH can only be diagnosed once an expansive intracranial process, neuromeningeal infection, and non-communicative hydrocephalus have been ruled out. In the majority of cases, no etiology is found. Such cases of idiopathic BICH usually occur in overweight young women, although drugs can be implicated. Amphotericin B has not previously been held responsible for BICH. On the basis of this observation, we present a review of the literature.","2926":"Aseptic meningitis is a very rare drug reaction involving non-steroidal antiinflammatory agents (ibuprofen and sulindac), antibiotics (cotrimoxazole, trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin) and miscellaneous drugs such as carbamazepine, human immune globulin and muromonab CD3. Meningeal symptoms occur a few hours after drug intake and resolve without sequelae within one or two days after drug withdrawal, mainly in young females with systemic lupus erythematosus or mixed connective tissue disease. Biological findings and radiological investigations are not suggestive of an infectious etiology or rheumatological\/neurological disturbances. Diagnosis is simple when recurrent episodes coincide with drug ingestion.","2927":"We have studied 12 reports of pneumonitis associated with nilutamide (Anandron) and notified to the French regional ADR monitoring centers between November 1987 and June 1990. The mean age of the patients was 71.5 +\/- 9.5 years, and 35% (5\/12) had a history of lung disease. All 12 patients developed dyspnea, cough and fever, 4.7 +\/- 6 months after starting nilutamide. Ten patients (83%) required admission to hospital. The symptoms revolved in 11 cases when the drug was withdrawn. In the other case, they disappeared when another drug was stopped and the dose of nilutamide was reduced. Six patients were treated with glucocorticoids. The severity of nilutamide-associated pneumonitis appears to be related to the time between the onset of dyspnea and consultation.","2928":null,"2929":"The cost of adverse drug effects first began to be analyzed in the 1960s, with an evaluation of related admissions to hospital in the USA. The average cost per patient of adverse events requiring hospitalization in France was estimated at 6,250 F in neurology units in 1979\/1980, and 14,920 F in geriatric units in 1984. Fifty per cent of these events were avoidable. A second approach is to measure the cost of certain iatrogenic manifestations, e.g. fever due to fipexide, stenosis and perforation of the small intestine due to potassium chloride, gastrointestinal bleeding due to NSAIDs, kidney damage due to aminosides, etc. Calculations of the economic impact of adverse drug effects must also take into account indirect costs such as loss of productivity. The lack of such studies should not make health care specialists forget the magnitude of the problem.","2930":"When a new antidepressant is put on the market, everyone is afraid of its possible cardiac effect. The control of unicellular potentials can give an hint about that effect, without being able to assess its severity; the 27 antidepressants commercialized in France have been reviewed. 180 cases of conduction delays from 10,060 overdosage in the Paris poison center were found, 7 times more often than with other drugs. In addition the 30 centers for monitoring of side effects of drugs have collected 38 cardiac side effects, as well arrhythmias or conduction disturbances.","2931":"In a prospective, multicenter study, we evaluated the incidence of adverse cardiac effects in 1097 patients receiving 5-FU as a short i.v. perfusion or as a continuous perfusion over 3 to 5 days. There were 29 cardiac events (incidence 1.6%; 4.5% in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease, 1.1% in the remainder). Adverse effects were more frequent in the patients with advanced WHO (WHO = OMS) stage (2 or 3) primary tumors of the upper respiratory or digestive tract, or of the gastrointestinal tract, when 5-FU was given as a continuous perfusion. They also appeared to be more frequent in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease, and mainly occurred during the second or third day of the first course of treatment. Retreatment of eight patients with 5-FU led to the recurrence of symptoms in five. The outcome of these adverse cardiac effects was generally favorable, but 11.5% of the patients died.","2932":"","2933":"","2934":"","2935":"Although the decision to continue or to stop prematurely a clinical trial is not solely based on statistical tests, they bring useful objective arguments to the data monitoring board. However, the multiple use of statistical tests leads to increase the risk of false positive conclusions in favor of one of the treatments, and several methods have been developed to address this problem. This article presents the four major strategies that are being used for monitoring clinical trials, as well as the rationale for planning and using such statistical monitoring procedures.","2936":"In order to fulfil the ethical principles linked to the protection of patients randomized in a controlled clinical trial, monitoring procedures need to be set up. In this context, a committee of experts, called the data monitoring committee is in charge of reviewing regularly unblinded data to assess the quality and the relevance of the trial, to evaluate the evidence of an emerging treatment difference and to control the rate of occurrence of serious adverse events. After each meeting, the monitoring committee reports to the steering committee its recommendation to continue or to stop the trial prematurely. Protocol modifications might be proposed as well. Illustrated with several examples, this article reviews different situations a monitoring committee might have to tackle with.","2937":"Cyclosporine A is a potent immunosuppressive agent, widely used in organ transplantation, in bone marrow transplantation and in the treatment of some autoimmune diseases. Changes of its absorption, a metabolism mainly processed by the liver and a concentration-related nephrotoxicity lead to the need of a careful drug monitoring, allowing to obtain blood levels that must be low and nevertheless sufficiently efficient. Cyclosporin A may additionally yield some numerous drug interactions. Those with potentially serious issue must be mandatory avoided and distinguished from those less severe that only have to be followed up. The strategy differs according to the nature of the interaction (i.e. pharmacokinetic\/pharmacodynamic): the posology will have either to be adjusted or the risk\/benefit ratio will have to be taken into account to decide any change in the dosage regimen.","2938":"In transplantation, the advantage of therapeutical follow-up of immunosuppressive treatment involving cyclosporine is generally recognized, even though the ideal therapeutic index has as yet not been perfectly defined. Cyclosporine blood level determination is merely one factor among many others in therapeutical success, but if replaced in its context, can provide valuable and relevant information. A certain number of rules exist regarding the use, and pharmacological surveillance, of cyclosporine in all patients treated with this medicine. These rules take into consideration the patients immunological responsivity, the length of time since transplantation, the position of cyclosporine in immunosuppressive treatment, related pathologies and medicines. However, it is of special interest to consider a few points according to the nature of the indication. In kidney transplantation, and nephrotoxicity, determination of cyclosporine blood level will help differential diagnosis between an immunological origin (graft rejection) and an iatrogenic origin; in liver transplantation the consideration of metabolite determination, and study of metabolite ratio, will enable the gathering of information on performance status and toxicity hazards. In some cases, the necessity to administer intravenous cyclosporine, and the special weakness of some patients as in bone marrow transplantation, treatment surveillance patterns will be altered. Finally in spite of our lack of background information, the use of cyclosporine in autoimmune diseases has shown that principles of treatment and surveillance differed from one pathology to another, this being increased in some cases (juvenile diabetes), or occasional and even non-essential (psoriasis).","2939":"Cyclosporine therapy after heart and lung transplantation implies a number of specific aspects such as: kidney deficiency associated to heart failure, which delays its use as for cardiac transplantation; intestinal absorption disturbances that could be linked to the cystic fibrosis disease for lung transplantation. For both types of transplantation, local efficiency could indicate an interesting, but still unexplored therapeutic effect. Finally, it seems that the immunosuppressive effect could be linked to important pharmacological effect on calcium and could explain the specific aspects of rejection of patients under cyclosporine.","2940":"The therapeutic drug monitoring of cyclosporine (CsA) requires not only correct methodological conditions but also taking into consideration of numerous other factors involved in the value of blood drug concentrations. Main factors concern: the clinical state of patients. Liver function and bile flow act predominantly on drug clearance; the choice of monitoring parameters and of sampling time. Comparison was done of information given respectively by area under the curve and different sampling times. Usually blood concentration is monitored with trough level plus eventually another concentration measured 4-6 h after drug administration; the time-table. Blood concentrations are measured at steady-state period. Bioavailability of CsA increases in the immediate postoperative period after transplantation; ways of CsA administration. Trough level is influenced by dividing up of the daily dose. In case of continuous i.v. infusion mean blood concentration, but not trough concentration, is measured; drug interactions. Several drugs modify blood concentrations of CsA. Others induce an additive nephrotoxicity or immunosuppressive effect. Recommended blood trough concentrations vary with clinical indications, experience and therapeutic habits of each transplant center. Currently recommended values (CsA whole blood concentration determined by specific method) are 150-250 ng\/ml in renal, heart, liver and bone marrow grafts, during the 3 months after transplantation, with good renal function. Concentrations are often higher for lung transplantation.","2941":"Cyclosporin A (CyA) is intensively metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 III monooxygenases A systems in the human liver. Among about twenty metabolites, only twelve of which have been identified, and found in the blood of treated patients. The major metabolic pathways are hydroxylation and N-demethylation of the various amino-acids of the parent compound. Quantitatively, and although there are some differences depending on whether one refers to the residual concentration or to the Area Under Curve (AUC), major metabolites are always, in decreasing significance, M17, M1, M18, and M21. Metabolite\/CyA ratio is subjected to numerous variations from one patient to another which can be explained by pharmacogenetics, but can also be affected by the type of graft, the hepatic performance status, and related treatments. Be that as it may, it is metabolites 17 and 1 which are especially present in the blood in large quantities. In fact, if one considers the relative percentage of metabolites in comparison with CyA, expressed in blood AUC, values of 79, 39, 21 and 15% are noticed for M17, M1, M18, and M21, respectively. These percentage become 170, 65, 16 and 10% if one refers to residual concentration. In the aggregate, these results may be extrapolated to the tissues and it has been shown that, excepting the liver which contains high M17 concentrations, metabolites overall appear in equal or lower levels than CyA. They are widely diffused throughout the tissues and the highest levels are found in the liver and kidneys, then in fats and pancreata.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","2942":"Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressive medicine widely used in all grafts and organ transplantations. Its pharmacokinetic characteristics, especially its intensive metabolism, result in great variability potential between and within patients justifying blood levels' determination in patients treated with this drug. If the biological medium (whole blood) selection is of the utmost importance regarding the quality of the result and its validity, the accuracy of the result compared to the blood levels of the drug will depend on the selection of the determination technic involved. At present, various analytical methodologics are available: the immunological technics involving radioactive or non-radioactive tracers, and HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) technic. The latter requires good chromatography experience; it takes more time to be implemented due prior extraction of cyclosporine from the biological media. This extraction can be effected with organic solvents or by column chromatography: these various technics will be discussed and compared. This methodology enables one to determine metabolite concentrations. Regarding immunological technics, multiclonal or monoclonal antibodies are available for technics involving fluorescence polarization. However, for radioactive tracings and enzymic tracers, only one specific antibody is available. It is important to take into account the specificity of these antibodies relative to the various metabolites regarding results interpretation, their crossing rate being altered in accordance with antibodies and related pathologies. The validity of these technics will be discussed in words of accuracy and exactitude. The laboratory arrangement, the feasability and cost of the technic are also factors to be taken into consideration. At present selection tends towards to most specific technics.","2943":"The major circulating blood fraction of cyclosporin is localized in red blood cells. It is 58% for blood levels of less than 1,000 ng\/ml. Beyond this concentration, a fall of this percentage is noticed which is related to a saturation phenomenon which occurs in its binding on an intracytosol protein, cyclophilin. Other fractions are distributed in the following manner: 27.5% on lipoproteins, 5% on albumin, 4% on polymorphonuclears, 5% on lymphocytes and 0.5% in the free state. There are various binding sites in the lymphocyte: in the membrane, cytosol on cyclophilin, and on the nucleus. The manner of binding on various plasma proteins, blood cells and platelets results in manifold pharmacological, pharmacokinetical, and toxicological results which are discussed here.","2944":"","2945":"The molecule E2 is present on T lymphocytes and thymocytes and is implicated in rosette phenomenon most probably via interaction with CD2. The discrepancy observed between rosette levels and lymphocyte phenotypes in the follow-up of kidney-transplanted patients treated with antilymphocyte globulins (ALG), methylprednisolone and azathioprine leaded us to study the effect of ALG on E2 molecule.","2946":"The therapeutic use of cyclosporine (CsA) requires total blood levels to be monitored with a specific assay, since this drug is nephrotoxic, has a narrow therapeutic index, shows wide intra- and inter-individual differences in its pharmacokinetic behaviour and can interact with other drugs. The parameter generally measured is the residual blood concentration at equilibrium; levels are occasionally again measured four or six hours after CsA administration. Patients are monitored every two days during the first two weeks following organ transplantation, a frequency which gradually declines to monthly determinations at four to six months in the absence of complications. The therapeutic range of blood CsA concentrations is still poorly defined. In renal, liver, heart and bone marrow transplantation most authors recommend concentrations of 100-250 ng\/ml for the first three months when renal function is satisfactory. Ways of administration (i.e. continuous infusion or dividing up of the daily dose) must be taken into consideration to assess values of blood concentration of CsA.","2947":"The usefulness of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in the transplantation field has become evident over the last couple of years. Different mAbs have been used as a prophylactic treatment after transplantation, in a therapeutic way against acute organ rejection and new diagnostic tools to predict clinical rejection immerge. One can even hope that with humanised mAbs or human mAbs obtained by repertoire cloning the formation of human anti-mouse antibodies will be solved although on the one hand this appeared not to be a big problem and on the other hand anti-idiotypic antibodies can still be expected. However, the most puzzling question is how the mAbs modulates the immuno-response and this not only in organ rejection but also in auto-immune diseases. Only one out of many CD25 mAbs with seemingly similar epitope recognition can be used in therapeutical treatment of acute Graft versus Host Disease. The same mAb is not, however, very efficient in the prophylactic treatment of kidney transplantation without association of suboptimal doses of cyclosporin A. Another example is a CD4 mAb which is efficient in the treatment of polyarthritis with no side effects but which provokes transient but clear side effects when used in psoriasis or multiple sclerosis patients. A second CD4 mAb with high inhibitory activity in several bioassays compared to the first CD4 mAb has no beneficial effect at all on polyarthritis. Also the question why there is a percentage of \"no response\" patients among apparently identical \"good response\" patients remains unanswered. However it becomes clear from these experiences that: 1) mAbs recognizing a similar epitope and being of the same isotype will not automatically have the same effect in therapy. 2) side effects may be depending of the disease treated. 3) the activities of mAbs in bioassays and even animal models very often do not reflect the in vivo situation in human. 4) efficiency of the treatment with mAbs can be increased by a better understanding of the mode of action and increased efficiency can be expected by association of several mAb or mAb with drugs for the \"no response\" patients and should be the next step in the therapeutical use of mAbs.","2948":"The diagnosis of acute rejection in heart allograft recipients receiving cyclosporine is still an important challenge. The poor diagnostic value of clinical signs and the ECG means that regular endomyocardial biopsies must be performed. Despite their diagnostic value during the first year after transplantation, endomyocardial biopsies are less sensitive there after and currently suffer from the lack of a universally accepted histological classification. Doppler echocardiography can be used for routine surveillance and has proven reliable for the diagnosis of acute rejection with various clinical presentations when used in conjunction with endomyocardial biopsies. Immunohistological examination of myocardial specimens can further increase the sensitivity of histological diagnosis. Similarly, immunoscintigraphy with indium 111-labelled antimyosin antibodies is of value for the prediction of acute rejection after the first year. Therapeutic approaches have been standardized, but must still be tailored to the individual patient according to the severity of the rejection and the presence of associated infection and\/or metabolic disturbances.","2949":"Allograft rejection reaction must be integrated in the broader sense of alloreactivity, i.e. involving a huge T cell repertoire with a high number of alloreactive precursors. This reaction is modulated by the particular immunological state induced by chronic renal insufficiency, by haemodialysis and by the primary kidney disease. The imperfect effect of current immunosuppressive drugs is illustrated by a sizeable proportion of grafts undergoing a chronic rejection process where many growth factors are involved. It has to be noted that allostimulating cells are different from target cells. At present, the therapeutical rejection involves corticosteroids and serotherapy, but it is hoped that new immunosuppressive drugs will increase the efficacy of the rejection crisis treatment.","2950":"Rejection is still a major problem in liver transplantation: 50-70% of patients present at least one acute episode, while 5-15% develop chronic rejection. Acute rejection is suggested by clinical signs and abnormal laboratory test results, but only histological signs on biopsy specimens are adequately specific. The three most frequent elementary lesions are a portal infiltrate, bile duct alterations and endothelial inflammation. Several systems have been forwarded to classify the degree of rejection. Chronic rejection is characterized by a progressive reduction in the number of interlobular bile ducts. It does not respond to available immunosuppressive drugs and thus requires retransplantation. Prophylactic immunosuppression is usually based on the triple-drug combination cyclosporine\/azathioprine\/corticosteroids. The orthoclone OKT3 and FK506 have recently been proposed for prophylactic use in this setting. Treatment of liver graft recipients with cyclosporine carries a number of specific disadvantages, particularly with regard to gastrointestinal interactions (delayed intestinal absorption in patients with cholestasis, bile derivation, diarrhea or receiving cholestyramine; possibility of a sharp increase in blood cyclosporine levels when the Kehr drain is clamped), and drug interactions (cyclosporine metabolization of CP450-IIIA accounts for most such interactions). The results of radioimmunoassay and TDx must be interpreted with care, and HPLC remains the reference technique in borderline cases. Cyclosporine is hepatotoxic in about 20% of cases, generally giving rise to cholestasis. This toxicity is dose-dependent and therefore diminishes when the dosage is reduced. Most groups initially treat rejection with corticosteroids. The response to treatment is generally evaluated in terms of liver function tests.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","2951":"The evaluation of anti-rejection treatments raises a variety of methodological problems depending on the clinical phase of development. The first administrations in man are carried out in order to study the profile of a drug and are sometimes performed in healthy volunteers, but more frequently in transplanted patients. It is then necessary to select and evaluate the assessment criteria which will be used in comparative studies to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the new treatments compared with reference drugs. Factors responsible for variation may be related to the nature of the organ transplanted, the clinical condition of the donor and host and their immune compatibilities. Associated treatments and the multidisciplinary environment in which an organ transplant takes place should also be taken into consideration. After registration, knowledge about the new anti-rejection drug continues in order to identify the optimum conditions for its use, its true therapeutic efficacy and to determine possible new indications.","2952":"Beta-blocker eyedrops used on asthmatic patients are known to enhance asthma which is, as chronic bronchitis, an obstructive disease of the lung, and an authentic bronchoconstriction is always possible. A single blind parallel trial in 3 groups of 10 patients with grade II and III chronic bronchitis, was conducted to evaluate the cardiovascular and bronchial tolerance of 3 beta-blocker eyedrops: timolol, betaxolol and carteolol compared to placebo. The following parameters were measured during a 90 minutes period: heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, forced expiratory volume in one second, vital capacity. It appeared that only heart rate lowers significantly under the influence of the beta-blocker eyedrop, the other parameters did not change and no difference was noticed between the three eyedrops. However, comparison of individual values showed a significant decrease of forced expiratory volume in one second in certain subjects and this, although betaxolol is a beta 1 selective beta-blocker. Caution should be taken each time beta-blocker eyedrops are prescribed for glaucoma to patients with chronic bronchitis.","2953":"Previously used in Alzheimer disease Tacrine (THA): tetrahydroaminoacridine has shown a rise of hepatic transaminase enzyme activity (TEA) in 18% of patients for Summers and 19% for Ames. Although studies using THA from USA or Canada have noticed a rise of TEA in 30% of the patients, after a treatment course with French THA we also have noted a rise of TEA in 12% of the Alzheimer patients. However, these secondary effects yielded to the end of treatment. These studies have been done with THA from different origins and different associations. Summers, the Canadian group and the French one have used THA in association with lecithin, when american group study has been made with no additional product. Therefore we have initiated a trial with oral THA in AIDS patients. 52 patients with HIV infection (26 in the IVC1 group and 26 in IVC2 group) have been treated with the same THA as the one used for Alzheimer french group. The common dosage was 150 to 200 mg (3 to 4 of 50 mg dosing capsules per day). The THA has been synthetized such as having an over 99% pureness product. After a period of 260 months\/patient no elevation of TEA has been noted in any patients of our group. These results observed in HIV advanced patients with this THA are discordant with the one observed in Alzheimer's study. The dosage used in AIDS is twice higher than the one used for Alzheimer which gives us credit to the lack of hepatic toxicity in HIV advanced patient after 7 months of treatment.","2954":"This paper presents the results of an intensive surveillance based on a network of general practitioners and following 200 patients treated by famotidine 40 mg per day during 6 to 8 weeks. Four patients with a previous experience of adverse reaction to another H2 antagonist did not relapse with famotidine. None interaction was reported with drugs such as beta-blockers, oral anticoagulants, theophylline, benzodiazepines, calcium antagonists. Twenty four clinical side effects were reported; For 5 patients (2.5%) the treatment had to be stopped. The most common side effects were neurological. The results are compared with those of previously published studies.","2955":"In a survey of the literature, phenacetin appears to be responsible for an increased risk of urothelial tumours in humans, especially renal pelvis tumour. Few observations have suggested an association between bladder cancer and phenacetin containing analgesics however. To assess this association in France, a case-control study of bladder cancer (143 cases, 120 controls) was undertaken. We point at some methodological difficulties, such as difficulties of recall, definition of a control group, non-responses, possible French distinctive features of analgesics use. Results are not able to confirm the suspected relationship between bladder cancer and phenacetin use.","2956":"Forty-one patients with mild to moderate hypertension were included in a multicentre trial. The objective was to assess the influence of the time at which nitrendipine (Nidrel 20 mg) is taken on its efficacy and tolerance. The drug was administered once daily either in the morning or in the evening during 2 consecutive periods of 28 days. Efficacy was assessed on an ambulatory recording of blood pressure over 24 hours. Globally, nitrendipine results in a statistically significant drop in blood pressure which is not influenced by the time of administration. Treatment response varies greatly according to the initial value of ambulatory diastolic blood pressure. There is a clear antihypertensive effect if ADBP is greater than or equal to 90 mmHg and no hypotensive effect if ADBP is less than 90 mmHg. The incidence of adverse effects did not vary according to the time the drug was taken. Biological tolerance was excellent. Nitrendipine, administered once daily alone appears to be an efficient antihypertensive agent, well tolerated both clinically and biologically. Its efficacy is maintained over a 24-hour period regardless of the time at which the drug is taken.","2957":"The antiarrhythmic drugs are unfortunately not devoid of adverse effects. A good watching of their safety is necessary, according to their cardiovascular adverse effects which are the most dreaded. Among these and beside the proarrhythmic effects, the negative inotropic effects can impair cardiac function. Different mechanisms could explain the negative inotropic effects of antiarrhythmic drugs: reduction of adrenergic sensitivity, decrease of calcium concentration in the cardiac cells. Pharmacokinetic properties of antiarrhythmic drugs can modulate their cardiovascular adverse effects. As a matter of fact the plasmatic concentration of the unbound drug, which could be correlated to the adverse effects, fluctuates according to the protein binding of the drug. In an other way the first pass hepatic effect of a drug can be saturable so that the resulting dose-concentration curve becomes exponential. Drug disposition might also be very different from one patient to another depending on kidney and\/or hepatic function and genetically determined metabolic pathways.","2958":"Antiarrhythmic drugs are able to save patients from emergency dysrhythmic situations or to avoid symptomatic disorders when used in a prophylactic goal. However they can also induce adverse effects. Cardiovascular adverse effects, and especially proarrhythmic effects, are the most dreaded. Analysis of the underlying mechanisms of the onset and perpetuation of sustained arrhythmias could lead to a better understanding of causes of proarrhythmic effects and thus to a limitation of their occurrence. Antiarrhythmic drugs can modulate the three principal factors which are involved in the onset of arrhythmias: individual predisposing factors, trigger mechanisms and environmental factors. This multiparameter modulation will conduct either to suppress the arrhythmic disorders (antiarrhythmic effect) or to impair it (proarrhythmic effect). According to the numerous factors which take part in the onset and perpetuation of arrhythmia, incidence of proarrhythmic effect of antiarrhythmic drugs is very difficult to evaluate.","2959":"Ventricular pro-arrhythmic effects of antiarrhythmic drugs correspond either to an aggravation of a pre-existing arrhythmia or to the development of a new arrhythmia not yet observed for a patient. More easily inducible ventricular tachycardias (VT) take part in this latter category. The incidence of ventricular pro-arrhythmias is difficult to evaluate but should be close to 3 to 10% during antiarrhythmic treatments. Two main mechanisms can be involved in pro-arrhythmia: 1) reentry can cause sustained VT complicating a pre-existing cardiopathy when a sodium channel blocker is prescribed, 2) early post depolarizations can result in the occurrence of torsades de pointes complicating an antiarrhythmic treatment which prolongs ventricular repolarization and QT interval. The main risk factors of pro-arrhythmia are in the first case the existence of antecedents of VT or V fibrillation with an altered ventricular function and in the second case an important prolongation of QT with bradycardia and hypokalemia. The incidence of pro-arrhythmia should decrease when these risk factors are taken into consideration. However the diagnosis of pro-arrhythmia should be systematically evoked by clinicians since these unwanted side-effects can occur with any class Ia, Ic and III antiarrhythmic drug and any drug which prolongs QT. If this diagnosis is confirmed, the need for an antiarrhythmic treatment should then be systematically evaluated in any patient taking into consideration the benefit\/risk ratio of the treatment.","2960":"Sudden cardiac death accounts for at least 50% of the mortality of patients with heart failure. Available clinical evidence suggests that lethal ventricular arrhythmias are responsible for the vast majority of cases of sudden death in heart failure. However, despite extensive clinical investigation over the last decade, there has been relatively little experimental study of the mechanisms underlying the development of lethal ventricular arrhythmias in heart failure. In addition to the original process leading to myocardium alterations, the role of other arrhythmogenic mechanisms such as ventricular overload and neuro endocrine activation remains to be elucidated. In ventricular hypertrophy both reentry and triggered activity may induce arrhythmias. Some studies on experimental models of heart failure did not provide consistent results concerning electrophysiological modifications and their relations with arrhythmias. Few studies in man in vivo are in favor of prolongation as well as increased dispersion of repolarisation in patients undergoing heart transplantation for idiopathic dilated cardio-myopathy. Further studies will need to be undertaken to clarify mechanisms underlying arrhythmias in heart failure.","2961":"Main sources of transmembrane ionic current that lead to cellular electrical activity are described. In hypertrophied myocardium, action potentials are usually markedly prolonged. Current modifications that could be responsible for this are not well established. However, despite divergent observations, one can postulate that calcium current density (current per area unit) is maintained to its normal level and that action potential lengthening can be related to a prolonged Na-Ca exchange current, a prolongation due to the lengthening of the calcium transient (systolic increase of intracellular calcium). In heart failure, calcium current appears reduced. It is markedly depressed in dilated human atria which greatly shortens action potential plateau. In cat, during the initial overload phase which triggers right ventricle hypertrophy, action potential plateau is also transiently reduced, which could correspond to an initial reduction of calcium current before its normalisation. Several effects are probably related to fiber stretch and appear to involve different types of stretch sensitive ionic channels.","2962":"A valid in vitro evaluation of antacid capacity should consider: 1) the intragastric pH-range; 2) the antacid mechanism; 3) the dependence of antacid activity from intraluminal flux variations; 4) the interaction between proteins and antacids. Pharmacologically, a static method allows 1) to quantify H+ binding sites at different pH-end points of the titration: pH 3.0, 2.0 and 1.0 and 2) to characterize the antacid mechanism, neutralizing activity and\/or buffering capacity. In dynamic conditions, using the \"artificial stomach-duodenum\" model the antacid-induced resistance to acidification was measured, the antacid mechanisms were characterized in regard to intraluminal gastroduodenal flux variations and the incidence of antacid activity on duodenal pH was evaluated. These procedures were applied to antacid evaluation of proteins, as natural antacids, and of drugs containing aluminium salts alone or combined with magnesium salts. Pharmacologically, antacid drugs exhibited a greater amount of H+ binding sites when titration end-point was pH 1.0 than pH 3.0 corresponding to the development of neutralizing activity and\/or buffering capacity. In dynamic conditions, the drugs, like proteins, induced a potent resistance to acidification related to gastric emptying fluxes. Antacid effect was supported by neutralizing activity and\/or by buffering capacity. It was prolonged by removal of H+ ions since lagtimes for recovering initial pH were longer than antacid total emptying, the dilution of intragastric content by H+ impoverished secretory flux contributing thus to prevent gastric acidification. At duodenal site, proteins and aluminium-containing antacids induced the same duodenal pH as controls, without antacids, while magnesium-containing antacids increased it.","2963":"","2964":"","2965":"","2966":"","2967":"","2968":"Lovastatin and simvastatin are the first licensed compounds of a potent new class of lipid lowering drugs whose mechanism of action is to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway in the liver. Inhibition of cholesterol synthesis leads to upregulation of LDL-receptors in the liver and subsequent increased LDL clearance. Both agents are pro-drugs (lactones) which undergo extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism to the beta-hydroxyl acid form. These drugs are liver specific and have low systemic exposure as open-acid forms (plasma concentration &lt; 5% of oral dose). Thus, theoretically both drugs have low potential for systemic adverse events. They are potent and effective agents for the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia. The adverse experiences reported for both drugs demonstrate an excellent safety profile.","2969":"Static and dynamic equilibrium (posture and gait) is indispensable for a normal behavior in human. Its mechanisms are nearly the same in superior species and in man, but humans are the only ones to have acquired exclusively biped upright position and gait. Equilibrium is a sensory function involving 3 sub systems: visual, vestibular and sensori-motor (proprioceptive), controlled by cerebellum and cerebral structures. Information coming from those 3 sub systems must be concordant. In case of discordance, the patient is in a state of sensory conflict. This conflict can induce disequilibrium or true vertigo. After a recall on equilibrium, the authors report the results of an epidemiologic study upon 5298 patients suffering of balance disorders and treated by an alpha-blocker: nicergoline (30 mg\/day during 6 months).","2970":"A study was performed in 220 out-patients with Parkinson's disease followed by general neurologists. The general characteristics of the patients are similar to those observed in the large epidemiological studies. The main conclusion concerns the low use of dopamine agonists. It confirms the discrepancy between drug prescription in general practice and the data from therapeutic drug trials.","2971":"The authors discuss the results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised study on the efficacy of mebendazole versus placebo in the treatment of human toxocariasis in 45 and 43 patients respectively, who exhibited evocative clinical and biological symptoms and a seropositivity. Scores were used to quantify clinical (20 parameters) and biological (blood count, sedimentation rate, determination of total and anti-Toxocara IgE, serodiagnosis by immunoelectrophoresis) abnormalities. The reassessment were done 1 month after the end of treatment. Analyzing the results showed a similar efficacy of mebendazole and placebo on the score of clinical signs; the score of biological abnormalities was significantly reduced in mebendazole group, but the serodiagnosis by immunoelectrophoresis was the only parameter that was significantly normalized. These results corroborate previous prospective studies and allow to make a conclusion in favour of a moderate efficacy of mebendazole.","2972":"In order to fulfill its task, the Lyon-C institutional review board (CCPPRB) developed standards for the evaluation of clinical research protocols. This check-list envisages 1- the mandatory documents in the absence of which the protocol will not be considered, 2- scientific quality standards, 3- ethical quality standards. An agreement on the use of such standards in France might improve the functioning of institutional review boards (CCPPRB) and the quality of clinical research.","2973":"","2974":"","2975":"","2976":"","2977":"","2978":"","2979":"","2980":"Small bowel and colonic motility can be studied either indirectly by the determination of the transit time or directly in recording bowel contractions. Small bowel transit time is usually assessed with the H2-breath test when colonic transit time is mainly determined fluoroscopically in studying the progression of radiopaque markers along the large bowel. Scintigraphic techniques are promising but not routinely used techniques. In the small bowel, gut contractions are recorded with manometric probes. To study colonic movements, electromyography is more usual than manometry. In both cases, whatever the technique employed, the large inter- and intra (topographic and nycthemeral) variability need to be considered for the interpretation of the motor patterns. Rectoanal studies led to consider two aspects: how the rectum acts as a reservoir and anal function. The ability of the rectum to be a reservoir is assessed either by the volume remaining in the rectum during the rectal perfusion with saline or by the determination of the maximal tolerable volume of distension. Manometry and\/or electromyography test anal function at rest and during a rectal distension, straining or a voluntary contraction.","2981":"By comparison with striated muscle, the main features of digestive smooth muscle are richness, complexity and diversity specially with thanks to the enteric and prevertebral nervous neurons which add up their effects to those of the central nervous system. The morphological and molecular characteristics of the smooth muscle contractility begin to be unveiled, but a lot of basic knowledge is still needed for further pharmacological advances.","2982":"Our stomach produces daily a large amount of hydrochloric acid at a pH close to 1. This secretion represents a more than one million-fold in H+ ion concentration as compared to blood and intracellular medium of a pH of 7.4. It is due to a specialized cell, the parietal cell, which contains a unique transport enzyme, the (H+, K+)-ATPase. The parietal cell is itself under the control of several endocrine and paracrine stimuli operating through appropriate receptors. The recent progresses achieved in the knowledge of these key elements of the acid secretion mechanism had led to the development of specific and potent inhibitors of crucial interest in the treatment of ulcer disease and reflux oesophagitis such as histamine H2 and (H+, K+)-ATPase antagonists.","2983":"We have investigated the mode of action of the sulphasalazine in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's ileitis. We point out: a) the activity of sulphasalazine and its derivative, 5-aminosalicylic acid in prostaglandin's metabolites pathway, by inhibition of lipoxygenase; b) a moderate activity on the cell-mediated immunity by weak inhibition of natural killer activity; c) the 5-amino salicylic acid is effective strongly like a radical scavenger.","2984":"","2985":"The marketing approval (AMM) is based on criteria of pharmaceutical quality, efficacy and safety of use. Before marketing, the data are collected by means of double-blind, randomized, prospective clinical trials that compare the study product to a reference product. A post-AMM assessment is needed to define the increase of the medical benefit (ASMR) and the therapeutic value of the new drugs. The quantification of the ASMR is essential for registration on the list of drugs reimbursable for those who benefit from Social Security. The evaluation of the therapeutic value and the nature of the affection treated are the criteria upon which the reimbursement ratio is chosen. After marketing, the reevaluation of the medical benefit and the drugs' usefulness may be compared to the treatment's net medical cost (direct + indirect cost--avoided cost) in cost\/utility or cost\/benefit studies. The Transparency Commission has worked out a scale of assessment of the ASMR which will orient recommendation, or non-recommendation, of registration on the list of reimbursable drugs as well as price fixing proposals. In the future, the Transparency Commission is to strengthen its position regarding the good use of the drug through a better prescriber information system. Thanks to the pharmaco-epidemiology and the pharmaco-vigilance data, the Transparency Commission will be able to guarantee the post-marketing follow-up of the drugs. The examination of the products' conditions of use, the reevaluation of the treatment's advantages based on the utility studies and the epidemiological surveys, and the cost-benefit studies will contribute to a medical control of health spending linked to drug consumption.","2986":"","2987":"","2988":"","2989":"","2990":"Tolerability is one of the main problems of the long-term use of antiparkinsonian drugs, especially in the advanced stages of Parkinson's disease. Since 1988, we have performed a prospective study to assess the clinical and therapeutic factors which may influence the tolerability of a new antiparkinsonian drug, selegiline. 168 patients, with a mean age of 68, were treated with selegiline in combination with L-Dopa or with L-Dopa and a dopamine agonist (bromocriptine, lisuride or piribedil). After an average of 19 months, 23 adverse effects (13.7%) were noted during the first three months of treatment with selegiline. Discontinuation was required in only 10 cases (5.9%) with 9 out of 10 for a psychotic episode. Neither age, nor the stage of the disease, nor the dose of levodopa in combination with selegiline or the presence of mental disturbances seemed to be predicting factors for appearance of a psychic episode. If selegiline with levodopa or with bromocriptine and levodopa appeared to be safe antiparkinsonian combinations, significant psychic side effects occurred with piribedil in combinations with selegiline and levodopa. A possible explanation was that selegiline potentiates piribedil side-effects.","2991":"Methylated xanthines are responsible of minor and major side effects on the central nervous system specially seizure.

Among those surveyed, 28.9% were taking regularly drugs, mainly analgesics (6.5%), antiallergic drugs (5.2%), oral contraceptives (4.6%), anti-inflammatory drugs (4.1%), antihypertensive drugs (3.6%), tranquillizers (3.4%), hypnotics (2.8%) and drugs for rheumatic disorders (2.7%). The study indicates the frequent consumption of drugs by Spanish drivers, and suggests the need to regulate drug consumption by drivers.","2993":"Eighties were characterized by the development of new antibiotic drugs and the introduction of systemic fluoroquinolones. The consumption of antibiotics at the Toulouse University Hospital was evaluated during the ten last years. Total consumption remained stable around 350,000 days of treatment. From 1980 to 1989, consumption of penicillins rose (from 36.6 to 43.7% due to the introduction of gram negative acting drugs). The increase in cephalosporin use (from 5.4 to 9.9%) is explained by the development of third-generation products. In contrast, we observed a decrease in the use of aminoglycosides (from 12.2 to 5.4%) tetracyclines and chloramphenicol (from 13.4 to 1.7%) as well as urinary quinolones (from 6.8 to 3.5%) without any variation of macrolides and drugs used in the chemotherapy of tuberculosis.

Patients with either urinary tract of respiratory tract mild infectious were divided into two age-dependent groups A and B. Group A: eight patients (65-80 years) received 200 mg of ofloxacin by the oral route every 12 hours and group B: eight patients older than 80 years, received 200 mg of ofloxacin by the oral route every 24 hours. The pharmacokinetic study was performed on treatment day 5. Plasmatic levels and urinary excretion of ofloxacin during 12 or 24 hours were assayed by means of high pressure liquid chromatography. Wide variations in plasma ofloxacin concentrations were observed within each group (Cmax range, group A: 1.9-9.2 mg\/l, group B: 1.6-10.0 mg\/l). Similar variability was observed for ofloxacin elimination parameters (CI\/F, renal CI(R)\/F) and half-life. In contrast, within-group and between-group differences in the volume of distribution adjusted for weight were not significant (group A: 1.22 +\/- 0.44 l.kg; group B: 1.49 +\/- 0.53 l.kg), but these values were approximately half those observed in the young adult. Plasmatic [CI\/F] and renal clearance [CI(R)\/F] of ofloxacin were correlated with creatinine clearance in both groups and in the overall population studied. Then the overall population was classified in terms of creatinine clearance [group 1: greater than 50 ml\/min; group 2: less than or equal to 50 (minimum 20) ml\/min]. The pharmacokinetics of ofloxacin in the elderly are characterized by a decrease in the volume of distribution and in plasmatic and renal clearances.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","2998":"Calcitonin and insulin are nowadays the most largely prescribed peptide hormones. It is therefore surprising that for some authors the relevant dosage of calcitonin remains a matter of concern. The dose-effect relationship was established twenty years ago, taking into account the kinetic analysis of calcium metabolism and the clinical data, enabling to assess effective dose of calcitonin. Our clinical experience concerning regularly followed-up patients confirms that the replacement dose of calcitonin is necessary and sufficient for managing the disorders of bone and calcium metabolism. Long-term calcitonin replacement treatment: represents a therapeutic approach preserving the integrity and the sensitivity of the hormone receptors, is devoid of the undesirable effects due to pharmacologic doses of the hormone. Therefore the compliance to the treatment is very high. Replacement therapy should become the rule governing the use of calcitonin.","2999":"Fictional case histories can be used as a tool by researchers interested in prescription, and they can also be used for quality control and in post-graduate medical teaching.

The functional relevance of the central 5-HT3 receptors is being established using selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ligands, which have been shown to modify behaviour in animal tests that is predictive of an action to reduce anxiety, schizophrenia and cognitive disorders. A remarkable feature of the effect of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists is their ability and potency to control a disturbed behaviour in the absence of effect on normal behaviour. This reveals an important role for 5-HT in different behaviours: indeed, the breadth of action of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists may be indicative of the critical importance of 5-HT in the control of catecholaminergic, cholinergic and peptidergic systems throughout the forebrain. Precisely how such effects are achieved remains a significant investigative challenge, with the potential for novel therapeutic developments being a major goal.","3007":"5-HT3 receptors have been the focus of much research during the last decade. They are characterised by being located on neurones both peripherally and centrally; 5-HT3 agonists cause a rapid depolarisation of the membrane potential which results from the opening of cation channels; the 5-HT3 response rapidly desensitizes. 5-HT3 receptors appear to have a modulatory role on other neurotransmitters. The identification of selective agonists and antagonists for this receptor type has allowed the discovery of several important new therapeutic applications. The use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in psychoactive illnesses is being explored clinically. In addition, ondansetron, a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, is already being used to prevent the severe nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

The parathyroid response was checked by measurement of PTH 1-84 and of nephrogenous cAMP before and after a 10 days therapy by phosphate (780 mg of elemental phosphorus twice daily). Before treatment a 16 per cent increase in PTH 1-84 (p less than 0.05) and a 34 per cent increase in nephrogenous cAMP (p less than 0.02) was obtained. After treatment the increases were respectively 34 per cent for PTH 1-84 (p less than 0.001) and 67 per cent for nephrogenous cAMP (p less than 0.001).

Only non depressed and non demented patients, previously treated with low doses of levodopa during less than one year, were included in this study. Mean age was 59 (range 36-68). After 12 months, the mean dosage of levodopa was higher in the placebo group than in the lisuride group (318 +\/- 121 and 274 +\/- 74 mg daily respectively). We observed a different decrease in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale with better scores in the lisuride group than in the placebo group, especially for the motor items (p less than 0.001) and the daily living (p less than 0.0001). The tolerance was similar in the two groups. This trial will be continued in open conditions over a period of 4 years to appreciate the incidence of motor fluctuations in the two groups.","3014":"A randomized cross over study was carried out in 12 healthy volunteers to investigate simultaneously the pharmacokinetics and the effects on urinary volume and electrolyte excretion after administration of single doses of 40 mg frusemide and a combination tablet containing both 40 mg frusemide and 5 mg amiloride. From a statistical analysis of plasma levels of frusemide and amiloride measured by HPLC methodology, no significant difference between the reference drug alone, frusemide, and the combination tablets was observed in mean peak plasma levels, mean times to peak or mean areas under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC). Frusemide and the combination tablet both produced a rapid and powerful diuresis in the 0-2 hours postdose period and did not differ significantly in urine output at any time point. However a difference in natriuretic activity was observed between frusemide and the combination with the latter producing a significantly greater sodium excretion in the 0 to 2 hours period (p less than 0.05). Potassium retaining activity throughout the 24 hours was marked after the administration of the combination, the potassium excretion being significantly less (p less than 0.05) than either control of frusemide alone. There was also a significant correlation between plasma levels of frusemide and the time course of urine and electrolyte excretion in healthy subjects.","3015":"Anti-rheumatic therapy has been targeted against the symptoms arising from chronic inflammation of the joint. This has resulted in the extensive use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. It is now becoming apparent that these agents have no beneficial effect on disease progression. This mini review concentrates on the formation and maintenance of pannus, the granulomatous tissue responsible for cartilage and bone erosion. This reveals a number of possible therapeutic targets. Protease inhibitors could be used to interfere with the degradatory processes. The diverse functions of endothelial cells suggest oedema formation, cell accumulation and supply of nutrients to the granulomatous tissue could all be targeted by appropriate therapy. Alternatively the immune processes that control pannus formation and state of activation could be regulated by interfering with antigen presentation and the cytokine network.","3016":"The three dimensional structure, electrostatic potentials and molecular dynamics of a series of tricyclic antipsychotic drugs and metabolites were examined by computer graphics and molecular modeling techniques. Three dimensional models of the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptor and of the dopamine D2 receptor were constructed from the amino acid sequences. The receptor models have strongly negative electrostatic potentials around the synaptic domains and a postulated ligand binding site. This indicates that protonated ligands are attracted to these receptors by electrostatic forces. Pharmacologically inactive trans(E)-thioxanthenes and phenothiazine ring sulphoxides had strongly negative electrostatic potentials around a part of the ring system. This may weaken their electrostatic interactions with the D2 receptor, and be the reason for their lack of potency in D2 receptor binding and related pharmacological tests. Molecular dynamics simulations in aqueous solution demonstrated that both the side chains and the tricyclic ring systems of the drugs are highly flexible, and move between different conformations in picoseconds.","3017":"Both intravenous and central administration of ketanserin, a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, decrease blood pressure and sympathetic nerve activity, suggesting a central origin of its effects. However, ketanserin also possesses alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocking properties. Selective 5-HT2 receptor antagonists devoid of alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocking properties, e.g. LY 53857 and cinanserin, fail to reduce blood pressure and sympathetic nerve activity. In addition, 5-HT2 receptor agonists increase blood pressure and sympathetic nerve discharge. Therefore, it seems improbable that blockade of central 5-HT2 receptors alone could lead to a reduction in blood pressure. In contrast, the selective 5-HT1A receptor agonists 8-OH-DPAT and flesinoxan decrease blood pressure and heart rate by a centrally-mediated decrease in sympathetic tone and an increase in vagal tone. The sympatho-inhibitory effects of 5-HT1A receptor agonists result from the stimulation of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors within the ventrolateral pressor area. These results suggest that selective 5-HT1A receptor agonists acting in the central nervous system could be developed for the treatment of hypertension. Indeed, drugs such as flesinoxan and urapidil are effective in this setting.","3018":"","3019":"A number of three-dimensional models of serotonin receptor recognition sites which were derived from a conformational analysis of their ligands and successfully used for drug design are reviewed.

Adrenaline, serotonin, dopamine and acetylcholine can thus be docked in their respective binding sites. There is an excellent convergence between the two approaches: modelling of the recognition site from its ligands and modelling of the receptor from its primary sequence.","3020":"There are four main classes of membrane-bound receptors: receptors which are also enzymes (tyrosine protein-kinase or guanylate cyclase), receptor channels, receptors coupled to G proteins (GTP binding proteins) and receptors with unknown transduction mechanisms. Receptors coupled to G proteins which have been cloned, constitute a superfamily of proteins containing seven hydrophobic transmembrane helices. The binding site of the ligand is within the hydrophobic core of the protein and the domain of interaction of the G proteins is constituted by the N- and C-terminal parts of the third intracellular loop, plus the C-terminal tail, adjacent to the transmembrane VII. G proteins themselves are also members of another superfamily. These proteins have highly conserved domains constituting the GTP binding site and they interact with the receptors by their C-terminal parts. Compounds such as mastoparan, substance P and 48\/80 directly stimulate G proteins, an action which probably mediates their exocytotic properties. A high degree of homologies between G protein-linked receptors explains the non-specificity of some antagonists (like beta-adrenergic blocking agents on 5-HT1 receptors). The discovery of new members of the G protein-linked receptors which have not yet been pharmacologically characterized, raises the problem of receptor classification.","3021":"","3022":"","3023":"","3024":"","3025":null,"3026":"Methotrexate (MTX) is used in the medical treatment of unruptured ectopic pregnancy.

Today, this side effect appears to be devoid of mystery, due to uncontrolled and inhibited ingestion of bismuth salts which increased the emergence of genetic and physiopathologic risk factors and brought about the cases of neurotoxicity. Bismuth therapy has shown major efficacy in the treatment of gastroduodenal ulcers. Colloidal bismuth subcitrate is as effective as the H2-receptor antagonists in peptic ulcer. In addition, it offers a lower rate of relapse. This therapeutic benefit has been attributed to a cytoprotective and demulcent action. Moreover bismuth acts as an antimicrobial agent, suppressing the organism Helicobacter pylori which occupies a central place in contemporary views on pathophysiology of ulcer disease. Side effects so far reported have been very infrequent mild and transient when the drug is used at low dosage providing blood-bismuth concentration above toxic values. Colloidal bismuth subcitrate complies to the requirements for a modern drug insofar as it is prescribed in period no longer than 6-8 weeks, followed by 8 weeks bismuth-free intervals.","3028":"","3029":"","3030":"","3031":"Rectal route with local or general effects, is an interesting possibility of treatment. Easy use and rapid absorption are two major advantages. But this therapeutic modality is not riskless. We report a case of septicemia with peri-rectal cellulitis which was generated by two ano-rectal ulcerations after using Trophires suppositories. The infection was favoured by local application of cortisone. Our original observation, with ano-rectal ulcerations and short use of suppository, confirms the idea of short-term treatment stopped in case of unwanted symptom.","3032":"To evaluate drug utilization during the last 15 days of pregnancy, one hundred six women were interviewed post-delivery in the CHU Bretonneau in Tours. Eighty-three percent received at least one drug during the 15 days preceding delivery and 27% more than 3 different drugs. Treatments for venous disorders (31% of patients), iron (31%), analgesics (25%), antacids (11%), magnesium (11%) and laxatives (11%) were most frequently used. In 92% of cases the drug was prescribed. Five women received a drug with potential risk for the neonate. However only one infant developed and adverse effect, possibly due to benzodiazepine (hypotonia).","3033":"In the course of 1979 the Netherlands Centre for Monitoring of Adverse Reactions to Drugs (NARD) received a remarkably large number of reports on patients with unusual and complex psychic disturbances, attributed to the use of the then recently marketed hypnotic triazolam. The interpretation of the data was difficult, however, and several questions could at that time not be properly answered. In the past 10 years a specific benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome has been identified, showing many similarities with the disturbances as reported in association with triazolam. In addition similar adverse experiences with triazolam have been reported in many other countries. Tablets containing 1 mg and 0.5 mg triazolam, as were widely used in the Netherlands, have in the mean time been globally removed from the market. It is concluded that the triazolam syndrome may be explained as a combination of strong benzodiazepine effects and withdrawal phenomena. The ultra short half-life of triazolam and the high doses used may have contributed to the problems as observed in the Netherlands. The signal perceived by the NARD appears to have been a valuable warning, rightly casting doubt on the safety of triazolam and the original dosage recommendations.","3034":"The survey of drugs used during pregnancy is necessary and the need for prospective studies is recognized. Health book distribution where drug intake is written since the beginning of the pregnancy allows a narrow therapeutic survey. The 350 first books analysis show that pregnant women use an average of well resorbed 1.8 drugs during 1rst and 3rd pregnancy trimesters. The most commonly used drugs are vitamins and iron (by 56% of women), non-narcotic analgesics (40%), antibiotics (40%), veinotonics (38%) and hormonal treatments (25%).","3035":"Metapramine (Timaxel) is a tricyclic antidepressant drug devoid of anticholinergic properties. As other psychotropic drugs, it may induce hyperthermia and several case-reports have been published. Agranulocytosis is an exceptional side-effect of this drug. Even if several cases have been reported to Pharmacovigilance structures in France, as far as we know there is no publication of this unwanted effect. The authors reported the case of an old woman who has presented two episodes of fever and asthenia. Blood formula was both times characterized by agranulocytosis without anemia nor thrombocytopenia. The accidental rechallenge of metapramine permitted to conclude to a causal relationship between these hematological events and metapramine intake.","3036":"By November 17, 1989, the MMWR published the 154 first reports of a syndrome consisting of myalgia and eosinophilia (EMS), occurring with the consumption of L-tryptophan containing products (L-TrpCp) and which might represent a new clinical entity. To standardize reporting over the country, the CDC of Atlanta developed the following case definition: 1) a peripheral blood total eosinophil count of more than 1 x 10(9) cells per liter 2) generalized myalgia sufficiently severe to affect a patient's ability to pursue daily activities 3) the exclusion of infections or neoplastic conditions. The FDA then, announced its intention to seek a nationwide recall of all tryptophan containing products, followed by other european countries (UK, Germany, France). In France, a first decree (January 4th 1990) completed by a decree on May 11th confirms this decision for one year. This measure did not concern the medicinal products or some dietary supplements for newborn or young children. Since December 11th, 1989, 24 cases have been reported to the Regional Adverse Drug Reaction Monitoring Centres in France. These cases share the same features as the cases notified previously in the USA: overrepresentation of females, no relationship with the time and the daily intake, clinical similarities to the Shulman syndrome, and unknown prognosis. Now, more than one year after the onset of this illness, it seems that discontinuation of the ingestion of L-TrpCp can resolve or improve the symptoms in most cases, but sometimes the syndrome can persist. The causal relationship between the ingestion of L-TrpCp and this syndrome has been established. Whatever the mechanism for the development of EMS among tryptophan users remains unclear, as well as the role of eosinophilia and the factors for fibroblast proliferation. The epidemic emergence of this syndrome in July 89 raises the possibility of the contamination of tryptophan during the manufacturing process. To confirm this hypothesis, the same unusual peak in HPLC analysis was found both in case-associated L-Trp lots and in implicated-japanese manufacturer L-Trp lots in USA. But this would not explain the previous EMS reports before this contamination. Other hypotheses consist an inabnormality of tryptophan metabolism and\/or an autoimmune process.","3037":null,"3038":"A retrospective study of the muscular adverse reactions of fibrates has been conducted from the last 5-years reports of the 30 French Regional Centers of Pharmacovigilance, centralized in the common data bank located in Lyon. Fifty four reports in which at least one fibrate stated as suspect (according to the WHO's definitions) have been reviewed. Those 54 reports represent 13% of the side-effects reported with fibrates during this same period. Fibrates seem to be involved as frequently as prescribed, so fenofibrate was the most frequently suspected and the most prescribed. The most usual terms found were \"myalgia\" and \"elevation of CPK\". This study shows evidence of the interest of the data-bank of the French System of Pharmacovigilance (which has collected 36,890 reports with all the drugs during the same period); harmonization in the choice of the terms selected for computerizing the cases would improve the exploitation of this sum of data.","3039":"The methodology of a retrospective study of the side-effects of the most prescribed lipid lowering drugs, essentially fibrates, is described.

The indication of this new formulation in the treatment of community acquired RTI required an updating of its activity against respiratory pathogens. A total of 260 isolates were included in a study using MIC determination (agar dilution technique): the mode MICs for Haemophilus spp., Branhamella catarrhalis, streptococci, S. pneumoniae ranged from 0.016 to 0.5 mg\/l; no difference was noted between beta-lactamase producers and non producers in Haemophilus and B. catarrhalis; coagulase positive staphylococci, E. coli, K. pneumoniae isolated from RTI exhibited mode MICs not exceeding 4 mg\/l (except for methicillin-R staphylococci mode MIC greater than 128 mg\/l). Simultaneously the pharmacokinetic parameters were determined in healthy volunteers after a loading dose (500 mg) of the drug: 7 consecutive samples collected after a light meal provided the following data: Cmax = 7.77 +\/- 2.2 mg\/l; Tmax = 2.33 +\/- 0.23 hrs; t1\/2 beta = 1.18 +\/- 0.19 hrs; AUC = 22.17 +\/- 6.4 h.mg\/l. Cmax and AUC were half of these values after administration of 250 mg. These results, together with the known intrinsic beta-lactamase stability of cefuroxime, should ensure sufficient in vivo concentrations and effective in vivo antibacterial activity against most respiratory pathogens after oral administration of cefuroxime-axetil.","3046":"ETAHP was a randomized multicentre study in general practice. The objective of the study was to assess the clinical safety of RU 28318, a new aldosterone antagonist, compared with spironolactone. 80 hypertensive patients were recruited by 52 general practitioners and treated with 160 mg of RU 28318 or 80 mg spironolactone (the doses had previously shown to be pharmacologically equivalent) for one year. The main end-point was the occurrence of gynecomastia. During the follow-up period, 18 gynecomastia were observed, 7 in the RU 28318 group and 11 in the spironolactone group, after 4 to 5 months of treatment. This difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.15). There were no statistically significant differences for the other clinical or biological end points. Centralized randomized allocation of treatment and transmission of data were carried out using a telematic system (the French Minitel system). The observed rate of gynecomastia in the RU 28318 group, not statistically different from that in the spironolactone group, was in agreement with the results of others studies conducted at the same time and resulted in the discontinuation of the development of the molecule.","3047":"The effect of polyethylene glycol-adenosine deaminase (PEG-ADA) therapy on biochemical, immunological and clinical abnormalities in an ADA-deficit child with severe combined immunodeficiency has been studied. Following PEG-ADA therapy, total lymphocytes, lymphocyte subsets (CD3, CD4 and CD8) and the response of lymphocytes to non specific mitogens increase significantly. The improvement of immunological functions is closely related to a decrease of erythrocyte deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) concentrations. This study shows that PEG-ADA therapy is sufficiently effective to reduce and to maintain erythrocyte dATP levels at values compatible with normal immune functions. PEG-ADA represents an important progress for the treatment of ADA deficiency associated with severe combined immunodeficiency disease.","3048":"This study was a 6-month open trial of the effects of naftidrofuryl fumarate (600 mg\/day orally) on the clinical and electrophysiological signs of diabetic polyneuropathy in 15 patients. A scored clinical evaluation and an indexed electrophysiological examination were done at inclusion, and after 3 and 6 months. Mean clinical score and electrophysiological index was improved after 3 months of therapy, the improvement persisting at 6 months, with no change in control of diabetes. These results could be related to the vasodilating properties of the drug, causing an increase in nerve temperature, or to a specific neurotropic action, as recently demonstrated in rats. Controlled studies are necessary to confirm these results, and explore the mechanism of this improvement.","3049":"Sulfonylureas act as hypoglycemic agents by stimulating insulin secretion and improving insulin sensibility by a post-receptor mechanism. Their long term results mainly depend on extra-pancreatic mechanisms. Moreover they indirectly decrease triglyceridemia. Glipizide and gliclazide enhance fibrinolysis. Gliclazide also inhibits platelet aggregation and adhesion. The best indication of sulfonylureas is non insulin dependent diabetes with normal weight.","3050":"We performed 24 hours ambulatory blood pressure monitoring with non invasive devices in 233 normotensive patients during a workday. Their age ranged from 21 to 74 years (mean +\/- standard deviation = 39 +\/- 11, 37% females). These patients were mainly recruited on their workplace. Blood pressure monitoring was proposed to all volunteers without any history of hypertension, independently of the casual blood pressure measured by a doctor after 10 minutes sitting, just before monitoring. Patients were asked to note precisely their bedtime and the moment of getting up and to start a blood pressure measurement as getting up. This measure was used as the starting point of the 24 hours blood pressure curve for each patient. Pooling all patients in that way shows an important rise of blood pressure as standing up but no significant variation before. So we calculated the average blood pressure during the true time of activity and of bedrest for each block of 10 years from 20 to 60 years, separately for men and women. These values may be used as a guide when interpreting 24 hours blood pressure recordings.","3051":"","3052":"Five large, placebo-controlled, randomised prospective multicentre trials have been completed in several European countries, including a total of 728 patients with critical limb ischaemia (CLI). 593 had ulceration or gangrene and it is these which will be analysed in detail. Only patients with CLI who were unsuitable for further reopening procedures were entered and approximately a third of the patients had already had attempts at surgical revascularisation or interventional radiology. The maximum tolerated dose up to 2 ng\/kg\/min was determined during the first three days and then continued as a six-hourly intravenous infusion every day for two to four weeks, depending on the study. Pooled results showed a significant overall 21% increase in ulcer healing rate due to iloprost (p less than 0.001) compared with placebo. The improvement was greater in the three studies when treatment was continued for four weeks. The very hard end point of a major amputation or death during a 3 to 6 month follow up was available in three of the studies. Analysis of these together demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of major amputations after iloprost treatment (p less than 0.05). Thus the existing weight of evidence from a large number of patients suggests that a course of intravenous iloprost is useful in the management of patients with CLI and trophic skin changes, who are unsuitable for reconstructive surgery or catheter procedures.","3053":"","3054":"The introduction of levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease had modified both the prognosis and the current concepts of the disease, Although levodopa remains the most potent drug for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, its long-term use is associated with fluctuations in motor performance, abnormal movements and psychotic hallucinations. These late side-effects remain difficult to treat and thus raise questions as to the benefits and risks of first-time treatment with levodopa. Levodopa mainly alleviates akinesia and rigidity and to a lesser extent, tremor. Levodopa increases life expectancy. This paper reviews some recent developments in the pharmacology of Parkinson's disease. Recent findings indicate that not only central dopamine but also several other central neurotransmitter and receptor changes are involved in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. New data on autonomic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease are presented. New methods of investigation (clinical rating scales, pharmacological tests, imaging techniques, etc.) are reviewed. Finally, future strategies, e.g. the development of potent new symptomatic drugs (selective D2 and D1 agonists, new formulations of apomorphine, COMT inhibitors, new routes of administration, etc.) and etiopathogenic agents (antioxidative and anti-free radical drugs, etc.) are discussed.","3055":"Although current knowledge concerning drug responsiveness in the human heart is still deficient at both extremes of age, i.e. in the fetus and the elderly, new information is beginning to emerge. Pharmacodynamic studies have provided a fairly comprehensive picture of the appearance and maturation of the automatic receptors, and also of the emergence and development of sympathetic-adrenergic and parasympathetic-cholinergic mechanisms in the prenatal human heart. A timetable can now be drawn up for the earliest detection of intrinsic responsiveness to numerous adrenergic and cholinergic agonists and antagonists, and to inotropic and antiarrhythmic drugs in the human embryonic and fetal heart. Information on the antenatal cardiac pharmacodynamics of antiarrhythmics and inotropic drugs is mostly confined to some of the classical remedies, so that a systematic study of the effects of the various newer drugs is warranted. As legal abortions yield prenatal hearts only in very limited numbers, human embryonic and fetal cardiac tissue and cell cultures could also be used for such research under both physiological and pathological conditions, such as hypoxia or simulated ischemia. Since the sporadic data available on the transplacental efficacy of maternally administered cardioactive agents are encouraging, extensive clinical investigation into the pharmacological control of intrauterine cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure, based on new, high-resolution fetal echocardiographic techniques to monitor the success of drug therapy at the various stages of prenatal development, is also a stimulating challenge. In the elderly human heart, pharmacodynamically-based alterations in responsiveness to drugs have so far been conclusively proven for adrenergic agents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","3056":"The review begins by a brief presentation of the present state of knowledge on the multiplicity of brain dopamine receptors. The molecular basis of their distinction is reported, as well as the most specific ligands for each receptors type: D1, D2 (their isoforms A and B), D3, the putative D4 and autoreceptors. Then the review focuses on the respective location of D1 receptors (mainly linked positively to an adenylate cyclase) and of so-called D2 (lacking precision for distinguishing D2, D3 or D4), at the cellular level. The theoretical aspects of the functional interactions between these D1 and D2 receptors suggest four possibilities: Antagonism, indifference, additive synergy and potentiation. The effects resulting from the simultaneous administration of either D1 and D2 dopamine agonists or D1 and D2 dopamine antagonists were considered on various behaviours or functions. The four predicted types of interactions were found: D1\/D2 antagonism on thermoregulation, D1\/D2 indifference on nociception, additive synergy on the traction test, on anorexia or on the latency of the acoustic startle response, and finally potentiation on stereotypies or climbing behaviour. These data are completed by many other reported in an abundant literature about these interactions, which appear as modalities of regulation: their alterations might take part in several pathological states.","3057":"Acne is a frequent dermatologic disease of the teenagers. Methodology of antiacne preparations clinical trials has evolved recently, leading to better comprehension of acne treatment on acne lesions. The main rules for good clinical evaluation of acne treatments are: an objective counting of each individual lesions on a defined area (face, back), a global acne assessment, a therapy duration from 1 to 3 months or more, a skin safety evaluation for erythema, desquamation, dryness, itching, burning and oiliness with a 0 to 3 scoring system.","3058":"","3059":"","3060":"","3061":"","3062":"","3063":"Therapy of chronical arterial occlusive disease primarily includes evaluation and treatment of risk factors as prophylaxis for preventing progression of arteriosclerosis. When patients suffer from claudication walking exercise is the therapy of choice. Only in cases with severe claudication (walking distance under 100 m) and rest pain or ischemic ulcers reopening procedures are necessary. Bypass surgery is supported by the different transluminal angioplasty techniques, which are suited even for the older and multimorbide patients. A pharmacological treatment of peripheral arterial occlusive disease should be introduced only for preventing progression of the disease or reocclusions following surgery or angioplasty or in those cases in whom reopening techniques are not possible or not successful. Here prostaglandin E1 has been proven to be effective in many clinical trials. The combination of surgery, angioplasty and pharmacological treatment allows to avoid major amputations in most patients with critical limb ischemia.","3064":"In order to estimate the efficacity of prostaglandine E1 (PGE1) to dilate the obstruction in coarctation of the aorta (CoAo), we studied 16 full term neonates with heart failure. Over the 16 neonates, there was 5 with isolated CoAo and 11 with an intracardiac shunt. Over the 11 neonates, 7 had pulmonary hypertension. PGE1, at a dose of 0.05 microgram\/kg\/min associated to the classical treatment of heart failure were given on the 6 day of life. Effects of PGE1 were evaluated on clinical basis (presence of femoral pulse, blood pressure), echocardiographical basis (ductus arteriosus and aortic isthmus diameter) and morphological basis. In 15 neonates, the ductus arteriosus was open, in all cases CoAo diameter was the same. In 7 neonates with pulmonary hypertension, femoral pulse appeared. In conclusion, PGE1 increases post ductal perfusion by a right to left shunt through the ductus arteriosus, only in cases where pulmonary hypertension is present. No direct action on the aortic isthmus was observed.","3065":"Thromboxane A2 (TXA2) and prostacyclin (two prostanoids) are produced from arachidonic acid through the cycloxygenase pathway. The enzyme cyclooxygenase is inhibited by aspirin. Prostanoids are short-lived and thus exert their effects locally. Activated platelets synthetize TXA2 which reinforces activation of those platelets and platelets in the vicinity of the former. Complete activation however can occur in the absence of TXA2 synthesis. Prostacyclin is able to block all the platelet responses, but this would be achieved in vivo together with intense vasodilation. Primary adhesion remains unaffected, since it does not require platelet activation. There are other molecules endowed with inhibitory effects on platelets: PGD2, PGE1, adenosine, and EDRF (nitric oxide). These molecules, and prostacyclin, also have effects on other cells than platelets and smooth muscle cells: leukocytes, endothelial cells. Clinical investigations on the prostanoid system in physiology and pathology of the cardiovascular system have been hampered by analytical problems. Taking into account all these restrictions, a rational pharmacological approach is difficult, but newer molecules with dual and selective activity against TXA2 (both inhibitor of TX-synthetase and antagonist at the TXA2-receptor level) seem promising as anti-thrombotic agents.","3066":"The eicosanoids, a group of endogenous metabolites of the cell membrane phospholipid-derived fatty acid arachidonic acid (AA), are formed from AA via three main enzymatic pathways (cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, cytochrome P450) and include the classical prostaglandins (PGF2 alpha, E2, D2), TxA2, PGI2, the leukotrienes and HETEs\/HPETEs, the lipoxins and various epoxy metabolites. In the cardiovascular system the current interest is focussed on TxA2 and PGI2. TxA2 is released from activated platelets, shows potent platelet aggregating and vasoconstricting properties and is therefore considered to be important in thrombotic and ischaemic diseases. Therapeutic strategies directed at interfering with endogenous TxA2 include inhibition of synthesis (aspirin, selective TxA2 synthase inhibitors) and, more recently, specific blockade of TxA2 receptors. PGI2 is released mainly from the vascular intima, potently inhibits platelet aggregation and shows vasodilator and cytoprotective properties. PGI2 and chemically stable PGI2-derivatives have been shown to be effective in the treatment of severe peripheral ischaemic diseases and offer further interesting prospectives like prevention of vascular reocclusion in bypass surgery and balloon catheter angioplasty as well as organ preservation in transplant surgery. Other eicosanoids like PGD2 and the leukotrienes may also be important mediators in cardiovascular disease. Whether they represent targets for innovative drug therapy in cardiovascular disease remains to be investigated.","3067":"Prostacyclin (PGI2) has vasodilatory effects and a powerful platelet anti-aggregating action. Receptors which may be common to prostaglandin E1 have been described on the platelet membranes, the uterus and various human arterial segments. The platelet activity is linked to the activation of adenylate-cyclase, coupled with a G protein. The mechanisms of the vasorelaxant effect have still not been fully studied. PGI2 is synthesized and released in vessels by the endothelium and the smooth muscle cells, and is very unstable. Its short half-life probably restricts its role to local regulation of platelet activity and vasomotricity. The kinetics and pharmacological effects of prostaglandins have been studied during intravenous injections in healthy volunteers and patients. The synthesis of numerous stable analogues is designed to produce drugs which can be administered orally to treat arteriopathies. The side-effects linked with the vasodilatory effects restricts the use of maximally active dosage.","3068":"To determine the efficacy or safety of new topical treatments, more or less standardized studies must be performed. This article presents several examples of statistical analyses of the data currently seen in the dermatology area, and some guidelines for study sample size determination.

Regulators and manufacturers, in establishing requirements and systems for reporting of adverse drug reactions, should consider adopting this method.","3074":"We have treated with intravenous iloprost twelve patients suffering from cardiac insufficiency compensated under oral digoxin (NYHA class II) associated with severe limb ischaemia due to arterial insufficiency. Our aim was to study its possible interaction on digoxin levels and to evaluate the long-term efficacy of iloprost. Although iloprost slowed the digoxin absorption by approximately one hour, we found no clinically significant difference between the digoxin pharmacokinetic data before and during treatment by iloprost. Moreover, 11 out of the 12 patients had a good clinical fate after the treatment, which persisted at 6 months. The pain disappeared in 4 and diminished in 7; and all skin ulcers healed. This improvement has lasted up to two and a half years in two patients. The clinical tolerance of iloprost was acceptable despite frequent headache and flushing associated with hypotension and nausea. We conclude that iloprost seems to be a very promising treatment of severe limb ischaemia when no intervention on the proximal arteries is possible. The patients on digoxin can continue their treatment without dose alteration while starting on iloprost.","3075":"The purpose of the study was to evaluate the correlation between pharmacokinetic and physiopathological parameters of flecainide in elderly population. Pharmacokinetics of flecainide was determined in seventeen patients, aged more than 60 years, with clinically documented ventricular extrasystoles. Patients received 1.5 mg\/kg flecainide either by intravenous administration or by slow perfusion. In elderly population the elimination half-life, the mean residence time and the volume of distribution of flecainide are increased and the plasmatic clearance is reduced. All of these parameters show an important interindividual variability. The relationships between pharmacokinetic and physiopathological parameters were evaluated with multivariate analysis. The correlation obtained (89.86% for total clearance, 64.64% for volume of distribution, 42.59% and 31.12% for elimination and distribution half-lives) provide a relatively good determination of pharmacokinetic parameters of flecainide in aged patients.","3076":"The effects of short-term administration of indomethacin and propranolol were studied in two groups of patients with borderline hypertension and both central and peripheral hyperkinesia.

The increase in blood pressure after administrating propranolol was not significant (+3 +\/- 2%), as opposed to what was obtained with indomethacin, (+5 +\/- 2%, p less than 0.02). On the brachial artery, Indomethacin had no effect on blood flow and local resistance, on the other hand propranolol induced a decrease in blood flow in the brachial artery (-43 +\/- 3%, p less than 0.001) and an elevation of local resistance (+105 +\/- 18%, p less than 0.01). While central hyperkinesia depends on both prostaglandins and on the beta-adrenergic system, high muscle blood flow seems to be regulated by the beta-adrenergic system alone, without participation of prostaglandins.","3077":"","3078":"","3079":"The cyclosporine is widely used as an immuno-suppressive agent in association with others drugs.

Because of technical difficulties in the realisation, very few studies have been reported at the present time. From a practical point of view, the good choice of dosing of anti osteoporotic drugs must be studied from dose-response relationship curvus at the beginning of phase III clinical studies. From literature, it appears that the supposed optimal dosing of anti osteoporotic drugs have frequently been assessed empirically or from studies with patent methodological errors. Such studies should be on the contrary, prospective in parallel groups, randomized, double-blinded, using a pertinent, validated and more sensitive criteria of response.","3081":"Recruitment of patients in a clinical trial is often difficult and probably more difficult in pediatrics where parents are asked to give the informed consent. In order to recruit infants in a randomized clinical trial we organized group meetings with families (4 to 40 at a time) in order to describe the study procedures: random allocation to treatment or placebo and double blind assessment, and ask them to allow their child to participate. All meetings were conducted by both a pediatrician and a RCT specialist. Parents asked questions about the effects of the drug, the evaluation process and the follow-up procedures. Forty nine % of all eligible infants participated in the study.

On a sample of 588 subjects, factorial analysis confirm that it is not restricted to the assessment of the health, as most of the instruments actually available for that purpose. Its internal consistency is high. Correlations clearly show that its specific questions assessing the degrees of a) satisfaction and b) involvement (concerning each item) are clearly understood as having different meanings. Multiple regressions demonstrate that these specific questions strongly contribute to the explanation of the global quality of life or of the satisfaction concerning each item. Its reliability is good. It is very well accepted, and completed in no more than 15 to 30 minutes. This questionnaire is thus matching the criteria defining an effective assessment of the quality of life.","3083":"The personality characteristics of 62 subjects to be screened for eligibility in psychopharmacology studies have been assessed. The psychological screening comprised the Cattell anxiety scale (CAS), the Eysenck Personality inventory (EPI) and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) in its complete version (550 items). The comparison of the results to a population matched for age and status showed that the anxiety level was not different, extraversion factor was higher (p less than 0.001) and various personality traits were different. The most striking differences were observed on the factors: Psychopathic deviation, Mania, Schizophrenia greater than controls and social introversion lower than controls. These differences may evoke several biases, such as a recruitment bias or a specific personality pattern of young healthy subjects. In order to discuss these hypothesis, further comparisons with other centers are required to conclude.","3084":"One hundred and eighty five whole blood samples were analysed for cyclosporine levels by fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). 123 came from 4 heart transplant recipients (mean age +\/- SD: 47.50 +\/- 20.56 years) and 62 from 4 liver transplant recipients (44.50 +\/- 16.52 years). FPIA was done on plasma and whole blood in heart transplant recipients, on plasma in the liver recipients. HPLC was always done on whole blood. The results show a good correlation between FPIA on plasma (y) and HPLC (x) in liver recipients (n = 62, r = 0.935, y = 1.23x + 70 ng\/ml), slightly worse between FPIA on plasma (y) and HPLC (x) in heart recipients (n = 64, r = 0.610, y = 0.78x + 189 ng\/ml) and mediocre for FPIA on whole blood (y) and HPLC (x) in heart recipients (n = 123, r = 0.566, y = 1.35x + 594 ng\/ml).","3085":"Plasma exchange has been proposed for treating diseases mediated by circulating immune complexes. Removal of drugs during plasma exchange is a complex function of pharmacokinetic characteristics and specifications of the plasma exchange procedure: the time of plasma exchange, the filtered volume of plasma, the number of procedure. The effect of plasma exchange on the kinetics of drugs can be evaluated by different parameters: amount eliminated, extracorporeal clearance, fractional drug removal, extracorporeal elimination rate constant. Knowledge of the impact of plasma on the elimination of drugs is essential to the design of the dosage regimen in patients treated with plasma exchange. The fraction of the estimated amount in body removed by plasma exchange is the best parameter to evaluate the effectiveness of the exchange procedure, but it is necessary to know the proportion of body pool of drug at the start of the plasma exchange. Drug recovery by each exchange may account for 0.5%-30% of the dose. Controlled studies are needed to quantify the effects of plasma exchange on drug therapy. Dosage adjustment is sometimes required.","3086":"A study was carried out in order to investigate the chronotherapy (dosing time dependency) of an NSAID, the tenoxicam administered in ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis of the hip. These variations in efficacy exist as much for pain as for stiffness and maximum efficacy is obtained with administration at 8 am or 12 pm. Since the tolerance was good, we recommend midday as an optimal once-a-day dosing time.","3087":"","3088":"We describe 5 observations of cutaneous reactions or immediate hypersensitivity with different hypoglycemic sulfonylurea: Quincke's oedema with glibornuride, three urticaria (one was followed by bronchospasm and collapsus) with glibenclamide, one bullous dermatitis with carbutamide. With special regard to cross reactions between sulfonylurea: we observe the tolerance of glipizide after glibenclamide induced urticaria, tolerance of glicalazide after glibornuride induced Quincke's oedema and eruption, tolerance of glibornuride after chlorporpamide induced urticaria and Quincke's oedema. In the literature, cross reactions between 1st generation sulfonylurea are noted, but not cross reactions between 1st and 2nd generation.","3089":"The early treatment of acute myocardial infarction with beta-blockers represents a major advance in the management of this condition which was proved in a large serie of international studies including a total of about 30,000 patients, and in recent overviews. As a whole such treatment reduces total mortality by 13 to 14% during the first week (p less than .02) in the treated group compared with the controls. The mortality reduction appears most marked in the first two days, about 25%, after early intravenous infusion. Data on non fatal reinfarction in hospital suggest that early treatment reduces this risk by about 19% (p less than .01). Furthermore data on all patients suffering deaths, non fatal arrest and non fatal reinfarction indicate a 16% reduction in the risk of suffering one of these major events (p less than .001) and provide strong evidence of the beneficial effect of this class. Bisoprolol (Detensiel) is a high beta 1-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent without intrinsic sympathomimetric activity and local anaesthetic activity. Its pharmacokinetic profile appears extremely favourable with a plasma elimination half-life of about 10 h and a balanced clearance: bisoprolol is inactivated by liver metabolism (about 50%) and excreted unchanged in the urine (about 50%). Two pilot open studies were performed up to now with IV bisoprolol in acute myocardial infarction (MI). The first trial (n = 37) confirms the clinical and ECG safety of the administered dose regimen: repeated IV infusion of 1 mg up to a cumulative maximum dose of 5 mg and subsequent oral treatment with 10 mg once daily (o.d.).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","3090":"Pharmacokinetics of the depot antipsychotics are unclear and mainly depend on releasing from the depot site (according to a \"flip-flop\" model).

Radio Receptor Assay method was used (based on competition for dopamine receptors binding), with results expressed as chlorpromazine equivalents. They showed; a wide interindividual variability; considering each subject, intraindividual variability is attenuated; blood measurements are mainly higher than therapeutic ranges (especially for patients on fluphenazine decanoate).

Pragmatic solutions have to be proposed if we want to avoid delay in clinical research especially in degenerative diseases and in the evaluation of therapeutics in old age. We can focus the problems on the chapter \"Responsibilities of the investigator\": 1) His professional qualification whereas gerontology in not yet considered as a specialty; 2) Obtention of informed consent in general, especially written informed consent and leaflet informations given to patients; 3) Constitution of staff according to low motivation of nurses to research and low methodological knowledge; investigators' disponibility considering low density of nurses and physicians in geriatric units. Among specific points of \"Good clinical practices\" for home trials we need a careful selection of general practitioners interested in both geriatrics and therapeutic trials. Finally obtaining pharmacokinetic data in elderly needs probably a clear distinction between two ways: classical pharmacokinetic studies with samples of old healthy paid volunteers and pharmacokinetic study of a population in therapeutic trials.","3095":"Trans Epidermal Water Loss (TEWL) was used to evaluate the skin permeability modifications in vivo in man with an evaporimeter Servo Med. Measurements were performed on the forearms of healthy volunteers. At first, influence of the stabilization of the subjects and reproducibility of measurements between morning and evening, and from day to day were determined. The effect on the stratum corneum of 3 surfactants (Tween 60, sodium dodecyl sulfate and cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide) was studied. The results showed a variability of TEWL during the first 30 minutes, but there were no significant chronobiologic variations. After treatment by surfactants, TEWL increase was in relation with the importance of the aggression and the time after the end of the treatment. 3 hours were necessary to be sure that TEWL increase was only due to surfactants.","3096":"Law established a holding and a distribution, by the hospital pharmacist, of the clinical trial drugs. These operations can only be achieved with written procedures. Two sorts of procedures are required: general procedures for the whole of trials and special procedures for each of them. In that setting, a protocol for administration and distribution of drug involved in one study is established. It is intended for the three partners of the trial: sponsor, clinical investigator, and pharmaceutical department itself. It gives to these partners all the relevant informations so as to lead the operations and their chronology. This system has been acting in the hospital for a year. It appeared reliable for the three partners in about thirty trials. So, it can be considered as validated.","3097":"On a worldwide basis, the drug development circuit in clinical trials undergoes a general movement towards improvement which is sensitive to the degree of quality. The methods used to achieve this are found at the interface of Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and Good Clinical Practices (GCP). They consist primarily of two types, for which examples are given here: strengthening of controls (verification of the resemblance of test drugs in double-blind comparison by a \"jury\" and computerized systems of drug accountability), improvement in \"compliance with therapy at the site of investigation\" (use of more \"intelligent\" drug packages and labels).","3098":"In a Pharmaceutical Industry Research Center requirements in statistics and data processing are: data acquisition and management, clinical trials management, clinical trials accomplishment, computation and statistics.

This new organization is well accepted by sponsors and investigators. The hospital pharmacist's contributions to clinical trials are: protocol application in hospital practice, nurses information, efficient and safe storage and distribution to patients. The pharmacist facilitates good clinical practices and quality assurance. The problem is that in many french hospitals the pharmaceutical department is chiefly a wholesale dealer for pharmaceutical products. Our opinion is that the pharmacists should deliver drugs to improve patient compliance.","3101":"The aim of the study was to compare plasmatic levels of calcitonin obtained after intradermic (ID) and usual subcutaneous (SC) route of administration.  6 volunteers between 18 and 40 years old received calcitonin 0.5 mg (Cibacalcin, Ciba-Geigy Laboratory) by ID and SC routes in a random order but at the same site of injection. Each administration was spaced by 8 days. Plasmatic levels were measured by R.I.A. before administration then 2 (M2), 7 (M7), 15 (M15), 30 (M30) minutes and 1 (H1), 2 (H2), 4 (H4), 8 (H8), 12 (H12) hours after each administration. Tmax were at 23.6 +\/- 10 min and 16.2 +\/- 7.5 min for SC and ID routes respectively. With ID route, Tmax was reached simultaneously or earlier (3 times). Cmax is significantly higher with ID route. Neither mean plasmatic levels at each plasmatic dosage nor mean areas under the curve between 0 to 1,440 min or between 0 to 480 min (this latest AUC calculate to minimize the importance of calcitonin basal level) were significantly different with ID and SC routes. 16 mild side effects (8 with each administration) were observed in 4 subjects. They appeared before 5 min. and were transient (1 hour) for cutaneous manifestations, and later between hours 3 and 7 for nausea and vomiting or asthenia. The mean lowering of calcemia was 0.29 +\/- 0.21 and 0.18 +\/- 0.11 mmol\/l respectively for SC and ID route. In this study ID and SC routes for calcitonin administration are not different with regard to plasma levels and side effects. ","3102":"A transversal study on consumption of medicines was performed in 1,020 children and adolescents (10 to 21 years; mean age 15.3 years) questioned at school. 60.2% used at least one medicine during the week before the study. The mean number of used drugs was 2 by each consumer. There was no increase in drug consumption according to the different classes of age (10 to 14, 15 to 17, 18 to 21 years). However, from 15 years old, girls used more drugs than boys. The most used medicines are neuropsychotropic drugs (analgesics or psychostimulants). Prescription from non medical origin (self-medication or prescription by parents) was found in 46.1% of subjects. Some factors are significantly corelated with a more marked consumption of medicines: familial or personal problems in the whole population, social class of parents in the population aged from 10 to 14 years, regular use of medicines by other members of the family for adolescents from 15 to 17 years.","3103":"Eighties were characterized by the introduction of two new pharmacological class of antihypertensive drugs [converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI) and calcium channel blockers] and the publication of several large scale antihypertensive trials. The consumption of antihypertensive drugs at the Toulouse Universitary Hospital was evaluated during the ten last years. Total consumption remained stable until 1985 (560,000 pinch units) and raised to 650,000 in 1988. This number decreased to 580,000 in 1989. Consumption of diuretics remained stable during these years whereas beta-blocking agents slightly decreased. The global increase of prescription was explained by the introduction of CEI and a marked rise in calcium channel blockers from 1986. In contrast, consumption of central antihypertensive drugs crushed from 1982 to equal vasodilators (direct + alpha-blocking agents) in 1989.","3104":"Yawning is a common physiological phenomenon, induced by hunger, sleepiness or impersonation. Its behavioral aim seems to be an effort to vigilance. There are numerous pathological reasons explaining yawning, as for example global (infectious, metabolic and toxical) or focal neurological diseases. The modification of yawning in pathology where a dopaminergic dysfunction is to be found, as well as some data of animal experimentation, support when it takes place the dopaminergic system's implication. The pre-synaptical receptor's role had been suggested for a long time but actually yawning seems to be linked with a D1-D2 cooperation. The cholinergic system probably control a final effective pathway. We also imply the peptidergic, serotoninergic, androgine and opiace systems. If the localization of a putative center of yawning is impossible, the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway, the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus and the pituitary gland play a major role. Yawning can be used as a functioning index of the dopaminergic system in vivo in the human being.","3105":"The effect on psychomotor and mnesic performances of acute oral dose (600 mg) of 2 Ginkgo biloba extracts were evaluated in twelve healthy female in a dummy placebo-controlled double blind study. Tests were performed comprising: objective measures of vigilance [critical flicker frequency (CFF), choice reaction time (CRT)], memory tasks (pictures and Sternberg scanning tests) and self-rating evaluation (visual analogue scales). Tests session took place before and 1 hour post-dosing. No statistically significant changes from placebo were observed on CFF, CRT or subjective rating of drug effects. No differences between treatment were evidenced on Sternberg scanning test and pictures recognition. Comparing to baseline, free recall score, while decreasing under placebo and Ginkgo, remained the same under Tanakan. As the differences between treatment are localized on one test, it appears important to examine the reproductility in healthy subjects. In order to verify the clinical relevance of these results, they need to be replicated in older healthy volunteers with age-associated memory impairment.","3106":"In cancer, phase II clinical trials are most of the time non comparative trials, the purpose of which is to determine whether a new chemotherapy is effective enough to warrant further study in phase III. So, it is necessary, at this stage, to dispose of decision methods which allow, for ethical reasons, for early stopping when inefficacy or efficacy is evident. In a previous work, we have extended to these phase II trials two group sequential methods initially proposed in phase III, and we have demonstrated the advantages of these methods (type I error alpha and power close to the nominal values, reduction of the sample size) as compared to the main methods proposed in the literature. The aim of this paper is to present the method which appears to be the best suited to phase II clinical trials, the triangular test. After a first part, focused on its theoretical aspects, the second part, more practical, presents its use for the design of a cancer trial and its analysis.","3107":"The possible alterations of zinc and copper serum levels in dyslipemies were studied. The population were classified taking into account total cholesterol HDL and triglycerides levels and the serum test at 4 degrees C in 4 groups: 1) Hypercholesterolemia (type II A), 2) Endogenous hyperlipemia (types II B and IV), 3) Mixed hyperlipemia (type V), 4) Exogenous hyperlipemia (Type I), and also the presence of over weight (\"15% ideal weight body, according to Bray), that occurred in the 29.5% of the sample. Zinc and copper were determined by AAS (Smith &amp; Butrimovitz method). Total cholesterol, HDL, LDL and triglycerides by enzymatic methods. The main results and conclusions obtained were the following: A significative increase in zinc serum level was observed; Hyperglycemia, present in nearly half of the studied population could be the responsible for it. Obesity was associated with an increase of zinc values, and this could be related to an insulinic dysfunction. A direct correlation between glycemia and triglyceridemia, and between glycemia and zincemia was found. Cardiovascular alterations seemed to decrease zinc serum levels; on the opposite however hypertension increased them. Neither lipidic metabolism alterations, nor obesity did modify copper serum level.","3108":"The correlation between debrisoquine and dextromethorphan oxidation polymorphism was studied in 16 depressed in-patients. There was a close correlation between both phenotypes (r = 0.81 p less than 0.0017). During a treatment with amitriptyline during two weeks there was no significant modification of the dextromethorphan polymorphism. In the same way, the association of amitriptyline and toloxatone during two other weeks did not change this polymorphism in a significant way, even if there was a non significant shift towards higher values of the dextromethorphan metabolic ratio.","3109":"Twelve healthy, male volunteers were treated for ten days, in double-blind conditions, with either enprostil, a PGE2 derivative, at a dose of 35 micrograms bid or with placebo. Before and after treatment fasting gastric juice was collected and basal bicarbonate secretion was measured by Feldman's method. In the enprostil group a statistically significant (p less than 0.01) increase in gastric HCO3 output was detectable 12 hours after the last dose. That finding, which is in keeping with the results of acute single-dose studies, suggests that stimulation of bicarbonate secretion by enprostil is not merely a transient phenomenon involved in the prevention of mucosal injury, but a lasting effect that may contribute to the ulcer-healing activity of the drug.","3110":"The penetration of minocycline into lung tissue was evaluated in 14 patients about to undergo excision of the lung for cancer. The patients received minocycline orally in doses of 100 mg twice a day for 3 days, the 100 mg in the morning of the operation day. Minocycline concentrations were measured in plasma samples taken before surgery and in the lung tissue resected. The mean tissue\/plasma concentration ration was 3.17 +\/- 0.41 (range: 1.5 to 7.48). The same ratios were obtained in peritumoral and tumoral tissues. These results indicate that minocycline penetrates well into tissues.","3111":"","3112":"The percutaneous absorption of ketoconazole was studied in 7 infants (1 to 5 month of age) with extensive seborrhoeic dermatitis (greater than 50% of the surface area), after application of a 2% ketoconazole cream (Ketoderm). The plasma concentrations of ketoconazole were measured by HPLC at the first, 5th and 10th day of the treatment. Despite the large surface involved, plasma levels ranging, from 0.018 to 0.133 micrograms\/ml were measured. These values are low, as compared with the concentrations observed following oral administration (4 to 9 micrograms\/ml), and suggest that the occurrence of systemic dose-dependent side effects is very unlikely. A careful monitoring of prescription remains however necessary.","3113":"","3114":"","3115":"We describe five cases of vasculitis noted a few days after influenza vaccination.

Spontaneous retrocession was noted in four patients and following corticosteroids once. To our knowledge only few cases of vasculitis has been previously reported after influenza vaccination. The mechanisms are unknown but preservatives may have some responsibilities.","3116":"We report a case of fatal anaphylactic reaction to intravenous methylprednisolone succinate therapy developed in a 51 year old asthmatic man with aspirin intolerance and undetermined myocarditis. 14 similar cases were found in literature and analysed: asthma and aspirin intolerance seem to be risk factors; the organism reacts against either unconjugated corticoid or esterified corticoid principally its succinate salt; the mechanism of these reactions remains not clear; it may be either a true allergic reaction or a non specific reaction.","3117":"Methotrexate (MTX) is used increasingly for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is an antagonist of folic acid. For the low doses used in RA (less than 15 mg\/week), MTX is completely and rapidly absorbed with an active process membrane transport. The frequent toxic effects of this drug (hepatotoxicity, hematologic or possible long-term oncogenicity) limit its widespread use. MTX is as effective in treating RA as the other second line drugs and always more rapidly effective, perhaps because of anti-inflammatory properties. MTX must at the present time be used only in severe RA, refractory to more than one classical slow acting drug. Despite this, it is an extremely promising new agent in the therapy of rheumatic diseases.","3118":"Recent evidence for the existence of extrarenal tissue renin-angiotensin systems has raised the question whether such a system also exists in the heart. In this communication, we present evidence for a cardiac renin-angiotensin system based on molecular biological and biochemical data. In addition, we address the question whether the components of this system interact as a locally integrated, biologically functioning unit. Using radiolabeled cRNA probes prepared from specific cDNA fragments, we were able to document renin and angiotensinogen gene expression in atria and ventricles of the rat heart by Northern blot and liquid hybridization analysis. Relative signal strength for both mRNAs was highest in the atria, followed by the right and left ventricle. Using specific, HPLC-controlled RIAs for angiotensin peptides, we demonstrated the presence of both angiotensin I and angiotensin II in all anatomical regions of the monkey and rat heart. Similarly, the presence of converting enzyme activity was ascertained by direct in vitro determinations. Additional experiments evaluating the spontaneous release of angiotensinogen from isolated, perfused rat hearts revealed a bimodal pattern of high, but rapidly declining rates during the first hour (perhaps representing the washout of a pool sequestered from plasma), followed by a prolonged period of steady, low level release, consistent with the secretion of locally synthesized protein. In separate experiments aimed at examining the possible local integration of the components of the cardiac renin-angiotensin system, we measured angiotensin II concentrations in the coronary sinus effluent of isolated, perfused rat hearts. Infusion of angiotensin I resulted in the prompt appearance of angiotensin II, amounting to a single pass fractional conversion of 6.42 +\/- 0.33%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","3119":"Pharmacokinetic plasma curves of altizide (ALT), spironolactone (SPI) and two of the main metabolites of spironolactone, 7 alpha-thiomethyl-spirolactone (7TM) and canrenone (CAN) have been established in 12 healthy human volunteers (6 men and 6 women) after unique oral administration of 1 or 2 tablets of a combination of the two diuretic compounds: altizide (15 mg per tablet) and spironolactone (25 mg per tablets). Main pharmacokinetic parameters have been calculated using a biexponential (ALT and SPI) or a triexponential model (7TM and CAN). Spironolactone is rapidly absorbed. Plasma curves show Tmax respectively equal to 1.19 +\/- 0.47 hours (1 tablet) or 1.21 +\/- 0.46 (2 tablets). Spironolactone is rapidly metabolized as it is shown by the mean Tmax of metabolites: 7TM and CAN Tmax are respectively 1.56 +\/- 0.45 hours and 2.54 +\/- 1.06 hours after administration of 1 tablet, or 1.58 +\/- 0.42 hours and 2.67 +\/- 1.13 hours after administration of 2 tablets.

The aim of the study was to check the clinical equivalence of the two formulations. Nine generalists and 9 psychiatrists participated in this double blind study. One hundred fifty four patients with DSM III generalized anxiety criteria were included in this study and received prazepam at an average dosage of 20 mg per day. There were 11 drop outs: 6 in the tablet group and 5 in the drop group. The statistical analysis was done on 143 patients. Before treatment the two groups were equivalent. There was a very significant decrease (p less than 10(-4) in Hamilton anxiety scale scores, physician visual analogic scale and patient visual analogic scale with no difference between both groups. The vigilance, measured by the Mini-Folstein scale, was significantly increased (p less than 10(-4) in both groups. The tolerance was also similar: 14 patients in the tablet group and 10 in the drop one complained of asthenia and somnolence.","3122":"Ten patients with spontaneous ascitic fluid infections received intravenously 400 mg of pefloxacin for pharmacokinetic evaluation of the drug and its diffusion into peritoneal space. The patients were then treated with oral pefloxacin (400 mg every 36 h except for icteric patients: 48 h) during 21 days. Total body clearance was decreased (0.66 +\/- 0.16 ml\/min\/kg) and elimination half life was increased as compared to that observed in normal subject (28.2 +\/- 7.6 h), the longest half-lives being observed in the cases with the most severe alteration of hepatic function. Peritoneal concentrations were higher than 1 microgram\/ml (i.e. exceeding the minimal inhibitory concentrations for most of the bacterial species involved in ascitic fluid infections) from the first half-hour after infusion to at least 36 hours. 9 of the 10 cases were cured. Pefloxacin provided a well spaced rythm of administration is a suitable antibacterial drug for ascitic fluid infections in cirrhotic patients with two advantages: its effectiveness against Enterobacteriaceae and an oral administration.","3123":"Since renin angiotensin (RA) system discovery during 1930 decade, its physiopathological importance was only recently demonstrated with the dramatic therapeutic value of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The tissular localisation of some of its compounds progressively lead to the concept of a tissular RA system. However non consensus can be established concerning either its existence or its physiological role. The distribution of the classical components of the RA system in the cardiac and other tissues is not homogenous enough to demonstrate the existence of such a functional and coherent system. Numerous technical problems concerning dosage methodologies are encountered especially with angiotensin II determination and must rend cautious when interpreting data. Non specific actions of ACE inhibitors can explain discrepancies between their effects and the level of RA system activation. Indeed they interfere with other systems such as prostaglandins, leucotriens, bradykinins, free radicals. Different tissues such as those of the cardiovascular system directly interfere with angiotensin II production. However, mechanisms and enzymatic reactions that are involved in such a production are multiple and their respective roles remain to be determined.","3124":"","3125":"","3126":"","3127":"","3128":"The efficacy and safety of long-acting propranolol (LA.P) 160 mg once-daily in the prophylactic treatment of migraine were tested against placebo in a multicentric, double-blind, randomized study comparing the two groups in a parallel manner over a treatment period of 12 weeks, and following a 4 week-placebo run-in period. Fifty-five out of the 74 patients who entered the trial included at the end of the run-in period. Forty-one patients completed the study. Out of the 14 patients who withdrew from the study, none discontinued because of side-effects. The statistical analysis was done according to the \"intention to treat\" principle. LA.P was significantly more efficient than placebo in reducing the frequency of migraine attacks (p = 0.01 by variance analysis). LA.P reduced the average number of monthly crises by 48% on day 84. There was a slight but significant reduction of the systolic blood pressure and heart rate in the erect position.

Mean creatinine concentration versus time rises significantly. This elevation is significantly higher in patients with hypertension, diabete, one functional kidney, or abdominoperineal irradiation. The association with other drugs has not proved a real influence on creatinine evolution.","3139":"Two new cases of osteofluorosis are presented. They are attested by the existence of a bone X-ray densification, by histological lesions of hyperosteoidosis and a large increase in the fluorine content. One is a 61 year-old man who consumed 2.5 l a day of Vichy St-Yorre (a mineral water containing 8 mg of fluorine ions per litre) during 11 years; the other, an 86 year-old man who during 20 years took 500 mg of niflumic acid a day, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug containing 3 fluorine atoms per molecule (i.e., 50 mg fluorine per 250 mg gellule). Both these hypertensive patients had severe renal insufficiency. These two observations serve as a reminder of the indispensable precautions to be observed when prescribing fluorine salts in the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis: at least the plasma creatinine level should be available in order to calculate the endogenous creatinine clearance and any possible supplementary intake of fluorine salts should be checked.","3140":"The assay by immunoenzymatic method of the blood level of digoxine in 150 old people, (m = 79 years), hospitalized during one year shows a level of more than 2 ng\/ml in 31 of them, (m = 2.91 ng\/ml). However, the dosage is normal or low, m = 0.206 mg\/j. A renal impairment often discussed is not the mechanism: 17 patients with a blood creatinine over 135 mumol\/l have a mean blood level of digoxine of 2.98 ng\/ml for 2.91 in the 14 another ones without renal impairment. Physicians should be still more cautious when prescribing digoxin.","3141":"A therapeutic committee was established in Toulouse Regional University Hospital in order to prescribe zidovudine in patients suffering from AIDS. Using an informatic card, the side effects were evaluated in the 125 patients treated by Zidovudine since the creation of the Committee (from July 1987 to January 1989). Zidovudine was prescribed from May 1987 to June 1988 at the total dose of 1,200 mg daily from June 1988 at 900 mg daily. The most frequent side effects were hematologic: zidovudine used alone (or associated with non hematotoxic drugs) elicited in 21.2% of patients a neutropenia (defined as a number of neutrophils less than 1,000\/mm3), in 2.4% anaemia (haemoglobin less than or equal to 9 g\/100 ml) and in 4.8% neutropenia associated with anaemia. When zidovudine was administered with hematotoxic drugs, neutropenia, anaemia or the association of both were observed in 12.0%, 3.2% and 2.4% of patients respectively. These hematologic side effects were always regressive after drug cessation. However, it is important to underline the low incidence of hematological side effects on red cells of zidovudine in the present study. This result is unexpected. The other side effects of Zidovudine (used alone) did not led to modification in drug treatment: gastrointestinal disturbances (30.4%), headaches (16.8%), insomnia (13.6%), somnolence (6.4%).... These side effects appeared during the four first months and decreased with the continuation of drug treatment. Their imputation was difficult to define and differentiate to evolution of the disease.","3142":"One hundred and eighty six cases of amineptine abuse were reported to the Regional Centres of Pharmacovigilance or to the Laboratory Eutherapie during a ten year period, between 1978 and february 1988. The analysis was carried out on 155 cases. The principal characteristics of overconsumption are: a predominance of females; the existence of risk factors in 2 out of 3 cases; the absence of correlations between the prescribed dosage, the duration and the importance of abuse; the constant search of a psychostimulant effect; a good clinical acceptability in most cases, but the risk of acne and psychic disturbances must be emphasized; withdrawal difficulties, obtained in only 48 patients (for at least one month). Psychic symptoms on withdrawal were variable and it was not possible to identify a syndrome. The risk of abuse seems to be rare, nevertheless, one must know this occurrence and respect the recommanded dosage. In patients with certain psychiatric illnesses, and especially in patients with risks factors, drugs with stimulant properties should be prescribed with caution.","3143":"Practitioners inquiries addressed to our Drug Information Centre are computerized since 1986. Their analysis allows to pinpoint special problems and needs for practitioners information, and to detect new adverse drug reactions. Time series analysis of calls (according to the practitioners specialities or geographic stay) allows to evaluate the effectiveness of the services provided by the Bordeaux Drug Information Centre.","3144":"Authors look at different methodological estimations of costs induced by hospitalizations for side effects of drugs: individual, global and budgetary estimations. Only the two last ones are possible today. Results are sufficient to demonstrate the economic importance of a Pharmacovigilance Centre for the Hospitals that have got such a structure.","3145":"All the requests (162) from the 1st to the 31th of december 1988 (a period of one month) are analysed by the Paris Fernand-Widal ADR Monitoring Centre. The requests are classified as following: 74 pharmacological consults (39 about pregnancy, 9 for breast-feeding, 3 neonates or children, 2 about G6PD deficiency, 3 guide-lines after a therapeutic error, 3 requests for treatment of ADR, and 15 miscellaneous). 5 ADRs notified and reported to an other nearest Centre to the caller and 3 diagnosed latter as an ADR 49 ADRs registered turn to a request because of lack of information (age: 15; sex: 18; name: 1; address: 31,) or faithfullness (4) or several reasons (18). 31 general information about drugs. Usually, physicians request the Monitoring Centre but recently patients request directly the Centre; specially during pregnancy. The progressive number of the questions makes computerization necessary. A single system appears to be essential for all the Regional Centres to improve the quality of the answer and for the new ADR's alert.","3146":"Forty-one observations concerning persons aged over sixty-five hospitalized for adverse drug reactions in the Emergency Service of Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital were collected and analysed by the Adverse Drug Reaction Monitoring Centre. The symptoms were predominantly haemorrhage, particularly digestive, connected with the use of oral anticoagulants, salicylates and anti-inflammatories. The follow-up of the thirty-one most severe cases (hospitalization over 48 h and\/or initial resuscitation) was undertaken in hospital and other care centres. In seventeen cases, complications occurred linked to the hospitalization (especially infections and neuropsychic complications) or to the adverse reaction itself through the measures taken to correct it (particularly cardiovascular complications). The hospitalization revealed hitherto undetected conditions in twelve patients, thereby allowing the prognosis to be improved. This positive side hardly outweighs the detrimental effects of adverse drug reactions in elderly subjects (six deaths and four irreversible incapacitations). Thus vital and social prognosis of elderly appears greatly damaged by adverse drug reactions.","3147":"","3148":"Hemodynamic effects and gas exchange were studied in twenty COPD patients undergoing mechanical ventilation before and 30 and 60 minutes after an intravenous administration of 1 mg\/kg enoximone. Enoximone decreased significantly pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistances without significantly decrease of systemic vascular resistances 60 minutes after a slight dose of 1 mg\/kg. Right ventricular ejection fraction increased; O2 arterial pressure, CO2 arterial pressure, intrapulmonary shunt remained unchanged. We concluded that enoximone induced pulmonary vasodilation in patients with decompensated COPD and increased right ventricular function without deleterious effects in gas exchange.","3149":"Patient 1 received carteolol and captopril for hypertension. Three days after a slow-release diltiazem preparation (300 mg) had been introduced, he developed cardiogenic shock and sinus bradycardia (heart rate: 30\/mn) with acidosis and severe hyperkaliemia. He was successfully treated by temporary pacing and dobutamine. Patient 2 had received sotalol and captopril for several years. Twelve hours after slow release diltiazem had been added, he was found in cardiogenic shock and extreme bradycardia with wide QRS, acidosis and hyperkaliemia. He died one hour later despite intensive emergency treatment. Concomitant use of beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers has been reported in patients suffering of severe coronary heart disease. However, several adverse reactions similar to our cases have been described. Slow-release diltiazem should be avoided in hypertensive patients taking beta-blockers.","3150":"","3151":"","3152":"","3153":"","3154":"Regulations on the use of laboratory animals are being in process, with regard to the very different aspects of animal experimentation. The generalization of feelings of respect for animals is highly positive. Research workers should apply themselves to avoiding this progress in human behavior to be associated with the development of \"anti-science\" reactions, leading to guilty feelings about the mainspring of their activity.","3155":"Alternative methods are already widely used in fundamental biological research. Among 6,649 papers given at the FASEB 1989 meeting, nearly 60 p. 100 deal with experimental data obtained without the use of live animals. Alternative methods are less frequently utilized in industrial Toxicology. The reason of this discrepancy is discussed as well as the efforts made to reduce the numbers of animals for acute toxicity studies (LD 50) and cutaneous and eye tolerance. Present scientific developments as well as the possible agreement by regulatory agencies of the newly developed tests are presented. In spite of the increasing acceptance of alternative methods, large numbers of animals are still used. The reasons for this state of affairs are analysed, as well as the efforts which are made to encourage research for the replacement of animals in programs traditionally based on animal experimentation.","3156":"Animal experiments are scientifically justified to establish kinetic parameters of xenobiotics in vivo (absorption, diffusion, biotransformation, elimination of pesticides, food additives and drugs). They are indispensable for evaluating toxic effects which appear with delay (carcinogenesis, drug dependence), and for exploring reactions which involve complex regulating systems in the whole organism. In this field, methods are in progress, leading to use less and less animals and to obtain more accurate data. Some problems still exist concerning painful experiments and controls of local tolerance. In vitro assays must not be opposed against those performed in vivo, since both are complementary and must be coordinated in order to make fruitful progresses for the benefit of men but also of animals.","3157":"Marketing authorization of numerous products: human and veterinary drugs, chemicals, agrochemicals and cosmetic products implies a minimum of animal testing. These trials are performed according to the Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) compulsory in France for drug registration. These guide lines are gradually extended to other products and tend to limit the number of animals to the strict necessity of providing a reliable information on the tolerance and possible toxicity of new products. The october 19-1987 decree of the Ministry of Agriculture as well as related decrees, complete and reinforce the previous legislation on animal experimental use in France. These texts comply with the EEC requirements and directives.","3158":"In order to analyse the response of pharmaceutical companies to adverse drug reaction reports, 37 suspected side effects were sent by mail to the 30 companies concerned. The time period involved was 1 year and corresponded to a total of 3341 consultations in general practice. Companies answered in 29 cases (78.3%), sent 21 reply forms and returned 3 evaluations of adverse drugs reactions to the reporting doctor. The high percentage of adverse drug reactions (1.07 per one hundred consultations), the doctor's work-load and poor feed-back lead one to reflect on the usefulness of systematic adverse drug reaction reporting by general practitioners.","3159":"Authors report results of an investigation led in 2 separate departments concerning 200 subjects: --blood donors: they are by definition healthy subjects who regularly are in touch with a medical structure; --patients with acute traumatic pathology leading to bone surgery consultation. The aim of this investigation was to analyse the different parameters involved in self-medication and to compare their distribution. Self-medication has an overall incidence of 87.5% in these studied groups and has generally been lasting from 2 to 9 years. The main reason for it is the lack of gravity to go and see a physician; although 52% of the patients tested take the advise of another person. The clinical signs leading to self-medication are looked for; 468 different drugs are listed essentially antalogics and drugs for ear, nose and throat as well as respiratory tract diseases. Self prescribed drugs usually come from the familial stock. Blood donors have some specific characteristics. In this population self-medication is more frequent and has been lasting longer. They more often feel able to take themselves in charge, but in contrast ask for the chemist's or the doctor's advise more frequently.","3160":"Drug consumption has been studied in a population of 187 retired people, the average age being 66.5 years. The retired subjects are great drug consumers: 89% regularly take one (or several) drug(s). The central nervous system drugs are the most used (52%). Those of cardiovascular system are used by 46% of subjects. Females take more anxiolytic drugs and paracetamol than males who use more calcium channel blockers. Polymedication is usual and in opposition to working population, retired people are less addicted to self medication.","3161":"The kinetics of chlormezanone were determined after oral administration of single (400 mg) and multiple doses (400 mg\/day during 8 days) in eight young healthy male subjects. Plasma levels determination had been carried out by HPLC. After single dose administration, Cmax concentrations 4.62 +\/- 0.75 mg\/l were obtained (Tmax) 2.18 +\/- 1.49 h after drug intake. Area under plasma concentrations time curve was 224.93 +\/- 27.79 mg.h\/l and terminal half-life 40.50 +\/- 4.19 h. On chronic regimen, chlormezanone accumulates in the body: trough plasma concentrations are significantly increased from Day 7 (2.97 +\/- 0.45 mg\/l) to Day 9 (5.41 +\/- 0.90 mg\/l) and reach the steady state faster than it can be expected from half-life (40 hours) and dosing interval (24 hours). Elimination is faster (T1\/2 beta = 37.14 +\/- 3.18 h) after chronic regimen. Area under curve during dosing interval at steady state (164.19 +\/- 21.70 mg.h\/l) is significantly lower than the area under curve between zero and infinity in the single dose sequence (224.93 +\/- 27.79 mg.h\/l). These results agree with probable induction effect of chlormezanone on its own metabolism.","3162":null,"3163":"In a previous study, performed in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery receiving antibiotics intravenously we pointed out that the gastric aspiration was an additional route of elimination for some drugs. In order to estimate the extra-dose required to replace losses in patients receiving ornidazole, a study was set up. 8 patients entered the trial; the patients were infused 500 mg of ornidazole for 3 days every 12 hours. Blood was sampled at 0-2-4-8-24 h after the last infusion. Urines and gastric aspirate were collected. The results indicate that the amount aspirated through the tubings is 69.1 +\/- 37.5 mg per 24 hours (24.8 - 116.8) with a very high variability; the half-life was not different of what is known for ornidazole: 10.5 +\/- 1.7 h. The results confirm that for the molecules weakly bound to protein which \"concentrate\" in the gastric secretion, the aspiration is an important route of elimination.","3164":"Using a double-labelling procedure, morphological relationships existing between dopaminergic and indoleaminergic neuronal systems in rat brain were investigated. Firstly, thanks to a tryptamine (T) antiserum, we visualized this indoleamine in all mesencephalic regions and showed that the T-immunoreactivity (IR) seems to overlap with the staining observed from serotonin (HT) and 5-methoxytryptamine (MT) antisera. Secondly, using a monoclonal anti-dopamine (DA) antibody and our anti-T antibodies, the simultaneous and specific detection of these compounds enabled us to define the chemically relationships existing between the dopaminergic and tryptaminergic neuronal systems from substantia nigra to raphe nuclei. No co-localization exists. But, the intensity of T-IR decreases from the back to the front, whereas the DA-staining decreases in the opposite way, indicating possible interactions at the end of substantia nigra and B9 area.","3165":"Myorelaxants, a specific pharmacologic group, are often prescribed. However, for many molecules, therapeutic trial methodology is not adapted. A review of the fundamental aspects of pharmacological trial clearly show a need for diagnosis and inclusion criteria, definition and validation for methods of assessment, analysis of the dose-response curve on term of effectiveness according to the pharmacologic and clinically established rules. Rational prescription of myorelaxants will arise from this principles.","3166":"Spasticity, flexion and extension spasms occur after lesions of motor descending pathways. Three different mechanisms can explain these disorders of tone: pure muscular alterations, segmental synaptic sprouting and liberation of spinal reflex activity. This last mechanism, which is also the most classically described has been studied long ago. Amongst all hypotheses which can explain spasticity (hyperexcitability of alpha motoneuron, gamma motoneuron, or reduction of presynaptic inhibition) reduction of presynaptic inhibition is the only one to have been clearly demonstrated. A new treatment is proposed: intrathecal Baclofen. It seems to act by reducing the excitability of alpha motoneuron.","3167":"The first part of the paper exposes the basic characteristics of the human spasticity which should be modeled: No hypertonia at rest; velocity-dependent myotatic responses, and fatigability. To model a syndrome including these signs is a related but different problem. Results and limits of the clinical neurophysiology concerning the spasticity are briefly quoted. Animal models would better assist the human neurophysiology when having their neuroanatomy closer to the human one. The second part confirms that a local unilateral excision of the ad hoc sensorimotor cerebral cortice of the Baboon induces a permanent palsy of the contralateral foot and leg, and after delay signs of spasticity in the Sol. Neither clasp-knife phenomenon nor fatigability is observed. There is no sign of motoneuron hyper-excitability. A GABA-related pharmacology suggests a significant defect in the presynaptic inhibition of the reflexogenic IA in-put, and possibly a defect in a post-synaptique gabaergic inhibition. Finally the monkey is considered as a valuable support for modeling the human spasticity, symptom and possibly syndrome.","3168":"The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the advantages of immunocytochemical studies of spinal neuropeptides in human pathology and in animal experiments. The distribution of neuropeptides in the gray matter of the human spinal cord is summarized. Data obtained on selected pathological cases are able to determine the origin of certain peptidergic afferents to the spinal cord and suggest that the early disappearance of substance P-positive fibers in the motoneuronal columns plays a role in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In rats, peptide immunocytochemistry is useful for assessing the plasticity of spinal neurons in a model of chronic pain, in chemically induced degeneration of the gray matter and in a model of spinal cord trauma. Finally, a newly developed culture system of adult rat and human dorsal root ganglia demonstrates that the phenotypic expression of neuropeptides can be modulated experimentally, which offers new perspectives for studying the neurobiological role of these mediators and for the tentative repair of spinal lesions by autografts.","3169":"We studied, in twelve healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of inorganic fluoride and calcium variations in serum and urine, parathormone variations in serum after administration of two oral preparations containing 100 mg of disodium monofluorophosphate (13.2 mg F as element) with different calcium salts (500 mg Ca as element). Fluoride was estimated in serum and urine with an ion specific electrode. The fluoride bioavailability from two preparations is identical with an areas under the curve corresponding to 61.05 and 62.53 mumols.l-1 h (after deduction of physiological fluoride concentrations) and urinary fluoride excretion after 72 hours corresponding to 266.6 and 246.1 mumols. The plasma peak appearance is rapid (one hour) and similar. The significant increase of urinary Ca-Creat ratio (70 to 100%) is identical four hours after drug administration. In the same way, a significant and early decrease of intact PTH in serum, measured with chemiluminometric method, was observed from two drugs. From these observations we may conclude that the two preparations are biologically equivalent.","3170":"Recent data suggest that amiotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) could be the result of motoneuron damage induced by endogenous or exogenous excitotoxins, and especially by excitatory amino acids (EAA). Three main sources support this hypothesis: 1) The induction of experimental models of motor neuron disease by 2 excitotoxins (BOAA and BMAA). 2) Evidence of disordered glutamate metabolism in ALS. 3) Data suggesting that EAAs may be a factor in the pathogenesis of other degenerative neurologic diseases (Huntington disease and Alzheimer disease). This new \"excitotoxin hypothesis\" of ALS is of particular interest as several effective antiglutamate agents are now available for human therapeutic trials.","3171":"The knowledge of the mechanism of action of neuromuscular blocking agents has improved together with the better understanding of the physiology of the neuromuscular junction at the molecular and cellular levels. The main action of competitive neuromuscular relaxants is the blockade of the acetylcholine binding site of the acetylcholine receptor when the latter is its inactive-closed conformation. Owing to the high margin of safety of the neuromuscular transmission, the blockade of an important fraction (75-90%) of acetylcholine receptors is necessary to cause a decrease in muscle strength. An other mechanism of action of competitive agents is the blockade of presynaptic secretion of acetylcholine during repetitive stimulations which may explain the phenomenon of train of four fade or of tetanic fade.","3172":"Several drugs are known to aggravate myasthenia gravis or to induce myasthenia like syndromes. Drugs which interfere with neuro-muscular transmission act either through a direct effect at the neuro-muscular junction or as with D. Penicillamine through an immunological action. For some drugs, the information available indicate their harmfulness in myasthenia gravis, so they are contraindicated. For others, the clinical effect is not so well established, nevertheless if necessary they can be used with caution.","3173":"Excitatory amino acids play a crucial role in cerebral transmission. Numerous neuronal systems have been identified contributing to learning, memory and brain neuronal plasticity. Recent advances in neuropathology led to propose a crucial role of these neurotransmitters in neurodegenerative processes and acute cerebral strokes due to their excitotoxic properties. Consequently, development of excitatory amino acid antagonists constitutes a challenge for modern neuropharmacology.","3174":"Genetic-controlled drug oxidation and acetylation were studied using dextromethorphan and caffeine as test compounds respectively in white Briton subjects (41 Britons and 27 Bigoudens considered as an ethnic group). Phenotyping was performed using the metabolic ratio (MR) calculated as the urinary output dextromethorphan\/dextrorphan ratio and the urinary output of 5-acetylamino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil (AFMU)\/1-methylxanthine (1-MX) ratio in subjects given 40 mg of dextromethorphan and 150 mg caffeine respectively. Frequence distribution of hydroxylator and acetylator status in Briton and Bigouden groups showed no significant difference relatively to the French population. However the frequence distribution of the intermediate acetylator group in the Bigouden population was significantly different from that observed in the Briton population (7.4% vs 31.7%). The signification of this latter result was discussed on the basis of genetic transmission.","3175":"","3176":"","3177":"","3178":"","3179":"","3180":"","3181":"The ability of flunarizine in inducing or worsening extrapyramidal symptoms is well documented. The relation with age or dose of such symptoms as their clinical characteristics remain controversial. We report 6 cases of extrapyramidal syndromes induced by flunarizine in five women and one man (mean age 71.5 +\/- 5 years). The daily dose was 10 mg in five cases (as recommended by the marketing laboratory) and 20 mg in one patient. These observations allow to discuss the dose-dependent occurrence of this adverse reaction. In only three cases the reason for treatment was compatible with the official french indication. These side effects appeared after 7.0 +\/- 1.6 months and disappeared after 2.2 +\/- 0.5 months respectively. Flunarizine-induced extrapyramidal symptoms are mainly characterized by tremor (which was the main symptom in 4 cases and the only one in 2 cases).","3182":"Little information is available on the effect produced by antiepileptic drugs on the serum beta-glucuronidase activity. According to recent findings, beta-glucuronidase serum levels are increased in patients with epilepsy just before the beginning of seizures and remain increased during several weeks; this it is suggested that determination of this enzyme could be important in the provision and the treatment of seizures. The purpose of the present study attempts to understand these changes. Our study was carried out on 49 adult healthy subjects and 48 adult epileptic patients receiving anticonvulsant therapies. Serum beta-glucuronidase activity was determined by a simplified procedure employing phenolphtalein glucuronic acid as substrate. The mean +\/- SEM of serum beta-glucuronidase activity in treated patients (40.93 +\/- 5.01 MSU\/ml) was significantly higher than those of the healthy subjects (25.04 +\/- 3.40 MSU\/ml). In conclusion, the relationship between changes in serum enzyme activity, seizures and anticonvulsant therapies suggests that the determination of serum beta-glucuronidase activity presents a weak interest in predicting or treating seizures.","3183":"It is common clinical experience that depressed patients comply poorly with their treatment schedules. In a retrospective study, the authors studied the compliance with the tricyclic antidepressant treatment (TCA) in 1,023 in-patients and evaluated the frequency of the plasma levels under or above the therapeutic range, following a first prescription of TCA. To describe the adherence to the TCA regimen, the investigators have classified patients as either \"compliant\" or \"bad compliant\" on the basis of two different arbitrary dividing points: plasma levels of tertiary OR secondary amine lower than 20 ng\/ml, or plasma levels of tertiary AND secondary amine lower than 20 ng\/ml. The antidepressant plasma levels were measured, on steady state conditions, using a gas chromatographic method. The incidence of bad compliance ranged between about 2.5 and 10%, depending on the criteria used, the incidence of plasma levels under or above the therapeutic window ranged respectively between 26 and 54%-4 and 24%. The results from this study should encourage TCA plasma level measurements.","3184":"Toloxatone is a new monoamine oxidase inhibitor. One hundred and twenty two cases of poisoning with this drug are reported. In this series, the minimal toxic dose was 2 g. The first symptoms appeared about one hour after ingestion. In most cases, only drowsiness and mild adrenergic effects were observed. In a few cases of massive overdose, coma, pyramidal irritation, and myoclonic jerks occurred. In 3 cases of severe poisoning, toloxatone was associated with tricyclic antidepressants. Symptoms were similar to those reported in intoxications associating classical monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants: muscular rigidity, hyperthermia and cardiovascular collapse. Two of these patients died.","3185":"Ponsinomycin or miocamycin (MOM) is a new macrolide which is totally metabolized in vivo. The disposition of its 3 major metabolites (Mb12, Mb6 and Mb9a), was investigated following multiple dosing with ponsinomycin at a dose of 800 mg every 12 h, for 8 days, in healthy volunteers. Drug measurements were conducted by high performance liquid chromatography. In agreement with the low values of their apparent elimination half-lives, respectively less than 1.5 h and 3.0 h, metabolites Mb12 and Mb9a did not accumulate with time. Their pharmacokinetics was apparently stable with time. Conversely Mb6 did accumulate, by approximatively a factor 2, although its apparent elimination half-life was only close to 2 h. This value must therefore be considered with caution. A dose dependency effect was previously observed, Mb6 pharmacokinetics could be non linear with time as well. The relative importance of this metabolite is therefore greater at steady-state, following multiple administration than after single dosing with ponsinomycin.","3186":"","3187":"","3188":"","3189":"","3190":"","3191":null,"3192":"The use of calcium channel blockers is usual in cardiology today, but seem to spread to others specialties, particularly in the field of neuropsychiatry.

In psychiatry, their introduction is more recent. However, some encouraging results have been noted in the treatment of panic disorder, Gilles de la Tourette disease and mania.","3193":"The haemodynamic effects of a new antiarrhythmic drug quinacainol (RP 54272) were evaluated in 12 untreated patients with normal left ventricular function referred for diagnostic cardiac catheterisation. The haemodynamic data were obtained before, 5 and 25 minutes after the injection of the drug (0.21 mg\/kg\/min during 6 minutes). A slight decrease of cardiac contractility indexes was constantly observed: dp\/dtmax decreased (-15%) in all patients (p less than 0.05), with no concomitant change of left ventricular pressure or left ventricular end diastolic volume with respect to control values. Cardiac output and left ventricular ejection fraction did not change significantly. Heart rate increased in all patients from 74.3 +\/- 9.8 to 79.9 +\/- 8.6 beats per minute after 5 minutes (paired t test p less than 0.05), and was 79.8 +\/- 9.0 beats per minute after 25 minutes. Systemic arterial resistance increased in 7 patients due to a reflex adrenergic discharge. The interpretation of the haemodynamic data was difficult in 3 cases due to systemic vasodilatation, which was poorly tolerated in one patient. The contribution of vagolytic reaction and adrenergic reaction to the negative inotropic effects of the drug must be evaluated before giving in to patients with impaired left ventricular function.","3194":"Non prostanoid endothelium-derived relaxing and contracting factors (EDRF and EDCF, respectively) are released by endothelial cells and act on the underlying vascular smooth muscle. It is now established that EDRF is nitric oxide (NO), whereas EDCF has been recently identified as a 21 residue peptide, called endothelin. However, circumstantial evidence suggests that there may be more than one EDRF and\/or EDCF. EDRF (NO) induces relaxation of the underlying vascular smooth muscle by enhancing intracellular level of cyclic guanosine monophosphate. The mechanisms of action of endothelin are still to be defined. It seems however that influx of extracellular calcium may partly account for its action. Although important findings have been made recently, most of the hypotheseses, at our current stage of knowledge, about the respective roles of EDRF and EDCF in disease have still to be proved. However, it is preferable from now to think in terms of balance (or imbalance) between these two factors which, probably, have both a fundamental role and very likely interact with each other in maintaining and regulating vascular tone in man.","3195":"","3196":"","3197":"","3198":"","3199":"Forty five patients with moderate or severe pulmonary valvular stenosis had been treated by percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty.

Surprisingly, these effects seem to be very rarely reported; this is perhaps due to a tricky assessment of the causal relationship: many factors (hypertension, other diseases, other drugs) can have an influence on these troubles.","3211":"19 cases of acute dyskinetic reactions related to anti-emetic drugs have been retrospectively examined. In these cases, the diagnosis was not recognized and the patients were hospitalized. Metoclopramide was the most frequently involved drug (17 cases). In one case, domperidone was the drug responsible of the neurologic symptomatology. The doses used were not higher than recommended. In most of cases, the neurologic manifestations occurred within the first 24 hours and disappeared within a few hours after discontinuation of the treatment.","3212":"The authors describe one case of calcified lipogranuloma observed in the forearm tissues of a 67 year old patient. This lesion seems to be due to a long term treatment by S.C injection of gomenoleo oil 60 years before. The analysis by high performance liquid chromatography of fat parts of the lesion identified the original olive oil (excipient).","3213":"The aims of the study were the correlation between dosage and plasmatic levels of slow release theophylline and the reason for dosage adjustment. 64 pharmacokinetic studies were performed in 58 asthmatic children between 17 months and 16 years. Plasmatic levels of theophylline were performed by fluoroimmunology technique at H0 (before the dose) 2 (H2), 4 (H4), 6 (H6) and 8 (H8) hours after the dose of slow release theophylline. The best correlation between dose and plasmatic levels were observed at H4 and H6 for Armophylline and Euphylline respectively. Dosage adjustment were based both upon clinical state and plasmatic levels in 55 cases. In 9 cases the modification of dose were decided only because of plasmatic levels out the therapeutic range. The authors proposed a schema of dosage modifications based upon clinical state; plasmatic levels must be used as a guide for dose adjustment in patients clinically uncontrolled.","3214":null,"3215":"","3216":"The authors report the case of erythema multiforme characterized by its cephalic onset and its rise after association phenytoin and cranial irradiation, for glioblastoma with epileptic fits. Eight similar cases are observed in literature with the same timing. Benign outcome is not always the rule because 2 patients died. This type of reaction being not forseeing, and outcome very varying, we suggest to avoid phenytoin in patients having a cerebral tumor revealed by epilepsy and needing a cranial irradiation.","3217":"We developed a high performance liquid chromatography method for the monitoring of enoximone and its main metabolite in serum and urine. Samples handling involves a unique chemical extraction step by ethylacetate. Serum needs at first to be deproteinized by acetonitril. The chromatographic separation is realized on a reversed phase analytical column by gradient elution with acetonitrile. Quantification is by U.V. absorbance at 365 nm. We compared our new method with the method so far considered as reference one. When specificity, accuracy and linearity of both procedures are similar, we greatly enhanced the detection limit [(5 ng\/ml for (E) and (SE)] and the practicability: ease of use, rapidity and lower cost.","3218":"Pharmacokinetic study of 458 L. via oral route, was performed in twelve normal volunteers, in a randomized crossover design of three galenic forms. Plasma concentrations were determined, after extraction, by HPLC, with spectrofluorimetric detection. Plasmatic kinetics were fitted to a bi-exponential function with a distribution half-life of 1h and an elimination half-life of 11.5 to 14.7 h according to the form. Pharmacokinetic parameters evaluated as area under the curve (AUC), maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax), relative bioavailability (F'), have shown strong interindividual differences, specially in women group, and this with tobacco smoking.","3219":"Potassium channels activators (PCA) are drugs which open or prolong the open state duration of potassium channels. Hence they promote potassium efflux, hyperpolarize the cell membrane, thus preventing intracellular penetration of calcium through the voltage-dependent calcium channels. The resulting decrease in intracellular free calcium concentration induces relaxant effects in smooth muscle cells (vessels, bronchi, bladder, etc.) which are the rationale for the present and future therapeutic indications of PCA, namely hypertension, asthma, etc. In animals, PCA produce vasodilating, hypotensive and antihypertensive effects, accompanied by tachycardia and stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system. The regional vasodilator profile of PCA is heterogeneous and their hypotensive properties are antagonized only by glibenclamide, an antagonist of ATP-dependent potassium channels. In patients, only pinacidil, minoxidil and diazoxide are presently used as antihypertensive drugs.","3220":"3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine is a thymidine analogue with an in vitro as well as in vivo efficacy towards HIV-mediated infection. Zidovudine exerts its action, following an intracellular three-step phosphorylation, through viral reverse transcriptase inhibition. Its half-life is approximately one hour. Oral biodisponibility is 65%, and passage through blood-brain barrier results in therapeutic levels is CSF. Clinical evaluation has enabled demonstration of a beneficial effect on survival of stage IV AIDS patients, when treated after a PCP episode. In this setting, aggregate survival ratios reach 73% after one year of follow-up, and 41% after 2 years. In addition, zidovudine activity has been demonstrated in treatment of HIV-induced thrombopenias as well as HIV-related central nervous system disorders. Presently, zidovudine therapeutic evaluation proceeds through the following main axes: dosage tuning (either by lowering of standard dose, and\/or dose interval modification); combination with other antiviral therapies; lastly, patient treatment et an early stage of disease.","3221":"The assessment of risks following drug exposure during pregnancy is of major concern to Drug-Information Centers. A computer-based management is helpful. The authors describe a computerized system to follow pregnancy outcomes and discuss their first results, stressing the merits of automatized recalls.","3222":"","3223":"The authors report five cases of mydriasis induced by the use of transdermal scopolamine delivery systems. Anisocoria and narrow angle glaucoma were involved in four cases; in one case, the use of a strong dosage resulted in a bilateral mydriasis in a child.","3224":"","3225":"AZT is the only available antiviral treatment. While using it, several problems appear to a general practitioner. 1) The supervision of the toxic effects, which is simple but does imply an experience. 2) The interaction of several drugs, while considering, among other difficulties, the great number of similar drugs available in pharmacies. 3) The psychological investment of the patient, for whom AZT is all at a time, a threat, a coercitive weapon and a hope. A proper knowledge of these problems allows the G.P. to work in agreement with the hospital practitioner.","3226":"Opportunistic infections in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) require hematotoxic drugs. Neutropenia and anemia are the major hematologic abnormalities attributed to zidovudine (AZT). Concomitant medications associated with an increased frequency of toxicity are trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole), sulfadiazine, pyrimethamine, ganciclovir. AZT is stopped during initial treatment then reintroduced at full dosage with cotrimoxazole, at reduced dosage with sulfadiazine + pyrimethamine or ganciclovir.","3227":"Zidovudine (AZT) is the only effective drug in the treatment of AIDS. No data are available on the pharmacokinetics of this drug in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We report on the pharmacokinetics of zidovudine between sessions of hemodialysis and during the procedure in one patient with ESRD. In 1987 a 40-year-old man with ESRD treated with hemodialysis had the AIDS-related complex. The T4\/T8 ratio was 0.49. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western Blot studies revealed IgG antibodies specifically directed against HIV. The patient was then treated with zidovudine (100 mg three times daily). Studies of the pharmacokinetics of the drug, conducted between hemodialysis sessions, were performed on days 1 and 14 after the start of zidovudine treatment. Paired arterial and venous blood samples were obtained simultaneously one hour after the start of a hemodialysis session on day 20. The peak and the trough concentrations of zidovudine were 0.61 and 0.15 microgram per milliliter, respectively. We observed a marked accumulation of the main metabolite of zidovudine, G-AZT, with a concentration of about 65 micrograms per milliliter on day 14. The half-life was 2.9 hours. The hemodialysis clearance of zidovudine and its metabolite were 102 and 71 ml per minute, respectively. The half-life of zidovudine was three times longer in our patient than in a normal subject.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","3228":"Pharmacokinetics of zidovudine was investigated after oral administration (200 mg) in 25 HIV seronegative subjects: 14 patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 6 to 31 ml\/min), 5 hemodialyzed anuric patients, and 6 healthy subjects. In healthy subjects, G. AZT concentrations are higher than those of AZT; AUC were 23.7 +\/- 1.9 and 5.2 +\/- 0.6 mumol.h\/l respectively. Formation of G. AZT rate-limits its elimination: G. AZT half-life parallels that of AZT which is around 1 hour. In uremic patients AZT concentrations are moderately increased (AUC = 11.7 +\/- 1.1 mumol.h\/l), whereas half-life and MRT remains unchanged, despite the decreased renal clearance (16 +\/- 2 vs 220 +\/- 58 ml\/min). In contrast G. AZT concentrations are markedly increased (AUC = 403 +\/- 89 mumol.h\/l). As a consequence of the decreased renal clearance (27 +\/- 3 vs 331 +\/- 42 ml\/min), elimination is the rate limiting step and half-life is increased (8 +\/- 2 vs 0.9 +\/- 0.1 h). Contribution of a 4-hour hemodialysis session to AZT elimination appears negligible whereas elimination of G. AZT is enhanced.","3229":"HIV human infections therapy requires at least two different approaches: antiretroviral therapy, and immune system modulation (stimulation or suppression depending on the clinical and biological stage, and upon the pathogenesis of the disease). Because no animal model is today available, little is known about the pathogenic mechanisms of HIV infections in humans. Therefore, only antiviral drugs might be involved in standardized middle or short term clinical trials, because virologic parameters are easily measurable, thought immunomodulators may require more than two or three years before getting informations on their efficiency. AZT is of benefit for treated patients within the first 6 or 8 months of therapy, and, after one year, survival of treated patients seems to be identical to survival of control groups. This might be related to the pharmacokinetic of the drug, which has to be phosphorylated before being active on HIV, and all the susceptible cells to HIV are not able to perform this phosphorylation (macrophages for example). Other therapeutic agents are today either in the early in vitro development (antisens, glycosylation inhibitors), or in phase II clinical trial, and when administered to patients, they do not exhibit any antiviral effect (soluble CD4), suggesting that new pharmacologic administration forms are required.","3230":"Prognosis of heart failure patients remains poor and stimulates research of new active drugs and therapeutic improvements. Besides diuretic and vasodilating agents, the place of positive inotropic drugs remains to be defined. Long term benefit remains to be demonstrated for Milrinone, Enoximone and Digitalis. However, absence of benefit has been established with Amrinone and beta adrenoceptor agonists. Too many uncontrolled studies have complicated the accurate evaluation of efficacy of these positive inotropic drugs. Purpose of heart failure treatment remains to improve functional status without deterioration of myocardial fibers contractility. The respective roles of cAMP, gAMP and intracellular calcium concerning myocardial fiber longevity remains to be clarified.","3231":"","3232":"Evidence from several sources, including electrophysiologic studies and cation flux and content measurements, now allows a reasonably cohesive synthesis of the molecular and cellular events that lead from inhibition of the Na pump by digitalis to the enhancement of the generation of contractile force by cardiac muscle. It is generally agreed that Na pump inhibition, with consequent elevation in [Na+]i and [Ca2+]i, underlies both the therapeutic (positive inotropic) and toxic (arrhythmic) responses of the heart, and accounts for the well-known difficulty in separating therapeutic and toxic clinical effects of digitalis glycosides. In the intact patient or experimental animal, cardiac glycosides also exert effects that are mediated through neural pathways, and these can exert important influences on the integrated response to digitalis administration.","3233":"","3234":"","3235":"","3236":"","3237":"","3238":"","3239":"The circadian intraindividual variations of cyclosporin blood concentrations were studied in nine renal transplant patients at steady state. The cyclosporin was administrated orally twice a day (9 a.m. and 21 p.m.). Blood concentrations were analysed by H.P.L.C. AUC = area under the drug concentration versus time curve, Cmax = maximum blood concentration, Cmin = minimum blood concentration, Tmax = Time to maximum concentration. Statistical analysis (t, Wilcoxon) shows: AUC, Cmax and Tmax are not significantly modified, Cmin (21) less than Cmin (9) (p less than 0.02). This phenomenon seems to be rather a cyclosporin metabolism variation than an absorption alteration.","3240":"A cross-linking process was applied to mixtures of a protein (gelatin A or B) and a polysaccharide. Mixed-walled microcapsules were then obtained, which exhibited properties different from those of microcapsules prepared from the protein alone. They were shown to be more resistant to enzymatic lysis and this effect depended on the ratio of the polysaccharide, on its nature and on the cross-linking pH. Very hydrophilic microcapsules were obtained through cross-linking of gelatin admixed with alginate or carboxymethylcellulose. The addition of alginate to gelatin resulted in a slower release of encapsulated pilocarpine.","3241":"We are presenting a Mac Intosh--Apple computer program (Excel*) for the aminoglycosides (AG) drug monitoring useful in the following situations: --initiation of an AG's dosing regimen depending on the desired peak and through concentration (AG's pharmacokinetic parameters have been calculated according to the AG's literature values). --an adequate dosing regimen after revision of the patient's parameters (calculated with the observed concentrations). The technique has been validated comparing desired (des. C) and measured concentrations (mes. C). --either at the beginning of the treatment, --or after revision of the individual parameters. In the first case, the correlation coefficient obtained between 14 des C and 14 mes.

During the first administration of the drug, two plasmatic concentrations are measured, and input in a preprogrammed hand-held calculator. A posology and a rythm of administration are returned by the calculator. After six days of this dosage regiment, the peak and the valley concentrations are compared with those previously given by the computer as values at equilibrium. No significant difference can be observed. There is no change in plasmatic creatinine level from the first to the sixth day of treatment. So, a preprogrammed hand-held computer can be convenient and safe to monitor netilmicin.","3243":"The importance of assessing the quality of life is more and more emphasized when therapeutic effects are to be studied. However, if its theoretical bases appeared as rather well established, they are not yet effectively translated into the presently available instruments: there is not yet any \"gold exchange standard\" in this field. This fact is the result of the difficulty of this translation and of the medical tendency to reduce the assessment of the quality of life to the assessment of the health. The second part of this paper is thus devoted to the presentation of a new instrument (\"PQVS\" in french, or \"QLPI\" for \"Quality of Life Profile Inventory\"). It was devised for applying the theoretical bases of the study of the quality of life. It thus allows for the assessment: 1) of the quality of the global life, 2) of the quality of what is experienced in several dimensions of the life, and 3) of the individual structure of the quality of life.","3244":"Today paracetamol (acetaminophen), the oldest known synthetic analgesic-antipyretic drug, is one of the most frequently used around the world. The present general review presents the essential knowledge about this drug which has accumulated during the last decade, 1978 from to 1988. It includes recent data concerning toxicity, pharmacokinetics, mechanisms of analgesic and antipyretic action, and therapeutic efficacy. Readers interested in the original papers are referred to 264 bibliographical references.","3245":"The pharmacokinetic parameters of drugs vary largely and predictably as a function of their dosing time along the 24-hr scale (and also the year and the menstrual cycle) in Man. Such chronopharmacokinetics have been described following single or repeated doses via the oral or the venous route, and whether drug halflife is short or long. Moreover continuous infusion of a drug at a constant rate cannot maintain constant plasma levels. Such phenomena are accounted for by circadian (and other) rhythms which characterize absorption, protein binding, transmembrane flux, as well as liver and kidney metabolism and biliary and urinary excretions. It is anticipated that the knowledge of the physical and chemical properties of a drug and that of the circadian organization of the main physiologic functions involved into its bioavailability will allow to predict its chronopharmacokinetics.","3246":"Among in vivo tests to assess liver drug metabolizing enzyme induction, urinary 6-beta-hydroxycortisol (6-beta-OHF), plasma gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and urinary D-glucaric acid are most frequently proposed. 6-beta-OHF is the most abundant unconjugated metabolite of cortisol in human urine. We measured its elimination during a clinical trial in 16 human healthy volunteers (men and women), these persons being treated by a new isoquinoleine derivative, 52028 RP (PK-11195). This drug is an antagonist of peripheral type benzodiazepine binding sites. Urinary excretion of 6-beta-OHF increased significantly (3.5 fold, p less than 0.01) on the 5th day of treatment (400 mg\/day, orally) and remained increased as long as the treatment was continued (15 days). Control values were again observed 5 days after stopping the treatment. Plasma gamma-glutamyltransferase activity and D-glucaric acid urinary elimination are increased more than 2 fold. The data demonstrated that 6-beta-OHF in the most sensitive among the three tests performed to detect a drug metabolism induction, during this clinical trial.","3247":"An open clinical study of treatment of severe rheumatoid arthritis (7 cases) with liposomal bovine copper superoxide dismutase is described. The drug was administered by intramuscular injection twice a week for three months and was well tolerated. Of the seven cases five showed good or very good results with significant amelioration. The absence of toxicity indicates that liposomal superoxide dismutase may be used in future trials with a greater number of patients.","3248":"The inhibition of oxidative drug metabolism is a major cause of clinically significant drug interactions. Among the possible modalities for exploring the enzyme inhibiting potential of drugs, the caffeine test is a valuable addition to the antipyrine test in man. Indeed, microsomal enzymes explored by the caffeine test differ from those attainable by the antipyrine test. After a short overview of caffeine pharmacokinetics, the features of the caffeine test are tentatively described. The results of published studies indicate the usefulness of this simple test for detecting those new drugs endowed with an enzyme inhibiting potential.","3249":"","3250":"","3251":"","3252":"","3253":"","3254":"Statistical analysis of eosinophilia of 331 patients at the onset of hospitalisation define a logarithmic standard population of 327 patients whose eosinophilia rates stand between 0 and 810\/mm3, among them 24 lies between 500 and 810, and 4 whose eosinophilia rise over 1,000\/mm3. These 4 patients had transient hypereosinophilia whose etiology was defined only in 2 cases. The 24 patients with eosinophilia between 500 and 810\/mm3 were significantly more frequently men, with rheumatoid disease (specially sciatica) and users of non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) than the general population.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether biliary tract pathology, as observed during surgery, had an influence on this distribution. 52 patients about to be operated upon and presenting with a high risk of bile infection received a single 1 or 2 g dose of ceftriaxone administered intravenously over 20 min during the hour that preceded surgery. Samples of blood and of bile from the gallbladder (GB) and the common bile duct (CBD), as well as specimens of the GB wall were taken during the operation. In patients whose GB was normal at laparotomy (apart from stones) ceftriaxone concentrations in bile and GB wall were 10-25 and 2 times respectively higher than in plasma. In patients with a grossly distended but not infected GB (hydrocholecystis) ceftriaxone levels were high in CBD bile but null in GB bile and only one-quarter to one-half of plasma levels in GB wall. In patients with stones in the CBD or inflamed GB wall ceftriaxone levels were high in bile (although lower than in cases with normal GB) and similar to plasma levels in GB wall. When malignant pancreatic lesions were present ceftriaxone concentrations could not be measured in both GB and CBD bile but reached 50% of plasma concentrations in GB wall.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","3256":"The study was carried out in association with medical practitioners who were responsible for observing the patients. Its aim was to determine the effective dosage of slow release verapamil (V) in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension and to compare plasma concentrations of V with blood pressure effects. The study comprised a 2-week placebo period and a 3-month active treatment period with V, during which patients were examined, 20-24 h after last intake of V, at the end of the first (D30) and of the third (D90) month of treatment. Active treatment started with 240 mg of V (once a day); at D-30 if diastolic blood pressure (DBP) remained above 90 mmHg the dosage of V was increased to 480 mg (t.d.s.). At each examination blood pressure, body weight and heart rate were registered, electrocardiogram and routine biochemical tests were carried out; plasma concentration of V was measured at D30 for every patient and at D90 for those receiving 480 mg. of V. Thirty patients (11 men and 19 women) aged from 29 to 80 years (mean : 61.7) took part in the study. Treatment needed to be stopped in one patient; results are based on the other 29. At D30 systolic blood pressure (SBP) fell from 179.4 +\/- 5.9 to 156.2 +\/- 5,5 mmHg and DBP from 101.3 +\/- 1.8 to 88.3 +\/- 3 mmHg; DPB became normal (less than 90 mmHg) in 23 subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","3257":"Modified gelatin are said without deleterious effect on kidney, an important proteinuria as been seen however in surgical patients after gelatin perfusion. A study in 15 patients scheduled for abdominal surgery compared the renal effects of two modified gelatin: Plasmion (gr P) and Haemaccel (gr H) administered in a similar manner. In the two groups proteinuria appears as soon as perfusion begins with at the third hour a peak which may be as high as 6 g\/l. In the same time low molecular weight proteinuria (less than 30 kdalton) appears. The beta 2 microglobulinuria (beta 2m) is significatively enhanced (p less than 0,001). Albuminuria is also enhanced but without statistic signification. Comparison between the two groups reveals that in gr P proteinuria is of the same importance, but delayed, with a significatively smaller elimination of beta 2m (1,8 mg\/mmol creatininuria versus 8,6,p less than 0,001). Enzymuria increases in a variable fashion. Proteinuria is probably due to tubular reabsorption inhibition of filtered protein induced by gelatin, particularly by amino acids arginine and lysin which become free after gelatin hydrolysis. If this phenomenon is pathologic or not is unclear and gelatin cannot be said absolutely innocuous. However this phenomenon must be known when proteinuria specially beta 2m is to be interpreted.","3258":"We investigated the anti-ischemic effects of PK 11195 (RP 52028), a selective ligand for peripheral type benzodiazepine binding sites in man. In a first series of patients, we did not find any hemodynamic effect of 10 mg (8 patients) or 20 mg (8 patients) of the intravenously administered drug. The anti-ischemic effect was evaluated on 16 patients with coronary heart disease and a positive stress test in a double blind study of 20 mg of intra-venous PK 11195 (8 patients) versus placebo (8 patients). Ischemia was induced by pacing, and assessed by ST segment depression and lactates extraction before and 15 minutes after administration of the drug. No statistical differences could be found on these ischemia indices between the placebo and PK 11195 treated groups. Although experimental studies have shown interaction of the drug with the calcium channels, our study did not demonstrate any anti-ischemic effect with the dosage used.","3259":"The effects on psychomotor and mnesic performance of acute oral doses of maprotiline (25, 50 and 75 mg) were evaluated in twelve healthy men in a placebo-controlled double blind study. A battery of tests was performed comprising: objective measures (critical flicker frequency, choice reaction time, memory tasks) and self rating evaluation (visual analogue scales). Tests session took place 15 hours after each treatment. Plasma concentrations of maprotiline were determined. Compared with placebo, maprotiline induced psychomotor impairment on both objective and subjective assessment in a dose related manner. No significant difference between maprotiline and placebo on memory test could be evidenced.","3260":"The kinetic of sulindac and its two metabolites (sulfide and sulfone) was investigated in twelve elderly patients, following multiple oral dose administration of 400 mg\/d. Data were compared to those obtained previously in ten healthy volunteers who received the same dosage regimen. Following multiple dose administration, accumulation ratios indicate that sulindac do not accumulate either in elderly patients (R = 1.35; R = AUC0-24 J8\/AUC0-24 J1) or in healthy young subjects (R = 1.38; R = U0-24 J1). No significant modification of sulindac and sulfide kinetic parameters was observed. The apparent bioavailability of the inactive metabolite, sulfone, was found to be doubled in elderly patients (p less than 0.05). We conclude that there is no need to modify the dosage regimen of Arthrocine (400 mg once a day) in elderly patients.","3261":"","3262":"Alpidem (Ananxyl) is a new imidazopyridine anxiolytic. Two studies of single doses of alpidem (50 or 75 mg) versus placebo, involving 104 patients each, showed alpidem at these two doses to be effective in a human model for situational anxiety, which is the psychological state of patients awaiting cardiovascular examination or surgery. Clinical assessment showed no significant difference in safety between alpidem 50 mg and placebo. Conversely, at the dose of 75 mg, there was a higher incidence of drowsiness with alpidem than with placebo.","3263":"","3264":"Over 8 1\/2 years, we observed 27 patients with drug-induced respiratory disease (DIRD). The inducer drugs were mainly those used in cardiology (9 patients, of whom 8 had amiodarone pneumonitis), in oncology (8 patients), in rheumatology (4 patients; 3 from d-penicillamine and 1 from gold), and in neurology (4 cases from ergoline derivatives). The main pattern of DIRD was a diffuse interstitial lung disease having either a rapid, a slowly progressive or a chronic course. Only the two former patterns offered clearing following withdrawal of the drug. Severe bronchiolitis obliterans from d-penicillamine (2 cases) and pulmonary eosinophilia (2 cases) was also observed. The onset of DIRD occurred earlier, i.e. following shorter periods of drug administration (months), in the acute interstitial lung disease variant, while it occurred after years of drug exposure in subacute and chronic forms. In contrast to other reports, bronchoalveolar lavage lymphocytosis was not a prominent feature in amiodarone pneumonitis. The outcome was favourable in 16 patients; deaths was encountered during the florid phase of DIRD in 3; incapacitating sequelae were noted in 6 patients, leading to subsequent death in 2; the underlying disease accounted for 7 additional deaths. Therefore, DIRD are relatively common, develop often in patients with severe underlying conditions, and interstitial pneumonitis is their pattern of predilection. Amiodarone emerges as a common inducer, and accounted for more cases than all chemotherapeutic agents grouped together in our series.","3265":"LF 2.0254 is a new 1.4 dihydropyridine that relaxes vascular smooth muscles by blockade of calcium entry mediated by depolarisation. In rabbit aortas contracted by KCl (15 to 55 mM) or CaCl2 (2 mM), LF 2.0254 differs markedly from nifedipine and nicardipine because of its slow onset of action, the inhibitory effect increasing with the duration of tissular contact. LF 2.0254 has only slight negative chronotropic and inotropic effects on isolated guinea-pig atria as well as in anesthetized dogs after intravenous administration. Furthermore, in open-chest anesthetized dogs, LF 2.0254 decreases mean arterial blood pressure and since cardiac output is maintained total peripheral resistance is decreased. LF 2.0254 administered orally to perinephritic hypertensive dogs (0.1 and 0.3 mg\/kg) and to spontaneously hypertensive rats (0.3 to 10 mg\/kg) induces a more pronounced and long-lasting hypotensive action than nifedipine. In conclusion, these results suggest that LF 2.0254 could be useful in the treatment of hypertension associated or not with cardiac insufficiency.","3266":"A 41 years old male patient suffering from angina pectoris was treated with diltiazem (Tildiem). He was administered with nifedipine (Adalate) 3 times in succession and each time either complete or partial intestinal occlusion occurred. A laparotomy was carried out after the first occlusion, but no organic lesions were found. The search for an alternate non-drug related explanation proved negative. The most likely hypothesis is that of a direct relaxant activity on intestinal smooth muscle, which would explain the functional nature of the occlusion. Therefore it must be considered that the two drugs acted synergistically.","3267":"Most side-effects of calcium channel blockers are related to their pharmacological properties. This is best illustrated by the most common cardiovascular side-effects, which reflect the differences between the drugs of such a heterogeneous group. Side-effects related to excessive vasodilating activity (headache, dizziness, flushing, peripheral edema, and palpitations) are most likely with drugs such as nifedipine and other dihydropyridines, which are most active on vascular smooth muscle. Those related to depressed cardiac contraction and conduction are more likely with verapamil, whereas diltiazem is intermediate between the other two drugs. In the event of the occurrence of these adverse reactions, factors such as pharmacokinetics, galenic form, and the administration mode play a role. The pathological status of the patient also comes into play. Other less common reactions such as neuropsychic, gastrointestinal and endocrine effects and gingival hyperplasia appear as a consequence of the numerous sites of action of these molecules. Hepatic, haematological and cutaneous reactions appear to be relevant to immunological mechanisms. Therefore, most of the adverse effects of calcium channel blockers originate in the common mechanism of action of these drugs.","3268":"Many experimental studies have shown that calcium channel blockers could prevent drug-induced acute renal failure. In dog, nifedipine and verapamil prevent decreasing blood flow produced by contrast material. In rat, administration of verapamil has beneficial effects on gentamycin nephrotoxicity. Verapamil improves renal function in rats with acute renal failure due to cyclosporine. Calcium channel blockers have various effects on cisplatinum nephrotoxicity: in rat, nifedipine worsens nephrotoxicity; in man, verapamil prevents nephrotoxicity due to cisplatinum. In addition, nifedipine seems to improve renal function in transplanted patients treated with cyclosporine. In 2 control studies, we did not find any effect of diltiazem on prevention of renal toxicity due to methotrexate and cisplatinum. Calcium channel blockers could prevent nephrotoxicity by reducing calcium transfer across cell membranes and\/or inhibiting the action of vasoconstrictive hormones.","3269":"Many studies have been done to try to define new therapeutic uses for calcium antagonists, in diseases in which calcium plays a role. Positive results have been obtained in the prevention of acute attacks of idiopathic Raynaud's disease and migraine, and in effort-induced asthma. Some activity could be demonstrated in selected groups of patients with pulmonary hypertension, manic-depressive illness, untractable epilepsy, various functional gynecological or digestive disorders, and in drug-induced nephrotoxicity. A possible effect on the prevention of resistance to anti-cancer drugs could be of major interest. Their antiplatelet effect, and their possible effect against atherosclerosis, which remains to be confirmed, their lack of side-effects in asthmatics and of interference with glucose regulation increase their usefulness in patients with hypertension or ischemic heart disease, especially when other diseases are present.","3270":"Calcium plays an essential role in ischemic events observed during cardiac surgery. Many experiments have studied the effects of calcium channel blockers on intracellular calcium overload during the periods of cardiac ischemia and reperfusion. Calcium channel blockers are no longer used before and during cardiac surgery because hypothermia inhibits their pharmacological action. However, during the post-operative period, calcium channel blockers are the drugs of choice to control coronary spasm, and arterial hypertension which is secondary to peripheral vasoconstriction.","3271":"Felodipine is a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist which selectively relaxes vascular smooth muscle. It lovers dose-dependently blood pressure in hypertensives patients. In this multicentre double-blind study, 113 patients (mean age 50 +\/- 14 years) whose diastolic blood pressure was higher than 95 mmHg after withdrawal of an eventual antihypertensive therapy and a week of placebo administration. The patients received randomly either felodipine (5 mg x 2\/j during two weeks and then 10 mg x 2\/day) either atenolol (100 mg\/day) during two months. Antihypertensive effects of these two drug regimens were not significantly different. Supine blood pressure decreased from 177 +\/- 22\/107 +\/- 8 mmHg to 152 +\/- 27\/91 +\/- 13 mmHg with felodipine and from 176 +\/- 19\/107 +\/- 8 to 152 +\/- 24\/91 +\/- 12 with atenolol. Side effects recorded by means of active questioning were ankle oedemas and headache with felodipine and fatigue and headache with atenolol.","3272":"In order to evaluate the antihypertensive action of intravenous (i.v.) nicardipine, a calcium channel blocker, we included 28 patients (20 women and 8 men) aged from 71 to 93 years (mean age: 80.4 yrs) poorly controlled by their normal antihypertensive treatment, which had not consisted of a calcium channel blocker. These patients had past histories of a variety of cardiovascular disorders: valve disease (n = 4), disorders of cardiac rhythm (n = 3), paced or unpaced disorders of cardiac conduction (n = 8), and cerebrovascular accident (n = 12). On inclusion, their systolic blood pressure (SBP) was greater than or equal to 180 mmHg and\/or their diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than or equal to 100 mmHg. Blood pressure recordings (SBP, DBP, MBP) and heart rate (HR) were simultaneously taken every 3 minutes for a period of 140 minutes by an automatic apparatus and a mercury manometer, before and after i.v. administration of nicardipine at 3 increasing dosages, respectively 1.25 mg (20 th min), 2.5 mg (32 th min) and 5 mg (44 th min), each injected over a period of 6 minutes. With a cumulative dose of 8.75 mg nicardipine i.v., the SBP decreased significantly from 192.6 to 138.8 mmHg (p less than 0.001); similarly, the DBP fell from 93.9 to 65.8 mmHg (p less than 0.001) and the MBP from 126.2 to 90.1 mmHg (Hg manometric measurement). In addition, after the final dose of nicardipine, the blood pressure progressively rose to reach levels, by the end of the trial, of 172.1 mmHg (SBP) and 91.1 mmHg (DBP).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","3273":null,"3274":"The aim of our study was to determine in patients over 70 years, the optimal dose of Bromazepam. Seven patients were administered a unique dose of Bromazepam (3 mg), then repeated doses (1.5 mg) every 12 hours for 9 days. Cmax was 42.5 +\/- 12 ng\/ml in Tmax ranged from 2 to 12 hours after the first dose-concentrations of Bromazepam at steady-state were between 79 and 157 ng\/ml. Half life was 30.5 +\/- 14.7 hrs for the unique and the repeated doses. Sleeping was noted for concentrations over 40 ng\/ml. The dose of 1.5 mg bid is recommended in old patients.","3275":"The most common interactions concern cardiovascular drugs. The combination of calcium antagonists (CA) and beta-blockers is more effective than single-agent therapy in stable effort angina and hypertension. But there is an increased risk of hemodynamic or electrophysiological side effects in patients with left ventricular or sinus dysfunction, or disturbances of conduction. Pharmacokinetic interactions have been observed in particular with verapamil (VE) which increases propranolol bioavailability. VE increases the T1\/2 of elimination and plasma digoxin concentration following single or prolonged administration. The primary mechanism appears to be renal. These modifications increase the risk of digitalis intoxication. Diltiazem (DTZ) inconsistently increases steady state plasma digoxin levels. In healthy subjects, nifedipine (NF) increases plasma digoxin concentrations and decreases digoxin renal clearance. These findings have not been observed in patients with heart failure. NF therefore leads to less marked modifications in digitalis pharmacokinetics than do VE and DTZ. Nitrendipine and nicardipine interact only slightly with digoxin, and consequently there are no pharmacodynamic effects. In healthy subjects, VE increases quinidine t1\/2 and markedly decreases its metabolic clearance. Conversely, quinidine increases plasma NF levels. The primary CA are extensively metabolized by liver microsome oxidases. These result in interactions with the drugs that are also metabolized by these enzymes, or able to modify their activity. VE and DTZ decrease antipyrine and carbamazepine clearance. VE, DTZ and nicardipine lead to a marked increase in plasma ciclosporin levels. Cimetidine, but not ranitidine, increases plasma NF levels. The effects on VE are controversial. Prolonged rifampicin treatment decreases plasma VE levels.","3276":"The sodium-hydrogen (Na+\/H+) antiport is electroneutral and amiloride-sensitive. It exchanges Na+ for H+ with a coupling ratio of 1:1 and therefore, it has important cellular functions: intracellular pH and cell volume regulation, control of the cell differentiation and growth. Its activity is increased in hypertension. The responsibility of the Na+\/H+ antiport in essential hypertension may result in increased vascular tone and vascular hyperplasia. Amiloride is a specific inhibitor of this exchanger but under physiological conditions, very high concentrations of this drug (that are unlikely to be attained in vivo) are required to inhibit the activity of the Na+\/H+ antiport. Certain of its analogues are much more potent in vitro than amiloride. Therefore, the Na+\/H+ antiport may become a target for new antihypertensive drugs.","3277":"In France, the use of an official drug adverse reaction assessment method is mandatory since 1984. The method proposes various qualifications for chronologic and semiologic criteria without clear limits. The definitions could vary with the nature of the side-effect. We report here the results of a consensus meeting on drug-induced photosensitivity. Dermatologists and experts in pharmacovigilance studied together how the \"French method\" could apply to the two variances of drug-induced photosensitivity: phototoxicity and photoallergy.","3278":"The main goal in treating hypertensive patients is to reduce the incidence of complications, especially on the heart. The lowering of blood pressure do not seem enough. Some properties, not shared by all antihypertensive drugs, are likely to allow some protection against heart and coronary diseases. These properties are: the absence of deleterious effects on glucids, lipids and kaliemia; the ability to induce left ventricular hypertrophy regression, antiarrhythmics effects, anti-ischemic effects and the ability to improve arterial compliance. Calcium inhibitors share all these properties and also have some more original and beneficial effects on arterial spasm and may be on progression of atherosclerosis. For all these reasons, a great interest arise for this new therapeutic class in hypertension. However we are still waiting for the demonstration of a true cardiac protection in hypertension with controlled long term trials.","3279":"Although satisfactory therapeutic results are obtained with usual topical opthalmic drugs, they present some inconveniences. Particularly, their biodisponibility is often poor, requiring the use of relatively important doses, and repeated applications. In order to avoid these difficulties, different systems more or less sophisticated, such as soluble inserts, impregnated lenses, liposomes or implantable pumps, have been conceived for topical application. However, although these systems seem to present certain advantages, none of them, commercialized or not, have been quite satisfactory.","3280":"The clinical study report is a key document, representing as it does one of the elements of the drug registration file. The authors propose here a general design for a controlled trial which offers the advantage of a methodical approach covering most clinical study situations.","3281":"The efficacy of propafenone (P), a class IC antiarrhythmic drug with weak beta-blocking properties was studied over a four day period in 10 patients with supraventricular arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation 7, flutter 1 and tachycardia 2). Group 1 included five patients (3M, 2F) who received 300 mg of P on days 1 and 4. Group 2 included five patients (4M, 1F) who received 600 mg on days 1 and 4. All the patients received 1200 mg\/day on days 2 and 3. Pharmacokinetics parameters were calculated for the first and the final dosing. Half of the patients were converted to sinus rythm after a delay ranging from 12 to 55 h after the first dosing. The duration of arrhythmia was shorter and the left atrial diameter was significantly lower in the responder group than in the non-responders. No relationship was observed between clinical efficacy and dose or plasma concentration of P. After the first administration of P, major interindividual variability in pharmacokinetic parameters was observed. Seven patients correspond to the extensive metabolizer phenotype with t1\/2 el less than 10 h (mean: 5.4 +\/- 2.2 SD). In this group t1\/2 el increased from day 1 to day 4 and the AUC final\/AUC initial ratio ranged between 4 to 17.5. Three patients showed the non-extensive metabolizer phenotype with t1\/2 el ranging from 12.4 to 13.7 h and a moderate increase in AUC over chronic dosing. Adverse effects (cardiac conduction abnormalities, visual and digestive disturbances) were observed in the 3 oldest patients (70-73 yrs).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","3282":"","3283":"The safe use of drugs for pediatric patients is based upon good conditions of administration, in order to ensure accuracy and reproducibility of the dose received. But dosage adjustment often needs also a transformation of the galenic form, and that involves many risks or error. Some solutions are proposed in order to standardize the methods of drug adjustment for pediatric use.","3284":"For the last decades, children have been the victims of severe and spectacular drug adverse reactions. Several risk factors explain the sensitivity and specificity of childhood to drug adverse effects. Newborn baby and infant are particularly affected. Three types of adverse effects which affect more specifically children, should be considered: a) Same effect as in adult but increase in intensity. b) Effects resulting from an interference with maturation and growth processes. c) Delayed reactions appearing a long time after drug exposition. Methods use to detect and collect drug adverse effects in children are not theoretically different from those used for adult patients except being more difficult to implement. A long term follow-up of adverse effects should be systematically organised for new drugs intend for children.","3285":"In the French Pharmacopoeia there is a table of doses of drugs for pediatric use, which is to be hold as an official document. Some of the problems raised for establishing these doses are discussed in this paper: choice of age-ranges, selection of drugs, way of expressing doses, interest or not to indicate maximal doses, spread of these data to medical prescribers and pharmacists.","3286":"Drug therapy for children arise many a problem for clinical practitioners as pediatric requirements are very specific. Adequate dosage according to various developmental stages (neonate, infant, child, adolescent), specific pediatric forms issued from clinical and pharmacokinetics trials in children, galenic drugs suitable for pediatric use without side effects especially for topical preparations, remodelling of adult forms into pediatric forms without loss of effectiveness are some of the main problems. Furthermore medication compliance and potential hazards connected to misuse of some \"over the counter\" drugs (antipyretics, vitamins, trace elements) delivered without medical prescription are underscored.","3287":"The pharmacokinetic parameters of a drug allow to define its posology. The large physiological modifications, which occur during the development of a child from birth to adolescence, can intensely modify some pharmacokinetic parameters of a drug and so increase its toxicity or inhibit its activity. In this review, pharmacokinetic consequential effects of child development are studied and discussed with regard to some examples.","3288":"Effect of nifuroxazide on fecal flora was studied in 12 healthy volunteers receiving, in hazardous order and double-blind procedure, three six-days courses of treatment separated by eight-days spaces of time: the conventional dosage of 400 mg twice a day, a dosage of 1200 mg once a day, and placebo. Among six settled bacteriological index (wealth of the fecal flora, percentage of gram-negative bacteria, numbers of E. coli, Enterococcus, Clostridium and Bacteroides), no significant variation was found by means of statistical study between D0, D2 and D7, nor between the three courses of treatment. Therefore nifuroxazide, even in high dosage, does not injure integrity of microbial intestinal ecosystem under so defined experimental conditions, similar with clinical conditions.","3289":"Moderate arterial hypertension of the elderly has to be treated but the efficacy has to be progressive. Cicletanine has a pharmacokinetic profile well fitted to the therapy of this age group. The mechanism of action is characterized by synthesis of prostacyclin. A double blind prospective randomized study was conducted at two institutions on 132 patients aged more than 60, with diastolic arterial pressure over 95 mmHg and systolic over 160 mmHg. 62.9% of them were aged more than 75. The analysis of those two studies shows that the three groups with cicletanine (respectively 50, 100 and 150 mg per day) had a significant decrease of both pressures versus placebo. In the 50 mg group, 40% of arterial pressures were normalized after 3 months of treatment. There were no difference between 50 and 100 mg. There were no adverse drug reaction like falling down, day or night, or orthostatic hypotension. The biological tolerance, more particularly renal, was excellent with this dose of 50 mg a day. Cicletanine at the dose of 50 mg\/day is a recommended treatment in arterial hypertension of the elderly.","3290":"In a double-blind cross over randomized study for the first two nights efficacy and safety of triazolam 0.25 mg and loprazolam 1 mg have been compared in 67 out-patients complaining of common insomnia and treated by general practitioners. After the second night patients had to choose one of the two treatments and were continuing a 3-week treatment period with the preferred one. In case of no preference they received one of the 2 drugs according to a new randomization. Cross over administration of the two drugs for the first two nights shows that with triazolam global help to get in sleep is greater (p = 0.016) and sleep latency is shorter (p = 0.07) than with loprazolam, and number of night awakenings is decreased (p = 0.02) compared to loprazolam. Patients felt more rested under triazolam (p = 0.015) than loprazolam. Triazolam (N = 31) is more frequently preferred than loprazolam (N = 19) p = 0.09. Preferred treatment continued to be effective during the following three weeks and quality of sleep improved drastically for all items compared to baseline data (p = 0.01). Both treatments are well tolerated (4 drop-outs for side-effects: 2 under each treatment). The one-week tapering period allows progressive withdrawal with rare reappearance of minimum sleep disorders (5 cases: 2 under triazolam, 3 under loprazolam).","3291":"Trisomy 21 produces excess sensibility to methotrexate (dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor). A trial of medication with folinic acid (5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate) was realized on 39 trisomic 21 patients. 30 of them were affected by severe infantile psychosis and the other 9 were affected by a severe Alzheimer-like regression. On 69 assays, 37 were favorable and 32 were null. A dose\/effect correlation was highly significant. It is proposed that a systematic investigation of the effects of folinic acid (associated or not with monocarbon precursors) be studied in cases of trisomy 21 complicated by precocious psychosis or severe secondary regression.","3292":"New analogic-digital technology contributions to standard electrocardiography may allow to record the his bundle potential from the body surface. The aim of this work has been to study the validity of this method by its application to estimate the dromotropic effect of propranolol in healthy volunteers. His bundle potential from body surface was recorded in 19 out of 26 enrolled subjects. The negative dromotropic effect of propranolol (40 mg orally) was observed in only 10 volunteers. The direction of the PR and PH interval changes was used to estimate sensibility (0.9) and specificity (0.89) of this method. There was also a significant correlation (0.89 less than p 0.05) between PR and PH interval changes. This new non-invasive method could be used in clinical pharmacology but the subjects must be preselected.","3293":"","3294":"","3295":"","3296":"The role of drug use in iatrogenic pathology was studied prospectively in a hospital department. It wa s found that patients received an average of 2.8 drugs and that 30% of the prescriptions were unnecessary. During this six-month study of all patients admitted to a general medicine and rheumatology department, there were 67 iatrogenic accidents affecting 12.3% of the population: 41.8% of the accidents were directly responsible for hospitalization, 35.4% were due to therapy initiated during hospitalization and 32.8% occurred during the hospital stay but were the result of earlier treatment. Moreover, 26% of the accidents were related to what was considered to be unnecessary therapeutics. This study shows that elevated iatrogenic pathology was due to excessive drug use. However, the degree of severity of the adverse effects varied considerably, and some could have been easily avoided.","3297":"Drug use was assessed in a prospective 6-month study carried out in the Department of General Medicine V and Rheumatology of the Nantes Regional Hospital Center. An attempt was made to evaluate consumption as realistically as possible, and a judgment was made based on the consensus of the medical team as to whether the prescription was justified or not. The mean number of drugs consumed by each patient was 2.8; 60% being prescribed for cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric purposes. As 33% of the prescriptions were considered unnecessary, it would appear that use was excessive in these hospitalized patients.","3298":"Ornidazole was administered for ten days to twelve hospitalized neonates at the same daily dose of 20 mg\/kg either by one or two IV infusions. Minimum steady-state concentrations measured between the 4th and 10th day ranged from 7.8 to 17.3 (mean = 11.8 +\/- 3.2 mg\/l) for one daily infusion and from 10.9 to 26.6 (mean = 20.5 +\/- 6 mg\/l) for two infusions. These minimum concentrations were all above the minimum inhibitory concentration for the most clinically significant anaerobic bacteria. So the single daily administration of ornidazole at the dose of 20 mg\/kg is sufficient to obtain therapeutic efficiency.","3299":"Gelox antacid activity has been evaluated in a dynamic procedure by using the \"artificial stomach\" model that mimics both gastric fluxes, gastric secretion and gastric emptying. At time 0, the gastric reservoir has been filled by 100 ml of 0.1 N hydrochloric acid solution without or with protein, or by 100 ml of human gastric juice (pH 1.1). Gastric secretion was simulated by a constant 3 ml\/min flux of HCl solution or of human gastric juice. Gastric emptying fluxes varied from 1.5 to 4.5 ml\/min. Gelox addition to 100 ml of 0.1 N HCl or of human gastric juice induced 1) a pH-rise from 1.0 to 4.5-5.8, 2) a buffering capacity close to pH 3.6-4.0 and 3) the consumption of an acid amount between 25 and 50 mmol according to emptying fluxes, for recovering initial pH. In a mixture of HCl 0.1 N and protein extract 1 or 5%, Gelox induced 1) a pH-rise related to the protein concentrations, 2) a buffering capacity close to pH 3.2-3.9 when 1% protein extract has been used, and close to pH 5.0-5.9 with 5% protein extract and 3) a greater acid consumption with 1% than with 5% protein extract. For both protein concentrations, the resistance for recovering the initial pH, expressed as the amount of consumed mmol H+, was therefore less than the sum of individual capacities of proteins and Gelox.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","3300":"In ten healthy volunteers, we evaluated the effects of a 6 days antacid treatment (Rocgel) on the aspirin induced changes in gastric potential difference (PD).

Aspirin induced drop of PD was less pronounced after antacid compared to placebo; maximal fall of PD and area upper the curve decreased (p less than 0.001). This effect was observed twelve hours after the last take of the antacid. It may suggested a long-term protective effect on the gastric mucosa.","3301":"The aim of this study was to measure the results of a long-acting theophylline (Planphylline) on the flow rates of stable asthmatic patients while taking into account the spontaneous circadian variations of the ventilatory function. 27 patients were involved in this randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial; they received 10 mg\/kg\/day in two doses at 8.30 a.m. and 8.30 p.m or the placebo. The product was administered over two 4-day periods separated by a 3-day wash-out period. The theophylline concentration and bronchial flows (FEV1; MMEFR 25-75) were measured at 8 a.m., 10.30 a.m., noon, and 3 p.m. on days 1 and 4 of each period; 11 patients measured their hourly PEFR from 8 a.m to 10 p.m those same days. The results can be analysed for 19 patients, including the 11 who measured their PEFR. The first day of treatment (D1), the theophylline concentration rose regularly without going above 10 micrograms\/ml. On the fourth day of treatment (D4), the mean maximum concentration was above 10 micrograms\/ml and the 8 a.m rate was superior to 8 micrograms\/ml for 14 patients out of 19. The bronchodilating effect of Planphylline is significant for all bronchial flow rates (FEV1 less than 0.01; MMEFR 25-75 less than 0.05; PEFR less than 0.01, n = 11). On D1, the FEV1 becomes normal. On D4, the MMEFR 25-75 is still only partially improved, in spite of the theophylline concentration obtained. Because of the spontaneous diurnal improvement of bronchial rates, only the 8 a.m, 10.30 a.m. and 3 p.m. FEV1 obtained with Planphylline are statistically different from those obtained with placebo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","3302":"The purpose of this retrospective study was to consider impaired renal function in patients with severe congestive heart failure after converting enzyme inhibition and to emphasize the characteristics of this population.

The induction is produced by oxygen-derived free radicals which attack the membrane phospholipids. Such an attack is modulated by an enzymatic protection system (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione transferase) and by a non-enzymatic one (vitamin C, vitamin E...). In various pathologic conditions, a dispoise takes place between radical attack and antiradical protection. The place taken by lipoperoxidation in the ageing process seems to be fundamental. We report here the results of a study carried out in aged and sick patients who were given an antioxidant medicamentous combination made from Vitamin C, Vitamin E and Rutin.

case of jaundice appearing after 7 days of treatment with troleandomycin 1.5 g\/24 hours in a 21-year old woman who had taken an oral contraceptive (OC) for 3 years is described.  The young woman had tolerated Ovariostat and later Miniphase, and had never taken troleandomycin.  Mild digestive trouble appeared after 48 hours, and on the 7th day the appearance of pruritus and early jaundice caused interruption of the troleandomycin and the OC.  Examination disclosed hyperbilirubinemia and increased alkaline phosphatases and transaminases.  Pruritus and jaundice regressed about 1 month later but did not disappear completely for 2 months.  No evidence of viral hepatitus was found.  Although combined pills and troleandomycin are both known to be associated with hepatic effects, jaundice is rare in both cases.  From 1977-81 about 60 cases similar to the present one have been published in France.  If simultaneous treatment with troleandomycin and combined OCs is the cause of the jaundice, the mechanism may be inhibition of troleandomycin metabolism by the estrogen, inhibition of estrogen metabolism by the troleandomycin, or simply the accumulation of toxicities of 2 hepatotoxic substances.  Until careful, large scale studies are undertaken it seems prudent to avoid the prescription of troleandomycin in women who are taking combined oral pills or are pregnant.","3986":"","3987":"","3988":"","3989":"","3990":"","3991":"","3992":"","3993":"","3994":"","3995":"","3996":"","3997":"","3998":"","3999":"","4000":"","4001":"","4002":"","4003":"","4004":"","4005":"","4006":"","4007":"","4008":"","4009":"","4010":"","4011":"","4012":"","4013":"","4014":"","4015":"","4016":"","4017":"","4018":"","4019":"","4020":"","4021":"","4022":"","4023":"","4024":"","4025":"","4026":"","4027":"","4028":"","4029":"","4030":"","4031":"","4032":"","4033":"","4034":"","4035":"","4036":"","4037":"","4038":"","4039":"","4040":"","4041":"","4042":"","4043":"","4044":"","4045":"","4046":"","4047":"","4048":"","4049":"","4050":"","4051":"","4052":"","4053":"","4054":"","4055":"","4056":"","4057":"","4058":"","4059":"","4060":"","4061":"","4062":"","4063":"","4064":"","4065":"","4066":"","4067":"","4068":"","4069":"","4070":"","4071":"","4072":"","4073":"","4074":"","4075":"","4076":"","4077":"","4078":"","4079":"","4080":"","4081":"","4082":"","4083":"","4084":"","4085":"","4086":"","4087":"","4088":"","4089":"","4090":"","4091":"","4092":"","4093":"","4094":"","4095":"","4096":"","4097":"","4098":"","4099":"","4100":"","4101":"","4102":"","4103":"","4104":"","4105":"","4106":"","4107":"","4108":"","4109":"","4110":"","4111":"","4112":"","4113":"","4114":"","4115":"","4116":"","4117":"","4118":"","4119":"","4120":"","4121":"","4122":"","4123":"","4124":"","4125":"","4126":"","4127":"","4128":"","4129":"","4130":"","4131":"","4132":"","4133":"","4134":"","4135":"","4136":"","4137":"","4138":"","4139":"","4140":"","4141":"","4142":"","4143":"The article presents the case of a 38 year old patient, on OC (oral contraception) for 10 years.

Electrophysiological studies have shown a specific interaction of BZD with - aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter, of which they enhance the physiological effects. The discovery of saturable and stereospecific binding sites with high affinity for BZD, and their brain distribution indicates a predominantly cortical action of BZD. Furthermore, BZD receptors seem to be linked to GABA receptors--modulating their inhibitory effects--and closely connected to the chloride conductance mechanism associated to the GABA receptor. The discovery of BZD receptors suggests the existence of endogenous ligands. Inosine, hypoxanthine or nicotinamide are reported to have BZD-like activities, in spite of a relative low affinity for their binding sites. Their putative role as endogenous anxiolytics needs to be supported by behavioral studies.","4164":"","4165":"","4166":"","4167":"","4168":"","4169":"","4170":"","4171":"","4172":"","4173":"","4174":"","4175":"","4176":"","4177":"","4178":"","4179":"","4180":"","4181":"","4182":"","4183":"","4184":"","4185":"","4186":"","4187":"","4188":"","4189":"","4190":"","4191":"","4192":"","4193":"","4194":"","4195":"","4196":"","4197":"","4198":"","4199":"","4200":"","4201":"","4202":"","4203":"","4204":"","4205":"","4206":"","4207":"","4208":"","4209":"","4210":"","4211":"","4212":"","4213":"","4214":"","4215":"","4216":"","4217":"","4218":"","4219":"","4220":"","4221":"","4222":"","4223":"","4224":"","4225":"","4226":"","4227":"","4228":"","4229":"","4230":"","4231":"","4232":"","4233":"","4234":"","4235":"","4236":"","4237":"","4238":"","4239":"","4240":"","4241":"","4242":"","4243":"","4244":"","4245":"","4246":"","4247":"","4248":"","4249":"","4250":"","4251":"","4252":"","4253":"","4254":"","4255":"","4256":"","4257":"","4258":"Since cervical mucus secretion and quality is of fundamental importance for the passage of spermatozoa through the cervical canal, a nonhormonal substance which would provoke a total coagulation of cervical mucus would provide a very secure barrier against the ascension of spermatozoa.  The authors have investigated the possibility of modifying the physio-chemical composition of cervical mucus to make it impermeable to spermatozoa for contraceptive purposes.  A very effective substance seems to be what is commonly called gallic tannin.  Experimental research conducted in vitro has been very successful; this substance is antiseptic and nonirritating to the vaginal mucosa.
