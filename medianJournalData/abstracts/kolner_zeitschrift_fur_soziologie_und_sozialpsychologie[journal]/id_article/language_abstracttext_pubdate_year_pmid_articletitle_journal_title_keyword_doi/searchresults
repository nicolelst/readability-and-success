Specifically, we use data from the Mexican Migration Project to construct event history files predicting first U.S. trips from seven communities in the state of Veracruz, which until recently sent very few migrants abroad. Similarly, using data from the Polish Migration Project, we derive comparable event history files predicting first trips to Germany from four Polish communities, which also sent few migrants abroad before the 1980s. Our analyses suggest that the onset of structural adjustment in both places had a significant effect in raising the probability of international migration, even when controlling for a set of standard variables specified by other theories to influence migration propensity, such as the size of the binational income gap and various indicators of human and social capital.","15":"People who share a common household with their life partner tend to demonstrate very low residential mobility. Attempts to explain this have been fruitful to an extent, but controlling for appropriate third variables does not entirely account for the effect of partnership status on mobility. A simple microeconomic model makes a first attempt to explain the independent effect of partnership status on migration decisions. This first attempt is here expanded into a behavior theory model and an expanded model of decision making in the context of uncertainty. According to this analysis, within certain parameters, the decisive obstacle to the mobility of couples living together consists of the risks and costs associated with negotiations. The anticipation of possible negotiating problems frequently results in a potentially positive migration opportunity not even being considered for a decision. The proposed theoretical models are empirically tested using data from the study on migration potential undertaken by the University of Mannheim's Center for European Social Research.","16":"\"Life expectancy and mortality increasingly are analyzed in the context of social factors.  This study analyzes the impact of social position, marital status, and religious confession on cohort life expectancy.  The analysis is based on [German data from the] Socio-Economic Panel Survey, wherein proxy-interviewee's parents have been used to estimate cohort mortality.  Results confirm a lower mortality risk of the upper classes and of married persons.  However, as opposed to other studies, Catholics do not have a lower, but even a higher mortality risk.\" (SUMMARY IN ENG)","17":"The availability of mates and the consequences for cohort fertility by sex in Germany is analyzed using pooled data from various fertility surveys conducted since 1900.  \"All German male cohorts born before 1930 have a greater number of children than their female counterparts.  German men up to cohorts around 1930 experienced favourable conditions of the marriage market due to the consequences of the two World Wars.... The general decline of births beginning around 1970 will, however, turn around this relative position. Leaving the preferred age-difference between spouses unchanged smaller female cohorts will now be able to select partners from greater (and older) cohorts of potential male partners.  These changing relative positions are already visible in the differences between male and female cohort fertility.\" (SUMMARY IN ENG)","18":"\"On the basis of life history data of German birth cohorts born 1929-31, 1939-41, and 1949-51 hypotheses about the relation between regional context, migration and family formation are tested.  Results of proportional hazard models do not show significant regional effects on first birth rates for stayers when sociostructural variables are controlled for.  However, social background and employment status of [women], which are proved to be important factors concerning family formation, reflect differential regional opportunities on the labor market.  For men including the indicator of marriage in the model makes the regional effect insignificant.\"  The impact on fertility of rural or urban residence and of rural-urban migration is analyzed. (SUMMARY IN ENG)","19":"\"Demographic studies on cohort fertility have revealed that the birth decline in the [Federal Republic of Germany] was accompanied or even brought about by a considerable postponement in parenthood.  By means of event history analysis and micro-simulation this article shows that the postponement of motherhood can be attributed to the expansion of the educational system that took place in the 60s and early 70s.  Furthermore, changes in educational structure have contributed markedly to increased childlessness in the younger generation, whereas there is no relation between the reduction in family size and the structural changes in education.  The impact of increased education on the family life-cycle can be explained by labour market theories, whereas traditional theories have neglected biographic aspects of fertility.\" (SUMMARY IN ENG)","20":"German contributions to the theory of migration are reviewed. Specifically, the author examines the theory of structural and anomic tension developed by Hoffmann-Nowotny and the action-oriented analysis of the assimilation process developed by Esser.  These two theories are compared, and it is noted that although both theories arrive at competing propositions on the theoretical level, there are strong convergences at the level of the derived causal models.  The extent to which models involving national choices can overcome the theoretical weaknesses identified in migration research is also considered.","21":"A review of the recent literature on consensual unions and cohabitation is presented.
