against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) provides effective protection against infection or severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Moreover, it is regarded as the single most important measure to end the pandemic. Individual vaccination effectiveness is often judged via measurement of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. However, considering the complexity of the humoral and cellular immune response the question arises whether the relation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness is a myth or a fact? The current article aims to answer this question and provide a short review of the immunological mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Recommendations for clinical practice are given based on the current evidence and known problems of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody measurements after vaccination.","1":"The current S3 guideline entitled \"Strategies to warrant rational in-hospital use of antibiotics\" summarizes evidence-based antibiotic stewardship (ABS) measures that aim to improve clinical outcomes and prevent development and spread of microbial resistance in German hospitals. Most important prerequisite for efficiency and safety of ABS programs is sufficient staffing capacity as well as reliably operating surveillance of (i) pathogens, (ii) antimicrobial resistance and (iii) consumption of antimicrobials. ABS teams require authorization by hospital institutions as units exclusively responsible for antimicrobial audits and implementation of anti-infective interventions. Clinicians should be regularly granted access to in-hospital training programs delivered by ABS experts. Finally yet importantly, the current S3 guideline also highlights future goals, e.g., the structured involvement for nurses in ABS-guided infection management or the promotion of ABS programs in the outpatient sector and in veterinary medicine.","2":"Life threatening events after surgery often occur on the ward. These events could be prevented by early detection of clinical deterioration of patients' health status during ward care. Therefore, an adequate monitoring could help to identify patients at risk, since there is an imbalance of monitoring intensity and the occurrence of life-threatening events during hospital stay.Additional monitoring on the general ward could lead to more patient safety. The practicability of additional monitoring needs to be considered, and therefore the use of available monitoring systems on the ward is limited. Capillary refill time (CRT) and the passive leg raise test (PLR) seem to be usable intermittent monitoring techniques.Continuous monitoring systems ensure a better detection of unwanted events and hemodynamic trends. However, the increased workload for the nursing staff and tethered monitors are unfavorable. Future trends of developing wireless monitoring systems are of paramount importance in this respect. Controlling artefacts is crucial for the successful balance between false alarms and \"missed events\". An adequate reaction is needed when detecting adverse events to avoid a \"failure to rescue\".","3":"Less invasive or even completely non-invasive haemodynamic monitoring technologies have evolved during the last decades. However, the invasive devices such as the pulmonary artery catheter and transpulmonary thermodilution technologies are still the clinical gold standard in terms of advanced haemodynamic monitoring, especially in the treatment of critically ill patients. The current data situation regarding the early use of continuous haemodynamic monitoring in this patient population, specifically flow-based variables such as stroke volume to prevent occult hypoperfusion, is overwhelming. However, the effective implementation of these technologies in daily clinical routine is remarkably low. Given the fact that perioperative morbidity and mortality are higher than anticipated, anaesthesiologists and intensivists are in charge to deal with this problem. The recent advances in minimally invasive and non-invasive haemodynamic monitoring technologies may facilitate a more widespread use in the operating theatre and in critical care patients. This review evaluates the significance of invasive, minimally- and non-invasive monitoring devices and their specific haemodynamic variables in this particular field of perioperative medicine.","4":"Goal directed hemodynamic monitoring and the balance in goal directed therapy between adequate fluid\/volume therapy and the application of vasoactive or inotropic drugs are the basic elements of modern perioperative therapy.Surgical procedures should be accompanied by as few side effects and complications as possible. Nevertheless, the number of postoperative complications remains surprisingly high, despite of the modern surgical procedures. Anticipation of potential complications in the perioperative period and their rapid treatment build a core competence of anesthesiological action. Thus, it is clear that anesthesia plays a central role in this balancing act.This article aims to provide an overview of the application of the currently available perioperative goal directed hemodynamic monitoring. The current possibilities are discussed by using a case example and an outlook on the future of hemodynamic monitoring is given.","5":"","6":"In this review, we provide an update on the intensive care unit (ICU) management of ischemic stroke. Over the last decade, new evidence has led to rapid changes in the early management of patients admitted with acute ischemic stroke. Nevertheless, stroke remains a leading cause of disability. Consequently, a significant number of patients with acute ischemic stroke require ICU level care. The most frequent reasons for ICU admissions are large infarction with potential swelling, reduced level of consciousness, secondary hemorrhagic transformation, acute symptomatic seizures or respiratory failure and stroke-related disorders of the brain-heart interaction. Moreover, there is an increasing number of patients receiving intravenous thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy with a subsequent need of ICU monitoring. Several studies have shown that the implementation of specialized neuro-intensive care teams help to improve functional outcome after acute ischemic stroke. The main goal in the ICU management of stroke patients is to prevent secondary brain injury. To this end, a comprehensive approach to optimize systemic physiological homeostasis, control intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion, hemodynamic and respiratory parameters is needed. Here, we summarize recent advances in invasive and non-invasive neuro-monitoring, decision making in decompressive neurosurgery for large supratentorial or cerebellar infarction, specific cardiorespiratory management, nutrition, temperature management and mobilization strategies in ischemic stroke.","7":"The Corona pandemic is a clear demonstration of the need for an alternative to face-to-face medicine. This demand makes telemedicine the tool of choice. In the preliminary stage of the Virtual Hospital North Rhine-Westphalia (VKh), tele-intensive care consultation services have contributed to both a benefit in terms of care and a benefit for individual patients. The task now is to roll out and use digitally-supported intensive-care networks across the board, including throughout Europe. The goal of telemedicine is to ensure comprehensive patient care - also across sector boundaries of the healthcare system - and to improve quality. Tele-intensive care is already an evidence-based added value and addresses current and future challenges such as resource shortage and citizen-centered care. The Virtual Hospital NRW is a telemedical network structure that is unique in Germany. It provides telemedical services from expert centers in a quality-assured and comprehensive manner for general hospitals as well as for outpatient players. Telemedical services help to overcome rigid sector boundaries and to optimize treatment processes. As a result, service-differentiated care networks are goal-oriented. The medium-term perspective could be cross-border network structures. Medical expertise and also intensive care data, both from care and research, could thus be used throughout Europe. In October 2021, the Aachen Expert Center reported on its first 112 telemedically co-managed COVID-19 patients as part of the preliminary stage of the virtual hospital. With a lethality rate of 34.2% in the group of ventilated severely ill COVID-19 patients and a transfer rate of 8%, high-quality care close to the patient's home was achieved through tele-intensive medical consultation services.","8":"The high workload in intensive care medicine arises from the exponential growth of medical knowledge, the flood of data generated by the permanent and intensive monitoring of intensive care patients, and the documentation burden. Artificial intelligence (AI) is predicted to have a great impact on ICU work in the near future as it will be applicable in many areas of critical care medicine. These applications include documentation through speech recognition, predictions for decision support, algorithms for parameter optimisation and the development of personalised intensive care medicine. AI-based decision support systems can augment human therapy decisions. Primarily through machine learning, a sub-discipline of AI, self-adaptive algorithms can learn to recognise patterns and make predictions. For actual use in clinical settings, the explainability of such systems is a prerequisite. Intensive care staff spends a large amount of their working hours on documentation, which has increased up to 50% of work time with the introduction of PDMS. Speech recognition has the potential to reduce this documentation burden. It is not yet precise enough to be usable in the clinic. The application of AI in medicine, with the help of large data sets, promises to identify diagnoses more quickly, develop individualised, precise treatments, support therapeutic decisions, use resources with maximum effectiveness and thus optimise the patient experience in the near future.","9":"The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health emergency of historic dimension. In this situation, researchers worldwide wanted to help manage the pandemic by using artificial intelligence (AI). This narrative review aims to describe the usage of AI in the combat against COVID-19. The addressed aspects encompass AI algorithms for analysis of thoracic X-rays or CTs, prediction models for severity and outcome of the disease, AI applications in development of new drugs and vaccines as well as forecasting models for spread of the virus. The review shows, which approaches were pursued, and which were successful.","10":"The application of artificial intelligence (AI) is often associated with the use of large amounts of data for the construction of AI models and algorithms. This data should ideally comply with the FAIR Data principles, i.e. being findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. However, the handling of health data poses a particular challenge in this context. In this article, we highlight the challenges of the data usage for AI in medicine using the example of anaesthesia and intensive care medicine. We discuss the current situation but also the obstacles for a wider application of AI in medicine in Europe and give suggestions how to solve the different issues. The article covers different subjects like data protection, research data infrastructures and approval of medical products. Finally, this article shows how it can nevertheless be possible to establish a secure and at the same time effective handling of data for use in AI at the European level despite its unneglectable difficulties.","11":"","12":null,"13":null,"14":null,"15":null,"16":null,"17":null,"18":null,"19":"","20":null,"21":null,"22":null,"23":null,"24":null,"25":"","26":"On March 14, 2020, the first Bavaria-wide exit restriction was imposed and university teaching in its familiar form was drastically restricted. For intensive care physicians and anesthetists, there was a special area of tension in many places due to the extraordinary demand for the treatment of critically ill patients and the restructuring and maintenance of teaching. We report on the realignment of the anesthesia seminar in an online flipped classroom and the development towards a hybrid model. As such, an adequate transfer of knowledge could take place under difficult conditions and at the same time the teaching concept could be further developed.","27":null,"28":"The majority of professionals involved in pre-hospital emergency care do not have explicit paediatric training and have limited experience in the care of life-threatening paediatric emergencies. There is often a fear of being overwhelmed. However, no special paediatric expertise is primarily required to successfully perform resuscitation in children. In addition, the scope of the measures required for successful paediatric resuscitation is on average significantly smaller than for adults. It is essential to know clear and easy-to-implement courses of action, such as those provided by the resuscitation guidelines. For the technical implementation of airway protection, mask-bag ventilation and the laryngeal mask are essential, and for access to the venous system, the intraosseous needle is an aid that overcomes all difficulties almost without exception. With additional support from reference sources, calculation aids and length-related systems, a high level of drug therapy safety can be achieved. In summary, through thorough individual and institutional preparation for paediatric emergencies, safe primary care is feasible by emergency service personnel of any speciality.","29":"Stroke is one of the most common neurological emergencies and requires rapid detection and treatment (time is brain). There is still insufficient knowledge about stroke warning signs. It is therefore of crucial importance that trained personnel in the preclinical setting recognize the relevant warning symptoms and collect the necessary information to quickly refer the patient to the appropriate additional care structure. For this purpose, training of the emergency medical services (EMS) and the correct triage are of particular importance. The on-site assessment of a patient with a suspected stroke by EMS should include airway, breathing, vital functions, a basic neurological examination, blood glucose testing and cardiac monitoring.Patients with suspected acute ischemic stroke should be brought to the nearest hospital with a stroke unit, ideally connected with a tertiary stroke centre. From there, once the primary diagnosis has been carried out and appropriate therapy initiated, the patient can be transferred to a thrombectomy center if necessary. To improve supply times, teleradiological networking plays a major role both between clinics of different levels of care and in communication between pre- and intra-hospital care providers. Also, the use of mobile stroke units can improve preclinical stroke care and reduce delays in access to intravenous thrombolytic therapy and mechanical thrombectomy. The identification of preclinical biomarkers could also save time.","30":null,"31":"","32":null,"33":null,"34":"More than a third of all patients undergoing surgery take psychotropic agents on a regular basis. Aside from classical indications like depression and psychosis these drugs are often prescribed for treatment of pain, anxiety and panic disorder. Over the last 30 years the frequency of prescription of psychotropic drugs increased by seven times. Of note, drug interactions of psychoactive medications and anaesthetic agents are common, and the therapeutic range is narrow. Since not all of these agents can be stopped uncritically, careful assessment of risks and benefits is obligatory. The anaesthesiologist has to take special care or avoid the use of certain medications.Medical treatment is crucial for the treatment of several neurological disorders. Frequently, anaesthesiologists are faced with common diseases like seizure disorders, Parkinson's disease and Myasthenia gravis. Perioperative withdrawal of specific medication implies the risk of recurrence of the neurological symptoms. Therefore, these drugs should be continued postoperatively as soon as possible.","35":null,"36":null,"37":null,"38":"","39":"For many colleagues, the job of anesthesia technical assistant (ATA) is a new - previously unknown - job description in the healthcare sector. The anesthesia departments currently employ qualified nurses (3 years of training) or specialist nurses (5 years of training). However, there has been a known shortage of skilled workers in the care industry for many years. Vacancies are often difficult or impossible to fill. The result is a higher service burden for existing employees. It can also happen that operating theaters have to be closed because no staff is available - this has not only economic effects on the respective provider, but also in particular on patient care.The independent basic training of the technical assistant for anesthesia was not only created to counteract the shortage of skilled workers. At the same time, this new field of work was supposed to be attractive and to train specialists - directly. In the future, the anesthesia departments will be supported by anesthesia technical assistants. This article explains the training structure and areas of responsibility.","40":null,"41":"The number of non-surgical patients in the hospital setting with pain due to medical conditions or comorbidities and\/or invasive procedures or treatments is high. Compared to perioperative pain management, the portion of patients and\/or conditions that require more than an approach focused on pharmacological treatment of nociceptive pain is considerably higher. Rather, treatment often requires the differentiated use of co-analgesics, non-pharmacological treatments, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, psychological assessment and interventsions and educational approaches, ideally in the form of closely coordinated interdisciplinary treatment. The assessment and treatment of acute and especially chronic pain should follow the biopsychosocial concept of pain, especially if risk factors for chronification have been identified, if patients receive high-dose therapy with analgesics or have preexisting a chronic pain disorder.","42":"For many years now, effective pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment approaches for acute and chronic pain exist, as well as organisational strategies for their implementation in hospitals. Nevertheless, there remain considerable deficits in pain management and the portion of patients with severe or long-lasting pain in non-surgical units is often high. There is a considerable potential to improve quality and structures of pain mangement in non-surgical hospital settings in Germany. Recently, legal requirements to establish a structured perioperative pain management were introduced. This should not be seen as a signal that pain management is less important in non-surgical disciplines. On the contrary - it should raise awareness for more clinical and health services research to further develop and validate appropriate approaches and concepts to improve pain treatment in this field.","43":"Acute pain therapy following operative or interventional procedures has become a compulsory component of a modern perioperative patient management. A structured pain regimen has several clear advantages: it leads to an improvement of the patients' quality of life in the short term, it reduces perioperative morbidity in the medium term, it reduces pain chronification in the long term, at the same time improving the economic efficiency due to an accelerated mobilization, a reduction of the hospitalization and an avoidance of complication inherent costs.This article provides detailed information on the change of paradigm, away from a generalized and rather unspecific acute pain therapy towards a problem oriented procedure specific regimen. It points out two examples of the PROSPECT (PROcedure SPECific pain managemenT) methodology and explains its background.","44":"Many surgical procedures are followed by postoperative pain. Acute pain should be treated optimally for medical and ethical reasons. Different psychological, physical, interventional and pharmacological methods are employed in a procedure specific and institution specific matter. For optimum patient care, implementation of acute pain management concepts in recommendations on quality management in German hospitals and outpatient clinics was enacted in September 2020 by Gemeinsamer Bundessausschuss (G-BA). Implementation of discharge management had already been enacted in 2017 for structured prescription of medication after hospital discharge, among other things. On the other hand, new national and international developments require a new weighting of pharmacotherapy in particular. Examples include debates on the safe use of metamizol and the opioid crisis in the US. To address these issues adjustments in informed consent and patient information and education are necessary. This includes also the information and education of caregivers. This article describes the legal framework, technical solutions and the impact of placebo and nocebo effects on doctor-patient communication.","45":"","46":"","47":"","48":null,"49":"A 29-year-old woman suffered major traumatic brain injury caused by a car accident. As diagnostic measures had revealed an early pregnancy (9th week), treatment on the intensive care unit was continued for 5 months, after unfavourable cerebral prognosis was followed by an irreversible loss of brain function in the 10th week of pregnancy. After assisted vaginal delivery of a healthy child in the 31th week of pregnancy on the critical care unit, organ procurement took place according to the presumed will of the patient. The article presents the details of the critical care therapy and discusses the supportive medical measures. Those measures served primarily to uphold the pregnancy und support the healthy development and delivery of the fetus and only in second instance the organ preservation aiming on organ donation. Necessary measures included maintenance of vital functions, hemostasis of electrolytes, nutrition, treatment of infection, prevention of adverse effects on the fetus, substitution of hormones and vitamins as well as the preparation of a planned or an unplanned delivery.","50":"New atrial fibrillation is a risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality in the perioperative phase. The prevalence and incidence of atrial fibrillation depend on age, previous illnesses and the intercurrent diagnoses in the perioperative phase. Pathomechanisms for both permanent and acute forms of atrial fibrillation relate to electrophysiological, histopathological and other pathophysiological abnormalities. In the perioperative phase, decompensated heart failure, systemic inflammation, sepsis and cardiac surgery are risk factors for conversion to atrial fibrillation and\/or rapid transition. The consequences of newly occurring and\/or rapidly transferred atrial fibrillation are cardiac instability due to a drop in blood pressure or cardiac output volume or coronary underperfusion due to tachycardia and the risk of thromboembolism. Associated with this is a significantly increased long-term mortality risk in the elderly if atrial fibrillation occurs again in the perioperative phase. The diagnosis of atrial fibrillation is made in the monitor or 12-channel electrocardiogram. Echocardiography and the adenosine test can be included in the differential diagnosis in cases of doubt. Important current guidelines for the treatment of atrial fibrillation are the ESC (atrial fibrillation) and the ERC (Advanced Cardiac Life Support) guidelines. The conversion into the sinus rhythm can be done electrically or medicinally. It is indicated in cases of acute instability or symptomatic atrial fibrillation despite frequency control after cardiac thrombi have been excluded by echocardiography. A step-by-step concept for thromboembolism prophylaxis from initial parenteral and secondary oral therapy must take place up to four weeks after conversion to sinus rhythm or permanently in the case of permanent atrial fibrillation. The individual indication for thromboembolism prophylaxis results from the CHA2-DS2-VASc score.","51":null,"52":null,"53":"The anaesthesiological care of patients in the operating room involves many activities that can lead to an infection. Hand hygiene is the most effective single measure for the prevention of nosocomial infections. Hand disinfectant dispensers should be placed within easy reach. When preparing infusions and drugs to be administered intravenously, the introduction of microorganisms cannot be completely ruled out, even if all hygienic requirements are observed. Therefore, parenterals without preservatives may only be removed immediately before administration, not several times from the same container and not for several patients. For punctures for regional anaesthesia and for the placement of vascular catheters, the highest hygiene requirements apply when long seldinger wires are used or when catheters are placed in deep tissue spaces or body cavities. The timely application of antibiotic prophylaxis is one of the most important measures in perioperative infection prevention. Indications and choice of substance should be defined in an in-house guideline. Maintaining a balanced volume, body temperature and blood sugar level contributes to the prophylaxis of surgical site infections. The preparation of an operating room after an operation must always ensure that it does not pose a risk of infection for the following patient - regardless of the pathogens with which the previous patient is infected or colonized. There is no evidence for further measures to separate so-called aseptic and septic operations or of patients with multi-resistant pathogens. In order to be able to take the necessary measures for employee protection in corona-infected patients in the operating room, it is essential to know the current infection status. For example, when a patient is handed over to the OR, a current test result should be checked and documented on the OR checklist.","54":"","55":null,"56":null,"57":null,"58":null,"59":null,"60":"","61":null,"62":"Malignant hyperthermia is a rare, subclinical pharmacogenetic syndrome leading to potentially life-threatening skeletal muscle hypermetabolism.

Especially in the late phase of vaginal delivery, surprising moments, instrumental methods or special maneuvers require quick and sufficient analgesia. This refers to situations with a sudden, often unexpected and particularly pronounced intensity of pain. Here the advantages of spinal analgesia over the gold standard of obstetric analgesia, catheter epidural analgesia, can be used. Spinal analgesia is characterized by a fast onset of pain relief, a profound blockage and simple technical feasibility and, like other neuroaxial procedures, is comparatively uncomplicated in pregnant women. However, it is only effective if the delivery situation is well assessed. There is no possibility of repetition without re-puncture, so that limited duration of action is a significant disadvantage. Applied drugs correspond to those described for combined spinal and epidural analgesia, such as a mixture of low-dose bupivacaine and sufentanil, and can be adapted to local conditions. In the future, longer acting substances could overcome the main limitation (temporary effect) of spinal analgesia and suitable adjuvants could further increase the attractiveness of the procedure.","77":"The guideline \"Sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy\" (AWMF-register-no. 021\/014) was published initially in 2008. Because of new and developing evidence, the guideline was updated in 2015. The aim of the guideline is to define the necessary structural, equipment and personnel requirements that contribute to minimizing the risk of sedation for endoscopy. In view of the high and increasing significance of gastrointestinal endoscopy, the guideline will remain highly relevant in the future. Essential aspects are the selection of sedatives\/hypnotics, structural requirements, personnel requirements with regard to number, availability and training, management of complications and quality assurance. In this article, the development and evaluation of the evidence and its influence on the practical implementation, in particular for anaesthesia, are highlighted.","78":"The early postoperative period is of increasing importance in modern operative medicine with a continuously increasing surgical spectrum and patients with increasingly complex comorbidities. Even with optimal preoperative evaluation and intraoperative care, postoperative complications are not uncommon. The fastest possible diagnosis, including possible differential diagnoses and any combined disorders, is essential in order to initiate the indicated therapeutic measures. The spatial correlate of the postoperative phase is the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU). The qualification of the medical staff and spatial structure must meet the recommended minimum and must be in line with the existing operational structures. Good interdisciplinary and interprofessional communication reduces the loss of information and a good error reporting culture helps to reduce critical incidents.","79":"Patients who undergo high-risk surgical procedures represent a large proportion of admissions to intensive care units. Postoperative outcomes are a result of the complex interplay between the exact surgical procedure performed, the previous health of the patient, and specific intra- and postoperative events. Appropriate triage of patients to intensive care postoperatively may have a relevant impact on patient outcomes after high-risk surgery. It remains challenging to accurately identify patients who are at high risk of complications or death and target the patients who will benefit most from this highest level of postoperative care. \"Failure to rescue\" as an expression for the proportion of deaths in patients who developed a postoperative complication out of the total number of patients who developed a postoperative complication adds to the mortality of surgical patients. General wards may not properly recognize and manage postoperative complications when they occur which emphasises the necessity for adequate triage of intensive care capacity. When admission to the intensive care unit is granted patient transport from the operating room to the intensive care unit and patient handover to ICU-staff are further issues relevant to postoperative patient safety. Intrahospital transports are prone to adverse events and need careful preparation to be executed safely. In addition, exchange of clinical information during the transfer of responsibility between anesthesiologist and the intensive care physician has been recognized as a high-risk area for medical errors to occur. Structured handover protocols can reduce communication breakdowns during postoperative transfer of patients from the OR to the ICU.","80":"With patient safety being anesthesiologists' top priority, the focus of preoperative assessment must be to reduce perioperative morbidity and mortality of each patient entrusted to us. Perioperative risk is multifactorial and depends on the extent of surgery and the preoperative condition of the patient.The three main causes of unexpected perioperative death are cardiac arrest, hypoxemia and acute bleeding. Therefore, cardiac and pulmonary risk assessment should cover pre-existing conditions, patient's functional capacity and risk factors associated with the surgical procedure. Specific assessment tools have been developed, are easily accessible and have proven effective in every day clinical practice. Regarding the risk of bleeding, taking a detailed patients' history (including medication) seems to be more suitable to detect mild bleeding disorders than laboratory screening.Functional capacity, defined as the patient's ability to cope with everyday life, gains importance in preoperative risk assessment, as do further factors like deficiencies in nutrition, anaemia, physical capacity, the metabolic status or frailty in the elderly. Prehabilitation strategies reduce perioperative mortality and morbidity by improving functional capacity. These include preoperative nutrition supplementation, physical exercise, correction of iron deficiency and optimized treatment of hyperglycemia.A combination of thorough risk stratification and prehabilitation strategies can improve preoperative conditions and reduce complications in the postoperative period.","81":"","82":null,"83":null,"84":null,"85":null,"86":null,"87":"","88":null,"89":null,"90":null,"91":null,"92":"Communication and teamwork skills are, besides clinical knowledge, key components of high quality care in modern intensive care units.

Blended learning is a novel approach, combining autonomous web-based education and on-site workshops in order to improve the training process. Enhanced Recovery after Intensive Care (ERIC) is a newly developed telemedical intervention targeted at improving evidence-based practice in critical care, guided by quality indicators defined by the German Interdisciplinary Society of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine (DIVI).

Anticoagulant therapy with heparin was initiated. About two hours after admission to the intensive care unit, hemorrhage requiring massive transfusion developed, which according to viscoelastometric diagnostics was most likely due to fulminant hyperfibrinolysis. This case report describes the pathophysiology of so-called post-cardiac arrest coagulopathy and discusses the use of antifibrinolytic therapy in patients with thrombotic complications such as pulmonary artery embolism.","109":"Surgical treatment of patients with alcohol use disorder can lead to disturbances (withdrawal syndrome, delirium) which require intensive care treatment. In a surgical ward, the diagnosis of an alcohol related disorder is not always simple. Oftentimes patients conceal or trivialize the issue and as a result are admitted to the hospital in a non-abstinent or unstable state. It is risky to assume that patients with alcohol use disorder will successfully be supplied with alcohol in general hospitals. The risk can be reduced through presurgical identification and alcohol withdrawal of such patients. A literature review concludes that there is no secured evidence for the application of alcohol as prophylaxis or therapy of alcohol withdrawal syndrome in a surgical intensive care unit. The use of intravenous and oral alcohol in intensive care is an unnecessary risk to patients. There are more secure alternatives.","110":"Future or reality? Treating acute and chronic pain is a part of the daily routine of clinical anesthesiologists. Commonly used analgesics have unwanted side effects or may even be insufficient as in chronic pain treatment. Virtual Reality (VR) could be a promising new approach which offers noninvasive therapy options for the treatment of pain. In case of the opioid misuse the adjunctive treatment is mandatory. Various phenomena occur in VR, such as immersion, presence, embodiment and Proteus effect, which can cause a change in body awareness and behavior. Experimental and clinical studies already yielded some promising results for analgesic effects for acute and chronic pain conditions using VR simulation. Potential analgesic mechanisms include distraction, cognitive behavioral change, and distance from reality, leading to neurophysiological changes at the cortical level. The quality of the virtual environment, personalized avatars, as well as the possibility of interaction and multisensory input can increase immersion, which leads to a state of presence, and thus effective VR. VR can be used as an immersive extension or alternative to mirror therapy, especially for pain disorders such as complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) or phantom limb pain. VR can be supplemented by gamification, which increases intrinsic motivation, well-being and adherence to therapy. In summary, VR could be an effective and realistic therapy option for acute and chronic pain in clinical and home settings in the future.","111":"Interdisciplinary multimodal pain therapy (IMPT) is based on the biopsychosocial model of pain and describes an integrated treatment for patients with chronic pain. IMPT incorporates a close cooperation of different disciplines, including physicians, psychotherapists, physiotherapists, and others. IMPT mainly aims to restore and increase patients' physical, social and psychological functional capacity. The efficacy of IMPT has been evidenced by systematic reviews and meta-analyses. A number of studies further indicate IMPT's cost-efficiency. Psychotherapy is an essential component of IMPT. Its main goal within the framework of IMPT is to identify and modify dysfunctional patterns of pain coping, and to diagnose and potentially treat psychological comorbidities. Pain psychotherapy comprises mostly cognitive-behavioral interventions which address dysfunctional coping at the three levels of the pain experience (i.e., cognitive, emotional, and behavioral). Research into the efficacy of pain psychotherapy is rather sparse and studies have mostly focused on chronic back pain, yet existing results show promising evidence both for psychotherapy within IMPT and for psychotherapy as a monotherapy. This paper aims at providing an overview of (a) commonly employed cognitive-behavioral psychotherapeutic approaches and strategies in the treatment of chronic pain, and (b) the existing empirical evidence of pain psychotherapy both within the framework of IMPT and as a monotherapy. Future research should include a wider range of pain diagnoses and also investigate the potential benefit of individually-tailored treatments.","112":"Pain is agreed to be understood as a multi-causal, biopsychosocial phenomenon.

Close collaboration of multidisciplinary protagonists in health care as well as interdisciplinary comprehensive medical treatment offer are two of the prerequisites for good practice in health care treating patients with pain.The article introduces into existing knowlegde about pain and risk factors for chronicity. The background (evidence and theoretical) of corresponding health care approaches and a detailed concept of interdisciplinary pain diagnostic by a multiprofessional team consisting of pain physician, physiotherapist and clinical psychologist are described and discussed.","113":"","114":"It is necessary to discuss the sometimes competing goals of sufficient critical care capacity, maintenance of regular patient care, protection of medical staff, interruption of infectious chains within the general public and individual aspects of patient care in anesthesia and the operating room in times of the SARS CoV-2 pandemic, given the uncertainty of many data on which decisions need to be based.

They are supervised. TxBs exist in every hospital that carries out organ harvesting and are always available. They are responsible for the conception of the organ donation process and should manage each individual case from the evaluation to the implementation of the patient's wishes.The evaluation for potential organ donors should be routine and supported by IT technology. The intensive care team must inform the TxB about living patients who \"come into consideration\" as organ donors. Reasons for exclusion can be known rejection, absolute medical contraindications and loss of function of all transplant organs. ICBF (irreversible cessation of brain function) deceased without reasons for exclusion must be reported to the DSO immediately. Talks with relatives about the neurological outcome, the ICBF diagnostics and organ donation are of fundamental importance for the implementation of the (presumed) wish of the potential organ donor and the relatives. The aim of the talks should be a sound decision with which the relatives can conclude. The TxBs support the ICU team to achieve this.Organ donation should be handled like an emergency. Typical bottlenecks are the instrument-based examinations and the availability of the operating room. The TxBs should draw up a schedule, communicate this to the interfaces and be available at all times during the entire organ donation process. Documentation of all details is important, as the TxBs must prepare detailed individual case analyses for quality assurance purposes and forward them to the clinic management and the DSO. Quality circles and especially peer review procedures are used and recommended as further QM tools.","117":null,"118":"An ever-evolving and successful transplantation medicine is providing a large number of living patients after solid organ transplantation. Anaesthetists should therefore be prepared to come into contact with such a patient. In addition to the preoperative assessment of the pre-existing diseases, including the function of the transplanted organ, immunosuppression also plays an important role. Immunosuppression must always be continued perioperatively. Strict adherence to all hygienic regulations is essential in these patients due to immunosuppression and the associated increased risk of infection and sepsis. This includes the strict risk-benefit assessment of all invasive procedures.There are no significant differences between the anaesthetic approaches and agents in transplant and non-transplant patients. However, in the first group, homeostasis of all organ systems should be more focused on.","119":"The outcome after heart and lung transplantation has improved significantly. Consequently, many patients are admitted to the hospital for routine surgical interventions that are initially non-transplant-specific. Some disorders lead to hospital admissions that affect other organ systems due to late consequences of the underlying disease or can be seen as early and late complications of the transplantation itself. Many of these surgical interventions are certainly carried out in the responsible transplant centre. Some surgeries are also performed in hospitals that do not primarily transplant and do not regularly care for heart and lung transplant patients.

Research into placebo hypoalgesic responses to chronic pain is sparse, however. In healthy subjects, placebo hypoalgesia is induced by expectations of pain relief through verbal information and learning experiences.

There has to be a greater awareness of problems associated with antibiotic use and the data about it must be communicated transparently within the hospital. However, there is also a need for training in the medical profession. The pathophysiological understanding as well as the accurate diagnosis of infectious diseases must be improved. Doctors need courage to forego the use of antibiotics. The consensus within a department and a hospital for withholding antibiotics must be strengthened. However, the awareness of sepsis as an emergency needs to be raised as well, and it is important to focus on hygiene issues and not just on the rapid antibiotic therapy.

The general usability and effectiveness of telemedicine in pain care has been described. The most prominent applications of telemedicine in pain care are store-and-forward applications and direct consultations. Smartphone applications are easily accessible and inexpensive. The quality and effectiveness of smartphone applications has not been evaluated thoroughly due to a lack of regulatory objectives. Estimations of the cost-effectiveness of telemedicine in pain care are limited due to a lack of data regarding long-term outcome and healthcare utilization after treatment.

Specific cases, in particular very limited mouth opening or sub-glottic masses, require awake flexible endoscopic intubation. Sufficient topical anesthesia and a sophisticated sedation protocol are prerequisites for successful awake video laryngoscopy. Awake video laryngoscopy cannot fully replace flexible endoscopic intubation. It is a useful option, but it must be considered that this technique is not suitable for all types of airways, patients or even anesthesiologists.

In about 20% of ventilated patients, however, an extremely protracted and complex weaning process can be observed, even though the cause necessitating ventilation has long since been eliminated. In addition to the stages in the process of weaning from the ventilator, in particular the pathophysiological processes that lead to prolonged weaning are addressed in this article.

Several arguments support the perioperative use of high oxygen concentrations (&gt;80%) for the prevention of surgical site infections. However, effects of oxygen include an increase in systemic vascular resistance, a reduction in heart rate and stroke volume and thus an impairment of the microcirculation, e.g. in the coronary and cerebral vasculature. Adequately powered, prospective, randomized, blinded outcome studies on the effects of hyperoxia in anesthesia and intensive care medicine are scarce. Recent data suggest that hyperoxia may be more harmful than beneficial and may increase morbidity and mortality in surgical and intensive care patients. Also, the current guidelines from the European Resuscitation Council from 2015 address the potentially harmful effects of high oxygen concentrations in various emergency settings.

Only in about one fourth of the reviewed cases could either a causal relationship between substandard performance and patient injury or an inadequate obtaining of informed consent be established. In the great majority of cases patients' claims were unfounded, since the patients' injuries were adjudged to be unavoidable and adequate consent had been abtained prior to performance of the blocks.

","466":"Hypernatremia is a common electrolyte disorder that reflects an imbalance in the water balance of the body, often resulting from an increased loss of free water compared to sodium excretion. It is rarely based on excessive sodium intake. The clinical presentation is often characterized by a central nervous system dysfunction (confusion, coma) and pronounced thirst (in awake patients). In addition to medical history, the volume status of the patient and the osmolality of urine are leading in the differential diagnosis. Usually, the treatment of hypernatremia - in addition to addressing the underlying cause - is replacing the (absolute or relative) loss of free water by hypotonic infusions, or in case of diabetes insipidus, by application of Desmopressin (Minirin). As rapid changes in serum sodium concentration may have deleterious consequences (osmotic demyelinsiation syndrome), preexisting hypernatremia (&gt;48h) should not be reduced by more than 8-10 mmol\/l\/day. Close laboratory controls are important. For acute hypernatremia (&lt; 24 hours), hemodialysis is an effective option to rapidly normalize the serum sodium levels. To avoid a rapid drop in sodium concentration that must also be considered when starting a renal replacement therapy in patients with chronic hypernatremia.

While patient blood management has been widely implemented in adult medicine, concepts for such measures in the care of children are rare. The basic principles of preoperative evaluation, optimization of blood volume, perioperative minimizing of blood loss and a differentiated use of blood products are effective both in adults and children. There are differences in the physiology of hemoglobin and cardiovascular systems, particularly in the first year of life. It can be difficult to determine impending anemic hypoxia in children, so that indication for transfusion based on standardized hemoglobin threshold values should always be supported by an individual risk-benefit analysis based on clinical assessment.

Generally, Tracheotomy will be divided in a surgical tracheotomy the percutaneous Tracheotomy. The surgical Tracheotomy takes place in the operation theater. The percutaneous Tracheotomy is one of the standard procedures in the Intensive care unit. There are many methods to perform the percutaneous Tracheotomy. The gist of every method is the seldinger procedure. Bronchoscopic supervision during the whole procedure is one of the most important things to prevent complications. However percutaneous and surgical tracheotomy are safe and have a low rate of complications. ","472":"Airway management in the prehospital setting is a particular challenge. Even with numerous alternative devices, endotracheal intubation still represents the gold standard. Limited knowledge and experience of the user in addition to a critical patient's condition, special environmental conditions and limited material resources at the out of hospital emergency, are major causes of an increased incidence of difficult airways in the preclinical setting. For the management of the difficult airway emergency physicians can use alternatives to tracheal intubation such as extraglottic airway devices, videolaryngoscopy and cricothyroidotomy. Both direct laryngoscopy as well as the use of alternative devices require experience and continuous training. ","473":"Due to its relevance to patient outcome, management of the difficult airway is a major topic in the training of anesthesiologists. Algorithms may serve as a plan for a difficult situation. Since 1993, many professional organizations have published guidelines for airway management. ASA and DGAI share common strategies in their guidelines, but also have significant differences. The DGAI provides different algorithms for both the anticipated and unanticipated difficult airway, while the ASA uses one universal algorithm. Extraglottic airway devices and video laryngoscopes are integral part of all these algorithms. In the DGAI guideline, spontaneous breathing is essential, in contrast to the ASA algorithm. Furthermore, the DGAI guideline is much more specific than the ASA guideline in regard to the anticipated difficult airway, extubation strategy and continuing training of anesthesiologists.

As compared to adults, hypoxic arrests caused by respiratory disorders that may subsequently result in pulseless electrical activity or asystole are more prevalent. The current Paediatric Life Support (PLS) Guidelines 2015 of the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) acknowledge both limited scientific evidence and aspects of practicability. They also take into account the rather limitedpaediatric routine that most providers have as well as national and local infrastructural differences. Particular emphasis was put on early recognition and treatment of a critically ill or injured child, hence the prevention of cardiorespiratory arrest and the early start of lay rescuer interventions. There have been no major changes in the 2010 algorithms, including retention of the ABC sequence (airway, breathing, circulation). ","482":"Enhanced measures for resuscitation of adults are based on basic measures of resuscitation. The central elements are highly effective chest compressions and avoidance of disruptions that are associated with poor patient outcomes that occur within seconds. The universal algorithm distinguishes the therapy for ventricular fibrillation from the therapy in asystole or pulseless electrical activity (PEA) by the need of defibrillation, and amiodarone administration in the former. Defibrillation is biphasic. In all other aspects, there are no differences in therapy. In each episode of cardiac arrest, reversible causes should be excluded or treated. For the diagnosis during resuscitation, sonography can be helpful. What is new in the 2015 ERC recommendations is the use of capnography, which can be used for the assessment of ROSC (return of spontaneous circulation), ventilation, resuscitation and intubation quality. Mechanical resuscitation devices can be used in selected situations. Successful primary resuscitation should be directly followed by measures of the post-resuscitation care. ","483":"Witnesses of a sudden cardiac arrest play a key-role in resuscitation. Lay-persons should therefore be trained to recognize that a collapsed person who is not breathing at all or breathing normally might suffer from cardiac arrest. Information of professional emergency medical staff by lay-persons and their initiation of cardio-pulmonary-resuscitation-measures are of great importance for cardiac-arrest victims. Ambulance-dispatchers have to support lay-rescuers via telephone. This support includes the localisation of the nearest Automatic External Defibrillator (AED). Presentation of agonal breathing or convulsions due to brain-hypoxia need to be recognized as potential early signs of cardiac arrest. In any case of cardiac arrest chest-compressions need to be started. There is insufficiant data to recommend \"chest-compression-only\"-CPR as being equally sufficient as cardio-pulmonary-resuscitation including ventilation. Rescuers trained in ventilation should therefore combine compressions and ventilations at a 30:2-ratio. Movement of the chest is being used as a sign of sufficient ventilation. High-quality chest-compressions of at least 5 cm of depth, not exceeding 6 cm, are recommended at a ratio of 100-120 chest conpressions\/min. Interruption of chest-compression should be avoided.

Antibiotic stewardship tries to improve antiinfective therapy with an interdisciplinary approach. One overall objective of antibiotic stewardship is the reduction of resistance induction in order to preserve the therapeutic efficiency of antibiotics. Intensive care units are important fields of action for antibiotic stewardship interventions. This article reviews available evidence and some practical aspects for antibiotic stewardship.

In general MDROs rates are higher in hospitals compared to the outpatient setting. Within the hospital the prevalence of MDRO-patients in ICUs is higher than in non-ICU wards. While the number of MRSA-patients decreased over the last years, there was a continuous increase of Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) in Germany. At present, every 60. patient in the ICU is known as colonized or infected with GNB. Hospitals in Germany are obliged by the \"protection against infection act\" (REF?)11 to establish a surveillance for MDROs.

Irrespective of the underlying disease or injury, pain is an important warning symptom of the body and the most common reason for an emergency alert notification. A patient assesses quality of care and success of prehospital care using the criteria of the extent of pain relief he experiences. Since mild pain does not usually lead to an emergency alert, the criteria apply mainly to treatment of severe and very severe pain. Pain perception varies from individual to individual. Accordingly, assessment of pain intensity is the very first step in pain therapy. The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable) is suitable for pain assessment in adult emergency patients. Above a grade of 4, therapeutic intervention should be initiated with the goal of reducing pain to reach a value of &lt;4, or at least to achieve a reduction by 3 points.

Due to the heterogeneous realization of acute pain management in different hospitals, it comes apparent, that general guideline recommendations and binding definitions are required to achieve adequate supply conditions. ","499":"An intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) defined as a pathological increase in intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is commonly found on ICU admission or during the ICU stay. Several studies confirmed that an IAH is an independent predictor for mortality of critically ill patients. The abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) which is defined as a sustained IAP&gt;20 mmHg (with or without an abdominal perfusion pressure [APP]&lt;60mmHg) that is associated with new organ dysfunction or failure has a mortality of up to 60%. In general, an IAH may be induced by several intra-abdominal as well as extra-abdominal conditions. Reduced abdominal wall compliance, intra-abdominal pathologies (either of the peritoneal space or parenchymateous organs) may lead to an IAH. Most commonly, intra-abdominal infections and\/or sepsis and severe trauma or burns are predisposing for an IAH. An early sign may be a decrease in urinary output. The effects of an increased IAP on cardiovascular function are well recognized and include negative effects on preload, afterload and contractility. However, all other compartments of the body may be affected by an IAH. Thus, by an increase of the respective compartment pressure, e.g. intracranial pressure, a poly-compartment syndrome may result. Adequate prevention, a forward-looking strategy, and objective techniques for measurement of IAP are required to avoid or early detect an IAH or ACS.

In contrast to the traditional assumption that decompression incidents only occur if decompression rules are neglected, recent data indicate that a vast amount of diving accidents occur even though divers adhered to the rules. Hence, there is a large inter- and intraindividual variability in the predisposition for diving accidents. Within the past few years, the molecular understanding of the pathophysiology of diving accidents has improved considerably. It is now well accepted that pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulatory mechanisms play a central role. Moreover, microparticles are increasingly discussed in the pathogenesis of diving accidents. These new molecular findings have not yet resulted in new therapeutic approaches.

However, if complications do occur they often result in catastrophic sequelae for the patient. Apart from the well-known side-effects and complications there are innumerous reports about procedural complications during placement and use of the catheter. Procedural complications often result in additionally required procedures and treatments, hence increasing morbidity of the affected patient. The aim of this review is to provide the reader with a current overview of the available literature with regards to classical and procedural complications.

Animal studies suggest that the use of epidural anaesthesia may be beneficial for cancer surgery because of less tumour recurrence. Further, a benefit is expected in patient's mortality.

Sonography allows the identification of the puncture target, observes the needle feed and assesses the spread pattern of the local anesthetic in real time. Peripheral electrical nerve stimulation (PNS) cannot offer these advantages to the same degree, but may allow nerve localization under difficult sonographic conditions. The combination of the two locating techniques is complex in its practical implementation. Partially, the use of one location technique is made even more difficult by the combination with the second. PNS in parallel to sonography serves primarily as a warning technology in the case of an invisible cannula tip. It should not be construed as a compensation technique for the lack of sonographic skills or knowledge. However, PNS may be helpful in the sense of a bridging technology as long as the user is aware of its limitations.

Despite this fact there are no systematic part-time work concepts published in the German literature, especially for physicians working in hospitals. This article describes background and circumstances of a part-time work concept which was established two years ago in a department of anaesthesiology at a university hospital in Germany. This concept considers needs of young families as well as older employees. We are convinced that a transparent part-time work concept is a good argument for job-seeking physicians when deciding for an employer. The benefit for the already employed colleagues has at least the same value. ","570":"Due to the demographic and medical development, the number of patients with heart failure needing anaesthesiological care will continue to grow in the upcoming years. For the optimal care of these patients close coordination between the surgically treating, the cardiology and the anesthesiological department is important. Cardiac function and structural characters, such as cardiac valve defects should be known preoperatively. Thus, the anaesthetic management, intraoperative monitoring, as well as necessary pharmacological interventions can be tailored. Especially in high-risk patients goal directed hemodynamic therapy is useful. For this, in addition to the established monitoring procedures, less invasive monitoring devices areincreasingly used. During an acutehaemodynamic instability, thetransoesophageal echocardiography is gaining importance due to its wide diagnostic evaluation. ","571":"With respect to the fact that - with the notable exception of patients undergoing cardiac surgery - only sparse data and limited guideline recommendations on optimal treatment strategies in patients with intraoperative acute heart failure are available. Consecutively it is rather difficult to make clear suggestions for the optimal treatment of this complication. However, data based on treatment of medical patients with acute heart failure suggest that it may be reasonable first to echocardiographically determine the specific cardiac pathology, especially with respect to systolic and diastolic function and\/or presence of acute myocardial ischemia and subsequently treat the specific problem in a goal-directed approach. Importantly, one has to to take into account that the use of beta-mimetic drugs for the treatment of acute heart failure is increasingly recognized as an isolated mortality factor. This suggests to use inotropes as restrictive as possible, and if inotropic treatment becomes inevitable, to use levosimendan as the only inotrope that has been shown to improve mortality in several meta-analyses.

In this review article the possible complications according to the beach chair position are explained and practical advice is given for the daily anesthetic routine. ","580":"Regional anaesthesia has significant advantages compared to general anaesthesia with an opiate-based postoperative analgesia in injuries of the upper extremity. Severe pain may be considered a risk factor for the development of chronic postoperative pain syndromes in adults and children. Depending on the anticipated postoperative pain level, a catheter procedure should be used. Fractures of the upper extremity are common and may also be associated with seemingly minor injuries with a high postoperative pain level. Nerve damage can be caused mainly by traumatic fractures, or iatrogenically during surgical procedures. Reduced possible neurological evaluability should not prevent the excellent pain control which regional anesthesia can provide. Since the brachial plexus is predominantly responsible for the sensory innervation of the entire upper extremity, therefore all known block techniques in regional anaesthesia apply. Since the introduction of ultrasound in regional anaesthesia (USGRA), older methods like the supraclavicular approach, which were previously banned due to high complication rates, are now being rediscovered. Both new and old blockade methods are much more effective and safe with ultrasound support because of the rapid visualization of the anatomy and needle. ","581":"Almost all surgical procedures following injury can be provided in peripheral regional anaesthesia or spinal anaesthesia - under consideration of specific contraindications. The majority of injuries at the lower limb are associated with severe pain and immobilization during the postoperative phase. Moreover, opioids are often required which are related to nausea, vomiting and impairment of vigilance. For avoidance of those side effects, regional anaesthesia techniques should be considered as a more effective approach with a better profile of side effects. Hip and proximal femur fractures are more frequent in elder patients with a corresponding high morbidity. Therefore anaesthesia is challenging in those patients. Even injuries of the long bones - like the femur and the tibia - are causing severe pain, therefore an appropriate concept for acute pain therapy is required. Moreover, for injuries with affection of bony joint-structures (i. e. knee, ankle, calcaneus) and marked soft-tissue injuries continuous regional anaesthesia techniques could provide advantages during acute pain therapy. ","582":"Hip fractures are among the most common fractures in elderly people. The annual number of femoral fractures is even expected to increase because of an aging society. Due to the high number of comorbidities, there are special challenges in treating geriatric hip fracture patients, which require a multidisciplinary management.

Despite known disadvantages in terms of efficacy and side effects, metoclopramide is still often used in the emergency medical service to treat nausea and vomiting. Recent studies show that, especially in the therapy of opioid-triggered vomiting, metoclopramide is not significantly effective when compared to placebo. Dimenhydrinate seems to be an effective drug for various forms of nausea, but can often be relatively or absolutely contraindicated in emergency medicine due to its sedative effect. Based on a literature review, 5-HT3-antagonists appear to be a good alternative for the treatment of emesis in the emergency service. However, as for all antiemetics, the maximum dosage and potential side effects need to be paid attention to. In addition, neither of the 5-HT3-antagonists are approved for therapy of non-chemotherapy-induced vomiting or PONV. In conclusion, it may be considered to include 5-HT3-antagonists in addition to dimenhydrinate in the ambulance medical equipment. The routine use of a specific antiemetic is not recommended.

Treating a patient without his or her consent always constitutes a serious infringement of the patient's constitutional right of self-determination as well as the right to physical integrity. By issuing a power of attorney in health care matters to a person he or she trusts, a patient can safeguard his or her rights in the event of incapacitation. At the University Hospital Frankfurt patients who are scheduled for major elective surgery are informed about the advantages of a health care power of attorney during premedication. The University Hospital has developed its own health care power of attorney form for patient use. In addition, patients have the option of receiving additional information about other types of health care advance directives, such as a living will.","589":"Informing patients about the benefits and risks of and alternatives to proposed medical or surgical procedures is crucial to the patient-physician relationship. It is a legal and ethical precondition to a patient's informed consent to a course of action. Particularly in cases of serious illness and when there are far reaching implications for a patient's lifestyle, this process entails much more than just imparting information. Indeed, it is a dialogue through which the physician empowers the patient to reach a decision which reflects the patient's life situation and system of values. This process promotes patient autonomy. Studies have shown that this approach builds trust, increases patient satisfaction with health care and results in a higher degree of professional fulfilment for the physician. ","590":"","591":"","592":"On-scene invasive emergency procedures, such as Cricothyroidotomy, chest drain, intraosseous puncture or even in-field-amputation, are often unavoidable, when indicated, and present a major challenge for the emergency physician. Personal, temporal or local conditions are often unsuitable. Even with regular intervention by the Emergency Medical Service, \"last resort\" measures occur very infrequently, particularly in relation to paediatric emergencies. As well as theoretical training, practice-oriented course concepts are essential in order to achieve high quality in these procedures. This article presents the use of in-field-amputation, with reference to indication, implementation, problems and risks. It is part of a series of four articles on the subject of invasive emergency techniques. ","593":"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep related breathing disorder with an increasing prevalence. Most surgical patients with OSA have not been diagnosed prior to surgery and are at an increased risk of developing perioperative complications. Preoperative identification of these patients is important in order to take appropriate measures concerning a safe perioperative management. While the level of scientific evidence for single measures is still low, several steps seem prudent: Preoperatively, sedating medications should only be applied with extreme caution. Anesthetic management should focus on regional anesthetic techniques and reduction of systemic opioids. In the case of general anesthesia, an increased risk of a patient presenting with a difficult airway should be appreciated. The extent and duration of postoperative continuous monitoring has to be determined on an individual basis. A preoperatively existing therapy with continuous positive airway pressure should be continued postoperatively as soon as possible. Patients with OSA may be managed on an outpatient basis if certain requirements are met. ","594":"More and more operative procedures are performed in an ambulatory setting. Many patients are denied spinal anaesthesia, although it provides several advantages. Innovative pharmaceutical formulations of well-tried local anaesthetics have created \"new\" substances that are ideal for ambulatory surgery due to their fast onset, short duration of action, and very low incidence of complications such as transient neurological symptoms (TNS). Both hyperbaric prilocaine 2% and preservative-free chloroprocaine 1% were recently approved for spinal application in Germany. Additional perioperative measures, such as the use of atraumatic, thin spinal needles (25 or 27G), restrictive volume management, and early patient mobilisation, lead to a further reduction of complications. The new S1 guideline of the German Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine encourages us anaesthetists to use spinal anaesthesia more frequently in an ambulatory setting. ","595":"","596":"","597":"","598":"The premedication visit is often a difficult situation for the anaesthetist. On the one hand the patient needs to be informed in detail, but on the other he must not be alienated unnecessarily. Furthermore, a hospital stay represents an exceptional situation for the patient in which he behaves differently than in everyday life and shows a limited ability to process information. Following certain communication strategies allows to convey information to the patient in a comprehensible manner and to describe his individual anaesthesiological risk without needlessly creating fear. ","599":"Sepsis therapy is aiming to eliminate the focus of infection and to obtain or to restore microcirculation. Severe sepsis and septic shock have to be treated as fast and aggressively as hemorrhagic shock, because the time between onset of disease and initiating the therapy is crucial for the probability of survival. The bundle measures introduced by the Surviving-Sepsis-Campaign are able to reduce mortality significantly. The compliance with the bundle measures and consequent training of medical staff to predefined goal measures and therapy protocols is determining the success of sepsis therapy. The bundle measures of the first six hours (resuscitation bundle) deserve special attention. ","600":"Blood cultures are an essential diagnostic tool to investigate suspected cases of sepsis. However, several studies indicate that (compared with other countries) blood culture diagnostics is only rarely performed in German healthcare facilities. Reasons for this are unknown, but could include clinicians' perception that the turn-around time of results is delayed or that contamination rates are high. Therefore, this article aims to summarize important aspects involved in assuring quality of blood culture diagnostics as well as innovative approaches. ","601":"Our understanding of the causes and pathophysiological basis of sepsis has been subject to constant change over the last decades. In today's understanding, sepsis is primarily a pathology of the immune system, triggered by an underlying infection but perpetuated by the host's response itself. Thereby, sepsis should not be categorized to be either a sole pro- or anti-inflammatory syndrome, but rather as a variable continuum of overlaying immune mechanisms. While a overshooting immune reaction predominates in early sepsis, this reaction is rapidly compensated, often leading to a immune dysfunction, rendering the host susceptible for secondary infections. This review aims to provide the reader with an overview of the broad molecular mechanisms contributing to the clinical picture of sepsis. ","602":"","603":"Patients with opioid pretreatment can be divided into different groups.While patients after successful drug addiction treatment with or without drug replacement therapy usually not require an extensive perioperative pain therapy, patients with persistent chronic pain and patients with an existing opioid addiction regularly are challenging for the anesthetist. Important pathophysiological issues among the patients include opioid tolerance, opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) as well as acute withdrawal symptomes. Pharmakokinetic properties of the opioid seems to be crucial the manifestation of an acute withdrawal syndrome following opioid administration, and thus the use of remifentanil has frequently been reported to induce withdrawal symptoms. While all established anesthetic procedures can be applied, regional anesthetic techniques should be included whenever possible. A common misstake when treating patients with a history of opioid abuse is an unwarranted restraint in using opioids. In patients with a ongoing opioid abuse, it may be efficient to apply methadone or buprenorphine even prior to surgery. While pregabalin and gabapentin are first line therapeutics for treatment of neuropathic pain, they also seem to be effective co-analgesics in patients suffering from chronic pain and undergo surgery. A similar statement applies to clonidine and dexmedetomidine, which probably induce analgesia by activation of the descending antinociceptive noradrenergic system. The intraoperative administration of S-ketamine is recommended for patients who either already have developed opioid tolerance or suffer from neuropathic pain, and by which postoperative pain is high and was already shown to be poorly adjusted. Other therapeutic options such as intraoperative administration of magnesium or lidocaine may be promising approaches. ","604":"Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is associated with high in-hospital mortality. The initial correct diagnosis, risk assessment and initiation of treatment are responsibilities of the emergency department (ED). In Germany, emergency medicine is not well established nationwide and organized in a very heterogeneous manner. Therefore, systematic approaches to improve quality of care are scarce and standardisations of processes are required. Standardized care bundles for CAP identify patients at increased risk for an adverse outcome. Early detection of CAP in the emergency department is essential for initiating timely and appropriate treatment. As part of the nationwide CAP quality improvement program we use CRB-65 for initial risk stratification in the ED. In own investigations we demonstrated that implementation of systematic guideline based care bundles for pneumonia significantly improves quality of care in the ED subsequently leading to decreased mortality during hospitalization. Early standardized care bundles in the ED reduce length-of-stay in the hospital and the intensive care unit. Furthermore, those strategies are accompanied with an improvement of economic characteristics. ","605":"Robot-assisted surgery, as a development of laparoscopic surgery, has an increasing field of application. Beside urology, this technique has also been implemented in visceral and thoracic surgery and gynaecology. For the surgeon an enhanced view of the surgical field and a better mobility of the instruments are the most important advantages. Thus, it is possible to work more accurate and prevent inadvertent tissue damage. For the anaesthesiologist several characteristics are of importance. Limited access to the patient as a result of a special positioning requires adequate anaesthetic preparation. For many visceral and thoracic surgical interventions the head and airway of the patient is bedded remote from the anaesthesiologist. Therefore, a standardised order and protection of all i. v.-lines, cables and the ventilation-hose of the (double-lumen) tube is essential. After the roboter is connected to the patient, it is nearly impossible to change or extend patient monitoring. Especially in case of emergency, e. g. respiratory complications or heart failure, a close communication with the surgeon and a team approach are indispensable. ","606":"","607":"Intensive care medicine and palliative care medicine were considered for a long time to be contrasting concepts in therapy. While intensive care medicine is directed towards prolonging life and tries to stabilize disordered body functions, palliative care medicine is focused upon the relief of disturbances to help patients in the face of death. Today both views have become congruent. Palliative aspects are equally important in curative therapy. In the course of illness or in respect of the patient's will, the aim of therapy may change from curative to palliative. Two examples are presented to illustrate the ethical challenges in this process. They follow from the medical indication, attention to the patient's will, different opinions in the team, truth at the bedside and from what must be done in the process of withdrawing therapy. ","608":"Side effects are more frequent and severe, or simply appear by just talking about them. But not the informed consent is to be challenged, rather the form of giving risk information. Nocebo effects mainly originate from induced negative expectations, not from the information itself. Concerns about legal consequences of an incomplete list of risks do not release from the responsibility to guide and help the patient to an understanding and a balanced decision. ","609":"End-of-life decisions are frequently necessary in intensive care units. These decisions are made more difficult through rapidly changing disease dynamics, lack of continuity of care, differing expectations, as well as a lack of support. In these situations, structured communication concepts can help families and staff, e. g. through structured family conferences, the concept of family as the expert for the patient's preferences, and empathetic reactions to emotions. The article discusses concrete strategies how to communicate about end-of-life care. ","610":"Palliative medicine (or palliative care, referring to its multi-professional character) denotes a comprehensive care concept for patients suffering from incurable and progressive disease, and their relatives. Specialized support structures are necessary, including (inpatient) palliative care units, (inpatient) consultation services, and (outpatient) specialized palliative home care services. Further, research and education is mandatory in order to gain and to spread this particular expertise and attitude. This contribution focuses on the current situation and on the development of palliative care structures in Germany.

However, this is mandatory for GDT. In this context, discontinuous transthoracic (TTE) and transesophageal (TEE) echocardiography is gaining clinical relevance. In addition, recently there exists the opportunity to perform a continuous hemodynamic focused transesophageal echocardiography (\"hemodynamic TEE\", hTEE) via a miniaturized monoplane probe. With its flexible probe tip the three most important two-dimensional views of the heart can be obtained to differentiate between aforementioned pathophysiological causes of a low cardiac output syndrome. It is introduced orally in the patient's esophagus and can remain up to 72 hours in situ.

The simulation flow of patients and accompanying persons and of the routes of the personnel is helpful for this purpose. Separating structures for outpatients from those for inpatients and avoiding de-centralized rooms helps designing an efficient and safe OR suite.The design of the single ORs should be flexible to permit changes or technical innovations during their use period. Mobile equipment is preferable to permanently installed devices. We consider an expanse of at least 45 m(2) for any location adequate for general ORs. The space requirements are elevated for hybrid ORs and rooms dedicated for robotic surgery.The design of the suite should separate the flow of personnel, patients and logistics. Surgical instruments and their logistics should be standardized. Dedicated locations for a simultaneous preparation of the instrumentation tables permit parallel processing.

This may result in uncertainty how to manage these patients appropriately. Preparation for such situations is essential. Therefore this article focuses on the specific problems associated with these kinds of patients. ","643":"Whole-body CT is considered gold standard for diagnosis of the multiple injured patient in the trauma suite. So far, no guidelines exist concerning its indication. The trauma team (Trauma Surgery\/Visceral Surgery, Anaesthesiology, Radiology) should use standardized triage-criteria for the indication of whole-body CT. The radiologist is responsible for its individual planning, taking clinical and morphological imaging results into consideration, embedding its implementation between assessment and treatment stage. Fast image analysis by an experienced radiologist (specialist or at least 3 years professional experience) as well as interdisciplinary discussion of all findings is essential. The increased importance of endovascular minimally invasive therapy strategies in the treatment of active bleeding or laceration of solid organs may require the consultation of an interventional radiologist as part of the extended trauma team. In addition to CT, a modern trauma suite should be equipped with conventional x-rays and ultrasound in order to comply with a conventional algorithm consisting of sonography, plain film radiography and region specific CT for diagnosis of less severely injured patients. In children, specific attention must be paid to radiation protection. In these cases, modalities without radiation exposure (ultrasound, MRI) play a major role. Detecting all relevant injuries and evolving a therapy strategy in compliance with aspects of radiation protection (ALARA-principle) and legal guidelines (justifiying indication) during the 'golden hour of shock' should be the aim. ","644":"Damage Control is a strategy for the initial treatment phase in severely injured patients. The aim is to avoid time consuming surgical procedures thereby reducing secondary damage and to improve patients' outcome. Once the patient is haemodynamically stabilized on the intensive care unit, definitive therapy - i. e. osteosynthesis, bowel\/urinary tract reconstruction etc. - can be performed after a time interval of 5-10 days. Thus Damage Control is a quick and focused but preliminary treatment strategy in the initial emergency phase in critically injured patients. ","645":"","646":"Resistance against antibiotics is continuously increasing throughout the world and has become a very serious problem. For just this reason \"Antibiotic Stewardship Programs\" have been developed. These programs are intended to lead to a sustained improvement in the situation and to assure a rational practice for the prescription of anti-infective agents in medical facilities. The aim is to prescribe the correct antibiotic therapy to the right patient at the most appropriate point in time. An AWMF S3 guideline on this topic published by the German Society for Infectiology (S3-Leitlinie StrategienzurSicherungrationalerAntibiotika-AnwendungimKrankenhaus.AWMF-Registernummer 092\/001 - S3 Guideline on Strategies for the Rational Use of Antibiotics in Hospitals.

","647":null,"648":"With 2000 new cases\/year in Germany spinal cord injury (SCI) is quantitatively less important for intensive care medicine than, e.g., sepsis. But, due to the consequences for the patient, the intricacy of treatment and the enormous costs, it is a significant clinical picture. Outside of specialized centers, routine experience with SCI is largely lacking, particularly in cases of tetraplegia. Dependent on the level of the paralysis, complications in the acute situation, the hospitalization and the rehabilitation are common and need intensive medical care. Lifelong mechanical ventilation is needed in some cases of cervical SCI, for which experience has since grown. New therapeutic options have become implemented (e.g., electrophrenic\/diaphragm pacing), have a need to be examined, and extend lifespan in cases of SCI. As a result more patients have a chance for rehabilitation today than in previous decades.\" ","649":"","650":"","651":"","652":"Healthcare-associated infections (HAI) are considered as one of the major challenges for modern health care. In the context of demographic change and the expected increase of invasive and complex patient treatment and concommittantrise in numbers of patients with underlying diseases with susceptibility to infections, quality of care and patient safety will in the near future depend strongly on the prevention of HAI. To avoid preventable HAI in terms of improved quality of care is beyond question, therefore mainly the prevalence of highly resistant microorganisms (HRMO) will becrucial for the success of treatment of unpreventable HAI. In addition to MRSA, the greatest danger in relation to antibiotic resistance worldwide are now considered tob e carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) or multidrug-resistant Gram-negative (4MRGN) bacteria. In case oft he uncontrolled spread of HRMO unpreventable infections become also untreatable. The prevalence of HRMO varies between different countries. Especially in the Netherlands and Denmark HRMO such as MRSA, VRE and CRE\/4MRGN are still significantly less common than in Germany or France. The reason lies in the fact that in nearly all Dutch hospitals anintegrative infectious disease service (clinical microbiology and\/or infectious diseaseas wellinfection prevention) was established already years ago, while in Germany - with few exceptions - in most hospitals only a basic infectious disease services (consulting hygienist, microbiological diagnosis is held by laboratories often far away from the patient). As hospitals are connected with each other with respect to theircommon care of patients, one of the most important challenges in future infection prevention will be the implementation of regional and intersectoral infection prevention and control. ","653":"Every day patients experience harm due to errors and complications. To improve this situation, patient safety is increasingly becoming important in the treatment process. One aspect to increase patient safety is the Critical Incident Reporting System (CIRS). Observers and members of the care team are given the opportunity to anonymously report critical incidents and thus allow an analysis by an evaluation team. The goal is not to sanction the behavior of an individual, but to identify particular structural and organizational sources of error and to derive improvements. ","654":"Avoiding complications is a major goal of all patient safety efforts. We are used to working with all kinds of algorithms for avoiding adverse events or for the diagnosis and treatment of possible unforeseen or inadvertent complications in our patients. As a matter of fact, severe complications certainly have an impact not only on the patient, but also on the medical team involved (\"second victim\"). Obviously there is no published standard in Germany on how to deal with this professional problem. Therefore, the German Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (DGAI) has elaborated guidelines for the individual professional concerned, for the colleagues of doctors involved, as well as for the supervisors and hospital institutions. The aim of these recommendations is to encourage our professional society to set a focus on this problem and to offer a structured course of action for the case that a major complication occurs in spite of all our efforts to maintain our patient's safety. ","655":"In cases of unintended treatment courses an adequate communication is mandatory. Empathetic conversations expressing human warmth can pave the way to the avoidance of forensic consequences. The laws on patient's rights obligate the responsible physician to inform on request the patient about all recognizable circumstances that may lead to the assumption of a treatment error and to avoid hazards to health. The patient has a right to view his or her complete patient records and to demand that copy be made at the patient's expense. In the case of information to relatives the physician must observe the content and scope of his\/her obligation to medical confidentiality.

The anesthesiology has recognized that early detection and therapy results in significant improvement of postoperative clinical state of health of the patients. In the following article it will be discussed that it could be profitable to make a further step: threatening the subsyndromal delirium. Because there are only few experiences in anesthesiology, this thesis will be substantiated by datas from psychiatry.","659":"We report the case of a patient who suffered a serious subarachnoid hemorrhage with a cardialaffection and development of an inverted Tako-Tsubo-cardiomyopathy. To avoid apparent cerebral ischemia due to severe cerebral vasospasm after exhaustion of conservative therapeutic options a temporarily endovascular therapy with continuous intra-arterial application of Nimodipine was necessary. In the overall protracted and complicated course the special challenge were the therapeutic efforts to avoid apparent cerebral ischemia in context to the significant cardial affection.","660":"","661":"Management of ischemic stroke is targeted on four therapeutic objectives: limitation of neurological deficit, prevention of earyl stroke recurrence, protection against complications, and secondary prevention. Intravenous thrombolysis within 4.5h of stroke onset is the only proven therapy to improvefunctional outcome. Although promising, neither endovascular recanalisation nor neuroprotective strategies have demonstrated efficacy so far. Immediate administration of antiplatelet agents like acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel - in case of intravenous thrombolysis at the earliest after 24h - is effective to prevent early stroke recurrence, whereas anticoagulants should be ommitted in this stage because of an increased risk of cerebral hemorrhage. Subcutaneous heparin\/low molecular weight heparin, mobilisation, nasogastric tube, and decompressive craniectomy may protect from venous thromboembolism, aspiration pneumonia, and malignant brain edema, respectively. Secondary prevention is guided by stroke etiology, e.g. oral anticoagulation in the presence atrial fibrillation or endarterectomy in case of sympomatic high-grade carotid stenosis. ","662":"","663":"The acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a major cause of death and disability in Germany. The treatment of patients with AIS focuses on rapid recanalization of close brain vessels. Anaesthesiologists are likely to encounter patients with AIS and must be aware of the anaesthetic considerations for these patients. The advantage and risk of general anaesthesia during a neuroradiology procedure is shown. We make recommendations for blood pressure, blood glucose and temperature management.","664":"In addition to the long-established local thrombolysis by means of a catheter, other mechanical procedures for the interventional treatment of acute ischemic stroke have been introduced over the last ten years. These new methods have proved to be effective for the recanalization of occluded vessels supplying the brain and can, in principle, also be employed outside of the therapeutic window valid for intravenous thrombolysis. For just this reason such interventionaltherapies are being increasingly used, also in combination with intravenous thrombolysis. However, higher demands are placed on imaging diagnostics in order to protect the patients from unnecessary risks resulting from these invasive measures. Since this is still a very new therapeutic procedure it has not yet been conclusively demonstrated that the interventional method, in spite of all theoretical advantages in comparison with intravenous thrombolysis, really does lead to a better outcome for the patients. The indication must thus be made on an individual basis at the interdisciplinary level.","665":"","666":"","667":"Emergency medical care for injuries caused by acids and bases is challenging for rescue services.

The patient management and its outcome are presented. ","670":"Drug interactions in emergency medicine can occur in many forms and can result in different complications. Drug interactions can be the primary cause for the emergency call, but also they can happen after the application of different drugs at the scene. Emergency physicians need to be aware of possible interactions of their own emergency drugs. Additionally, interactions of different medications prescribed by physicians, non-prescription drugs and also by food are possible. Emergency drugs should never be mixed in a single syringe or applied together in a single infusion bag. Solving of medications always needs to be in accordance with the official instruction leaflet.","671":"Drug-drug interactions are a common problem in elderly multi-morbid patients receiving polypharmacy. A high quantity of prescribed drugs is associated with an increase in the risk of adverse effects and drug-drug interactions. More and more medical and pharmaceutical stakeholders are involved in the drug therapy of critically ill patients. In the future it will be important to comprehend the medication as a common task. The patient will get the best therapy available, if the cooperation is successful. In general, drug interactions may be related to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic aspects. Pharmacokinetic drug interactions concern the influence of the cytochrome P450 enzymes and transport proteins in the body. Pharmacodynamic interactions can be found, for example, as an additive effect of drugs which are combined. The relevance of both aspects must accordingly be considered and negative impact should be avoided.","672":"Pharmaceutical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions (DDI) can complicate or facilitate anesthesia. Knowledge of the basic DDI mechanisms and DDI databases helps to avoid unwanted DDIs and to optimize wanted DDIs such as antidotes or desired synergism. Concerning pharmaceutical DDI (=incompatibilities) special attention must be paid to very acidic or basic drugs, polyvalent ions such as calcium and emulsions like propofol. Inducers or inhibitors of cytochrome p450 3A4 can complicate postoperative therapy of raised blood pressure or pain (pharmacokinetic DDI).

Accordingly, the number of intensive care patients suffering additionally from a significant obesity is also increasing continuously. Some particular features of these patients need to be observed. Differences to normal-weight patients involve, for example, respiratory physiology: the obesity leads to a decrease of lung volume and to a marked increase in breathing work as well as oxygen consumption. Clinically relevant changes occur in the upper airways and neck. Thus, mask ventilation, intubation or surgical interventions to secure the airways are clearly more difficult than in normal-weight patients. Obese intensive care patients are therefore primarily to be considered as patients with difficult airway conditions. In addition in cases of extreme obesity, drug distribution, degradation and excretion can differ from those of normal-weight patients. This must be taken into account for medication dosing. In spite of the overweight, obese patients may be undernourished upon admission to the ICU. Thus, for this group of patients also, enteral nutrition should be started as early as possible. Although obesity is accompanied by a higher mortality on account of the many possible comorbidities, numerous studies have confirmed that even extreme obesity does not increase the mortality rate in comparison with that of normal-weight patients.","678":"","679":"","680":"Patient blood management (PBM), as a multidisciplinary, evidence-based treatment concept for reducing anemia and blood losses, should be realized in individual hospitals after local adaptation according to the available facilities.The implementation of a PBM program in clinical institutions will be a challenging but in every case worthwhile task. The local facilities may be insufficient to fulfill the training requirements of a large group of different personnel. Accordingly, sustained support by the hospital's management with provision of the necessary resources for personnel and materials is essential. The formation of the core PBM team, in our case consisting initially of anaesthesiologists, surgeons, internists and transfusion medicine specialists as well as - the particularly important - motivated nursing personnel, is one of the most pressing and primary tasks in the establishment of a PBM project.It is also extremely important to firmly anchor the PBM project permanently within the hospital. Possible steps and details for this purpose are presented and discussed in terms of value and weighting by the authors on the basis of their actual experience in Frankfurt University Hospital. ","681":"The multimodal concept of Patient Blood Management touches many aspects of in-hospital treatment. The goals are to preserve and strengthen the patients' own resources in order to avoid transfusion-associated adverse events. This can be achieved by meticulous minimization of perioperative blood loss and the enhancement and full utilization of individual anaemia tolerance. The transfusion of allogeneic blood products shall be guideline-based only. The proposed package of measures has immense potential to increase patient safety! ","682":"Preoperative anaemia is an independent risk factor for an increase in perioperative morbidity and mortality. Patient Blood Management (PBM) aims for an early detection of anaemia in elective surgery patients. Reasons for anaemia should be detected and causally treated if possible. A multidisciplinary team of specialists aims for diagnosis and causative treatment of easily treatable and frequent causes of anaemia like iron deficiency, bleeding or (autoimmune) haemolysis using patients' specific history, examination, laboratory and technical methods. Such an outpatient PBM programme is only feasible, if anaesthesiologists, surgeons, haematologists, gastroenterologists, gynecologists, laboratory and transfusion medicine specialists work together in a PBM team using a common PBM plan. Communication within this team as well as with the patients' physicians in their private offices is key for a long lasting success of such a PBM programme.

These and their relatives worry about an aggravation of an already existing dementia or even the postoperative evocation of one. Common volatile anaesthetics and propofol are suspected to increase dementia - associated protein tau and amyloid-betalevels in the brain. Perioperative complications such as cognitive dysfunction and delirium occur more frequently in dementia patients. For anaesthesiologists, it seems prudent toassess the grade of dementia in the elderly to adjust anaesthesia drug doses and monitoring intra- and postoperatively. Pharmacological interactions with antidementic andneuroleptic current medications affectanaesthetic and analgesic effects.In dementia, perioperative malfunction of cognition, memory, attention, information processing, communication and social interaction abilities is of profound influence on the perioperative management.This review mentions actual knowledge about dementia forms and symptoms in brief.

Patients with cardiac disease benefit from regional anaesthesia, especially catheter-provided postoperative pain relief, but are at higher risk for puncture-related haematoma when NOAC are applied simultaneously. Therefore recommended time intervals between drug application and performance of RA including catheter removal of 22-34 h must be respected. The next dose of NOAC must not be given before 6 h have been elapsed; after bloody tap a delay of 24 h is recommended. The respective time intervals are prolonged in patients with renal insufficiency, especially when Dabigatran is applied, until 36 to 72 h. In general, high risk patients with NOAC undergoing surgery benefit from an interdicsciplinary approach and from less traumatic techniques such as spinal anaesthesia or superficial peripheral nerve blocks. ","690":"The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) were developed because of the urgent therapeutic need due to the deficits of vitamin K antagonist therapy. The predominant indications in internal medicine are the acute treatment and secondary prevention of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) as well as stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation. For the acute therapy and secondary prevention of DVT\/PE the DOACS were non inferior to low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) plus vitamin K antagonists at a significantly reduced rate of severe bleeding complications. Only Rivaroxaban is currently approved for this indication, with Dabigatran, Apixaban and Edoxaban still awaiting approval. For stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation Dabigatran, Rivaroxaban and Apixaban are approved. The efficacy of Dabigatran (150mg bid) and Apixaban (5mg bid) are superior to warfarin, with Rivaroxaban being non-inferior to warfarin for stroke prevention. The rate of bleeding complications with Apixaban and Dabigatran (110mg bid) were significantly lower as with warfarin. The DOACs do represent a major therapeutic advantage in oral anticoagulation therapy of patients for the approved indications. ","691":"For stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation and other indications new oral anticoagulants have been developed. These drugs are direct anticoagulants in contrast to the indirectly acting vitamin-K antagonists, which are used for decades as the only available drugs. Most clinical experience exists for the thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the factor X inhibitorrivaroxaban. However, to transfer the benefit from the large scale studies to the real world conditions, physicians have to get clinical experience in using the new drugs. Especially drug interactions, impaired renal function and periinterventional bridging need special attention to ensure transfer of the new drugs benefits to daily life treatment.

Whether anesthesia for a child with respiratory infection should be performed or better be canceled, is still a dilemma for many anesthetists. The reasons for this are understandable: respiratory infections are associated with an increased incidence of perioperative respiratory adverse events, and there have been no evidence-based recommendations for the procedure in the individual case. The reason appears to be the asthma-like airway hyperreactivity. Typical respiratory adverse events are laryngo- and bronchospasm. Although most of them remain without serious sequelae they have potential for serious morbidity and mortality when not immediately diagnosed and treated. Risk factors for respiratory complications include age &lt;1 year , pulmonary comorbidity, invasive airway and airway surgery. Hence the individual decision is dependant on the risk but also the benefit factors and the expertise of the medical team. ","695":"The use of extraglottic airway devices (EGA) is well accepted for airway management for certain classic indications such as general anaesthesia during limb surgery in the supine position. Furthermore, EGA have been deemed a useful tool during the management of an unrecognized difficult airway. On the other hand, the use of EGA has been controversially discussed for advanced indications such as during general anaesthesia during laparoscopic surgery and in coexisting morbid obesity. This article provides an evidence based review of the role of EGA during a variety of indications and is designed to assist with the decision making process of whether an EGA may or may not be appropriate for a particular indication.

However, in reality, it is possible that patients with poor living conditions are satisfied (well-being paradox) whereas patients treated successfully are not (dissonance). The higher the psychological distress, the more rare is the assumption that successful therapy is an equivalent of satisfaction. Satisfaction depends more on fulfillment of patient expectations and involvement of the physicians.","699":"Critical illness leads to oxidative stress and can induce or exacerbate nutrient deficiencies. This predisposes patients in the intensive care unit to impaired immune function and increased risk of developing infectious complications, organ dysfunction, and therefore worsens clinical outcome. Immune-modulating properties of specific nutrients such as glutamine and antioxidants may support the endogenous antioxidative system, improve immune and organ function and translate into better clinical outcome of the critically ill patient. The following article summarizes the rationale and provides an update on recent clinical studies with special focus on the use of glutamine and antioxidants in critically ill patients. It further provides recommendations for the clinical use of these substrates in this particular patient population.

Alternatively indirect calorimetry should be applied where available.","701":"Nutrition of intensive care patients is often complex and challenging due to metabolic changes. For this reason nutritional support adapted to the metabolic state is of key importance to avoid hyper- or hypoalimentation and thus has direct impact on the prognosis. Target parameters might be beneficial to establish an adequate and differentiated nutritional strategy but thus far concerning single nutritional components evidence-based data are only available for adjusting blood glucose levels. Furthermore, an early enteral nutrition is of major prognostic importance. In practice a supplementary parenteral support is often required to provide adequate calorie supply. Monitoring of residual gastric volume as a tool to regulate an effective enteral nutrition might possibly become less important due to recent study data.

Due to the demands of the Heidelberger surgeon Kirchner a rethinking was initiated prior to World War 2. It was not until the 1960s that this concept was taken up again and physicians were incorporated into the rescue services. A prerequisite for this in the technical field was the development of physician escorted rescue vehicles for the prehospital management of road accident victims. After the economic and medical benefits of the deployment of emergency physicians had been demonstrated, the mandatory participation of emergency physicians was laid down in the laws on rescue services by the West German federal states. With increasing acceptance, there was a shift of the patient collective from accident victims to acute internal medical and neurological emergency cases.

This necessitates a sound knowledge about the mechanisms and processes of an explosion as well as the particular pathophysiological relationships of explosion injuries in order to be able to initiate the best possible, guideline-conform trauma therapy.

The news of the beneficial effects, primarily disposed as a \"Yankee Invention\", spread over all continents quickly. This was the result of an article, published in the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal on November 18th, 1846. It is mentioning worth that this article was written when Morton had disclosed that the used \"preparation\", later named as \"Nostrum\" or \"Letheon\", was sulphuric ether. The important discovery later became a patent case and was overshadowed by a long lasting priority claim. Nevertheless the readers of the New England Journal of Medicine voted in a survey that this article was the most important publication in the 200 years journals history ever.","737":"During acute respiratory failure, intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation may be life saving procedures. However, with increasing time on the ventilator, the rate of complications increases and prolonged mechanical ventilation is associated with increased morbidity, mortality and high ICU cost. Since the weaning period accounts for 40% of the overall ventilation period, optimizing weaning is mandatory to shorten mechanical ventilation. Various concepts to facilitate weaning have been proposed and there is an ongoing debate about the most effective methods. These include an early screening of weaning readiness based on established criteria, the choice of the concept of ventilation and ventilator modes, the use of weaning protocols, \"closed loop\" automated ventilation and weaning. This article describes the relevance of the different ventilator strategies that are applied during weaning from mechanical ventilation. ","738":"Early weaning and discontinuation of mechanical ventilation can help prevent respiratory muscle dysfunction in critically ill patients. Prolonged mechanical ventilation and failure to use adequate strategies to discontinue mechanical ventilation can even enhance and perpetuate respiratory muscle dysfunction. On the other hand, premature attempts to extubate may result in re-intubation due to respiratory failure and are associated with poor outcomes and high mortality rates of up to 30-50%. Therefore, accurate monitoring of the respiratory muscle function is a valuable tool for the clinician at the bedside to assess to optimal weaning strategy and, ideally, would predict either weaning failure or success. In this review, we briefly summarize the available techniques, measurements and equipment required for the monitoring of respiratory muscle function in the intensive care unit. ","739":"Independent from the mode of mechanical ventilation, particularly a quick termination of mechanical ventilation is essential for the weaning progress. Respirator-associated complications need to be early detected and treated. Thus it is important to know correspondent pathomechanisms as they have a crucial influence on the weaning process.To facilitate a holistic treatment approach for patients in prolonged weaning, a tight junction of intensive care within specialized units seems mandatory. ","740":"Timely weaning from invasive ventilation is of major importance to limit time of invasive ventilation and improve outcomes. However, in pediatrics only limited knowledge on the optimal weaning approach is available. In this review evidence from recent trials on weaning in pediatrics is summarized. Standardized daily evaluation of weaning readiness, daily interruption of sedation, use of pediatric sedation protocols, application of noninvasive ventilation and prophylactic treatment with steroids of patients with high risk for post-extubation upper airway obstruction have been shown to decrease duration of invasive ventilation or to decrease the risk of extubation failure. However, due to the heterogeneous patient population in pediatric intensive care units, an individual approach might be necessary for certain subgroups of pediatric patients.","741":"Special conditions in neurologic patients arise, first, from abnormal breathing patterns with brain lesions. These however may be managed effectively by adaptive ventilator settings together with special drugs thus not ultimatively precluding weaning. Second, failure of respiratory muscle strength is a leading cause of weaning failure. In acute neuromuscular diseases during the weaning process special attention should be payed to the parameters of muscle strength, and for disturbances of swallowing at least after extubation. In degenerative terminally decompensated neuromuscular disease, an exact diagnosis and information is essential to help the patient in decision-making towards terminal weaning or long-term home ventilatory support. ","742":"Weaning from mechanical ventilation plays a key-role in modern intensive care medicine: about 40% of all ventilated patients suffer from difficult\/prolonged weaning causing about 50% of the total stay on the intensive care unit (ICU). Severe chronic airway, lung and thoracic disorders, neuromuscular diseases and morbid obesity cause respiratory muscle insufficiency and result in respiratory failure with prolonged weaning. In Germany, pneumologists have a wide ranging expertise with this patient cohort and established weaning centers over the past 25 years. This article illustrates the classification, the most important therapeutical strategies and organizational aspects when caring for patients under (long-term) mechanical ventilation from the pneumologist's perspective. ","743":"","744":"In the Helsinki Declaration terms and conditions are demanded to control problems in airway management in perioperative care situations. A differentiated airway management can reduce morbidity and mortality. This includes staff- and structure-adjusted standard operating procedures (SOP), which take into account different patient groups, situations of treatment and current guidelines. Along with these SOPs continuing education, sytematic screening of patients and the use of algorithms and checklists are recommended. In this regard paediatric care requires special consideration. Furthermore the fibreoptic as the gold standard for the difficult airway as well as surgical airway management are essential and must be available at all times, whereas videolaryngoscopy takes on increasing evidence as an additional technique. ","745":"As a general rule drinking water in hospitals does not represent a risk for the normal patient. However, for high-risk patients with compromised immune defense systems drinking water in hospitals may become a source of nosocomial infections. It may be contaminated with microorganisms that may have the potential to be infectious agents in the hospital environment. Of particular significance in such circumstances are the Gram-negative rods such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp. and Legionella bacteria. Accordingly, specific behavior patterns and measures in the handling of drinking water in hospitals are meaningful in order to reduce the risks of water-associated nosocomial infections. ","746":"Patients with univentricular congenital heart disease are treated with Fontan-procedure for more than 40 years resulting in mainly good life-quality for pediatric and now more and more adult patients. Due to prolonged life expectation and adequate physical state, adolescent and adult Fontan-patients participate in normal life activities like the main population. Mass events like open-air concerts and sport events belong to these activities.Since 1999 the Southside Festival is one of the main open air events in southern Germany with about 60.000 visitors. Visitors with minor or major health problems are treated by emergency response services like the German Red Cross, the German St Johns Ambulance and the German Order of Malta. The article refers to the special pathophysiology and management of Fontan-patients in emergency and anaesthesiologic settings based on a case report from the Southside Festival. Due to increasing \"fontanpopulation\" profound education of attending physicians and paramedics is inevitable to provide good quality in prehospital and innerhospital care.","747":"The management of pre-hospital cardiac arrest in children requires psychosocial as well as medical skills. This paper provides a review of the current literature regarding the psychological aspects of pre-hospital cardiac arrest in children. ","748":"About 75000 people suffer from sudden cardiac arrest in Germany every year. 47% of all out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) in Germany are bystander witnessed, but in only 16.1% is bystander-initiated CPR undertaken. In comparison to other countries, Germany is in the last third of bystander-initiated CPR activities. But bystander CPR is one of the most important measures contributing to a good neurological outcome after OHCA. New methods and concepts have to be developed to bring the knowledge of CPR to the general public in Germany and to improve the international standing. ","749":"An analysis of literature results reveals differences concerning the need for rescue breathing in lay-rescuer cardiopulmonary-resuscitation (CPR). Observational studies on large registries have shown improved survival rates with standard CPR (chest compressions and rescue breathing) compared to continuous chest compressions (CCC). This applies especially for cardiac arrests of non-cardiac origin or prolonged EMS-arrival times. In contrast a public program for lay-rescuers focusing on CCC lead to improved success rates of bystander-CPR, followed by improved survival rates. The 2010 ERC guidelines have resolved this controversy by integrating both aspects. CCC is recommended for everyone. Trained bystanders should use standard-CPR as method of choice. For dispatcher-assisted CPR the results are clear. Giving instructions for mouth-to-mouth ventilation is too complicated and time consuming, thus impairing survival rates. Therefore CCC is recommended for dispatcher-assisted CPR. ","750":"Sudden cardiac arrest is a major contributor to avoidable deaths in Europe. Immediate start of basic life support (BLS) by laypersons is among the most successful strategies in the treatment of cardiac arrest patients. Despite the fact that more than half of all cardiac arrests in Germany are witnessed by a bystander, only in one fifth of all arrests layperson resuscitation is initiated. One strategy to enhance bystander BLS is to establish cardiac resuscitation tuition in schools. BLS instructions for pupils have been proven to be successfully implemented independent from children's age or physical ability. Although an age-adjusted curriculum seems reasonable even usage of automatic external defibrillators (AED) can be taught effectually. The earlier in the life of a student BLS-instruction begins, the more successful the training is. However a national German curriculum for BLS-training in schools has yet to be established in Germany. ","751":"ERC Guidelines 2010 highlight the importance of dispatcher assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The concept has been in use in emergency medical services in the USA since the mid-Eighties where it accounted for a considerable rise in bystander resuscitation. Subsequently it was implemented in some major Scandinavian cities. Studies from those countries showed that the rate of survivors in good neurological condition can be raised significantly. Yet, this procedure has not been widely established in Germany so far. In this article the positive effects of the approach are illustrated as well as its limitations some of which can be resolved putting in reasonable effort. The relevance of dispatcher assisted CPR for emergency medical dispatchers as well as the emergency medical crews at the scene is then discussed. ","752":"","753":"In 2010 the Helsinki Declaration on Patient Safety in Anaesthesiology was launched. In this joined statement under the auspice of the European Society of Anaesthesiology the need for protocols for different aspects of perioperative procedures that could affect patient safety was stated. All participating institutions should have--among others--protocols for checking equipment and drugs required for the delivery of safe anaesthesia. The background for this being the fact that the lack of carefully checking equipment and drugs--or not adhering to existing checklists--is a latent threat to patient safety and thus may increase morbidity and mortality.In this part of a series the authors present protocols existing in their clinic for checking anaesthesia equipment and drugs.","754":"","755":"Sepsis is a complex life threatening disease whose outcome decisively depends on a fast diagnosis and treatment.

Strategies to prevent these infections are crucial. Evidence based measures like hand hygiene, treatment of nasal carriage of S. aureus, surveillance, prophylactic application of antibiotics or hair removal with electric clippers are listed in national and international guidelines. Beside these measures several myths and traditions like the application of antibiotic prophylaxis for several days or hygienic rituals in a septic operating theatre still exist. These measures are not helpful and should not be used any more. It is helpful to include effective measures in a bundle, the compliance with the bundle should be monitored regularly.

Despite enhancements of surgical techniques in prostatectomyperioperative blood loss is still the most frequent complication. Controlled hypotension (MAP 60-70mmHg) consisting of thoracal epidural anaesthesia und restrictive fluid management is a safe method to minimize blood loss. 25 degrees Trendelenburg position supports the multimodal treatment of controlled hypotension. Tranexamic acid is a safe drug to treat hyperfibrinolysis during prostate resection. ","759":"Because of excellent results, high patient satisfaction, and extraordinary surgical conditions robotic assisted prostatectomies have found a wide spread acceptance. Trendelenburg positioning, CO2-Insufflation, and installation of the robot system cause moderate hemodynamic and respiratory changes. Respiration can be compromised by significantly reduced pulmonary compliance during surgery and a marked CO2 load. Therefore, arterial blood gas controls during surgery can be recommended. Over hours edema of head and neck including the upper airways and an increase of the intraocular pressure can develop. There are no restrictions in the choice of the anesthetics. Careful positioning of the patient and critical intravenous fluid management are important determinants of a successful anesthetic management. ","760":"Radical prostatectomy (RP) is a treatment option with an excellent cure rate in patients with localized prostate cancer but is accompanied by increased side effects. Particularly laparoscopic techniques developed in the last decade and are widespread. The operation techniques (retropubic(RRP), laparoscopic (LRP) and robot assisted laparoscopic (RALP) radical prostatectomy) and the comparative literature available are presented. RALP shows less blood loss compared to RRP and a lower transfusion rate compared to RRP and LRP. RALP may obtain better 12-months continence and potency rates. However, due to short follow-up and methodic weaknesses no conclusions can be drawn at this time. At present RALP seems not to be usable in an economically reasonable way. RRP, LRP and RALP show similar oncologic outcomes and comparable side effects. RP is the gold standard in the treatment of localized prostate cancer.","761":"","762":"Primary aspects of post operative care should include decisive and adequate treatment of pain.

It is applied to both patients with psychiatric disorders and in psycho-social crises. For the latter, a psycho-physiological reaction is typical that can be treated with the BELLA concept. Psycho-social crisis intervention for the emergency physician must be regarded as psychological first-aid and is characterised by an immediate start, a limited time frame, consideration of security aspects, flexibility and a determination to pre-set goals and their achievements. We recommend to adequately document this complex service. ","765":"More than 30 years ago the pioneering work of Andrew and co-workers showed that the coagulation system of children is different than from adult. They have introduced the term of \"developmental hemostasis\" to describe this phenomenon. They were able to show that the concentration of coagulation factors and inhibitors are age-dependent and therefore reference limits from adult practice cannot be transferred to children one to one. Numerous studies showed that the perioperative loss of blood, and thus the use of homologous blood could be limited by administering antifibrinolytic substances such as aprotinin. Other antifibrinolytics acting substances like Epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) or tranexamic acid (TXA) tended to be misfits in routine clinical practice. In 2006, the publication of a retrospective study carried out by Mangano et al, in which considerable safety concerns were expressed with regard to aprotinin led to a significant rethinking of its clinical use. Two years later the results of the BART (Blood Conservation using antifibrinolytics in a Randomized Trial) study confirmed that there was an increased postoperative mortality associated with the use of aprotinin compared to TXA and EACA. In a few adult studies so far tranexamic acid was found to be comparably as effective as aprotinin. Although TXA is a long known drug available on the market for more than 50 years, the studies connecting factors of indication, dosage regimen and safety are limited especially in children and infants.

Here the application of an opioid is possible or even necessary to lessen increases of the heart rate and blood pressure. To lessen cardiovascular response, short acting Remifentanil has advantages, e.g. the fast clearance rate in newborns. However, the risk for the newborn from respiratory depression has to be considered and experienced staff to care for the newborn should be present after childbirth.

But none of the promising candidates is used in clinical routine up to now. For evaluation of clinical benefit the results of large prospective multicenter studies have to be awaited.","816":"Acute kidney injury occurs in up to 30% of all ICU patients. Renal replacement therapy is required in approx. 8%, and mortality in the latter group is up to 50%. Dialysis dependency occurs in 10-30% of survivors. Risk factors for non-recovery are baseline kidney disease, advanced age, and sepsis-induced kidney failure. Even in those with initial recovery the subsequent risk of chronic renal failure is high. Specific interventions to promote renal-recovery are not available. Nevertheless, there is some evidence that if continuous renal replacement therapies are used instead of intermittent haemodialysis the chance of recovery to independence from dialysis is increased.","817":"Continuous and intermittent renal replacement procedures are equally adequate therapies for acute kidney injury. The choice of modality should be made individually and on the basis of the specific clinical situation which may include switching between modalities during the course of treatment. In patients with haemodynamic instability or at risk of disequilibrium and cerebral edema CRRT or prolonged intermittent treatment may offer advantages whilst IHD should be preferred for the acute treatment of life-threatening electrolyte abnormalities or metabolic acidosis. Overall, the different modalities should be viewed as complementary.","818":"","819":"","820":"","821":"Emergency care for patients in palliative situations is not a rare event, but often difficult to handle, because training in palliative care for emergency physicians is often insufficient. This article proposes an algorithm that should facilitate the decision-making process in such emergencies. In addition, recommendations concerning the management of symptoms in the emergency medical services are presented.","822":"Oxygen is the best known and well accepted medication in emergency medicine. In most emergencies high doses of oxygen are an essential part of treatment and seemed to be nearly free of adverse effects. Studies of the last two decades show hints to possible adverse effects of hyperoxia during post-resuscitation-care and myocardial infarction. These results should be critically reviewed and may lead to a rational use of oxygen in emergency care.","823":"The need for inter-hospital transports over long distances aboard air ambulances or airlines has increased in recent years, both in the civil as well as the military sector. More often severely ill intensive care patients with multiple organ failure and appropriate supportive care (e.g. mechanical ventilation, catecholamines, dialysis, cardiac assist devices) are transported by air. Despite the fact that long-haul intensive care transports by air ambulance and airlines via Patient Transport Compartment (PTC) are considered established modes of transport they always provide a number of challenges. Both modes of transport have distinct logistical and medical advantages and disadvantages. These-as well as the principal risks of an air-bound long-haul intensive care transport -have to be included in the risk assessment and selection of means of transport. Very often long-haul intensive care transports are a combination of air ambulance and scheduled airlines utilizing the PTC.","824":"","825":"","826":"In general there are 3 significant malpractice risks for anaesthesiologists: insufficient supervision especially in case of patients, who have a known awareness risk, technical mistakes in the preparation or controlling of anaesthesia and no or insufficient therapeutic reaction if awareness has occurred. As long as awareness cannot be avoided during anaesthesia this risk should be explained to the patient. But the information should be given by the physician very subtly and carefully.Until today there have been only 3 court decisions in Germany concerning awareness. In all cases the claims have been dismissed. There is no Federal Court decision dealing with informed consent in case of awareness.","827":"Awareness is a rare but typical complication during general anesthesia, with a reported incidence of 0.1- 0.2% to 1% (high risk patients) in adults and probably much higher in children with 0.2 -1.2%. Awareness is defined as consciousness during general anesthesia with explicit (conscious) recall of memories.Wakefulness during anesthesia can meet DSM-IV criteria of trauma. Significant long-term psychological sequelae (e.g. post-traumatic stress disorder) may occur.Recommendations of the German Society of Anesthesiologists have been developed according to the ASA Task Force for intraoperative awareness and brain function monitoring.The article focuses on risk factors and sequelae of awareness, explains the options for detection of intraoperative wakefulness and postoperative memories and makes recommendations for prevention and handling of awareness.","828":"Awareness is a rare but in some cases severe complication of general anesthesia. In clinical practice vegetative signs such as sweating, lacrimation, tachycardia and hypertension are used to assess the anesthetic depth. Awareness however may also occur without any of these signs. Different systems based on the electroencephalogram (EEG) have been developed to monitor hypnosis. Some studies have shown that the use of EEG based monitor systems can reduce the incidence of awareness in patients of high risk. A similar reduction of the incidence was reached in studies using protocols based on concentrations of volatile anesthetics. Other systems to monitor anesthetic depth have been developed, but their influence on awareness has not yet been investigated sufficiently. Further studies are needed to clarify their impact concerning the incidence of awareness.","829":"","830":"Nowadays almost all operating rooms are equipped with air conditioning (AC units). Their main purpose is climatization, like ventilation, moisturizing, cooling and also the warming of the room in large buildings. In operating rooms they have an additional function in the prevention of infections, especially the avoidance of postoperative wound infections. This is achieved by special filtration systems and by the creation of specific air currents. Since hypothermia is known to be an unambiguous factor for the development of postoperative wound infections, patients are often actively warmed intraoperatively using warm air blankets (forced-air warming units). In such cases it is frequently discussed whether such warm air blankets affect the performance of AC units by changing the air currents or whether, in contrast, have exactly the opposite effect. However, it has been demonstrated in numerous studies that warm air blankets do not have any relevant effect on the functioning of AC units. Also there are no indications that their use increases the rate of postoperative wound infections. By preventing the patient from experiencing hypothermia, the rate of postoperative wound infections can even be decreased thereby.","831":"","832":"Placement and removal of central venous catheters (CVC) are routine procedures in anesthesiology and on the intensive care unit. There are numerous possible complications associated with those interventions. Here, we report on a patient who developed respiratory failure immediately after removal of a CVC. The proof of air bubbles in echocardiography confirmed the diagnosis of air embolism. In this article we describe causes, symptoms and therapy of air embolism.","833":"Critical care medicine in severely burned patients should be adapted to the different pathophysiological phases. Accordingly, surgical and non-surgical therapy must be coordinated adequately. Initial stabilization of the burn victim during the first 24 hours (Surgical therapy and critical care medicine in severely burned patients - Part 1: the first 24 ours, AINS 9\/12) is followed by a long lasting reconstructive period. During this time calculated fluid replacement to compensate evaporative losses by large bourn wounds is as essential as reconstruction of the integrity of the skin and the modulation of metabolic consequences following severe burn injury. Special attention has to be paid to local and systemic infections.","834":"Apart from cardiovascular, pulmonary and metabolic drugs, many patients scheduled for surgery are taking antidepressive or antipsychotic drugs. Some of these psychiatric drugs may interfere with anesthetics. The anesthesiologist has to decide whether or not to continue the psychiatric medication during the perioperative period. Since the discontinuation of psychiatric drugs may lead to withdrawal syndromes, the decision should be made in accordance with the attending psychiatrist. Should the discontinuation of any psychiatric drug be recommended, it may be prudent to involve the attending surgeon in order to postpone the procedure, since the modification of psychiatric drugs may take several days.Prospective randomized data about the perioperative modification of psychiatric drugs are scarce. Thus, recommendations in this regard must rely on physiological and pharmacological principles, case reports and published expert opinions. In this article we use the available data to answer the question of a journal reader regarding the perioperative modification of Opipramol therapy for a 59-year-old patient scheduled for elective shoulder surgery.","835":"","836":"","837":"Every year a large number of patients suffer from cardiac arrest and must be reanimated. The German Resuscitation Registry was founded in 2007 in order to analyze and optimize these measures. The registry documents the course of reanimated patients at the time points \"first aid\", \"further management\" and \"long-term outcome\" and can thus provide a complete presentation of the procedures and the quality of the outcome. Furthermore, important scientific questions can be answered from the database containing at present details of 24,000 resuscitations: for example, a score for benchmarking the outcome quality after out-of-hospital resuscitation (the so-called RACA score) has been developed. In addition, the major significance of percutaneous catheter interventions and active cooling after cardiac arrest has been demonstrated. In future, the platform of the German Resuscitation Registry will be further expanded to enable an interdisciplinary exchange of information as well as scientific research.","838":null,"839":"Even in the 21st century major trauma still contributes to a svere loss of life in our society. Severly injured victims benefit from prehospital care that both considers tactical and medical aims. Knowledge of major trauma care has grown over the past years. The 2011 german guidelines on multiple- and severe trauma care set a milestone for better treatment of these patients. Trauma courses do not only teach theoretical knowledge but do also train participants in skills. By putting up the new structure of german traumacenters involving certified trauma hospitals it is easier for ambulance doctors to find the best hospital for their patient. Thought has been given to nearly al organ systems and body-areas in the guidelines making them a very usefull orientation guide for prehospital care. Emergency anesthesie including intubation is a mayor issue of the new guidelines.","840":"","841":"A marathon runner collapses after crossing the finish line and shows neurological disorders. Aftertreatment at the scene hyponatremia and cerebral edema are found at hospital admission. Thepatient is treated for \"exercise-associated hyponatremia\" (EAH) on the ICU for six days. This raredisease occurs following endurance exercise and is based on an acute dilutionalhyponatremia.Symptoms include nausea and vomiting, desorientation, dizziness, seizures or coma. Therapyincludes fluid restriction and application of hypertonic saline. Plasma sodium concentration shouldbe checked at the scene in all collapsed athletes showing neurological symptoms to differentiatebetween exercise-associated hyponatremia and dehydration.","842":"The complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is indeed a very complex pain situation. The treatment of CRPS is challenging. Patients with an acute CRPS or a CRPS in the past, who have to undergo surgery, provide a special situation. Recommendations for the management of such patients will be described in the article. High degree of evidence exists for high doses of vitamin C to prevent the development of a CRPS in trauma patients.","843":"Air travel has become a natural part of modern life. Both the environment, they take place in and the physical changes humans are exposed to must not be underestimated. Changes of pressure and volume of gases in higher altitudes induce specific physiological reactions, whereas limitations to compensate need to be acknowledged. It is the artificial environment of the aircraft cabin that allows travel in usual flight levels. Nevertheless, mild hypoxia and its sequeale have to be considered.","844":"Basically regional anaesthesia offers a lot of advantages compared with general anaesthesia for obese patients, e.g. avoiding airway manipulation and systemic application of opioids. Although anesthesiologists are increasingly faced with obesity, regional anaesthesia poses a challenge because of missing landmarks, increased depth of nerval structures and difficulties in positioning these patients. While obesity is not associated with an increased risk for severe complications in regional anaesthesia, a higher failure rate can be observed because of difficulties in performing the blocks. Ultrasound guidance may be an important aid but it is associated with specific phenomena caused by obesity. Further studies are needed to optimize regional anaesthesia techniques and dosing of local anaesthetics avoiding block failures as well to improve the patients' safety and outcome.","845":"","846":"Preanesthesia visits are highly complex communicative events with legally demanded participation of the patients. The contribution describes the logical communicative course of this communication type as well as the communicative tasks of the participants. It is shown that physicians in fact offer opportunities for patients' questions but combine them with initiatives for the completion of the interaction; formulations of such offerings are also discouraging patients' questions. Initiative questions of patients during the conversation otherwise indicate where patients are in need for questions.","847":"","848":"In patients with the most severe forms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) refractory to conventional mechanical ventilation and adjunctive or rescue therapies like kinetic therapy, inhaled vasodilators or extracorporeal CO2-elimination (extracorporeal lung assist), the use of the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can secure gas exchange. Due to technical improvements and miniaturization, the new ECMO system is safer and simpler. Nowadays the ECMO-systems are heparin-coated, so that there is no need of therapeutic systemic anticoagulation, and thus bleeding complications are less frequent. Recent data suggests, that outcome of patients with severe ARDS treated with ECMO may improve. This review describes the function and the management of ECMO-therapy in ARDS-patients.","849":"Extracorporeal lung assist can be performed pumpless by using the arterio-venous driving pressure or pumpdriven in a veno-venous mode. Oxygenation is maintained via the native lungs and depends mainly on mean airway pressure during mechanical ventilation.Extracorporeal lung assist can be part of a multimodal treatment concept in patients with acute lung injury. It aims at a further reduction of the applied tidal volume and peak pressures in order to reduce the intensity of the pulmonary and systemic inflammatory response which is the main factor for the development of multi-organ failure in this group of patients. Eventually patients with acute exacerbation of a chronic pulmonary disease might also benefit from extracorporeal ventilation.","850":"Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) contributes to the high mortality of ALI\/ARDS. Lung protective ventilation with a tidal volume of 6 ml \/ kgIBW (Ideal Body Weight) and a plateau pressure &lt;30 cm H2O has shown to reduce mortality and was thus selected as one of ten quality indicators for critical care in Germany. The optimal level of PEEP is currently unclear; however, patients with severe disorders of gas exchange seem to benefit from higher PEEP levels.Adjusting the respirator settings to the mechanical properties of the individual patient will change the treatment of ARDS in the next few years. Measurements of transpulmonary pressure by an oesophageal probe or electrical impedance tomography (EIT) are promising approaches, but still need to proof their superiority. Until then, every clinician must aim to translate the recommendations of lung protective ventilation into daily practice.","851":"","852":"","853":"Despite the ongoing further development of high definition imaging techniques (CT, MRI), mediastinoscopy and thoracoscopy remain essential instruments e.g. for extracting mediastinal lymph nodes allowing further histological diagnostics, or increasingly complex thoracoscopic procedures. Furthermore, in the course of the development of endoscopic thoracic and percutaneous interventions, the therapy of thoracic aortic aneurysms is increasingly the domain of endovascular procedures. In the second part of this review the anaesthesiological procedure and specialties concerning endoscopic thoracic interventions and percutaneous aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) will be described.","854":"Among clinical benefits like reduction in blood loss, faster postoperative recovery of gastrointestinal and lung function, lower rate of perioperative complications and less postoperative pain level, cost reduction by shortening of hospital stay plays a pivotal role for high incidence of laparoscopic surgery.Elevated intraabdominal pressure due to creation of pneumoperitoneum induces various pathophysiologic changes. Most of these changes are clinical inapparent in case of appropriate anesthesiologic management. This paper aims to sensibilize the anaesthesiologist for pathophysiologic changes, particularly with regard to hemodynamic and pulmonary complications, differential diagnosis and therapies.","855":"Percutaneous tracheostomy has become an established procedure in airway management of critically ill patients. It offers advantages over prolonged tracheal intubation. To date, there is no evidence of the optimal timing of the procedure. The Ciaglia Blue Rhino technique is the most common technique and, as any other techniques of percutaneous tracheostomy, is performed under general anaesthesia and with continuous bronchoscopic control. The recently introduced Ciaglia Blue Dolphin technique is based on radial dilatation with a fluid-filled high pressure balloon. Provided that specific contraindications are observed (e.g. difficult tracheal intubation, inability to identify anatomic landmarks, severe coagulopathy etc.), all techniques have low complication rates. The use of ultrasound may further enhance perioperative safety. Finally it must be noted that percutaneous tracheostomy is an elective procedure that requires informed consent from the patient or an attorney of law.","856":"Effective, aggressive treatment of pain accompanied with thoracic surgery is important and beneficial for patients, since severe postoperative pulmonary complications and long-term pain will be reduced. In this systematic issue evidence-based strategies in preventing and treating pain after thoracic surgery will be reviewed.","857":"Acute and chronic pain are significant problems after thoracic surgery with a multifactorial pathogenesis. On the one hand iatrogenic procedures as surgical access and complexity of treatment procedures, and on the other hand constitutional factors as psychosocial comorbidities affect individual pain threshold and the development of a Postthoracic Pain Syndrome (PTPS). Special phenomena associated with thoracic surgery like ipsitateral shoulder pain and neuropathic pain are discussed. The characterization of pathophysiological pathways wants to point out treatment options. In conclusion there is a need for well organized, multimodal pain therapy concepts to minimize the risk of perioperative and chronic pain.","858":"","859":"An ever occurring problem in the health-care services is the handling of patients who are carriers of multi-resistant pathogens (MRP). As a general rule, these patients must be isolated. Thus, the transport of these patients not only within but also outside of the hospital can be a problem. It is not just a matter of making the necessary transport of the afflicted patient, e.g., to examination suites or operating rooms, possible but also above all of protecting other patients and personnel from transmission and potential infection with the pathogen. As a rule, the measures of \"standard hygiene\" are sufficient for an adequate protection of patients and personnel. Above all, hand disinfection is of decisive importance.","860":"The prevalence of obesity has increased steadily in recent years. Obese people often suffer from diseases which acute decompensation requires a prompt prehospital therapy. The Emergency Medical Service will be confronted with difficulties in clinical diagnostic, therapy and especially with a delayed management of rescue and transport. It is most important to avoid prehospital depreciation in quality and time management. This article reviews the specific requirements of prehospital care of obese persons and discusses possible solutions to optimize the prehospital therapy.","861":"Critical care medicine in severely burned patients should be adapted to the different pathophysiological phases. Accordingly, surgical and non-surgical therapy must be coordinated adequately. Initial wound care comprises topical treatment of less severely injured skin and surgical debridement of severely burned areas. The first 24 hours of intensive care are focused on calculated fluid delivery to provide stable hemodynamics and avoid progression of local edema formation. In the further course wound treatment with split-thickness skin grafts is the major aim of surgical therapy. Critical care is focused on the avoidance of complications like infections and ventilator associated lung injury. Therefore, lung-protective ventilation strategies, weaning and sedation protocols, and early enteral nutrition are important cornerstones of the treatment.","862":null,"863":"","864":"","865":"","866":"The combination of medical and economical proceedings allows new perspectives in the illustration of medical workflows. Considering structural and developmental aspects multimodal therapy programs show similarities with typical subjects of economic process systems. By pointing out the strategic appearance of the multimodal pain therapy concept multimodal approaches can be described to some extent by using management approaches. E. g., an economic process landscape can be used to represent procedures of a multimodal pain therapy program.","867":"","868":"","869":"Goal-directed fluid therapy (GDT) is one important step in perioperative therapy as it improves complication rate and mortality by optimisation of oxygen delivery. There is a convincing evidence for GDT when used early, before organ failure occurs, and in high-risk patients. Moderne algorithms use goals derived from advanced haemodynamic monitoring and are based on the concept of fluid responsiveness and optimisation of global perfusion. Future investigations will have to prove the advantage of using the new less or non-invasive haemodynamic monitoring devices or automatic closed-loop fluid administration systems for GDT.","870":"There is a renewed discussion about the role of crystalloids and natural as well as synthetic colloids in fluid resuscitation. Based on the currently available evidence the choice of fluid replacement does not influence mortality. However, there is increasing evidence that due to unwarranted organ effects of the specific replacement fluids, individual subgroups of patients may be preferentially treated either with cristalloids or colloids.","871":"Cardiac filling pressures alone are not appropriate to estimate the effect of a volume challenge on the corresponding change in stroke volume. Dynamic variables of fluid responsiveness have been shown to discriminate with acceptable sensitivity and specificity between responders and non-responders to a volume challenge. However, several clinical confounders have been indentified which potentially influence the predictive power of these variables. Sound knowledge of these confounders and the acknowledgement that there is no unique threshold value for volume optimisation but a considerable \"gray zone\" is necessary to fully exploit the advantages of functional haemodynamic monitoring.","872":"","873":"Retrograde intubation is an alternative technique to endotracheal intubation. It is used for the management of expected or unexpected difficult intubation. The indication for use of this technique is, above all, a situation in which a flexible bronchoscope, a video laryngoscope or other alternative devices are not available or, respectively, when their use is - or appears to be - not possible due to bleeding and secretions or other particular anatomic pathological conditions. Although the necessary equipment for a retrograde intubation is frequently available, the technique is rarely used, especially in the German-speaking regions.The present article describes the technical steps of retrograde intubation and discusses its possible risks and pitfalls. Furthermore, modifications that facilitate the technical procedure are presented. This contribution is intended to promote the acceptance and use of this less invasive technique in order to avoid possible injury to the patient due to hypoxia, trauma of the airways, and surgical emergency procedures or tracheotomies during the management of difficult airway conditions.","874":"Further development of surgical techniques and instruments provide complex endoscopic or transcatheter guided interventions in thoracic organs. However, minimalinvasive surgery does not mean minimalinvasive anaesthesia. Particularly concerning cardiothoracic surgery, complex endoscopic procedures represent a challenge to the anaesthesiological management. These interventions require a close interdisciplinary cooperation. Considering the surgical procedures, this review describes the anaesthesiological management for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and percutaneous mitral valve repair. Furthermore it focuses on the anaesthesiological management of pitfalls and complications related to the surgical procedure.","875":"","876":"Haemotherapy is an integral part of modern high-tech medicine. Without supportive care including red blood cell (RBC), platelet concentrate (PC) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusion, invasive therapies such as high-dose chemotherapy regimens for haematological and solid malignancies, haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and solid organ transplantation as well as major surgery and modern trauma management would not be possible. In this article we describe the current state of haemotherapy, the risk of adverse effects and risk minimization measures, specifically focussing on haemolytic transfusion reactions (HTR), transfusion-related lung injury (TRALI) and transfusion-transmitted infections (TTI). Aided by the introduction of NAT technology for blood component screening, the residual risk of transfusion transmitted infections was reduced to 1:10.8 million for HCV, to 1:4.3 million for HIV-1, and to 1:360,000 for HBV for blood products of the German Red Cross Blood Service.","877":"","878":"Evaluating the patient's individual bleeding history with a standardized questionnaire, using \"point-of-care\" - methods for coagulation analyses and providing autologous transfusion techniques are preconditions of a modern coagulation management. Therapy of coagulopathic patients should be based on structured hemotherapy algorithms. Surgical haemostasis and the maintenance of the basic conditions for haemostasis are elementary requirements for an effective therapy. In cases of diffuse bleeding, early antifibrinolytic therapy should be considered. Coagulation factor deficiencies should be corrected \"goal-directed\" using coagulation factor concentrates. Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma is only indicated in the clinical setting of massive transfusions. DDAVP and transfusion of platelet concentrates are options to optimize primary haemostasis. In cases of on-going bleeding, recombinant activated coagulation factor VII represents an option for \"ultima-ratio\" therapy.","879":null,"880":"","881":"","882":"Psychosis can cause multiple psychiatric and somatic emergencies. Due to the complex character of the disease the communication and accessibility of the patient can be severely disturbed. In the pre-clinical emergency medical care the etiology of a psychosis remains often unclear, the most common causes are schizophrenia and drug-induced psychosis. Frequent emergencies are states of psychomotor agitation, self-endangerment and endangerment of others including suicidal tendencies\/acts as well as catatonic and manic states. Antipsychotic drugs and benzodiazepines are the most efficient pharmacotherapeutic treatments. Extrapyramidal side effects of the prescribed medication can also cause the need for urgent medical care. In any case needs to be considered a severe somatic comorbidity. It is particularly necessary that all available information at the scene of emergency should be transferred to the clinicians since the further diagnostic and therapeutic assessment will rely hereon.","883":"The noble gas xenon provides many characteristics of the 'ideal anaesthetic agent'. Xenon offers outstanding haemodynamic stability and rapid emergence from anaesthesia without relevant side effects or toxity. The major limitation for its application in clinical routine is the high price. Recent studies demonstrated additional protective effects against ischaemic injury in particular for the heart and the brain. Therefore, xenon may be beneficial in a subset of high risk patients or operations and may become a meaningful alternative to other anaesthetics in this population.","884":"","885":"74% of all hospitals had vacant positions in 2011, also departments of anaesthesiology and intensive care medicine. More than 50% of these departments work with locums. There are couple of reasons for the shortage of physicians. The consequences in anaesthesiology and intensive care medicine can result in qualitative and financial loss. To solve the shortage of physicians one has to solve the reasons. Main reasons are increasing feminization of medical profession and part-time-work, work-life-balance and a poor specialised education.","886":"The rupture of a catheter near the spine is rare. There are no evidence-based guidelines for diagnosis and therapy. Opinions derived from German anesthesiologists, neurosurgeons, orthopaedics and trauma surgeons are: Infants should have immediate surgery. In an asymptomatic adult, the catheter fragment does not require removal surgery. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not necessary. If symptomatic, the catheter fragment should be localized by a thin slice computed tomography or fluoroscopy. Otherwise surgical exploration is indicated. Direct surgery is recommended for cases with neurological symptoms, infections, loss of spinal fluid, pain and local discomfort. Relative indications for surgery are severe pain, tissue infection and intrathecal localization of the fragment. Surgery should be performed in prone position and under general anesthesia. Starting at the entry wound, the surgical access should be microsurgical and preferably by a neurosurgeon. If the entry is not detectable, a midline incision is suggested.","887":"Epidural analgesia is regarded as gold standard after major abdominal or thoracic surgery in combination with general anaesthesia. Apart from well documented positive effects of epidural analgesia on the postoperative period, evidence for the incidence of neurologic complications is less clear. Complications include direct spinal cord damage during epidural puncture, epidural hematoma, abscesses or meningitis. The review article gives an overview about current data on neurologic complications related to epidural analgesia and shows feasibility of prevention and early detection. Furthermore a therapeutic approach in case of a neurologic incident will be demonstrated.","888":"Permanent nerve injury as a complication of peripheral regional anaesthesia is fortunately rare with an estimated incidence of 0,03%. However, transient neurological symptoms are more frequent with an occurrence of 3-8%. The pathophysiology and etiology of nerve injury depends on a number of different factors. The needle-nerve trauma, cytotoxicity of local anaesthetics, patient factors (i.e. morbidity) and factors which are related to surgical interventions should be considered. Regarding pathophysiology, trauma-related inflammation should be acknowledged as an important interference during nerve recovery. Needle-nerve contacts, nerve perforation and local cytotoxicity of local anaesthetics should be reduced to a minimum by application of nerve stimulation, ultrasound and an adequate dosage of local anaesthetics with less locotoxicity.","889":"Persistent nerve injuries in context of peripheral nerve blocks are uncommon. Previous surveys and prospectively designed studies have specified neurological dysfunctions in different ways, which may cause the variability of data about incidence; so it has to be reckoned with about 5% after 1 week, 1% after 1 month and 0,01% after 6 months. Amongst the different locations interscalene blocks with their associated surgical procedures seem to have the highest incidence. Establishing the correlation between disabilities and the performed block technique often constitutes difficulties, especially when other reasons like patient positioning techniques, tractions, ischemia and surgery related nerve injuries have to be considered. Dysfunctions manifest as numbness, parasthesia, tingling sensation and\/or amyasthenia. Fortunately long-term lesions, caused by nerve blocks are a rarity.","890":"","891":"Immediately after emergency caesarean section a 37 yr old patient suffered severe atonic bleeding requiring different operating procedures (Clipping of the uterine arteries) in combination with an uterotonic and haemostaseological medication as well as massive transfusion of blood components and recombinant factor VIIa. After a period of 17 days without any bleeding the patient presented to the emergency room with recurrent massive uterine bleeding. Transarterial embolization of the anterior bundles of the iliac arteries in combination with a second uterotonic and haemostaseological medication stopped the haemorrhage. Reasons and risk factors of a recurrent postpartum bleeding are discussed and a multidisciplinary algorithm for treatment is proposed.","892":"The use of muscle relaxants facilitates endotracheal intubation and ameliorates the conditions of surgery. But, their use should be controlled - otherwise there will be postoperative residual curarisation which can lead to patient discomfort up to severe medical complications. Therefore, an appropriate surveillance via objective neuromuscular monitoring is essential. This article gives a review of the basic principles of muscle relaxants, their clinical application and the surveillance of their effects and degradation.","893":"","894":"Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have become available for prevention of venous thromboembolism after major orthopaedic surgery, treatment of venous thromboembolism, and stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation. The thrombin inhibitor Dabigatran has a plasma half life of 11-14 hours which prolongs significantly in renal insufficiency. The two Xa-inhibitors Rivaroxaban and Apixaban have slightly shorter half lifes, and renal elimination is confined to about 30% of active drug. Prior to elective surgery, drug intake needs to be halted. The time period depends on the actual drug half life in that particular situation. Bridging anticoagulation is not necessary. The management of bleeding complications does not differ from that in other anticoagulants. The most uncertainties in clinical practice will arise from the fact that NOACs derange the global clotting tests without any conclusive information about the actual intensity of anticoagulation.","895":"Critical care patients have to be considered at high risk patients for thromboembolic events. The recommendations and guidelines support strongly a pharmacologic anticoagulant prophylaxis. Due to the fact that only very few data are available for this selected patient population there are still open questions concerning the ideal choice of drug and optimal dosages. Prophylactic administration of UFH, LMWH and Fondaparinux can be used safely and effectively. In case of acutely suspected or diagnosed HIT type II Argatroban seems to be a reasonable choice for anticoagulation. The new orally available anticoagulant drugs are not yet indicated in ICU patients.","896":"Aspirin and thienopyridines are the mainstay of platelet aggregation inhibition in patients with acute coronary syndromes and patients receiving coronary artery stents. After elective coronary artery stenting, they are prescribed for up to 3 months after bare metall stents and for at least 12 months after drug-eluting stents, thereby significantly reducing the risk of acute stent thrombosis. During this time period, patients should not undergo elective surgery. However, they may present with surgically amenable diseases that do not allow further delay. In these cases a careful risk-benefit analysis is required to elucidate the risk of major surgical bleeding versus the risk of major cardiovascular events with aspirin to be continued throughout the perioperative period. Current evidence does not suggest to use platelet function tests to guide therapy under these circumstances. If major bleeding occurs under dual platelet aggregation inhibition, the most appropriate interventions are antifibrinolytics such as tranexamic acid and transfusion of platelets to counteract the platelet aggregation inhibitory effects.","897":"","898":null,"899":"In the last 5 years the use of cuffed tracheal tubes in infants and children has become popular worldwide and is accepted by major medical authorities. The advantages of cuffed tracheal tubes in smaller children - in particular the almost 100% chance to insert the right sized tracheal tube at the first attempt and their reliable sealing characteristics within the trachea - makes tracheal intubation and ventilation considerable easier and safer. This certainly compensates for the higher cost of cuffed compared to uncuffed tracheal tubes. The fear that cuffed tracheal tubes cause increased laryngeal damage in small children could not be confirmed, if adequately designed, cuffed tracheal tubes are correctly used. Conditions for the safe use of cuffed tubes in children are the availability of an adequately designed cuffed tube with a proofed recommendation for tube size selection and cuff pressure monitoring. The following rules must be fulfiled when cuffed tubes in children using are: confirmation of an air leak &lt; 20 cmH2O inspiratory pressure with the cuff not inflated, cuff pressure limitation at 20 cmH2O and the avoidance of negative cuff pressures, resulting in sharp, cutting edges of the cuff membrane within the trachea.","900":null,"901":"This two part article \"Mental disorders in intensive care medicine\" aims to give an understanding of the most frequent mental disorders in critical care medicine.

The assistance to the family members of a potential donor in forefront of transplantation is as much important as to maintain donor organ function. Caring for a brain dead potential organ donor is therefore major challenge for nurses and physicians.The pathophysiological changes following brain death entail a high incidence of complications including hemodynamic instability, endocrine and metabolic disturbances, that jeopardize potentially transplantable organs. The knowledge of the complex physiologic changes is crucial to the development of effective donor management strategies.The management of potential organ donors is similar to the management of patients with severe sepsis. The main goal of that treatment is to achieve hemodynamic stability as well as the normalization of endocrine and metabolic disturbances. Donor optimization leads to increased organ procurement and contributes to improved organ function in the recipient.","904":null,"905":"More than 17000 patients currently live in Germany who have had organ transplants. The implications of this for the anaesthetists are that they are very likely to be confronted by such a patient at some point during their active career. Besides the preoperative assessment which includes that of the function of the transplanted organ, appropriate immunosuppression poses a particular challenge. Close collaboration with both patients and their transplant specialists is essential to preempt the perioperative consequences and plan continuation of immunosuppression. Strictly aseptic measures are mandatory as well as detailed evaluation of the risk-benefit balance of all invasive procedures.There are no significant differences between the anaesthetic approaches and agents in transplant and non-transplant patients. However, in the latter group, homeostasis of all organ systems should be more focused on.","906":"","907":"","908":"Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is a well established tool in cardiology and cardiosurgery. The rapid availability of TTE, combined with high quality and quantity of diagnostic messages, provides the user an interesting option in the area of anesthesia and intensive care medicine. The presenting case reports describe the importance and possibilities of transthoracic echocardiography for anaesthetists in the non-cardiosurgical area.","909":"This two-part article on mental disorders in intensive care medicine aims to provide an understanding of the most frequent mental disorders in critical care medicine. Part 1 highlights the basic principles, disturbances and diagnostics and part 2 deals with prevention and therapeutic approaches. The most frequent mental disorders in the intensive care unit are delirium, substance abuse or, respectively, intoxication, suicide attempts, anxiety disorders, depression or psychosis. Mental disorders may be the reason for admission or can develop in the course of intensive care treatment, such as, for example, a post-traumatic stress disorder. The consequences thereof include increased morbidity, mortality, and duration of hospitalization. The early participation of a psychiatrist in the diagnostic process is to be recommended.","910":"End-of-life decisions (EOLD) are frequently used in patients who die in the intensive care unit. The decision to limit life support and the extent of limitation depends on the nature of the disease, its progress and the presumed prognosis and, equally important, the patient's preferences. These preferences should be stated by the patient if he or she is able to do so. If not, the patient's assumed will can be elicited by using written advance directives or with the help of surrogate decision makers.Primarily withholding life-sustaining treatment is reasonable in patients who present with an endstage, irreversibly progressive disease or if the patient explicitly rejects intensive care treatment.Limiting the extent of intensive care medicine by withholding specific procedures (e.g. resuscitation) should be discussed in critically ill patients whose prognosis would become futile with an additional serious medical problem.Withdrawing life-sustaining treatment and changing to palliative care should be considered if intensive care medicine is futile because of the severity of the patient's condition.It is vital to find an interdisciplinary consensus about EOLD within the medical team as well as with the patient\/surrogate decision maker. The agreement is documented in the patient's chart.","911":"","912":"The benefit of the pulmonary-artery catheter (PAC) is a matter of discussion since years. The development of alternative monitoring techniques especially for measurement of volume parameters has decreased routine use of the PAC. Several investigations verified advantages of therapy attempting to optimize circulation parameters regardless of the used technique. Nonetheless, patients with a higher peri-operative risk, especially in cardiovascular surgery, may benefit from PAC monitoring intra- or postoperatively.The concerns about the available monitoring techniques bear mainly on the fear being too invasive. Up to now, there is no technique complying with all requirements of an ideal monitoring system.","913":"The variety of minimally invasive cardiac output (CO) monitoring devices is growing rendering it difficult to keep track of new developments. In this article technical principles, limitations and validation procedures considering new aspects are reviewed. An integrated approach for their use is proposed since no single device can comply with all clinical needs. CO should be interpreted in combination with clinical information and other hemodynamic parameters. It's evident that not the monitor per se, but only the protocol \/ therapy based on the hemodynamic data can improve patients outcome.","914":"Advanced haemodynamic monitoring provides information on blood flow, volume status, and oxygen supply to demand ratio. Together with related therapeutic algorithms these variables can be used to optimize cardiac preload and oxygen delivery in the perioperative period. There is increasing evidence that a goal-directed therapy can improve perioperative outcome. In this review we will briefly describe different target variables and their relevance for the haemodynamic optimization of high-risk surgical patients.","915":"","916":"In the emergency medicine field cases of intoxication by sniffing agents do not occur very often. Nevertheless, considering the easy availability of butane the option of abuse especially by adolescent persons cannot be ignored. Although many cases of accidental death caused by malignant arrhythmia are described (\"Sudden sniffing death syndrome\"), suicide attempts using butane are a rarity. In this case the emergency treatment has to allow for special pathophysiological changes explained by physicochemical characteristics of butane. The following case report describes the symptomatology and pre-hospital treatment of an intoxication by butane with a suicidal intention.","917":"Process optimization offers the opportunity to improve the quality and efficiency of medical care. Various approaches are possible in a pre-, peri- and postoperative care setting: It is almost always possible to prepare the children for surgery on an outpatient basis. This allows for hospital admission the same day or the evening before the procedure. But a schedule needs to be established that includes a certain leeway for admission and preoperative fasting in order to cater for a flexible response to delays or cancelations on the surgical list. An efficient use of theatre time can only be assured if several anesthetists can work in parallel. This applies in particular to complex anesthetic inductions. Sufficient staff and facilities are a prerequisite for this. The use of ultrasound for vascular access and regional anesthesia raises the success rate and saves time. In the postoperative period good analgesia with a fixed therapeutic regime, immediate postoperative feeding and mobilization improve the care.","918":"","919":"","920":"","921":"Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) in various brain diseases has for long time been treated according to guidelines for traumatic brain injury. First data of randomized study reveal, that specific treatment options like decompressive craniectomy, hyperosmotic agents, hyperventilation, hypothermia and steroids should have specific indications to control elevated ICP in future. In general, optimal ICP-treatment should also target sufficient cerebral perfusion and oxygenation.","922":"Managing patients after severe traumatic brain injury and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is a challenging task of modern intensive care. Most patients do require sedation for mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress or treatment of increased intracranial pressure. Besides standard ICP monitoring, a variety of continuous monitoring technologies for bedside use exists. The paper discusses the 5 methods most frequently used and their significance for multimodal neuromonitoring.","923":"Increased intracranial pressure can be the result of different intracranial pathologies. Sustained intracranial pressure above 20-25 mmHg may cause secondary brain injury by impaired cerebral perfusion or direct pressure with neuronal injury, with in consequence deterioration of neurological outcome. A main cause of critically increased intracranial pressure is traumatic brain injury. Most treatment strategies for increased intracranial pressure were developed and studied on these patients. Most of them were transferred to other pathologies with increased intracranial pressure.Treatment is based on general measures, which can be escalated for medical and surgical options in case of failure to sufficiently decrease intracranial pressure below the established threshold. Despite its enormous medical and socio-economical relevance, the evidence for most treatment strategies of intracranial hypertension, though published in guidelines, is weak.","924":"","925":"","926":"A 69-year-old woman reported that underwent endonasal frontal sinus surgery under general anesthesia. In her medical history the patient reports a multiple occurrence of angina pectoris attacks, especially in stressful situations. Coronary heart disease has so far been excluded. At preoperative presentation of this patient was in good general and nutritional state. Intraoperative hypotension had to be treated with norepinephrine. In the recovery room, the patient developed angina pectoris symptoms and the ECG showed T negativity. The patient was admitted on an ICU. Coronary angiography showed left ventricular apical ballooning with a transient akinesia typical of the left ventricle, as is seen in a Tako-Tsubo syndrome. The symptoms are similar to acute coronary artery disease, but without stenosis of coronary arteries. Physical or emotional stress is known to trigger Tako-Tsubo Syndrome, but the exact etiology or pathophysiology remains somewhat unclear.","927":"Resolute and rapid action in obstetric emergencies is essential for the child and\/or maternal survival. Therefore emergency caesarean section and the emergency actions for peripartal haemorrhage, shoulder dystocia, fetal bradycardia, hypertension and embolism should be interdisciplinarily coordinated. Interdisciplinary emergency concepts for the major complications could help to optimise their therapy taking structural conditions and legal requirements into account. Emergency concepts should include the alarm- procedure, communication, logistics, the priority steps in therapy as well as the analysis of the passed obstetric emergency. A regular interdisciplinary training of the major obstetric emergencies may help to avoid unnecessary loss of time.","928":"Extensive space occupying strokes occur in about 1-10% of all ischaemic supratentorial infarctions. Both the high mortality and morbidity primarily result from secondary brain damage due to an accompanying brain edema. Therefore, the primary therapeutic target in patients with space occupying strokes is the control of the brain edema and the consecutively elevated intracranial pressure. If intracranial pressure cannot be controlled by conservative treatment methods, a decompressive craniectomy (DC) is a possible treatment option in selected patients to reduce intracranial pressure. In this review recommendations from the surgeon's perspective are given concerning the indication and timing of DC in patients with space occupying supra- and infratentorial cerebral infarctions.","929":"Anesthesiologists and Critical Care Physicians are confronted with the differential diagnoses of dyspnea, complications of mechanical ventilation or rapid assessment of trauma patients on a nearly daily basis. This requires the timely diagnosis or exclusion of a wide variety of disease processes including pleura effusion, pneumonia, pneumothorax as well as thoracical or abdominal bleeding. Furthermore, the anaesthesiologist or intensivist often makes decisions leading to invasive procedures like thoracentesis or percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy. Bedside ultrasound as the \"visual stethoscope\" of the acute care physician offers an alternative to other imaging modalities like X-ray and CAT scan and can reduce associated high-risk transportation of mechanically ventilated patients. In this article, we introduce a new training module based on the DGAI curriculum.","930":"In medical systems, economic issues and means of action are in the course of dwindling human (physicians and nurses) and financial resources are more important. For this reason, physicians must understand basic economic principles. Only in this way, there may be medical autonomy from social systems and hospital administrators. The current work is an approach to present a model for strategic planning of an anesthesia department. For this, a \"strengths\", \"weaknesses\", \"opportunities\", and \"threats\" (SWOT) analysis is used. This display is an example of an exemplary anaesthetic department.","931":"The use of ultrasonography in perioperative medicine has developed rapidly within the last decade. Today ultrasonic techniques are established methods for peripheral and central venous access as well as for regional anaesthesia. However, transthoracic ultrasonography by non-cardiologists has not yet been routinely established perioperatively, in intensive care medicine or in emergency medicine. With the current module 4: Cardiosonography of the DGAI-certified seminar series in Anaesthesia Focussed Sonography (AFS) it is intended to provide a basis for a quality assured training and implementation of transthoracic sonography in anaesthesia, intensive care medicine and emergency medicine.","932":"Modul 2 will provide the theory and practical training of the sonographically guided puncture of central and peripheral veins and arteries. In doing so patients of all age groups are taken into consideration. Combined with the content of the other modules this series of workshops, which was initiated by our society, might be a first step in defining a new core competency of our specialty. The confident use of ultrasound in vascular puncture sharpens our dedicated professional competence and will contribute to continuously improve the quality and safety of anaesthesiologic patient care.","933":"","934":"Invasive infections through to sepsis caused by fungi in intensive care units have increased markedly in the past few years. In the mean time almost every tenth case of sepsis in the intensive care unit is the result of an invasive fungal infection. Not only hemato-oncological or organ-transplanted patients are affected but increasingly also those patients who have been under intensive care for a considerable time and who exhibit particular risk factors. The lethality among the afflicted patients is high. The diagnosis of fungal infections is still difficult; unambiguous, highly sensitive and specific test procedures are still lacking. The decision for therapy must often be made empirically and as early as possible. In the past few years newly developed antimycotic agents have opened up new options for therapy.","935":"Identification of the right puncture site and the target structures are mandatory in performing nerve blocks. Ultrasound is a new method, that visualizes target structures as well as the injection and spread of local anaesthetic solution. The presented module 3 neurosonography is part of the didactic concept \"anaesthesiology focussed sonography\" developed by the german society of anaesthesiology and intensive care. It contains all essential nerve blocks of the upper and lower limb. Additionally the structural requirements to provide the course are included.","936":"Understanding the principles of wave physics paves the way for appropriate utilization and interpretation of sonography. In module 1 of the course series \"Anesthesia Focused Sonography\", the course participants will learn by lectures and practical training, how ultrasonic waves emerge, how they travel in human tissue, and how a picture is generated from their echo signals. Furthermore, the technology of an ultrasound system and the development of artifacts will be demonstrated; moreover, the Doppler effect and its implementation into current sonographic procedures will be presented as a central theme.","937":null,"938":"Acute respiratory insufficiency due to obstructive pulmonary diseases is a common problem presenting to the emergency medical service. Most frequent causes are acute asthma attacks or acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The preclinical differentiation of both diseases may be difficult, so that the diagnosis is often made by precise anamnesis. This article reviews the prehospital management of asthma and COPD, including pharmacological options and techniques of mechanical ventilatory support (non-invasive vs. invasive).","939":"Acute right heart failure (RHF) is a frequent and severe complication during perioperative and intensive care treatment in intensive care units (ICUs). The most common causes are pulmonary hypertension, left heart failure, pulmonary embolism, sepsis, acute lung injury (ALI) and thoracosurgical procedures. Acute RHF is not only a major contributor to morbidity and mortality; it also influences efficacy and outcome of routinely performed procedures, such as vasopressors, in critically ill patients. In contrast to the left ventricle, the right ventricle's physiology and pathophysiology are understudied, and the diagnosis of acute RHF is frequently challenging. Although many drugs are available for the treatment of RHF, randomized trials for this setting are still missing. This article gives an overview of aetiology and pathogenesis of RHF and reviews the diagnostic and therapeutic interventions currently available for providers in anaesthesiology and critical care.","940":"At present, providers at an Anesthesia Preoperative Evaluation Clinic (APEC) may have difficulties in gaining access to relevant clinical information, including external medical records, surgical dictations etc. This common occurence makes obtaining an informed consent by the patient after a complete pre-anesthetic assessment difficult. This form of patient information is subject to wide interindividual variations and, thus, represents a challenge for quality assurance. Insufficient or not completed pre-anesthetic assessments can lead to an untimely termination of an elective procedure.A web-based pre-anesthetic evaluation record moves the time point of the first contact to well before the day of admission. The current pre-anesthesia evaluation record is replaced by a structured interview in the form of a complex of questions in a specific hierarchy taking guidelines, standard operating procedures (SOP) and evidence-based medicine (EBM) into consideration. The answers to the complex of questions are then classified according to agreed criteria and possible scoring systems of relevant classifications. The endpoints result in procedural recommendations not only for the informing anesthesiologist but also for the patient. The standardized risk criteria can be used as core process indicators to check the process quality of the anesthesiological risk evaluation. Short-notice cancellations of elective operations due to incomplete premedication procedures will then be avoided with the help of such structured and evidence-based patient interviews with detailed assessment of the anesthesiological risk profile.The web-based anesthesia evaluation record (WAR) corresponds with the recommendations of the DGAI to carry out the staged information in analogy to the staged information of Weissauer. The basic practice is not changed by WACH. By means of WACH, the time point of the first contact with anesthesia is moved forward and occurs within a different framework. WACH has potential advantages for both patient and anesthesiologist, not least due to a higher patient safety.","941":"In light of the hazard of healthcare associated infection (HAI) and pandemic increase of multiresistant pathogens the prevention and control of HAI by implementing infection control strategies in a structured and systemic manner are becoming increasingly important in order to assure patient safety.A well balanced implementation of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention in the format of a multibarrier concept together with surveillance of outcome measures are critical elements for a good hygiene practice. Criteria for structure-quality are optimal planned facility interieur supporting the clinical work-flow, adequate staffing of infection control practitioners and nurses, management of processes supporting infection prevention measures together with facility specific SOPs, and Surveillance and monitoring of the outcome together with feed-back to staff. Finally, any healthcare facility must be prepared for acute crisis such as outbreak management or management of critical incidences related to HAIs.","942":"Perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis (AMP) is an important but not the only procedure to prevent surgical site infections. The effectiveness of AMP to prevent surgical site infections has been proven in numerous studies during the last decades and is part of national and international guidelines. The choice of the antibiotic as well as the duration, time point and mode of application strongly impact on the effectiveness of the prophylaxis. This article provides an overview on recommended antibiotics for AMP and their activity against the expected bacterial pathogens in elective surgery. Furthermore, the current spectrum of microorganisms most frequently isolated from surgical site infections and alternative antibiotic strategies are discussed.","943":"Surgical site infections are the second or third most common type of nosocomial infections in Germany. For hospitals an annual incidence of 130000-160000 cases is estimated. Microbiological findings basically depend on type of surgery and wound location. A variety of risk factors is known. Discrimination of avoidable and unavoidable risk factors is the key for prevention. Most important points in prevention are perioperative prophylaxis with antibiotics 30-60 minutes prior to incision and strict asepsis in the operation room. Clinical findings include a variety of symptoms. They can be assigned to an early course or a definitive infection. However, wound scores are better applicable when comparing clinical studies. The most important therapeutic procedure is clearing the source of infection. Subsequently the wound can be closed by secondary intention or lead to open wound healing. An accompanying therapy with antibiotics is recommendable in case of advanced local or systemic infection. To document wounds is an essential part of treating wounds.","944":"","945":"This article reports about the perioperative disposition of an intraosseous (IO) needle on a 15 days old critically ill premature infant (weight 1300g) in line with an urgent surgery and sole possible vascular access on circulation insufficiency.Due to vital danger there was perioperatively no time to place a large-bore vascular access in addition to the 2 lying 28G-submerging venous catheters with a minimal flow rate. Because it was not possible to set a secure vascular access in several attempts - with generalised oedema and anasarca -, after having interrupted the surgery, the sole possibility was to dispose an IO needle in the range of the tibia.It was obvious, that a puncture of very small and weak bones is difficult and that a secure bone marrow puncture on infants beyond the weight category of 3 kg declared by the producer can be hard. Anyhow in case of emergency, an attempt is reasonable and useful, the effect after the application on the whole circulation situation was considerably verifiable.","946":"Preoprative Anaemia is an independent risk factor in perioperative medicine. Furthermore, preoperative anaemia is associated with higher treatment costs and remains the main risk factor for the transfusion of packed red blood cells. However, transfusion of packed red blood cells is although life-saving in conditions of acute anaemia associated with higher mortality, morbidity and postoperative complications. The preoperative treatment of anaemia has been shown to improve postoperative outcome and transfusion requirements. Treatment of anemia as one pillar of patient blood management bears the potential to reduce costs to the national health system by prevention of complications and transfusion-associated morbidity. The economic impact of the treatment of preoperative anaemia versus the treatment with blood products requires prospective evaluation.","947":"Most of the female consumers of legal and illegal substances are of childbearing age. Occasional use, use disorder and addiction commonly devolve into each other. A lot of young women quit consuming when planning a family or at the latest with the knowledge of pregnancy. The ongoing substance abuse during pregnancy requires a coordinated interdisciplinary collaboration for a sufficient care of these highly complex and individual cases.","948":"","949":"The editorial board of AINS requests the retraction of the named article, as the studie has no IRB-approval.","950":"","951":"Invasive airway management techniques are still challenging even for skilled anesthesiologists, intensivists and emergency physicians. All current percutaneous tracheostomy techniques are based on Seldinger's principle. Using the recent introduced Blue Dolphin Kit is feasible and safe, but without clear advantage compared to other kits. There is no data available to generally support performing early (&lt;8 days) tracheostomy in intensive care patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Experimental data show promising results of supporting expiration through a small bore catheter using ejectors based on Bernoulli's principle in terms of minimizing risk of barotrauma during emergency transtracheal high frequency jet ventilation.","952":"Supraglottic airway devices are developed with increasing frequency following the overwhelming success of the laryngeal mask airway (LMA). In contrast to the first generation devices such as the 'classic' LMA and the laryngeal tube second generation devices usually offer an oesophageal drainage tube and\/or an improved oropharyngeal leak pressure during positive pressure ventilation such as the laryngeal mask ProSeal and the laryngeal tube S. Recently the disposable versions of these supraglottic airway devices and the novel I-Gel mask have gained increasing interest. Both the LMA and the PLMA have been shown to be perfectly suitable for routine anaesthesia and emergency airway management. While the lacking protection against aspiration is still considered a major limitation of the LMA, the value of airway devices with an oesophageal drainage tube in this respect remains untermined at present.","953":"Endotracheal intubation remains the \"goldstandard\" in airway management. If with use of conventional techniques intubation of the patient fails, or if an anticipated difficult airway is present, video-assisted techniques may help to increase intubation success. Video-assisted techniques give the possibility to indirectly visualise the laryngeal structures with fibreoptical or camerachip-technique, and to display the videopicture on an external or integrated monitor. For the anticipated difficult airway, awake flexible fibreoptical intubation still is the first choice. However, if Oxygenation and Ventilation can be established with bag-mask ventilation or supraglottic airways, the use of an endoscopic optical stylet or a videolaryngoscope may be alternatives. If the algorithm for the unanticipated difficult airway can be safely administered, the latter techniques may also be used as emergency intubation devices.","954":"","955":"In 2009 the Commission for Hospital Hygiene and Prevention of Infections (CHHPI) at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) published recommendations on the personnel and organisational prerequisites for the prevention of nosocomial infections. Emphasis was placed on the tasks of all members of professional groups who belong to or work closely with a team of hygiene specialists in an institution for outpatient or inpatient medical care. Since these recommendations have not yet been adequately implemented and because of the repeated occurrence of hygiene deficits in the health-care services the legislature has been forced to pass a new law on hospital hygiene. This law requires the managers of hospitals and other medical facilities to avoid nosocomial infections and to abide by the recommendations of CHHPI and RKI. The already existing shortage of hygiene specialists, and especially of hospital hygiene specialists, is thereby further intensified. Thus there are initiatives to provide physicians working in hospitals with further training in hygiene so that they can take over the functions of a hospital hygiene specialist.","956":"","957":null,"958":"Patients who suffer from a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are ventilated longer, stay longer in the ICU and in hospital and therefore lead to higher costs. Despite the therapeutic potential of the VAP nowadays there is about 10% additional mortality observed. Although the clinical VAP diagnosis is limited (sensitivity\/specificity) rapid diagnosis promotes treatment (calculated antibiotic therapy) and improves the survival rate. And in the course the review of the VAP diagnosis of unnecessary antibiotics reduces the resistance development in that area and also the selection pressure.","959":"Since the first description of spinal and epidural anaesthesia, postdural puncture headache (PDPH) is a well known complication. Its prophylaxis and treatment has been studied and discussed for more than 100 years, but the evidence is still limited. Due to relatively low prevalence of PDPH, prospective RCTs are often missing, and the frequently self-limiting character of PDPH impedes an adequate interpretation of results from studies without a control group. Taking side effects and complications into account, a prophylactic treatment of PDPH cannot be recommended. In case of PDPH, non-opioid analgesics are the first choice treatment. The epidural blood patch remains the mainstay of severe PDPH therapy. Noninvasive therapies like theophylline, sumatriptan and ACTH can be an alternative. However, an evidence-based recommendation is lacking. The development of standard operating procedures for accidental dural punctures and PDPH is recommended.","960":"","961":"","962":"","963":"This review summarises the current (and controversial) topics in the field of anaesthesia and analgesia in obstetrics. In the British report \"Saving mothers' lives 2006-2008\" it is shown that the direct causes of maternal deaths are as before mainly sepsis, preeclampsia and eclampsia, thrombosis, thromboembolisms, and amniotic fluid embolism as well as haemorrhagic complications. Deaths associated with anaesthesia still involve airway complications. In the \"closed claims\" in U.S. American statistics, in the meantime ones finds maternal and perinatal deaths and brain damage to be less frequent whereas liability claims due to nerve damage and back pain have increased, presumably as a result of the change away from the use of general anaesthesia to the use of regional anaesthesia in obstetrics.","964":"Postpartum hemorrhage remains a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. The incidence of postpartum hemorrhage appears to be increasing in developed countries due to an increased number of placenta accreta or percreta after previous Cesarean deliveries. The initial therapy of postpartum hemorrhage consists of uterotonic drugs and inspection of the uterine cavum. At the same time, optimization of the clotting potential should be initiated early. Tranexamic acid may be considered as a first line choice, followed by fibrinogen if necessary. If bleeding continues, fresh frozen plasma and packed red cells should be ordered in a ratio of 1:1, as this ratio has been shown to improve survival in trauma victims. All labor and delivery suites should have standard operating procedures for the management of postpartum hemorrhage in place with regular drills.","965":"Successful resuscitation of newborn infants depends on adequate preparation, exact evaluation and prompt initiation of support according to the recently updated recommendations by trained personnel. The key step in postnatal adaptation is the initiation of breathing with a subsequent increase in pulmonary blood flow and pulmonary gas exchange. Therefore, in compromised newborn infants, adequate ventilation is the most important step in cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Ventilation should be initiated with room air in term infants and with low concentrations of supplemental oxygen in preterm infants. Subsequently, oxygen supplementation should always be guided by pulse oximetry. Chest compressions are only effective if adequate ventilation has been ensured. The compression ventilation ratio remains 3:1. The prevention of heat loss and maintaining a normal body temperature by adequate measures is an essential part of the care for healthy as well as asphyxiated infants. Therapeutic hypothermia should only be initiated after successful resuscitation and consultation with the regional neonatal intensive care unit.","966":"","967":"The editorial board of AINS requests the retraction of the named article, as the studie has no IRB-approval.","968":"The case of a young female patient with progressive chest trouble and dyspnea is reported. After development of a massive cerebral infarction, thrombolysis and afterwards decompressive craniectomy had to be performed. A patent foramen ovale (PFO) could be detected by transesophageal contrast-echocardiography accountable for a paradox embolism in existence with a deep vein thrombosis. The patient survived this situation but sustained persistent hemiparesis.","969":"Despite favorable conditions, in-hospital resuscitations do not lead to higher survival rates than those in the field. Recent studies show an average survival rate of 18%. One of the most important predictors for an unfavorable survival is a delay of defibrillation of greater than 2 minutes, which leads to a reduction of ROSC, 24-hour survival and survival to discharge. With respect to the guidelines of the European Resuscitation Council for cardiopulmonary resuscitation from 2010, track and trigger systems to detect the deteriorating patient should be used. Of note, the survival rate for in-hospital resuscitation is significantly lower over the weekend and at night than on workdays and during the day--most likely because fewer staff is available. More than 80% of patients with an unexpected cardiac arrest exhibit cardiopulmonary and neurological abnormalities prior to this event. A Medical Emergency Teams (MET) could intervene in such cases and thus decrease the likelihood of cardiac arrest. METs are more time-consuming and more labor-intensive than simple resuscitation teams, but these resources are well spent, as unexpected admissions to the intensive care unit can be avoided and patients receive treatment before their conditions deteriorate. Hospitals should therefore analyze and evaluate their internal emergency response plans.","970":"Patient blood management (PBM) is a patient-specific multidisciplinary, multimodal, evidence-based concept to appropriately conserve and manage a patient's own blood as a vital resource. PBM is based on 3 pillars: the first is the optimization of the patient's endogenous red cell mass, the second is the minimization of bleeding and blood loss and the third involves harnessing and optimizing the patient-specific physiological tolerance of anemia, including adopting more restrictive transfusion thresholds. PBM primarily identifies patients at risk of transfusion and provides a management plan aimed at reducing or eliminating the need for allogeneic transfusion, thus reducing the inherent risks, inventory pressures and the escalating costs associated with transfusion. PBM is applicable to surgical and medical patients. The application of PBM systematically reduces the impact of 3 major contributors to negative outcome: anemia, blood loss and transfusion.","971":"","972":"The growing number of patients suffering from severe congestive heart failure (HF) worldwide still means a challenge for the therapeutic options, mainly in the older population. According to the rapid development in the possibilities for mechanical circulatory support (MCS), the increasing use of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) as bridge to transplantation (BTT) or destination therapy (DT) reflects a change in the up-to-date therapy of HF. This article gives a broad overview concerning indications, patient selection, choice of the device and mainly a study update. It is clearly shown, that VAD therapy has become an effective tool in the treatment of HF, and that the modern continuous flow pumps have replaced the older, bulky, pulsatile devices, especially in the LVAD sector.","973":"Left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) have become an important option for the treatment of patients with advanced heart failure. Unfortunately, patients undergoing LVAD-implantation still experience considerable perioperative morbidity and mortality. Right ventricular failure, bleeding, infections and device-associated problems represent the major postoperative complications. The present overview summarizes current strategies for preoperative risk estimation and for the prevention and treatment of frequently occurring perioperative complications.","974":"Ventricular assist devices (VAD) to support the left (LVAD), the right (RVAD) or both ventricles (BVAD) have emerged as one standard of care for advanced heart failure patients. Initially used to bridge patients to transplantation (BTT) they are now more frequently implanted as permanent support (destination therapy, DT). Bridge to recovery (BTR) is a valid option for only a small number of patients. Although there are different devices available, patient selection, preoperative and intraoperative management, and the timing of VAD implantation are the elements critical to successful circulatory support.","975":"","976":"The currently valid guidelines for resuscitation of the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) do not give any unambiguous recommendations for \"transport with ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation\". Furthermore, up to now there are no generally accepted criteria for terminating cardiopulmonary resuscitation, apart from certain signs of death. In spite of the generally poor outcome of patients being transported with ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation, there are a number of positive case reports and undisputable indications (e.g., in cases with a potentially reversible cause of cardiac arrest). The increase observed over the past few years in the number of patients being transported under cardiopulmonary resuscitation has as yet not been reflected in an improved prognosis for these patients. The use of mechanical chest compression devices with a better quality of chest compression, also under transport conditions, may have an influence on the number transports but this has not yet been evaluated sufficiently with regard to patient outcome. However, the decision to transport a patient resides with the responsible emergency physician who has to evaluate the prognosis for the patient on an individual basis.","977":"Patient blood management (PBM) is a patient-specific multidisciplinary, multimodal, evidence-based concept to appropriately conserve and manage a patient's own blood as a vital resource.

Pathogenesis, clinical course, management and treatment of noma are described with the consequences for anaesthesia.","979":"The numbers of awake craniotomies performed worldwide are rising. The technique allows a maximum of brain tumor resection with a minimal risk of functional damage in patients, where the tumor is growing close to functional relevant brain areas. The maximal resection improves the long-term outcome of these patients. For the anaesthetist awake craniotomy can be challenging, because he misses the advantages of general anaesthesia (safe airway, suppressed reflexes), but has to deal with the added risks of brain mapping and cortical stimulation (induction of epileptic insults). After adequate patient selection and intense (psychological) preparation a careful anaesthesiologist will be able to accompany the patient throughout this procedure safe and comfortable. This article describes the anaesthesiological management at Erasmus MC, University Medical Centre Rotterdam, The Netherlands, in detail.","980":"At present, besides well-known financial problems, German hospitals are facing a serious lack of qualified medical staff. Given these facts, it is of great importance, especially in work load burdened disciplines, such as cardiovascular anaesthesiology, to retain highly qualified medical staff. Here, human resource development measures offer valuable tools for efficient retention management. Moreover, most of these are applicable to almost any clinical specialty. Surprisingly, financial aspects play a minor role in such concepts, in contrast to human resource development tools, such as mentoring, interviews, training and motivational activities. Especially, with regard to \"Generation Y\", an efficient retention management will play a key role to keep these physicians as hospital employees of long duration in the future.","981":"Post-operative pain management of elderly patients requires special attention. In addition to the organic functional impairments, age-related changes in psychological and social factors play an important role. Also life experiences, painful medical history and a range of different complaints of old age influence the expectations to the treatment of pain. Several factors have to be considered, so 1) age-appropriate preoperative assessment of organic, psychological and social factors, 2) a selection of regularly administered non-opioid, or combination of two different effective non-opioids, notably on the contra-indications and dose limits, 3) if necessary careful titration of the strong opioid with patient adjustment further doses in the recovery room (\"start low, go slow\"), 4) if necessary, supplement the non-opioid with a strong, not retarded opioid (subcutaneous or oral administration) on the ward, 5) restrictive indication for retarded opioids because of increased risk to fall and constipation, 6) more frequent control of side effects than for younger patients, 7) medical care with increased acceptance of autonomy, to allow trust to improve the often limited compliance and to achieve high patient satisfaction.","982":"Acute pain therapy in children can be achieved by numerous modalities: non-medicamentous supportive measures, regional and local anesthesia, systemic opioids, non-opioids and co-analgesics. The multimodal approach for prevention and therapy of acute pain in children helps minimizing side effects. A well-organized pediatric pain service based on transparent standard operating procedures seems to be essential for the successful treatment of pain in children.","983":"In the perioperative period acute pain is measured by one-dimensional scales concentrating on pain intensity. As part of a quality assurance procedure pain assessment is to be exercised during periods of rest and activity. Pain is a subjective experience. That is why self-report is the golden standard of pain assessment. Only in case self-report is not available due to mental development or to cognitive restraints, it has to be replaced by behavioural observation. Established scales are the visual analogue scale (VAS), the verbal rating scale (VRS), and the numerical rating scale (NRS) with a preference for the NRS. Scales that measure pain in children are the Faces-Pain-Scale and behavioural observation scales. The assessment of non verbal adults also has to rely on behavioural observation.","984":"","985":"The results of microbiological tests are the foundation for a targetted therapy and the basis for monitoring infections. The quality of each and every laboratory finding depends not only on an error-free analytical process. The pre-analysis handling procedures are of particular importance. They encompass all factors and influences prior to the actual analysis. These include the correct timepoint for sample taking, the packaging and the rapid transport of the material to be investigated. Errors in the pre-analytical processing are the most frequent reasons for inappropriate findings.","986":"The peripheral venous access remains the first-line method to administer drugs in emergency cases. The intraosseous injection, however, represents a good alternative in difficult situations. In this way the therapy-free period ? the \"no flow time\" ? and the preclinical rescue time are essentially minimised. The procedure is simple and quickly learnt, also no special features with regard to pharmacotherapy need to be observed. The low flow rate can mostly be compensated for by changing the treatment strategy. In principle, there are no absolute contraindications. The risks can be neglected in the acute emergency situation. Endobronchial and central venous routes for the administration of drugs have now lost their position in the primary preclinical management of emergency patients, except for a few exceptional circumstances.","987":"Diagnostic point of care testing based on thrombelastometry with the aim to fully understand the overall changes in global haemostasis during the perioperative phase is today performed in several operating theatres. Therapeutic measures are based on these laboratory results. Within the scope of a pro and contra outline of the journal this paper comment, why point of care diagnostic solely based on laboratory testing using the ROTEM is not recommendable. On the other hand the author values the thrombelastometry as a supplementary supportive method used directly by haemostasis specialists or in a tight cooperation with such skilled specialists.","988":null,"989":"Until a few years ago an interruption of breast-feeding for 12 or even 24 hours was recommended for breast-feeding mothers after anaesthesia, this is no longer valid. If it is the mother's wish, if she is sufficiently awake and physically able, there is no reason not to start breast-feeding a mature and healthy baby immediately after recovery from a general or regional anaesthesia. Even breast-feeding after a Caesarean delivery with administration of the common anaesthetics in the usual (single) doses is no longer considered to be a problem since the amount of the substance taken up from colostrum is vanishingly small in comparison to the amount that is transferred by transplacental routes. Neither the pharmacological properties of the drugs used in association with anaesthesia nor clinical experience justify an interruption of breast-feeding.","990":null,"991":"Metabolism and nutrition of the critical ill are dynamic parameters of the severe disease influencing the blood glucose concentration. After the finding of increased survival in an initial study in tight glucose control, further large multicenter trials could not show such a benefit and even an increased mortality has been found. Hyperglycemia may be a feature of the stress metabolism and is possibly an adaptive process. Next to the endogenous response, therapy with catecholamines and glucosteroids impacts the response to insulin and the glucose metabolism. Hypo- and hypercaloric nutrition also interact with the insulin therapy. Nutritional therapy should be adapted to the actual state of the patient avoiding hypercaloric feeding and an energy deficit. Using this framework, therapy with insulin may be used to achieve a targeted range of glucose avoiding an increased risk of hypoglycaemia.","992":"Hyperglycemia is a frequently observed phenomenon in critically ill patients, affecting numerous patients without a history of impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes. During critical illness, hyperglycemia may result from decreased peripheral glucose uptake and\/or utilisation in presence of normal or elevated plasma insulin levels (peripheral insulin resistance) as well as an increase in hepatic glucose production due to augmented glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis resulting from stress and\/or central (hepatic) insulin resistance. As there are a number of factors that cause or aggravate hyperglycemia \/ insulin resistance during the intensive care unit (ICU) stay, a multifactorial etiology is likely. Furthermore, animal models of sepsis suggest a decrease in anabolic insulin signalling within skeletal muscle.","993":"Overview on the perioperative metabolism of diabetic patients. The text provides important information for the clinician and summarises the evidence in the international literature. Important studies, background of the diabetic perioperative metabolism, patient screening, existing oral diabetes therapies and insulin regimes, differences between regional and general anesthesia, and important laboratory parameters are discussed. Oral antidiabetics used in Germany, different classes of insulins and possible regimes for the intraoperative management of insulin therapies and important aspects of the postoperative management are presented.","994":"Hyperglycemia and insulin resistance are frequently observed during critical illness. The underlying pathophysiology is not yet fully understood, although hyperglycemia predicts post-surgical morbidity and mortality. Apparently perioperative insulin resistance has a complex pathophysiology and tissue-specific differences have to be considered. Multiple causative factors and intracellular signalling pathways have been identified driving the development of systemic perioperative insulin resistance. This review will focus on mechanisms involving the classical insulin signalling cascade.","995":"","996":"Fearful patients are in emergency situation often inattentive, unable to concentrate, agitated or even aroused. They show reduced perception and restricted willingness to cooperate. In severe conditions these patients are strongly tending towards more hazardous behavior: refusal of necessary therapy, break out or even high suicidal risk. Within disaster situations (mass accidents, fires) fearful patients with their agitated and persuasive behavior can influence other victims and with that trigger a situation of mass panic that has to be avoided at any cost. Therefore these patients must be swiftly identified and separated from the event. A diligent diagnosis process including physical-neurological examination is necessary. The recommended treatment within the emergency situation consists of a close continuous personal contact through assuring and encouraging conversations. A sense of security should be created by explaining the planned therapeutic interventions in simple, easy-to-follow and understandable words. If this necessary psycho-therapeutic intervention can not be applied a short term psychopharmacological treatment is required preferably with Benzodiazepines. Still a longterm specific therapy is highly advised, since these disturbances, if left untreated, will lead to a chronic manifestation and with that to considerable psychosocial impairments.","997":"Total knee replacement improves mobility and quality of life in gonarthrosis. In 2004 more than 60.000 total knee arthroplasties were performed in Germany. Because of severe postoperative pain which can interfere with functional outcome and impair hospital discharge, effective postoperative analgesia is not only important for patient satisfaction but also for economic reasons. For the 1990(th) years femoral nerve blocks have become more popular leads back to lower risk of complications and equal quality of analgesia compared to neuroaxial blockades. The prevention of \"tourniquet pain\" as well as treatment of hemodynamic and respiratory failure in the context of pulmonary embolic events and tourniquet deflation is part of anesthesiologic challenge.","998":"","999":"Central venous catheterization and arterial catheterization are common procedures performed perioperatively by anesthetists. The traditional technique of locating surface landmarks was used to assist in vascular access. In patients with anatomical variants or pathological vessel changes it could be difficult or impossible to succeed with this traditional approach. Ultrasound-guided vascular access can improve patient safety in adults and children. Surrounding anatomical structures are visualized and the needle is advanced under continuous observation. Complications can be reduced and success improved. It is mandatory to offer an appropriate ultrasound training programs for physicians using this technique. This article summarizes the literature and describes a practical method of ultrasound-guided vascular access.","1000":"Ultrasonography has developed as an indispensable and highly versatil tool in the diagnosis and treatment of critically ill patients. Nowadays intensive care medicine without the use of ultrasound is hard to imagine. The advantages of ultrasound are instantaneous availability at the bedside and high diagnostic output especially in life-threatening situations. This article focuses on special applications of ultrasound in the intensive care unit: echocardiography, transcranial Doppler sonography, abdominal ultrasonography and the imaging of pleura and lung. Furthermore, the use of ultrasound to guide interventions is discussed.","1001":"The ultrasound in regional anesthesia is gaining currency. Of fundamental importance for a successful blockade is not only the direct process. Many decisions taken in advance, have enormous impact on the quality of implementation. The aim of this article is about the current state of knowledge on implementing instructions of the risk stratification, hygiene, choice of the needle, the training and the sequence concerning ultrasound regional anesthesia. There are pitfalls and presented important conditions for successful work with this method.","1002":"","1003":"Rescue helicopters are used for emergency care and transport of emergency patients. The dimension of the cabin is clearly limited. A transport is carried out under spatial narrowness and high noise levels. Acoustic alarms or noises caused by the patient are hardly to be perceived, so that the view at optical alarms is necessary. Environmental conditions affect the concentration on the patient. Rearrangement maneuvers represent the most critical phases. Always the whole apparative monitoring and respirator must be in the field of view of the emergency doctor, drugs to the care must be handy to be quickly administered, the quantity of oxygen has to be observed. Infusions and option of airway management are ready to set in advance. Standardized work with the aid of algorithms and knowledge of treatment recommendations and guidelines help to prevent errors. To optimize the care of emergency patients, special training courses for the crew of rescue helicopters are offered. A training simulator to practice different scenarios and the establishment of a CIRS system are recommended.","1004":"The aim was to update recommendations concerning the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) for German speaking countries. An expert panel produced evidence-based, consented statements graded according to the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN). Relevant risk factors for PONV include female gender, non-smoking status, history of PONV, history of motion sickness, use of intra- and postoperative opioids, volatile anesthetics and nitrous oxide. PONV scoring systems allow for an approximative risk assessment as a basis for a risk adapted approach. Since a risk-adapted prophylaxis vs. a risk-independent, fixed (combined) prophylaxis has not yet proven superior and because of inherent limitations of PONV scoring systems a fixed prophylaxis may be favourable. Regardless of the strategy for prophylaxis of PONV, high risk patients must be given a multimodal prophylaxis by avoiding known risk factors and applying multiple validated and effective antiemetic interventions. In the case of PONV immediate treatment is indicated due to its relevance for patients as well as the economic and medicolegal implications PONV may have. Given the impact of PONV on patient satisfaction and the availability of effective and safe measures to prevent and treat PONV, further efforts should be taken to actually implement present evidence in order to improve patient?s outcome following surgical procedures. ","1005":"","1006":"","1007":"Constipation, nausea and sickness are frequent accessory symptoms in patients suffering from chronic pain. Typical causes are the underlying disease and the medical treatment against chronic pain. Most often opioid treatment induces an enteric dysfunction syndrome with constipation as a leading symptom and, especially in the initial phase, nausea due to direct stimulation of central structures. Therefore prophylactic and therapeutic strategies should be determined routinely and additionally, in special cases, different reserve measures might be applied.","1008":"Common recommendations for the treatment of acute exacerbations of non-malignant chronic pain (e.g. migraine, trigeminal neuralgia, cluster headache or chronic pancreatitis) are often not adequate to provide sufficient analgesia. Specific recommendations based on the underlying disease mechanisms are usually more likely to offer efficacious treatment algorithms. In the case of migraine, triptanes represent an option to improve analgesia if NSARs fail, and in cluster headache triptanes and especially inhalation of oxygen have been proven to be the most effective measures. German guidelines recommend intravenous procaine, besides pethidine and buprenorphine, for the management of acute exacerbations of chronic pancreatitis. The objective of this survey is to provide recommendations for the treatment of acutely exacerbated pain states on the basis of international guidelines. The authors place particular emphasis on parenteral drug administration to achieve a rapid onset of action.","1009":"Patients used to opioids belong to 2 groups: patients under opioid therapy due to tumor pain or chronic non malignant pain and, second, opioid addicts with current uncontrolled abuse, under substitution therapy or former opioid addicts (\"clean\"). Perioperatively these patients are difficult to manage because of the complex medical as well as psychosocial factors. Despite these problems, these patients have a right to receive sufficient perioperative pain therapy and this should not be withheld. Due to the lack of controlled studies this review summarizes standardized examples and alternatives in the acute pain treatment of patients using opioids. Early interdisciplinary cooperation, prevention of withdrawal through substitution of opioids and alternative treatment strategies like regional analgesia or ketamine as well as carefully titration of opioids are the essential components of the treatment of these patients. Furthermore, these patients require a clear and empathic guidance by medical and nursing staff.","1010":"The treatment of cancer pain shows a special challenge in the ambulatory and stationary treatment of various medical departments. A multifactorial design has to be established for the treatment of breakthrough pain episodes. The development of fast acting lipophilic opioids has improved the therapy of breakthrough pain. Combining these opioids with non-opioid analgetics, adjuvant drugs, interventional procedures, radiotherapy, orthotic devices and surgical \/orthopedic interventions delivers a multimodal approach to manage breakthrough cancer pain.","1011":"","1012":"Outbreaks of gastroenteritis caused by noroviruses have become an increasing problem for institutions in the health-care system over the past years. Staff members are also afflicted by the outbreaks of infection due to the highly contagious nature of noroviruses and this can lead to bottlenecks in health-care management and to economic losses. An acute gastroenteritis due to norovirus usually begins with severe nausea, heavy often projectile vomiting and a pronounced feeling of unwellness. In addition, there can be diarrhoea and abdominal cramps. The incubation time amounts to around one day. As a rule the disease is self-limiting and clears up after 2 to 3 days. However, the clinical pictures for one and the same type of pathogen can vary markedly from mild to severe illness. Since there is no way to treat the cause of a noroviral infection, prophylactic hygiene measures, especially of standard hygiene, are of particular importance. The necessary hygiene measures (especially hand hygiene) are aimed at interrupting the faecal-oral transmission pathway.","1013":null,"1014":"Strabismus surgery is one of the most common paediatric operation procedures. As associated with congenital syndrome, congenital heart disease and neuromuscular disorder, the anesthesiologic management has to be planned carefully. Considering high incidences of oculocardiac reflex (OCR) and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) anesthesia can be performed to decrease both. Induction of anesthesia with ketamine or midzolam reduces risk of oculocardiac reflex, whereas propofol or remifentanil lead to higher incidences of OCR. A combination anti-emetic therapy from different drug classes is recommend to patients at high risk for nausea and vomiting like patients undergoing strabismus surgery. A combination therapy of ondansetron and dexamethasone lead to a risk reduction of PONV to at least 10 %. Further, the incidence of OCR and PONV is significantly reduced in children receiving peribulbar block on top of general anaesthesia.","1015":"Local infiltration analgesia (LIA) is usually performed intraoperatively by the surgeon who injects 150 mL (300 mg Ropivacain, 30 mg Ketorolac and 0.5 mg adrenalin) into the bone, cartilage, ligament, musculature, or hyperdermis. A tight bandage and ice cooling for 4 - 6 hours lengthen the duration of analgesia, mobilisation can be undertaken about 5 hours after the operation. Besides large observation-in-use studies, there are 11 randomised studies in the fields of total hip and knee arthroplasty that report comparisons with systemic analgesia as well as with epidural or peripheral anaesthesia, all of which showed positive results for LIA. In addition LIA is safe, has favourable costs and does not require any special technical abilities in contrast to epidural and peripheral regional anaesthesia.","1016":"Recently, human resource development concepts have become more important in intensive care medicine. Motivationally oriented leadership is an essential part of this strategy. Of particular significance, leadership first of all means not to demotivate the personnel. Furthermore, a motivationally oriented leadership concept creates a framework in which the physicians' own motivation may thrive. Intensive care supervisory staff today should be familiar with mechanisms and potential of established motivational concepts and should be able to transfer them consequently into clinical practice.","1017":"","1018":"Injuries caused by regional anaesthesia are the second most common reason for a patient to apply to the North German Arbitration Board. Part of the reported injuries are mild and transient, while others are severe and permanent, e.g. a paraplegia after regional anaesthesia. In the majority of the reported cases, the Arbitration Board did not find a medical error as cause of the injury. Nevertheless, every possible effort needs to be made to reduce the number and the severity of the injuries due to regional anaesthesia. In order to reach that goal, medical treatment has to be applied with the appropriate care, including the strict adherence to the height of puncture for epidural and spinal anaesthesia below the Conus medullaris and the use of assisting devices like nerve stimulator and ultrasound-guided puncture. Using these measures, the frequency of injuries caused by regional anaesthesia will be reduced.","1019":"Injuries related to the airway management belong to the most often observed anaesthesia-related complications. Injuries of the trachea and the oesophagus possibly require surgical treatment. The most severe injuries caused by the airway management are the hypoxic brain damage and the patient's death. Tracheal injuries happen foremost as a result of tracheal intubation. Symptoms like subcutaneous emphysema and dyspnea are likely a sign of a tracheal lesion and need to be examined by Thorax-CT and endoscopy of the airways. In order to avoid injuries, medical treatment has to be applied with the appropriate care and strict adherence to the manufacturer's requirements regarding the use of the assisting devices necessary for the tracheal intubation. While some of he cases presented have to be assessed as of fateful origin, others are clearly the results of medical errors.","1020":"","1021":"Therapy by psychotropic drugs is bound to limited indications, which are partially changing. By an extent literary research in pubmed and Cochrane especially corresponding articles of the past 10 years were proofed. So antidepressants were continually seldom given to nociceptor pain. While on the other side anticonvulsants are to be given in the case of neuropathic pain of defined quality, it will be looked for new applications for these drugs. Particularly hitherto existing difficult indications as fibromyalgia were investigated as possible indication for anticonvulsants. At least neuroleptics can be used for very difficult, resistant and bizarre pains such as cenesthesias.","1022":"Acute renal failure (ARF) is a common and dangerous complication in intensive care medicine. Especially critical ill patients, who are suffering from major burns, have a high risk to develop ARF as a consequence of their trauma. Many factors, including the trauma itself, the damage of soft tissue and consecutive rhabdomyolysis, the development of the burn illness and therapeutic interventions play also a major role in this context. These circumstances have a major impact on the morbidity and mortality of severely burned patients. The aim of this manuscript is to review the reasons for the development of an ARF in burn patients as well as its consequences; moreover it highlights potential strategies to avoid ARF in critically ill burned patients.","1023":"We report on a failed epidural puncture for insertion of a catheter during chest wall correction by the minimally invasive procedure according to Nuss in a 16-year-old boy. After insertion of the catheter without any problem and establishment of a symmetrical thoracic analgesia and initiation of general anaesthesia, the catheter was surprisingly observed in the thoracic cavity upon insertion of the endoscopic camera. The catheter was then withdrawn under vision and the operation continued without any further incidents.","1024":"Electrolyte- and acid-base-balance are relevant determinants for metabolic processes whose real time analysis is obligatory particularly in perioperative and intensive care treated patients. Also, the oxygenation status of the blood as a determinant for the oxygen supply of an organism and for the gas exchange is measured. By use of \"point-of-care\" (POC) monitoring, these important variables of blood gas analysis (BGA) can be measured real-time, potential mechanisms of compensation identified and disorder of homoeostasis reconstituted quickly. This article deals with the presentation of relevant parameters of blood gas analysis, potential pathologies and their treatment.","1025":"Daily routine procedures in anesthesia may be associated with critical events including cardiac arrest. Therefore every anesthesiologist must be informed completely about standards and guidelines for resuscitation to provide adequate patient safety. In October 18 (th), 2010, new international guidelines for resuscitation were published. The main changes in these resuscitation guidelines are described.","1026":"In recent years, point-of-care coagulation monitoring systems have gained widespread use during surgical procedures. By providing quick and goal directed diagnostic information, they enable the attending physician to deliver a quick and goal directed therapy, thereby saving blood products and reduce resource utilisation. In order to maintain a high quality level, the physician in charge needs to have a sound knowledge of both the available methods including their indications and limitations and possible sources of error. This article summarizes the popular POC coagulation systems in Germany. Indications and limitations are described with special emphasis on the legal prerequisites that have been changed according to the new guidelines for laboratory investigations launched by the German college of physicians in 2008. Even though several issues regarding the necessary quality controls are still under debate especially with the more complex methods, it is of paramount importance that a comprehensive quality management is established for these POC methods.","1027":"It is well known that the early initiation of a specific antiinfective therapy is crucial to reduce the mortality in severe infection. Procedures culturing pathogens are the diagnostic gold standard in such diseases. However, these methods yield results earliest between 24 to 48 hours. Therefore, severe infections such as sepsis need to be treated with an empirical antimicrobial therapy, which is ineffective in an unknown fraction of these patients. Today's microbiological point of care tests are pathogen specific and therefore not appropriate for an infection with a variety of possible pathogens. Molecular nucleic acid diagnostics such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) allow the identification of pathogens and resistances. These methods are used routinely to speed up the analysis of positive blood cultures. The newest PCR based system allows the identification of the 25 most frequent sepsis pathogens by PCR in parallel without previous culture in less than 6 hours. Thereby, these systems might shorten the time of possibly insufficient antiinfective therapy. However, these extensive tools are not suitable as point of care diagnostics. Miniaturization and automating of the nucleic acid based method is pending, as well as an increase of detectable pathogens and resistance genes by these methods. It is assumed that molecular PCR techniques will have an increasing impact on microbiological diagnostics in the future.","1028":"","1029":"","1030":"In recent years it came to a change of paradigm in therapy of chronic pain. Not the one cause is now responsible for a defined pain but a group of factors. According to this pain will be no longer treated with opioids or NSAIDs only but by given psychotropic drugs. To understand the following explanations you don?t need any special psychiatric knowledge. The present review tries to give anaesthesiologists a better understanding of antidepressants and to facilitate the application of the drugs.","1031":"We report on a 27-year-old female patient who developed a progressive neurological disorder (anisocoria, dysarthria and facial nerve paresis) after participating in a marathon race. She was admitted to a maximum care level hospital after endotracheal intubation with a provisional diagnosis of intracranial bleeding. Imaging studies (computed tomography and computed tomographic angiography) revealed basilar artery occlusion. A successful outcome was achieved following thrombolysis within two hours of the initial onset of symptoms.","1032":"Maintaining regular function of the intestinal tract is an important prerequisite for successful outcomes in critical illness. Disturbances of gastrointestinal motility are frequently caused by drugs, excessive fluid load, mechanical ventilation, surgical or ischemic damage, and occur frequently in sepsis and SIRS. Impaired gastrointestinal motility may give rise to a vitious circle of enteral nutrition intolerance, edema, and may eventually result in a breakdown of the gastrointestinal barrier. Early diagnosis, patient-adapted treatment and a focus on prophylactic measures are necessary prerequisites to maintain gut function in critically ill patients.","1033":"Hospitalization may represent a stressor that can lead to Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Translation of the UK-PTSS-14, conducted in accordance with ISPOR principles and validation with the PDS (86 patients). The ROC analysis showed that the German version of PTSS-14 is a valid instrument with high sensitivity (82%) and specificity (92%) with the optimum cut-off point at 40 points. The translation process was authorized by the author of the UK-PTSS-14. The validated German version of PTSS-14 is now ready for use as an efficient and reliable screening-tool for PTSD in a clinical setting. ","1034":"The term \"Damage-control\" is borrowed from naval terminology. It means the initial control of a damaged ship. Because of the lethal triad in multiple injured patients the classical concept of definitive surgically therapy in the acute phase of the injury has a high rate of complications such as exsanguination, sepsis, heart failure and multiple organ failure. The core idea of the damage control concept was to minimize the additional trauma by surgical operations in these critical patients in the first phase. This means temporary control of a hemorrhage and measures for stopping abdominal contamination. After 24 - 48 hours in the intensive care unit and correction of physiological disturbances further interventions are performed for definitively treatment of the injuries. Summarized, the damage control strategy comprises an abbreviated operation, intensive care unit resuscitation, and a return to the operating room for the definitive operation after hemodynamic stabilisation of the patient.","1035":"Health care policy has changed duties and responsibilities of hospitals in Germany. The transition zone of in- and outpatient care has been recognized as a critical gateway for the success of hospitals, subsequently leading to the appreciation of the value of professionalized emergency departments. Currently, hospital-based emergency medicine in Germany is organized in a very heterogeneous manner. Due to the key function of emergency departments for the medical and economic success of hospitals, professional expertise in clinical emergency medicine has to be strengthened: We discuss possible models of hospital-based emergency care and present first data that professionalisation of hospital-based emergency medicine in Germany improves treatment quality and outcome of patients presenting with chest-pain or community-acquired pneumonia to the emergency department. Furthermore, those strategies are accompanied with the improvement of economic characteristics. Summing up, professionalisation of hospital-based emergency medicine in Germany is urgently needed and may improve medical and economic success of hospital-based patient care.","1036":"The confrontation with lethal courses, either due to fate or treatment errors, is an inevitable factor in the professional life of anaesthesiologists working in the fields of pain and palliative medicine as well as in emergency and intensive medicine. Even those active in the central service of anaesthesia in the operating room are not strangers to this topic. Thus it is even more surprising that neither during undergraduate studies nor during continuing medical education are systematic aids or guidelines provided on how to cope with such situations. Furthermore, there are no structured recommendations on how individual physicians, institutions or their superiors should behave in such circumstances. This is worrying as post-traumatic stress disorders can result from these experiences and can be detrimental to further professional and private lives ranging through to burn-out, substance abuse, or abandonment of the medical profession, etc. Lessons can be learnt from the German railways that have long offered a structured counselling concept for train drivers who have been involved in accidents with human injury. The present article is thus intended to promote a sensitisation for the topic and the resultant problems in individual cases as well to provide first considerations on the establishment of possible remedial structures.","1037":"Drug dependence of anaesthetists occurs more often than in other physicians, especially the noxious usage of common substances in anaesthesiology and pain management like opioids and anaesthetics. Opioids are the most frequent abusively taken medication followed by benzodiazepines, illegal drugs, Propofol and Ketamine. Determining for the behavioral pattern is the easy access to the drugs. Especially as some of the addictive-drugs (e. g. Propofol, Ketamine) are not underlying any release-control. Recent German surveys confirm the American figures. For the development of drug dependence many factors like biographic, social and genetic aspects as well as the substances and their potential itself are significant. Furthermore, the presence of many stimuli encourages the relapse-risk for addicted people despite earlier abstinence. At least 16% of all cases and 37% of the Propofol-addiction cases proceed deadly. American studies with structured therapy-, rehabilitation- and follow-up surveillance-programs show a positive prognosis for anaesthetists. In Germany it requires rethinking and the establishment of comparable therapy-offers and facilities.","1038":"In Germany aprox. 15% of all employees have irregular or flexible working hours. Disturbed sleep and\/or hypersomnia are direct consequences of shift work and therefore described as shift work disorder. Beyond this, shift work can also be associated with specific pathological disorders. There are individual differences in tolerance to shift work. Optimization of both shift schedules and sleep to \"non-physiological\" times of the day are measures to counteract the negative effects of shift work. There is still not enough evidence to recommend drugs for routine use in shift workers.","1039":"","1040":"Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a heterogeneous group of inherited rare diseases, which are characterized by trauma-induced blister formation of the skin and mucosa. The underlying cause is a functional deficiency of structural proteins of the epidermis or the dermis. Depending on the level of the blister formation, EB is divided into EB simplex (intra-epidermal), junctional EB (within the lamina lucida), dystrophic EB (below the lamina lucida) and Kindler syndrome (variable level of split formation). Besides different distinct blister formation and pain symptoms secondary problems like anaemia, oesophageal stenosis, cardiomyopathy or squamous cell carcinoma may occur. Since causal therapies are not available strict prevention of friction and trauma is essential to avoid blister formation. Anaesthesia challenges exist in the field of bedding procedures, care of the skin, monitoring, airway management und analgesia. This article gives a review over the EB and highlights in detail the corresponding anaesthesia characteristics.","1041":"Sugammadex can reverse rocuronium-induced muscular relaxation by encapsulation of steroidal muscle relaxants without muscarinergic side effects. Clinical studies show effective dose-dependent reversal of neuromuscular blockades after rocuronium and vecuronium. We report on a patient with deep neuromuscular block at the end of surgery following rapid sequence induction of anesthesia with high-dose rocuronium, who could rapidly be reversed without side effects after adequate i.v. sugammadex application.","1042":"Outcome-focussed benchmarking has been shown to be a successful tool in adult quality improvement of postoperative pain management in adults. We report on feasibility and first results of a similar project in operated children (quality improvement of postoperative pain management in infants, QUIPSI). Our results show that outcomes in postoperative pain management can be measured and compared in routine clinical practice. QUIPSI (Quality Improvement in Postoperative Pain Management in Infants) represents a new tool for outcome evaluation, consisting of standardized data acquisition of outcome and process quality indicators. In the currently starting second phase of the project, a multicenter evaluation will take place in ten medical centres.","1043":"The implementation of the sepsis bundles have led to a remarkable reduction of mortality. The early treatment is one key factor, but there are differences in the effectiveness of single bundle measures to contribute to decreased mortality. The validation of newly introduced management or therapeutic interventions like tight glucose control in randomized controlled trials is not completely successful for patients suffering from severe sepsis or septic shock. Recently published guidelines attenuate implemented treatment strategies and lead to further adjustment taking into account actual data on adjunctive sepsis therapy.","1044":null,"1045":"The sepsis bundles comprise the most important steps that have to be made in the first 24 hours following the sepsis diagnosis. Being comprehensive and manageable, they can be implemented in every ICU and in every hospital, and wherever this happens, more patients suffering from severe sepsis or septic shock survive. The ideal mode of implementation has yet to be found. Education and both financial and human resources play an important role for success, and so does the strong wish for improvement among the individual doctor, and among all responsible individuals within an institution or a scientific society caring for critically ill patients.","1046":"","1047":null,"1048":"Even nowadays and at specialized centers, one of the leading causes of death is exsanguination. Trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC) occuring with massive blood loss primarily results from loss of coagualtion factors and platelets and is aggravated by hemodilution. In addition, hyperfibrinolysis, hypothermia, acidosis and hypocalcaemia also contribute to the development of severe haemostatic derangement. During the past few years new insights into the pathophysiology of TIC and the widespread use of viscoelastic coagulation monitoring provoked the development of alternative treatment concepts. As for the previously recommended standard therapy using fresh frozen plasma and platelet concentrates also for alternative strategies no data from large prospective randomized studies are available until now, however, the evidence is growing favoring the use of coagulation factor concentrates guided by viscoelastic measurements.","1049":"The \"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome\" (ARDS) is a life threatening disease and is associated with a high mortality, mainly due to multi-organ failure. Invasive mechanical ventilation can worsen multi-organ failure which must be avoided. A tidal volume of 6 ml\/kg bodyweight should be the aim. Extracorporeal lung assist devices like ECMO or iLA can contribute to lung-protective mechanical ventilation.","1050":"Neurological complications after surgery may have fatal consequences for the patient or lead to disability and inability to work. Similar to central nervous complications such as stroke, postoperative visual loss, postoperative cognitive deficit and delirium, peripheral neurological complications following anaesthesia can be decisively influenced or almost avoided by an optimized anaesthesiological management. In the present article typical peripheral neurologic complications which can occur after regional anesthesia, central venous puncture and insertion of arterial or venous cannulas as well as etiology, diagnosis and therapy of peripheral nervous damage are described. Moreover the paper gives recommendations on intraoperative positioning of the patient and presents medicolegal aspects in the perioperative setting.","1051":null,"1052":"Prolonged, chronic pain after surgery is a very common phenomenon that has been underrecognized until recently. A number of risk factors and predictors (including the surgical procedure, age, gender, pre- and postoperative pain, psychosocial factors, genes and pain modulation variables) have been identified in the past years. Together with an increased knowledge about the pathophysiology of chronic pain after surgery, we may be able to develop successful drugs or interventions modifying the disease in subgroups of patients in the near future. However to date there is only little information about successful drugs or approaches which can be recommended to prevent chronic pain after surgery successfully. One of the reasons is the inadequacy of trial design and lack of prospective studies. Single RTCs show for example positive results with perioperative pregabalin for 30 days after total knee arthroplasty or short-term ketamine intravenously after open colon surgery. However, others have failed to show an effect after other procedures with similar drugs and treatment approaches. Positive results are consistently shown with regional anesthesia techniques perioperatively (for example epidural analgesia after thoracic surgery of paravertebral block after mastectomy). However, again, convincing evidence for certain treatment protocols (start and duration of regional anesthesia techniques) to get optimal results are limited at most. Thus, we are left with speculative effects after certain surgeries and may rely--at least to date--more on analgesic rather than disease related treatment approaches. Future studies with a standardized study design recognizing patient characteristics are highly needed to make progress and find drugs, strategies and approaches which can be applied to certain groups of patients to prevent the development of chronic pain after surgery successfully.","1053":"Acute postoperative pain is a still inevitable accompaniment of surgery. Up to 50% of the patients undergoing surgery--depending on its type--develop later on chronic postoperative pain. Psychological variables as minor depression, anxiety and pain-related catastrophizing as well as full-blown mental disorders are known risk factors. The relationship between such variables and postoperative pain is likely reciprocal.","1054":"Chronic postoperative pain is a most serious, unrecognized problem. Acute postoperative pain can be viewed as the initial step of an extensive, persistent nociceptive and behavioural cascade triggered by tissue and nerve injury. As a result, neuronal plasticity in all parts of the nociceptive system leads to an increase in pain perception. In most patients, chronic postoperative pain resembles neuropathic pain, occasionally however, pain is caused by continuous inflammatory responses. Identification of the etiology of pain is essential for its successful treatment. Both postoperative pain and the risk for the development of chronic postoperative pain are determined by preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors. To identify the contribution of relevant determinants and modulators of postoperative pain, large prospective controlled clinical studies are urgently required that include measurement and documentation of all risk factors and procedure-specific aspects.","1055":"","1056":"Opioids are important as medication against postoperative pain in infants and children too. However, intraoperatively given opioids increase the analgesic demand in the postoperative period without an improvement of the postoperative pain. Nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression and gastroparesis develop. The apparent benefit of a stable anaesthetic has to be bought with relevant drawbacks. Modern concepts heavily rely on local anaesthetics and nonsteroidals for postoperative analgesia.","1057":"Modern perioperative anesthesia regimen in pediatric anesthesia focus on patient safety, pain reduction and patient comfort. Multimodal analgesia is based on regional\/local anesthesia, non opioids and opioids. The use of opioids is traditionally much more restrictive than in adult anesthesia because of mostly unsubstantiated fear of serious side effects. As pain is still undertreated in pediatric anesthesia, opioids should be used generously but well-considered. Requirements for a professional pain service are: knowledge of the physiologic and pharmacokinetic specialities of children, possibility of monitoring (f.e. postanesthetic care unit) and prophylaxis and therapy of side effects.","1058":"Following an uncomplicated outpatient colonoscopy, a patient was found unconscious with bradycardia in the waiting room of a practice of an internist. After a half an ampoule of atropine, the pulse quickened but the patient remained unconscious. Even flumazenil did not improve the situation. The now responding emergency physician was confronted with numerous, unspecific neurological symptoms and considered various differential diagnoses. The situation was aggravated by the rural infrastructure. In the course of the clinical investigation, the patient's condition deteriorated rapidly and intubation was necessary. The correct underlying diagnosis was finally made following a telephone call and disclosed an (almost) fatal chain of misunderstandings.","1059":"Major sport events require adequate expertise and experience concerning medical coverage and support. Medical and ambulance services need to cover both participants and spectators. Likewise, residents at the venue need to be provided for. Concepts have to include the possibility of major incidents related to the event. Using the example of the Hamburg Cyclassics, a road bicycle race and major event for professional and amateur cyclists, this article describes the medical coverage, number of patients, types of injuries and emergencies. Objectives regarding the planning of future events and essential medical coverage are consequently discussed.","1060":"We report a case of severe neuroleptic malignant syndrome developing in a 28-year-old female patient following deliberate self-poisoning with atypical antipsychotic drugs and serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Because of an increasing loss of consciousness she was rapidly transferred to an Intensive Care Unit. Following this, she became progressively febrile associated with rhabdomyolysis and life-threatening organ dysfunctions. Due to fast diagnosis and immediate therapy the patient was treated successfully. This article describes etiology, pathophysiology and symptoms of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. In addition therapeutic options are discussed.","1061":"Neurological complications following anesthesia deteriorate patients' outcome, and increase hospital costs because of prolonged hospitalization and supplemental medical care. Moreover, patients' satisfaction is negatively influenced by neurological sequelae after anesthesia. Improving anesthesiologic management based on consequent prevention measures can help to reduce the incidence of neurological complications after anesthesia. In case of neurological complications in the perioperative phase an interdisciplinary approach in immediate diagnosis and treatment may prevent patients from permanent damage. The present review article gives an overview over incidences, diagnostic and therapeutic issues of neurologic complications in operative patients, such as perioperative stroke, postoperative visual loss and the anticholinergic syndrome.","1062":"In view of patients' increasing expectations the civic liability of physicians is gaining more and more importance. In order to prevent them from the risk of indemnifications to be paid out of their own pocket in the event of loss, a profound professional indemnity insurance becomes necessary. The professional activity of an employed physician is often covered through his employer; however, whether sufficient or not is always subject to an individual case-by-case review as to the limits of indemnity and the risk of a possible regress. Only after definition and verification of the concrete insurance needs (e.g. subsidiary activities), the physician is in the position to decide upon his individual professional indemnity insurance, taking his personal (remaining) risk into account. Thus, superfluous double insurance and insurance gaps can be avoided.","1063":"The focus on the role of non-technical skills such as communication, dynamic decision making, situational awareness and teamwork in emergency medicine has gained importance over the past few years. Especially during time-critical and complex treatment of severely injured patients in a multidisciplinary and interprofessional trauma-team these factors play an important role for patient-safety and process optimization and are a key factor influencing the perceived quality of a given scenario by the team members. Thus, apart from medical expertise and technical excellence of single actors within a trauma team, non-technical skills need to be incorporated in trainings for trauma management. For the improvement of non-technical skills, particularly team communication and teamwork, a simulator-based training represents a valuable tool. The technical performance of portable manikin-based simulators has improved tremendously during the last decade, which facilitates realistic and true-to-life multidisciplinary team-training in trauma management.","1064":"The needs of seriously ill or injured patients issue a challenge to the Emergency Department in terms of personnel, premises and organization. The acute and often interdisciplinary care necessitates optimal surrounding conditions and a stringent coordination of each single step in the in-hospital setting. Many emergencies are time-critical, thus requiring the immediate initiation of diagnostic and first therapeutic measures with respect to the in-hospital interfaces. This review article describes the structural and organizational prerequisites of the appropriate management of seriously sick and injured patients in the Emergency Department. It also focuses on the interdisciplinary cooperation with other specialties during the initial resuscitation (\"team approach\") as well as during the ongoing clinical course.","1065":"The trauma resuscitation room in emergency departments is an important link between preclinical treatment and clinical management of patients with multiple trauma. For the trauma team (Trauma Surgery, Anaesthesiology, Radiology) to respond adequately, a high degree of training and standardisation is required. With arrival of the patient, the trauma team starts with priority orientated resuscitation. After life-threatening problems have been resolved, the diagnostic work is started with plain films of the chest and the pelvis and FAST. Additional plain films are made depending on further suspected injuries. Reassessment of the patient is done and necessary emergency interventions are performed before the patient is transferred to the radiology department for organ focused computed tomography. CT has gained importance in the early diagnostic phase of trauma care. The development of Multislice Helical Computed Tomography (MSCT) has led to substantial refinement in the diagnostic work-up. For many institutions it has become an essential part of the imaging of the traumatized patient. Delayed and insufficient medical interventions have a high impact on negative patient outcome. Anticipating and dealing with critical situations might reduce preventable errors in the treatment process and can be achieved by implementation of an algorithm-based structured workflow. In that context some elements of quality management are well established in clinical practice. In the presented paper we describe the effort that needs to be done to provide optimal care for multiple trauma patients after admission to a designed trauma centre.","1066":"","1067":"Opioids are important in pain management of patients suffering from chronic pain. However, opioid use is associated with several concerns, such as opioid induced impairment of cognitive and psychomotor performance. Several studies could demonstrate that opioid treatment in stable doses does not necessarily impair complex activities such as driving ability. But due to intraindividual variability to opioid response and other confounding factors (e.g. pain intensity, co-morbidity) judgements have to be made on an individual basis only.","1068":"Induction of anesthesia can be very distressing for children. This may lead to a lack of cooperation and refusal. The knowledge about the reasons of this behaviour is important to develop strategies and techniques to minimize the preoperative stress. Adequate preparation and the use of anxiolytic premedication are important modules. Non-pharmacological interventions are interesting and could be an alternative to sedative drugs in the future.","1069":"The blast injury is characterized by 3 different patterns of injury: blast wave, splintered fragments and displacement of victim's body. Severe external and internal hemorrhage, tension pneumothorax and the lethal trios (hypothermia, acidosis, coagulopathy) require a rapid prehospital and inhospital trauma care according to a standardized protocol. The concepts of damage control resuscitation and damage control surgery have proven to be effective and should be integrated into the treatment.","1070":null,"1071":"The term neurological diseases includes a lot of disorders concerning both the central and peripheral nervous system. Low incidence on the one hand and anaesthetic relevance on the other hand requires special attention in preoperative preparing and management of general anaesthesia. The following paper presents special problems of neurodegenerative disorders, which anaesthetic relevance is of growing interest in the changed elderly population.","1072":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease the central nervous system. Its first manifestation and clinical course of the disease is highly heterogeneous. The diagnosis is based on the verification of neurological deficits, the development of the clinical course and the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and spine. The therapy comprises disease modifying drugs (DMD), therapy for acute relapses and escalation therapy according the German MS-Therapy-Consensus-Group (MSTKG). An early therapy initiation and a systematic therapy of acute relapses and symptoms determine the modern MS-management.","1073":"Neuromuscular illnesses are characterized by a motor weakness or unusual muscular fatigue. Besides in some diseases sensory disturbances and pains are prominent. The causes of the disturbed interaction between nerve and muscle are varied and reach from illnesses of the motor anterior horn cells of the spinal cord about multifactorial lesions of peripheral nerves, a disturbance of the neuromuscular junction up to primary and secondary myopathies. In addition to the clinical examination electrophysiological procedures, specific laboratory tests from serum and CSF as well as the nerve or muscle biopsy allow a further etiology clarification. Few illnesses are separateable by specific genetic investigations.","1074":"","1075":"Obturator nerve block is commonly used for transurethral resections of the bladder in order to inhibit reflectory adductor muscle reaction during electrocoagulation and to reduce the risk of bladder wall perforation during transurethral surgery. Furthermore, obturator block is used to complete regional blocks for major knee surgery in addition to femoral and sciatic nerve blocks. Continuous techniques are sometimes used to treat chronic pain problems such as adductor spasm. During a so called \"3 in 1\" block (femoral nerve block) the obturator nerve will only be anaesthetized in 0-62% of the patients. Therefore, a specific approach to the obturator nerve is deemed appropriate. In addition, an accessory branch of the obturator nerve will accompany the femoral nerve in 10-30% of the patients. The classical approach uses the tuberculum pubicum as an anatomical landmark, inserting the needle approximately 1.5cm lateral and caudal until bone contact is established. After laterocaudal redirection the canalis obturatorius is reached and the local anaesthetic is injected. The alternative approach is more often used: At the proximal tendon insertion of the adductor longus muscle the needle is introduced and advanced towards the anterior superior iliac spine. For both approaches a nerve stimulator is used and 15-20ml of local anaesthetic solution are injected.","1076":"Drug addicts need special anesthesiological care due to their co-morbidities, their modified need for analgesics and anesthetics and\/or their specific substitution therapies. In spite of the high incidence of addiction worldwide controlled studies and evidence based recommendations for the anaesthesiological management of the patients are missing. The perioperative care is not the treatment of addiction, on the contrary the specific aspects of a chronic disease have to be accepted. Equally important perioperative treatment strategies for the management of drug addicts include: 1. stabilisation of the physical dependence by substitution therapies. 2. avoidance of distress or craving. 3. perioperative stress relief. 4. strict avoidance of inadequate analgesic treatment. 5. postoperative optimization with regional or systemic analgesia with non-opioids, opiods and co-analgesics. 6. consideration of specific physical or psychological comorbidities. Inadequate analgesic treatment is known to be responsible for relapses into addiction and has strictly to be avoided. This holds true even for people with long term drug abstinence.","1077":"A 78-year-old patient undergoing laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy under accompanying thoracic epidural anesthesia develops post surgically sensorimotor deficits. Initially, the pathogenesis is unclear. Only specific diagnostic tools can identify the underlying causes and enable delayed therapy.","1078":"For preoperative haemostatic assessment a structured questionnaire for the bleeding history of the patient should be primarily used. Only in case of abnormalities an additional laboratory coagulation testing is recommended. Such a test set must include functional testing of platelets as defects of the primary haemostasis are frequent. In the event of acute acquired perioperative coagulopathy laboratory coagulation testing is a prerequisite for sophisticated and precise diagnosis and therapy. Points of care techniques like thrombelastography are capable to provide fast and extensive information.","1079":"Dental injury is one of the most anaesthesia-related complications. It can cause a patient's functional, esthetic, financial, and emotional annoyance. The incidence of dental injury is said to range from 1:6000 to 1:1000. The upper incisors are by far the most often injured teeth. Removable dentures should be taken out prior to anaesthesia. A tooth guard can be used as a prophylactic measure. However, with that tracheal intubation can be complicated because of the reduced view at the epiglottis and the vocal cords. If a dental injury occurred, the patient should be seen by a dentist as soon as possible to undergo appropriate treatment with no delay.","1080":"Epidural anaesthesia results in a significant reduction of postoperative pain, opioid requirement and opioid related side effects. Additionally a reduction of duration of postoperative ileus and pulmonary complication has been shown, but influence on cardiac morbidity remains contradictory. Effects on mortality and long term outcome after tumor surgery is still a topic of intensive research. Positive effects of epidural anaesthesia should be intensively used in terms of intensive physiotherapy and postoperative mobilisation as well as early enteral nutrition to further improve outcome of the patients.","1081":"Recent demographic developments challenge anaesthesiologists with an increasing number of elderly patients with cardiovascular comorbidities undergoing major surgery. Interventions that are capable to increase tissue tolerance against ischemia are of paramount importance. In this context, conditioning is defined as a mechanism that fosters tissue by specific adaptive processes to develop tolerance against a subsequent ischaemia. Dependent upon the temporal relationship between the intervention and the index ischaemia, preconditioning (intervention before ischaemia) is differentiated from postconditioning (intervention upon reperfusion). Ischaemia induced in tissue remote from the target organ is called remote preconditioning. Both brief periods of ischaemia as well as volatile anaesthetics and opioids are able to trigger conditioning. On a cellular level, ATP-dependent potassium channels and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore are thought to be key effectors. Effective conditioning has been unequivocal demonstrated for various tissues in animal experiments. Clinical trials in patients undergoing cardiac surgery have provided evidence for organ protection by conditioning. Large scale multicenter randomised trials, however, are still needed.","1082":"The number of patients with limited organ function is steadily increasing due to the aging of the population. Consequently, a growing number of patients needing surgery is accompanied by serious comorbidities. These patients are at high risk of perioperative organ dysfunction. In this context cardiac events (e.g. cardiac arrhythmias, angina or myocardial infarction) play a major role with significant impact on postoperative care, long term outcome and economic sequelae. Thus, anaesthesiologists must prevent such events in the perioperative period. Besides general measures such as adequate analgesia, protection from stressful events and sufficient volume replacement, medical intervention with beta-blockers or HMG-CoA-reductase-inhibitors (statins) are necessary to reduce the incidence of perioperative cardiac events. Both beta-blockers and HMG-CoA-reductase-inhibitors are known to exhibit pleiotropic effects (defined as additional cardioprotective effects) besides the primary blockade of the beta-adrenergic receptor or the inhibition of the synthesis of serum cholesterol, respectively. Both groups of drugs improve cardiac function, decrease inflammatory response, decrease activation of blood coagulation and stabilize endothelial plaques. Based on the current literature the following recommendations are published concerning the perioperative administration of beta-blockers: (i) Patients who are on beta-blockers on a regular basis following guidelines concerning chronic treatment of cardiovascular diseases should continue this medication throughout the perioperative period; (ii) a sufficient indicator of an adequate therapy is the baseline heart rate. It should not exceed 60-70bpm at rest; (iii) the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) is a widely accepted score to estimate the patient's perioperative cardiac risk; (iv) patients with a RCRI &gt; or =3 should not be scheduled for routine surgery without sufficient beta-adrenergic-receptor blockade; (v) in patients at high cardiac risk based on the RCRI who are scheduled for emergency surgery beta-blocker-therapy should not be initiated de novo perioperatively. However, for perioperative treatment of tachycardia or hypertension beta-blockers are the drug of first choice. Concerning perioperative statin-therapy the following recommendations are suggested: (i) chronic statin-therapy should be continued throughout surgery and the perioperative period; (ii) in patients without chronic statin-therapy scheduled for vascular surgery this treatment should be started perioperativly; (iii) no data is available concerning other patient populations; (iv) if statin-therapy is indicated it should be started independently from baseline serum LDL-C-concentration; (v) side effects of statin-therapy are rare and usually not live threatening, thus treatment is considered to be without serious risks to the patient.","1083":"","1084":"Resistance to antibiotics and the directly related proportion of multiresistant bacterial pathogens (MRP) is increasing continuously. This applies particularly for intensive care units. The most relevant MRP are methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), extended spectrum ss-lactamase formers (ESBL), multiresistant pseudomonades and Acinetobacter species. According to WHO the world is in danger of entering a so-called \"post-antibiotic era\", in which it is no longer possible to treat the causes of infectious diseases with antibiotics. The reasons for this development are considered to be the increased morbidity of patients as well as the too frequent, too long-enduring and often inappropriate usage of antimicrobial substances. But also the increasing number of invasive measures and interventions as well as the still existing inadequate maintenance of hygiene standards and the inadequate establishment of non-medicamentous measures (e.g. hand disinfection) for infection prophylaxis play a significant role.","1085":"A five-year-old girl suffering from sepsis and acute paraplegia was diagnosed with spinal epidural empyema due to a superinfected tuberculous osteomyelitis of a vertebra. In the absence of a neurosurgeon the anaesthetists opted for an epidural procedure. To this effect they aspirated, drained and irrigated the epidural space on several levels via epidural Tuohy cannulas - followed by an antibiotic instillation.","1086":"Modern computer-based methods to monitor anesthesia are widespread. They are used in order to avoid awareness, to reduce consumption of anesthetics, to optimize recovery times and to detect prolonged times of deep anesthesia and associated immunsuppression, mortality and morbidity. This review illustrates the evidence with which these goals were achieved until now. Finally, a recommendation for each indication is given. The useage of EEG-monitoring may help to avoid awareness and allows a reduced of consumption of anesthetics. The question if a cumulated time of deep anesthesia is associated with elevated mortality might be of a certain importance in the future.","1087":"A forty-five year old male tourist suffers a febrile illness, delirium and severe abdominal pain on the fifth day of his holiday trip to the Canary Islands (Spain). After hospitalization he presents a surgical abdomen which requires emergency laparotomy however without detectable pathology. Progressing critical illness and septic shock leads to multiple organ failure, but focus identification is not possible. Well after return to Germany diagnostic uncertainty persists due to recurrent fever and possible travel-associated infections. Finally, besides a simple pararectal abscess, manifestation of acute intermittent porphyria is diagnosed. Clinicians should consider acute intermittent porphyria as a rare cause of a surgical abdomen. Its clinical presentation include abdominal pain, life-threatening neurovisceral, neurological and psychiatric symptoms, hypertension, tachycardia, hyponatriemia and reddish urine. ","1088":"The economical pressure on the health system and especially on hospitals is growing rapidly. Hence, economical knowledge for people in medical executive positions becomes imperative. In advanced and forward-looking hospitals controlling is gaining more and more weight, because it takes over a coordinative responsibility. Ideally controlling is navigating the teamwork of managers (CEOs) and medical executives by weighing medical necessities and economical framework. Controlling is contributing to evaluate an optimal efficiency of a hospital in a highly competitive surrounding by providing medical and economical data on a regular basis. A close, open-minded and trusting cooperation between all people, who are involved, is imperative. Hence, controlling in the proper meaning of the word can not flourish in dominant and hierarchic hospital structures.","1089":null,"1090":"Spinal anesthesia is a safe procedure. The knowledge of complications may support efforts to minimize risks, speed up the recognition process and lead to adequate timely therapeutic approaches. Pain during insertion of the needle can be a warning signal for potential conus damage. Hypotension caused by spinal anesthesia should be treated by appropriate vasoactive drugs. Timely recognized cardiac arrest situations are usually well treatable. The incidence of postdural puncture headache should be less than 2% of cases. In case of a high degree of suffering the best currently available treatment is the epidural blood patch. Further complications like intracranial bleeding, infection, cauda equina syndrome or spinal hematoma need immediate differential diagnosis and therapeutic approaches. The residual risk for permanent harm can be estimated to be around 0,02 per thousand.","1091":"Unilateral spinal anaesthesia aims to limit the distribution of spinal block only to the operated side, for all operations involving only one lower limb. Small doses of local anesthetic, pencil-point needles, injection speed, lateral decubitus position and not isobaric anesthetic solution are the main factors involved when attempting a unilateral spinal block. In comparison to conventional technique it requires a bit longer preparation time, but provides less hemodynamic side effects with higher cardiovascular stability, increased autonomy after surgery and better patient acceptance.","1092":"Day case surgery is becoming more and more important. In order to perform these services cost-efficiently it is of primary importance to ensure that procedures can be scheduled with the largest possible patient satisfaction. Up to now spinal anaesthesia was of little importance in day case surgery due to prolonged nerve block and negative side effects especially when using long acting local anaesthetics. Since prilocaine and 2-chloroprocaine, two short acting local anaesthetics with a known low incidence of side effects, were recently introduced into clinical practice a reevaluation of spinal anaesthesia in a day case setting according to EMB guidelines still has to be done.","1093":"","1094":"The (intravenous) administration of opioids is frequently associated with the induction of cough. This phenomenon is usually neither harmful for the patient nor bothersome. However, in some situations a severe cough may interfere with imaging, diagnostic or therapeutic procedures and thus, anesthesiologists may want to know effective preventive measures. The existing literature is extremely diverse and the results of clinical trials are sometimes conflicting. Based on experimental investigations in accordance with clinical findings this systematic review of the existing evidence helps to guide the management strategy if opioid induced cough should be avoided. Promising strategies - among others - in order to achieve this aim consist for instance of decreasing the injection speed in conjunction with pre-administration of lidocaine or clonidine.","1095":"Compared to patient controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) peridural analgesia is considered as more effective but more expensive for the treatment of postoperative pain after major abdominal surgery. The aim of the analysis was to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and to relate the cost to time (per 1 day) and pain reduction (per 1 step on a pain scale). Systematic literature research on Medline and the Cochrane library were conducted. Clinical data were primary extracted from randomized controlled trials. Labour costs and costs for material and drugs were generated from a multicentre evaluation of DGAI and DGSS. The cumulative weighted mean difference for 4.5 days of therapy was 63.33 mm on a VAS in favour of the PDA. The overall costs of the PDA amounted to 305.35 euro and of the PCIA to 137.74 euro. The incremental costs came to 26.48 euro per day and one unit of pain reduction.","1096":"Inadvertent perioperative hypothermia impairs postoperative outcome in surgical patients due to ischemic myocardial events, wound infections and coagulation disorders. Body core temperature should be assessed 1-2h preoperatively and continuously during surgery. To prevent hypothermia patients and nursing clinical staff should be teached and trained. Preoperatively surgical patients should always be prewarmed by using convective warming devices and active warming should be continued in surgeries longer than 1 hour. Warming of IV fluids is effective if infusion rates are above 1l\/h. Core temperature should be measured in the recovery room and active warming should be started when patients are hypothermic or if they feel cold.","1097":"Brain infections caused by fungi of the Pseudallescheria \/ Scedosporium-complex weeks or months after a near drowning event should be considered, since mortality rate is high and specific diagnostic methods are necessary for fungal detection. Voriconazole is the only authorised antimycotic drug available for the treatment of these infections in Germany, but other antimycotics may also be indicated for alternate or combined treatment strategies. Consultation of a specific reference laboratory is recommended in comparable relevant cases.","1098":"Evidence-based medicine implies that recommendations ideally exist for each clinical question based on a systematic data search in the current literature, a data extraction, a summary and critical appraisal. Over the last fifty years evidence-based medicine has been growing rapidly. Systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials are of high impact in this field. However, the question remains: in which way is daily clinical practice affected? In an era of time- and cost-pressures as well as manpower shortages, the complex process of evidence-based medicine is difficult. Examples from perioperative pain therapy are provided to demonstrate how evidence-based medicine could be feasible and incorporated into daily practice.","1099":"Medical decision making is affected by different aims and influencing factors. Nowadays economic aspects are so important that they influence the structure of hospitals, the number and quality of personnel, and the treatment and care of patients. This leads to conflicts with moral aims, especially when the necessary service cannot be provided due to financial reasons or when doubtful offers are supposed to increase revenues. Examples demonstrate cases in which economic aspects become more important than patients' interests because physicians are corruptible. It is necessary to communicate values. Patients' health should be first and economy should be a subordinated service.","1100":"Up to 92% of patients in ICU develop delirium, which may be missed without routinely monitoring. Delirium monitoring, though, is often deemed time consuming and dispensable, as mere clinical judgement is considered sufficient. This paper describes the general pitfalls during the introducing of a delirium screening tool and provides tips for daily delirium monitoring.","1101":"To date, there are few studies available focusing on prevention and therapy of delirium in ICU patients. Monitoring during routine care is important because without using validated tools only one third of the delirious patients will be detected. A lot of non-pharmacological interventions like re-orientation and helping the patient to get back his autonomy, but also goal-orientated sedation support prevention and therapy of delirium. Furthermore, there are hints that pharmacological intervention can reduce incidence and severity of delirium. For delirium prevention there are drugs available acting on different receptor systems (acetylcholine, dopamine, opioid, glutamate). For the use of this drugs, a strict risk-benefit-consideration is necessary due to the low level of evidence of the existing studies. Therapeutically causative and symptom-orientated approaches should be preferred.","1102":"The reported incidence of delirium in critically ill patients ranges widely - from 11% to 87%. Both in the recovery room as well as in the intensive care unit postoperative delirium is the most common psychiatric disease. Patients with ICU delirium have a significant higher 6-month mortality rate. Recent studies could show that the use of a validated delirium assessment tool significantly improves the ability of physicians and nurses to detect delirium in ICU patients. The following article gives a review about different assessment tools of ICU delirium and focuses on the differences between validated delirium scores.","1103":"","1104":"The Institute of Medicine (IOM) reports \"Crossing the Quality Chasm proposed 7 aims for high-quality healthcare: effective, safe, timely, efficient, equitable, patient-centred, and emphasized care coordination.

On this occasion, it is shown whether such a pain measurement with the available parameters is generally possible and which parameters are necessary for this. However, quality parameter and quality outcome must be regarded individually for every patient. Quality measurement concerning the therapy of chronic pain diseases is an interaction of several quality and outcome parameters.

With increasing recreational activities and the fascination of diving also for older persons diving accidents are expected to occur more often. There can be several reasons for diving accidents such as the ignorance of the physics of diving, a trauma under water as well as internistical illnesses like heart attach, stroke or hypoglycaemia. The therapy of the underlying illness should not be left aside while dealing with the patient. The careful rescue and the immobilisation are most important for the initial therapy. The patient should receive oxygen, if possible via a demand valve, until a hyperbaric chamber is reached. There is no specific medical therapy for decompression illness. It is very important that a pre-information is sent to the closest hyperbaric chamber as soon as possible since often the chamber needs some time to be properly prepared for usage. In order to receive information regarding the depth where the diving incident occured, the duration of the diving trip and the decompression stops, it is important to secure the diving computer of the victim for the hyperbaric chamber. Also outside diving, decompression illness can occur, for example working in a tunnel under hyperbaric conditions. These accidents have to be treated according to the same guidelines.","1107":"It is estimated for the year 2006 that around 500,000 to 600,000 nosocomial infections occurred in Germany and that among these 10,000 to 15,000 patients died of the infection. Nosocomial infections in general lengthen the duration of hospitalisation by on average 4 days - with associated extra costs of 4000 to 20,000 Euro per case. About a third of all infections acquired in hospital are considered to be avoidable. However, the classification of an infection as nosocomial does not automatically mean that a causal relationship exists between a medical intervention and the occurrence of the infection. Also a nosocomial infection is not a synonym for medical or nursing errors. The first epidemiological report of the EU emphasises the health-political and health-economical significance of nosocomial infections and classifies the increasing number of infections acquired in hospitals as a most important danger - even higher than the threats of pandemic influenza and HIV.","1108":"Compounds with anti-inflammatory properties are an important component of multimodal postoperative analgesia. NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors are of similar analgesic efficacy in this indication. However, the use of COX-2 inhibitors reduces the risk of gastrointestinal ulcers, bleeding complications and bronchospasm in comparison to NSAIDs. In parallel, COX-2 Inhibitors do not carry an increased risk of cardiovascular complications and require the same caution with regard to renal effects as NSAIDs.","1109":"An increasing percentage of surgical procedures are performed in an ambulatory setting. However, a fairly high number of patients experience moderate to severe postoperative pain and pain is a common reason for unanticipated hospital admission. An adequate postoperative pain therapy in the ambulatory setting is therefore essential not only for ethical reasons or improvements in recovery but also for economic reasons but - in Germany - still remains inadequate. The following article deals with the problems that cause inadequat pain therapy after ambulatory surgery in Germany and introduces different therapeutic options, strategies and drugs relevant to optimize pain therapy after ambulatory surgery. Major aspects are education of the patient, the use of adequate non-opioid analgesics and implementation of regional analgesia techniques. Non-opioid analgesics are known to be effective to reduce opioid requirements and side effects; however, not all non-opioid analgesics are similar effective. Furthermore side effects and risks of these drugs need to be considered in individual patients. Benefits from regional anesthesia and analgesia techniques are well known after sugery. Experiences from other countries demonstrate improved analgesia, less side effects (e.g. sedation, insomnia) and increased patients satisfaction associated with continuous peripheral nerve blocks at home. In Germany, these techniques are not frequently used but need to be considered in the future to optimize postoperative pain management after ambulatory surgery.","1110":"Cancer-related pain affects approximately about 30 to 80 % of all patients, according to primary and metastatic sides and stage of disease. Cancer pain management depends on the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Current pain treatment is still based on the World Health Organisation (WHO-\"ladder\") - guidelines, opioid therapy beeing the cornerstone. The present overview article focuses on different opioids, as well as on the various adjuvants. Advantages and side effects of the different nonopioids, anticonvulsants, and antidepressants are discussed. The recommendations are limited for the adult outpatient treatment.","1111":"","1112":"The effectiveness of the analgetic placebo effect has been confirmed by several meta-analyses: not only can substances without active agents (placebos) achieve (hypo-) analgetic effectiveness, but also the effectiveness of active analgetics can be increased by added placebo effects. For this reason the new AWMF-S3 guidelines (DIVS 2009, www.awmf.org ) on the \"treatment of acute and perioperative pain\" recommend the clinical use of placebo effects and the avoidance of nocebo effects. The point is not to use placebos as a substitute for analgetics, but rather to add placebo effects on to those of analgetics.","1113":"Causes for reduced states of consciousness are diverse; it is often impossible to directly reveal the underlying agents. The following case report describes a young healthy patient who showed a temporary unconsciousness that first appeared seemingly without reason. Accidentally we hit a very uncommon cause for the prevailing carbon monoxide intoxication and were able to prevent further impairment of health status of both patient and environment.","1114":"The management of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) requires a fundamental knowledge of the disease, its therapeutic options and possible complications. The preoperative goal is to prevent rebleeding by controlling blood pressure and treating pain and anxiety as well as stabilizing cardiopulmonary functions. An acute hydrocephalus has to be treated immediately. Microsurgical clipping or endovascular coiling are the therapeutic options available. The postoperative goal aims at securing cardiopulmonary functions as well as recognizing and treating cerebral (cerebral vasospasm, hydrocephalus, epilepsy) and systemic complications (electrolyte disorder, cardiac dysfunction). This article provides an overview about the pre-, peri- and postoperative management of patients with SAH.","1115":"Regional anaesthesia generally is considered to be safe. However, reports of complications with different severities are also well known. The scientific working group of regional anaesthesia of the DGAI has founded a network in conjunction with the BDA. With the aid of a registry, we are now able to describe risk profiles and associations in case of a complication. Moreover, a benchmark has been implemented in order to continuously improve complication rates.","1116":"Neuromuscular disorders are rare and often not very well diagnosed diseases. They can be separated in prejunctional, junctional or postjunctional diseases. General anesthesia is connected with a higher risk, therefore regional anesthesia could often be regarded with favour and could be a safe alternative. Because of the lack of systematically studies and guidelines the decision choosing a regional anesthesia is always a risk-benefit-analysis. This and also the detailed preoperative neurological status must, because of forensic reason, exactly be documented.","1117":"In malignant hyperthermia (MH) susceptible individuals volatile anaesthetics and the depolarizing muscle relaxant succinylcholine may induce a potentially lethal hypermetabolic syndrome of skeletal muscle due to an uncontrolled sarcoplasmic calcium release. Immediate discontinuation of triggering agents, oxygenation, correction of acidosis and electrolyte abnormalities and dantrolene application are essential for MH treatment. This article reviews the clinical symptoms of MH, the diagnostic criteria and the actual guidelines for treatment and management of anaesthesia in susceptible individuals.","1118":"Patients with neuromuscular disorders undergoing anaesthesia are at risk of various complications due to muscular weakness and the involvement of other organ systems. This article reviews the anaesthetic approach with regard to preoperative considerations and perioperative management in this heterogeneous group of patients.","1119":"","1120":"The sensation of pain arises through stimulation of peripheral nociceptors and is transmitted centrally involving several receptors and ion channels. In addition many endogenous physiologic pain-modulating mechanisms exist. Besides of classical analgesics, numerous other drugs showed analgesic properties based on diverse modes of actions along the pain pathway. These co-analgesics, administered in combination with classical drugs, are able to reduce painful states of different origin. We describe the peripheral action sites of co-analgesics, such as cannabinoids, capsaicin, bisphosphonates, steroids and somatostatin. We also summarise the effect of peripherally and centrally acting ion-channel blockers, e.g. local anaesthetics, carbamazepine and tolperisone working on sodium channels and gabapentin and pregabalin working on calcium channels. Finally, central analgesic mechanisms are discussed, for instance the inhibition of NMDA-receptors by ketamine or magnesium, the stimulation of alpha2-receptors by clonidine, tizanidine or antidepressants, the activation of GABA-receptors through baclofen and other analgesic mechanisms of i.e. ondansetron and neostigmine.","1121":"A difficult airway in childhood is very uncommon. Therefore, it will always be an unfamiliar and menacing situation for most anaesthetists. Knowledge of the individual pathology, associated anaesthesiological problems and possible solutions provide the basis for successful airway management. Endoscopical techniques are essential for the process. The following article shows how a difficult airway in childhood can be recognized and which anaesthesiological options exist to handle such a situation.","1122":"Emergency physicians, paramedics and the staff of the emergency room play an increasingly important role in the medical and psychological emergency treatment of patients after suicide attempts, as well as in the crisis intervention of persons with acute suicidal tendency. This article aims to give an overview of prevalence rates, method of suicide or attempted suicide, and the problems faced by EPs when treating these patients. In addition, concepts are presented which allow for an adequate risk assessment of suicidality and showing possibilities of primary crisis intervention.","1123":"Communicating bad news, e.g. the message of the death of a close relative, is not a straight forward task for physicians. Typical common inter-speaking attitudes often fail in this difficult situation. Even simple rules and cooking recipes are seldom helpful. Medical training unfortunately does not cover this topic sufficiently. Hence physicians have to learn from trial and error. However, this trial-and-error-method may provoke an unfavourable course of conversation. Training and knowledge of evidence-based rules can improve communicative faculties and facilitate delivering bad news.","1124":"Interventional radiologists perform a wide range of procedures. The anaesthesiologist takes care for provision of a physiologically stable and immobile patient, alteration of arterial blood pressure as necessary, and appropriate and timely management of complications. In this article we discuss the anaesthetic considerations for procedures like embolization of arterio-venous malformations, coiling of cerebral aneurysms, kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty including the preprocedure preparation, monitoring requirements, suitable anaesthetic techniques, postprocedure management and complication.","1125":"Neurological diseases can be treated more and more by minimal-invasive procedures. Most of them are performed under X-ray control in general anesthesia. In some diseases the minimal-invasive therapy is superior to medical or surgical therapy. In other cases final evaluation can not be made so far. For a successful minimal-invasive treatment a working communication between the involved persons is essential. At least basic knowledge about the underlying disease and the used techniques should be present.","1126":"Image guided minimally invasive local and locoregional tumor ablation techniques like radiofrequency ablation, interstitial brachytherapy, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and selective internal radiotherapy (SIRT) with (90)Yttrium ( (90)Y) microspheres have been established as valuable amendments in oncologic therapy concepts. These techniques allow the destruction of extensive liver tumors with an acceptable toxicity profile. Necessity for a safe performance of these procedures is a close collaboration between interventional radiologist and anesthetist.","1127":"","1128":"Labor-pain analgesia in the absence of epidural analgesia is difficult to achieve with the commonly used analgesic interventions. If epidural analgesia is not feasible due to coagulation disorders, anticoagulation, inability to insert an epidural catheter or on the mother?s request, there is a need for interventions to cope with labor-pain. For a decade, anaesthesiologists have experienced the unique properties of remifentanil in the settings of surgical anaesthesia, sedation and postoperative analgesia since its introduction into labor analgesia. The fast onset and offset without accumulation is largely due to its elimination by tissue esterases. These features are also key enabling factors that make remifentanil suitable for labor analgesia administered by a patient controlled analgesia device in a bolus dose of 20-40 microg [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED]with an initial 2-min lockout and no background infusion. Although remifentanil crosses the placenta, it is eliminated quickly in neonates by rapid metabolism and redistribution. Unfortunately, remifentanil does not have a licence for administration to the pregnant patient, and it is unlikely that the manufacturers would consider the cost justified. However, in labor and pediatric anaesthesia the off-label use of drugs is not uncommon. As it stands remifentanil is the best opioid for obstetric use so far. Therefore it is the onus on us to justify the use of remifentanil as off-label drug for obstetric analgesia on the basis that the benefit outweighs the risk. Proper informed consent, appropriate monitoring for the mother and the newborn, one-to-one nursing or midwifery care as well as the availability of an attending physician experienced in neonatal resuscitation and an anaesthesiologist with experience regarding the use of remifentanil is important to ensure that this method retains its credit for obstetric analgesia. These issues are discussed in an interdisciplinary approach.","1129":"Gangrene, non-clostridial myonecroses and intracranial abscesses are clinical entities for which hyperbaric oxygenation can be used therapeutically. Mortality and invalidity can be reduced by this means. Except for gangrene, HBO is used merely as an adjuvant for these diseases when conventional surgical, antibiotic and intensive therapy measures are not sufficient. The action of HBO is based on several points of attack: it reduces the formation of oedema, inhibits the production of alpha-toxins of the Clostridia, has a bacteriotoxic action, increases the effectivity of antibiotics and improves the immune defense system. An early start is decisive for the success of HBO therapy.","1130":"Herpes zoster, a biphasic disease with different kinds of pain is a challenge for pain therapy. The acute illness with mixed pain (nociceptive - neuropathic) requires antivirals for risk patients and pain treatment according to rules of acute pain therapy. For treatment of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) an example of neuropathic pain, antidepressants, anticonvulsants and topical lidocaine are today the first line therapeutics, further opioids are of a certain therapeutic value.","1131":"The German interdisciplinary task force for clinical hemotherapy (IAKH) is an independent association of clinicians. It aims for the improvement of blood transfusion application processes, procedures and safety in the absence of a German hemovigilance system. Whereas the producers of blood products concentrate on product safety, the IAKH focuses on administrative needs such as forms and regulations associated with the administration of blood products. It provides information about coagulation disorders, autologous blood donation and cell saving as well as techniques that reduce the amount of allogeneic transfusion needs. Benefits of a membership in IAKH are electronic and individual recommendations to clinical hemotherapy issues, an exchange forum, as well as low cost participation at conventions and meetings. Just recently, a critical incident reporting system for errors in blood transfusion and hemotherapy was launched (www.iakh.de\/ BeinaheFehlerErfassung\/). The entries reported are analyzed, feedback and recommendations are given. Everybody in contact with the administration of blood products is asked to report errors and critical incidents.","1132":"Obesity is a growing healthcare problem in all industrial countries, which occurs with increasing frequency in young people and indicates bariatric surgery. Obesity increases the risk for pulmonary and cardiovasculary side effects and also the anaesthesiologist is confronted with significantly more problems when the patient is overweight and obese. The present review focuses on the surgical techniques and the anaesthetic implications of bariatric surgery.","1133":"Obesity is a global epidemic, and approximately 20 % of the German population are obese. Therefore anaesthesiologists will be increasingly involved in the care of obese and morbidly obese patients in the near future. As a prerequisite, the hospital must focus on this patient population with respect to facilities and the availability of tailored medical equipment and supplies. Comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease and sleep apnea considerably increase the risk of obese patients. A thorough preoperative evaluation of comorbidities, an anaesthesia induction and intraoperative ventilation tailored to the pathophysiological sequelae of obesity and a sound knowledge of pharmokocinetics are necessary to ensure optimal care for obese patients.","1134":"The incidence of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents who need an anesthesia is increasing. These children have a higher risk for perioperative complications. The review discusses definition and causes of obesity in children, gives information about relevant pathophysiological changes, and focuses anesthesiological management and complications.","1135":"The major objectives of the German Medicinal Products Act (Medizinproduktegesetz, MPG) and the Medicinal Products Marketing Act (Medizinprodukte-etreiberverordnung, MPBetreibV) are to avoid the dangers (to health) arising from medicinal products (MP). This necessitates procedures for the professional maintenance of the, according to regulations low in germs or sterile, MP to be used. These procedures are associated with qualified personnel, appropriate resources, a reproducibly successful processing procedure and control of the technical-unctional safety of the MP.","1136":"Hyperbaric Oxygenation (HBO) is a medical treatment, in which a patient breathes 100 % oxygen inside a treatment chamber at a pressure higher than at sea level. The indication for HBO has to be considered whenever gas bubbles present in tissue or blood circulation (decompression sickness, gas embolism) or when a high oxygen delivery is of crucial importance (CO-intoxication, selected anaerobic soft tissue infections). HBO must never be considered as a substitute for conventional surgical or intensive care therapy, but as an adjuvant of (potentially) crucial importance.","1137":"Osteoporosis is a chronic disease with an enormous impact on health care costs. Approximately 8 Mio. people are affected in Germany. A reasonable part of them is suffering from acute and\/or chronic pain due to osteoporotic bone fractures and musculoskeletal malfunctioning. Therefore, pain therapy is based on the principles of acute pain treatment and chronic pain therapy.Drug effects and side effects have to be considered with respect to fracture healing, bone mineral density and fracture risk.","1138":"Providing an acute pain service means accumulation of a large amount of data. The alleviation of data collection, improvement of data quality and data analysis plays a pivotal role. The electronic medical record (EMR) is gaining more and more importance in this context and is continuously spreading in clinical practice. Up to now only a few commercial softwares are available that specifically fit to the needs of an acute pain service. Here we report the development and implementation of such a program (Schmerzvisite, Medlinq, Hamburg, Germany) in the acute pain service of a University Hospital.","1139":"The operating theatre is one of the most expensive areas in German hospitals. Contributing to high cost are badly arranged perioperative processes, which should be avoided. An appreciation of processing times and an illustration of department-specific operating figures are vital in order to ensure cost-efficiency. Specific software based on DRG-data is available to evaluate processing-times from an economic perspective.","1140":"Thoracic paravertebral block for postoperative pain control has been introduced more than a century ago. It is currently gaining increasing popularity. This simple and safe technique can be used for postoperative analgesia, as well as sole anesthetic technique. When compared to epidural analgesia for postthoracotomy pain control, thoracic paravertebral analgesia provides comparable analgesic efficacy, but less side-effects. Regarding concomitant use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs, paravertebral blockade is considered a central nerve block.","1141":"Regional anaesthesia has gained increasing importance during the last decades. Successful regional anaesthesia for shoulder surgery requires a detailed knowledge of the relevant anatomy. Interscalene nerve blocks are most frequently used to anaesthetize the shoulder and among them the techniques according to Winnie, Meier, Pippa and Borgeat are the most popular. The techniques described by Meier and Borgeat are characterized by low complication rates. They are efficient for the majority of surgical procedures and therefore offer an interesting supplementation or an alternative to general anaesthesia. When carried out as a catheter-technique they provide a high quality postoperative pain therapy.","1142":"Cervical plexus blocks have been established as safe and feasible procedures for carotid endarterectomy. Comparable perioperative complication rates have been reported for plexus techniques and general anaesthesia. The results of the GALA trial support the theory that the indication for insertion of intraluminal shunts was significantly reduced by regional procedures (14 % vs. 43 %) in consequence of the more reliable diagnosis of neurological complications. However, it has not been identified yet which technique (superficial, deep or a combination) offers the highest effectiveness.","1143":"","1144":"Difficulties in tracheal intubation are the major causes of anaesthesia related morbidity and mortality. Novel videolaryngoscopes facilitate endotracheal intubation by indirect visualisation of glottic structures through optical systems. In this review, differences and the advantages and disadvantages of videolaryngoscopes are discussed.","1145":"National and international evidence based recommendations for anti-infective therapies in the intensive care unit are difficult to implement into daily clinical work. However, adequate and early applications of anti-infective therapies are important outcome factors for the clinical course of severe infections. With support of the German Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine and the Association of German Anaesthesiologists (DGAI\/BDA) a web based anti-infective program was developed to address these issues. The program includes interdisciplinary consented evidence based algorithms to help with immediate diagnostics and initial anti-infective therapies. Currently, with the title \"ABx local\" a subproject is launched to broaden program functions. It unifies current evidence based recommendations and local internal standards or comments on one platform to achieve priority of therapy options e.g. based on resistance patterns.","1146":"Compared to other trauma patients, burn trauma victims show alterations that require special attention. The burn trauma modifies several physiologic processes. Metabolic regulation presents itself as one of the major problems. The first part of this review deals with the metabolic pathophysiology of severe burn trauma and its clinical impact. At the end we present possible therapeutic interventions with their mode of action and common side effects.","1147":"Rescue and medical care of people in a drowning accident is a rather rare incident which still needs special attention. The rescue process can be technically challenging and only a well experienced team will be able to act professionally without any time loss. At a first step all team members have to protect themselves. Especially close collaboration of technical and medical rescue teams are of high significance and should be part of future exercises. Hypothermic persons should be protected from further cooling and gently rescued in a horizontally way. If a patient has no circulation continued cardiopulmonary resuscitation and immediate transport as soon as possible to the nearest hospital with an extracorporeal rewarming device is recommended. To avoid any time loss it is essential that the respective hospital is informed immediately and the fastest mode of transport selected. Astonishing cases show that this procedure is very promising even after long time submersion.","1148":"Guidelines for the therapy of cardiogenic pulmonary edema or acute exacerbation of COPD imply the use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV). Clinical studies show a decrease in intubation frequency, mortality and length of stay with inhospital NIV. First prehospital reports show a safe and feasible use of NIV in this setting. We report the case of a 102-year old patient who was successfully treated with preclinical NIV.","1149":"The essential tasks of a department of interdisciplinary emergency medicine are the initial triage and assessment of vital function as well as the subsequent organization und initiation of emergency treatment. A previously defined set of diagnostic and therapeutic measures is carried out before the patient is allocated to an in-hospital clinical service and is admitted to a ward. Moreover, diagnosis and treatment for outpatients are performed. \"Time\" is a critical factor to be considered for all organizational and structural aspects of a department of interdisciplinary emergency medicine.","1150":"Deep knowledge of characteristic features of the growing skeleton is necessary for effective treatment of fractures in the pediatric population. The first part of emergency treatment of pediatric fractures involves immobilisation and appropriate pain management. In addition reduction of the fracture, either open or closed, with or without internal or external fixation are further treatment options used by the experienced pediatric surgeon. Generally, the principles of therapy of pediatric polytrauma are similar to the management of trauma in adults (ATLS). Nonetheless, attention must be paid to anatomical and physiological differences especially between young children and adults.","1151":"Injuries are responsible for considerable morbidity and much long-term or permanent disability. They are also the leading cause of death for children aged 0 to 5. In high income countries around the world 20000 children die each year from injuries. A recent UNICEF report has compiled data for 2001 on the leading cause of death for Europe. The burden of disease measure has identified injury as causative in 40% of years lost from premature death in children. Drowning and near drowning is the number two killer for children aged 0 to 5. In 30% of all cases cardio-pulmonary resuscitation and intensive care are needed. 11.5% of all drowning accidents are fatal, 9.5% of nearly drowned children show extensive neurologic deficits. Though the absolute number of deaths from injury in children has decreased during the last 20 years (in 1980: 18.8 dead children per 100000; in 2004: 3.0 dead children in 100000), still approximately 400 children die from injuries in Germany every year. The public health approach to injury involves not only deaths but also the burden of disease and loss of health from disability. Severe traumatologic pediatric emergencies are thermal injury, drowning and blunt abdominal trauma.","1152":"Pediatric emergencies are exceptional challenges for every emergency doctor. Referring to the complete spectrum of all emergencies the percentage of pediatric cases amounts 5-10%. In adulthood cardiovascular diseases represent the major cause for emergencies whereas in childhood respiratory disturbances and seizures prevail. This article reviews the most common pediatric disease patterns that are of importance for the emergency doctor. The typical clinical symptoms will be outlined as well as the corresponding therapeutic measures.","1153":"Due to the dramatic changes in anatomy and physiology from birth to adolescence children build a quite inhomogenous group of patients. However, the knowledge of these changes and the differences between children and adults are crucial for the adequate treatment of paediatric emergency medical cases. This article indicates the most important items for an emergency physician to know.","1154":"","1155":"Influenza is a severe, febrile disease of the airways that occurs epidemically in the winter months. It is caused by influenza viruses. In cycles of about 30 years, these seasonal epidemics progress to pandemics with high numbers of infections and deaths worldwide. In order to prevent just this situation, so-called pandemic plans have been developed worldwide. Besides vaccination, general hygienic precautions and antiviral therapies are the most important measures in the management of influenza. We can only wait and see whether or not the newly appeared H1N1 variant of the influenza virus A (Mexican flu, swine flu) will actually turn out to be a new worldwide pandemic.","1156":"We report a patient who presents pulmonary embolism three days after right hemihepatectomy because of colorectal metastasis. During two hours of successful resuscitation 50mg rt-plasminogen-activator are administered. Unfortunately the patient develops bleeding complications: an intraabdominal bleeding needs to be operated twice; intracerebral bleeding is followed by intracerebral edema. After a very prolonged intensive care treatment of 55 days the patient is discharged to a neurologic recreation centre. One year later she is doing fine beside a little cognitive deficit.","1157":"Lung-protective ventilation strategies for patients suffering from acute lung injury (ALI\/ARDS) are well- accepted measures to improve outcome including mortality. But what tidal volume is the best for the patient with non-injured lungs undergoing elective surgery? We searched the literature for studies that analysed perioperative tidal volume in patients not suffering from ALI\/ARDS. 10 studies were detected that matched our query. Mostly on patients undergoing major or cardiac surgery. Only a few studies exist which examine the effect of protective ventilation settings on healthy lungs of patients not being critical-ill. The reported results are very heterogeneous and do not strongly support a lung- protective ventilation strategy. However, apart from reasoning based on pre-clinical experimental data, there is some clinical evidence, that suggests using lower tidal volumes in patients undergoing major or cardiac surgery, even if the patient does not present with an ALI\/ARDS and is not critically ill at the time when the surgical procedure is performed. ","1158":"Since the beginning of anaesthesia it was well known that anaesthetic agents administered by inhalation must be capable of existing in gaseous form. For vaporization various types tried to work accurately. Since oxygen was available there could be realized new concepts like the principles of injection or bubble through. With Copper Kettle (1948) for ether and chloroform and Draeger Vapor (1958) for Halothane accurate administration of volatile anaesthetics was available. Today vaporizers are part of anaesthetic machines.","1159":"To make a decision concerning the withholding and\/or withdrawing of therapy is one of the most difficult tasks in medical care. Similar to other treatment decisions, initiation and interruption of therapy should be guided by the medical indication and, in principle, requires informed patient consent even during end-of-life care. However, especially in this situation, patients are frequently not able to give informed consent or to clearly express their wishes regarding therapy. Therefore, in Germany it is widely recommended to draft a \"living will\" in order to document the concerned individual's wishes for medical treatment either in general or for specific situations in the case of legal incompetency. Unfortunately, typical phrases of living wills such as \"for the case that I am in the terminal stage of an incurable, lethal disease, I hereby wish that...\" often do not exactly match the patient's situation or leave the medical team with the difficult task of precisely predicting the prognosis of an individual patient. However, according to a retrospective analysis of two large databases, even sophisticated scoring systems predicted a survival of more than two months in approximately 50% of the patients at one week before their actual deaths and again in 15% of the patients at 24 hours before their deaths. These data emphasise the fact that it is almost impossible to precisely forecast the individual prognosis of terminally or critically ill patients. Consequently, the careful but invariable subjective appraisal of the patient's prognosis and the applicability of the living will by the medical team is of major importance for the decision to withhold or withdraw therapy. Most often, this decision is the result of a cumbersome and controversial debate within the medical team. If a formal living will or any other declaration of the patient's will regarding medical care is lacking, the medical team faces the challenge to explore the patient's putative will by questioning his\/her friends and relatives. In order to reach a unanimous decision with relatives and also within the medical team, it may be helpful as a first step to withhold an escalation of therapy for a limited time, while daily reassessing the situation, before it is actively reduced. In Germany, health-care professionals do not always feel certain about the question of whether an active reduction of medical therapy is, in fact, active or passive euthanasia. The German Federal Court of Justice, however, has explicitly stated that withholding and withdrawing therapy is passive euthanasia and as such is legal.","1160":"Cyclodextrins consist of rings of sugar molecules with a lipophilic core and a hydrophilic periphery. Thus they are well soluble in water and possess the ability to bind (encapsulate) steroid molecules. Cyclodextrins have now been modified (sugammadex) in such a way a perfect complex formation with rocuronium results. In this way an alternative to the classical indirect antagonists has been discovered. It is now possible to terminate a neuromuscular blockade via an intravasal encapsulation of rocuronium far distant from the neuromuscular endplates and avoiding the side effects associated with acetylcholinestase inhibitors instead of by an intervention in the acetylcholine system. Furthermore, it has been found that even deep neuromuscular blockades can be reversed within 2 minutes by means of this novel mechanism.","1161":"Neuromuscular blockade in ICU patients has become less popular, in particular since non-invasive methods of artificial respiration have been introduced. Succinylcholine has numerous side effects. Due to its short onset, Rocuronium may be an alternative. The advantage of Atracurium and Cis-Atracurium is a largely organ-independent metabolism. In ICU patients, neuromuscular monitoring should be applied. Prolonged action and critical illness neuropathy are the most prominent side effects of neuromuscular blockade.","1162":"Neuromuscular blocking agents are used to facilitate intubation and to establish muscle paralysis during surgery. However, postoperative residual blocks are a significant complication following the use of neuromuscular blocking agents with an incidence of approximately 30 % at arrival in the post operative care unit. If they are not identified and adequately treated, residual neuromuscular blocks would increase the risk for muscle fatigue, hypoventilation, swallowing disorders, and aspiration. These complications may result in postoperative pulmonary disease. Therefore, monitoring of neuromuscular block is essential not only to detect residual paralysis postoperatively but also to maintain adequate muscle paralysis for surgery. Moreover, the response of individual patients to a particular drug can be variable and needs to be determined for the individual patient in a clinical situation. Sugammadex, the newly developed steroidal muscle relaxant encapsulator, is another important step to optimize treatment with neuromuscular blocking agents but will not replace neuromuscular monitoring. Since qualitative assessment has been shown to be insufficient to validly measure neuromuscular block in the anesthetized patient, it should be monitored quantitatively. Only using this technique and treating residual blocks where required, life threatening complications can certainly be avoided.","1163":"","1164":"Needlestick injuries (NSI) occur very frequently in the health-care field and represent a very serious risk for health-care workers. It is estimated that 500,000 NSI occur per year in Germany. They are the most frequent cause of infections with blood-borne pathogens. Thus prevention is of decisive importance. A simple reporting procedure and low-threshold care system after NSI would certainly help to reduce the risks and the number of undetected cases.","1165":"The increase in intra-abdominal pressure may be followed by a renal, gut, respiratory and cardial dysfunction and an increase in intra-cranial pressure. The review focuses risk factors and pathophysiological consequences of intra-abdominal hypertension and of abdominal compartment syndrome. Patients with intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome are critical ill and need special anesthesiological care due to risk of pulmonary aspiration, hemodynamic disturbances and difficult mechanical ventilation.","1166":"We report the case of a patient suffering from a severe methemoglobinaemia following accidental sodium nitrite intoxication, a substance frequently used as a preservation agent for animal feed. On base of this case report, pathophysiology, clinical symptoms, diagnostical and therapeutical options with methylene blue (1-2 mg\/kg of body weight) are discussed. Recently, pulse oximeters capable to measure 4 different hemoglobins have been introduced. These may be helpful for diagnosis especially in the prehospital setting.","1167":"Neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists represent a new approach in the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and show an efficacy comparable with those of common antiemetics with some evidence for superiority with regard to vomiting. Currently, only aprepitant is available as an oral preparation. Palonosetron is a new representative of the serotonin-3 receptor antagonists but without the hoped for superiority on the 2nd and 3rd postoperative days. However, available data do suggest that palanosetron does not prolong the OT (c) interval. When using 5-HT (3)-receptor antagonists for the prevention of PONV, anaesthetists should be aware of negative interactions with analgesics. Low-dose droperidol has regained approval and should be considered as first choice among the current available neuroleptics.","1168":"Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) constitutes a major unpleasant symptom in the postoperative period. The prevention of PONV is judged equally important as the prevention of postoperative pain. Therefore, a working PONV-algorithm should be as self-evident as the approach to prevent and treat postoperative pain. None of the currently available pharmacological interventions is able to totally abolish PONV. However, using a multimodal approach with the combination of various antiemetic interventions, a substantial reduction or even elimination of PONV is already feasible. As a rule of thumb, each effective antiemetic intervention will lead to a relative risk reduction of approximately 30 %. Well documented interventions in terms of the aforementioned efficacy are the administration of ondansetron 4 mg, dexamethasone 4 mg, droperidol 1,25mg and dimenhydrinate 62 mg, as well oral Aprepitant. Metoclopramide may play a role for instance in a multimodal approach. Apart from the administration of antiemetics, the avoidance of inhalational anaesthetics by using propofol is associated with a comparable risk reduction. In general, using a risk-dependent approach, e.g. based on a simplified risk score, allows to avoid administering antiemetics to patients at low risk. However, due to the difficulties associated with the implementation of risk-score based algorithms and the inherent weaknesses of clinical risk scores to predict PONV in an individual patient, a general (multimodal) approach seem to be justified as well. Considering the fact that the currently available antiemetics are associated with few side effects, the administration of prophylactic antiemetics should not be associated with a high hurdle in the clinical setting. In case of any doubts regarding the individual risk, it seems justified to expand the (multimodal) prophylaxis rather than to wait until PONV occurs and impairs patient comfort.","1169":"This review discusses the clinical relevance of risk stratification to determine measures to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting. The key question is whether PU&amp;E is a problem related only to a small group of risk patients and whether risk stratification is a reasonable approach to deal with this problem. The application of risk scores to predict PU&amp;E has been strongly advocated in the past years. These tools suggest that PU&amp;E is mainly a problem of a small and well defined group of patients that can be identified and clearly separated from patients with no risk for PU&amp;E. The need for applying these risk scores was based on the assumption that efficiency of antiemetic intervention mainly depends on the baseline risk for PU&amp;E and that these are only justified at an increased risk (e.g. PU&amp;E-risk &gt; 60 %) where the number needed to treat is about 5 or lower. PU&amp;E, on the other hand, are distressing and annoying symptoms for the patient. PU&amp;E is a limiting factor for any approach to speed postoperative recovery and thus incompatible with so called fast-track rehabilitation programs. Thus, PU&amp;E is relevant not only for high-risk patients but also for the great majority of patients with an intermediate risk for PU&amp;E. The latter group, e.g. patients with a predicted risk to suffer from PU&amp;E between 20 and 60 %, account for more than 80 % of all patients undergoing risk evaluation. Considering the high impact of PU&amp;E for the individual patient, the small incidence of patients where the occurrence of PU&amp;E can be ruled out with appropriate high probability, and finally the availability of several effective antiemetic measures all with a marked low incidence of side-effects, the authors of this review advocate a liberal policy for prophylactic administration of antiemetics. Prophylaxis against PU&amp;E should be as self-evident as measures to limit postoperative pain. Omitting antiemetic prevention should only be considered if the estimated risk for PU&amp;E is extremely low. All other patients in whom PU&amp;E cannot be ruled out with high confidence should receive routine antiemetic prophylaxis.","1170":"","1171":"Cerebral microdialysis (CMD) is a minimal-invasive monitoring technique for patients with subarachnoidal haemorrhage or severe traumatic brain injury, which allows the investigation of a wide spectrum of compounds in the brain tissue. The aim is a precocious identification of cerebral ischemia and secondary brain damage. The method was introduced in the early 1970s. By using commercial equipment it is nowadays possible to conduct on-line analysis at the bedside in the intensive care unit. The following article discusses the principles of CMD, the most commonly used biomarkers and the options during neurointensive care.","1172":"The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by inflammation evoked pulmonary edema, hyaline membranes, diffuse endothelial and epithelial injury, and fibrosis. For survival to occur lung repair is required. This review explores recent advances in the field of fibroproliferation with emphasis on cellular and soluble factors, mechanisms involved in lung repair, and genetic factors which influence severity and survival in ARDS.","1173":"Effective and safe airway management is one of the core skills among anaesthesiologists and all physicians involved in acute care medicine. However, failure in airway management is still the most frequent single incidence with the highest impact on patient's morbidity and mortality known from closed claims analyses. The anaesthesiologist has to manage the airway in elective patients providing a high level of safety with as little airway injury and interference with the cardio-vascular system as possible. Clinical competence also includes the management of the expected and unexpected difficult airway in different clinical environments. Therefore, it is the anaesthesiologist's responsibility not only to educate and train younger residents, but also all kinds of medical personnel involved in airway management, e.g. emergency physicians, intensive care therapists or paramedics. Modern airway devices, strategies and educational considerations must fulfill these sometimes diverse and large range requirements. Supraglottic airway devices will be used more often in the daily clinical routine. This is not only due the multiple advantages of these devices compared to the tracheal tube, but also because of the new features of some supraglottic airways, which separate the airway from the gastric track and give information of the pharyngeal position. For the event of a difficult airway, new airway devices and concepts should be trained and applied in daily practice.","1174":"In this case report, we describe the course of a chronic hemodialysis patient who has been treated for 7 days with linezolid for pneumonia caused by a methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and who developed severe thrombocytopenia which was reversible after having stopped the treatment. Since there is an increasing evidence that linezolid induces severe thrombocytopenia, especially in patients requiring hemodialysis, indication for treatment with linezolid should be made with caution and monitoring of blood count in short-term intervals should be performed in critically ill patients. Linezolid is a representative of a new antibiotic class, i.e. an oxazolidinone, which inhibits the bacterial protein synthesis at the ribosom. Such agents do not have any relation to common anti-infectives and act nearly exclusively against Gram-positive bacteria and mycobacteria. In clinical practice, linezolid is most widely used for treatment of Gram-positive infections, mainly caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The major adverse effects of linezolid are diarrhoea, nausea, and headache. Furthermore, abnormalities in blood count, i.e. leukocytopenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia, have been reported.","1175":"It is the responsibility of all anaesthesiologists to inform their patients about the risk and benefits of available treatment options. It is also our duty to obtain the patient's informed consent. But how much information do patients want about risks, and how should this topic be approached during the preoperative consultation? In this article we will discuss risk perception in general and options to describe potential medical risks.","1176":"Massively transfused multiple trauma patients commonly develop a complex coagulopathy which needs immediate treatment. Near-patient diagnostic methods are available for the management of this coagulopathy and for the guidance of the therapeutic options with blood products and haemostatic drugs: conventional laboratory analysis methods adapted to the point-of-care (POC) situation (blood gas analysis, point of care PT, APTT and platelet count), and the complex whole blood methods used for near-patient coagulation monitoring (thromboelastometry and platelet function analysis). Based on the new Guidelines of the German Medical Association for the use of blood and plasma derivates, interventions with blood products and haemostatic drugs in multiple trauma patients are suggested. The diagnostic value of near-patient methods for coagulation monitoring is discussed.","1177":"The German transfusion laws authorize and instruct the German Medical Association to institute a working group to provide \"Guidelines for Therapy with Blood Components and Plasma Derivatives\" for the critical use of blood products to promote a standardized hemotherapy and to help to protect patients from avoidable risks. In particular, because the collection of such products requires the willingness of numerous volunteers to donate blood, the responsible and carefully considered application of blood products is mandatory. For the first time, the recommendations have been evaluated on evidence-based criteria and listed for many specific medical interventions so that comprehensive procedures can now be created for the transfusion personnel in hospitals and clinics.","1178":"","1179":"As a Federal law, the German Protection against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz (IfSG)) regulates the prevention and management of infectious diseases in humans. For the physician actively engaged in the management of patients, the requirement to report infectious diseases and the surveillance responsibility for specific nosocomial infections are of particular importance.","1180":"About 80 % of all extremity amputations suffer from phantom limb pain following the operation. In this context, it is important to differentiate between painful phantom limb sensations, non-painful phantom limb sensations and residual limb pain. The pathophysiology of phantom limb pain is not fully understood. Current research findings ascribe a major pathophysiological role to cortical changes as well as a disturbed body perception. Peripheral and spinal mechanisms appear less relevant in the development of phantom limb pain. An essential part of the therapy is the pharmacological treatment with antidepressants, anticonvulsives and opioids. Another significant aspect of therapy is senso-motory training, important to mention here would be mirror therapy, lateralisation and motor imaging. In case of an elective amputation, an epidural or axiliar plexus catheter should be considered prior to the amputation. The perioperative treatment with ketamine is debated.","1181":"One of the most frequently ordered tests by intensive care medical staff is the complete (CBC) and differential blood count for diagnosing anemia due to blood loss, characterizing thrombopenic conditions or finding proof for sepsis. Classically, the clinician relies on the quantification of single cell classes for substitutive therapy especially in emergency situations. Here, the authors discuss new possibilities offered by markers of the extended blood count from fully automatized haematology analyzers supplying valuable information for monitoring therapies in intensive care units.","1182":"We report the case of a 77-year-old man, who presented with seemingly clear cerebral ischemia. During transport a short-term inexplicable decline of oxygen saturation occurred. In-hospital diagnosis showed not only a thrombosis of A. basilaris but also pulmonary embolism with a venous thrombosis of the lower leg. The thrombosis of A. basilaris itself represents a form of paradoxical embolism with persistent patent foramen ovale. Even with a seemingly obvious diagnosis less obvious diagnoses also have to be considered.","1183":"Regulations for the post-graduate education of physicians deployed in the emergency medical system in Germany are existing, but unfortunately not standardised nationwide. Within the compulsory certification course \"soft skills\" are not incorporated resp. psychological disorders are not considered to an adequate extent. In respect of increasing emergency calls with psycho-social indications it seemed necessary to invent a specialised course concerning these issues. Integrating under-graduate experiences of classes with standardized patients, objectives were defined; a pilot course was composed using scenarios as acute psychosis, suicidal tendency and bringing bad news including structured video-feedback. Evaluation data approved the tested approach concerning content as well as feasibility, pointed out areas for improvement, but encouraged further implementation of the program to greater extend.","1184":"In vascular surgery, intraoperative monitoring of the brain is recommended when the internal carotid artery (ICA) is clamped, because brain damage by ischemia and embolism is possible. Clamping of the ICA results in embolic or ischemic brain lesions in about 7 % of all patients undergoing the procedure. Prophylactic routine insertion of an intraluminal shunt can cause brain embolism and does not reduce the occurrence of complications. Consequently, a shunt should only be inserted, if critical reduction of cerebral perfusion is evident after clamping the ICA. Measurement of carotid stump pressure is an invasive method to estimate perfusion of the brain hemisphere at the clamping side. Transcranial doppler sonography (TCD) measures the mean blood flow velocity in the ACI, but practicability is suffering from technical problems in 20% of all patients. However, TCD is useful for detecting intraoperative embolism and postoperative hyperperfusion. Changes of oxyhaemoglobine and desoxyhaemoglobine concentration in brain tissue can be measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) with wavelengths between 700 and 1000 nm. NIRS measurement is easily performed and reacts quickly to changes of brain tissue oxygenation, but there is still lacking evidence and at present a general recommendation of its application in vascular surgery is not justified. Use of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) is the most widespread cerebral neuromonitoring during vascular surgery due to its high reliability and simple application. Sensitivity and specifity for ischemic lesions are 100% and 94%-99%, respectively. SEP are regarded as the gold standard for cerebral neuromonitoring in anaesthetized patients.","1185":"Vascular surgery carries a high perioperative risk for the patients, because of the high incidence of coexisting diseases with an increased risk of cardiovascular complications. Based on preoperative findings, anaesthetic technique, monitoring and postoperative management are planned. For risk optimization the anaesthetist should have a high theoretical and practical experience in the used anaesthetic techniques and a profound knowledge of the pathophysiological characteristics of the vascular procedures.","1186":"With advancing developments of endovascular techniques, the demands on anaesthesiological management are increasing. The transfemoral implantation of coated endografts in the aorta of cardiopulmonal impaired patients is a particular challenge for the interdisciplinary team. Guided by invasive monitoring, changing blood-pressure targets have to be achieved and in case of serious complications conversion to open surgery must be available immediately.","1187":"","1188":"The care of severely burned patient is still an interdisciplinary challenge. Despite improvements in the understanding of the pathophysiology of burn disease, mortality is high if more than 25 % of body surface area is burned. Mortality increases in the presence of inhalation injury. Initially, the burn trauma leads to a capillary leakage syndrome, resulting in severe hypovolemia. Therefore, adequate volume substitution is the primary therapy to prevent potential life-threatening hypovolemic shock.","1189":"A 31-year old female with left-sided pneumonia was admitted to a district hospital due to progressive dyspnoea. She underwent endotracheal intubation and received a central venous catheter (CVC) via the V. subclavia sinistra. However, chest X-ray showed malposition of the CVC and computed tomography confirmed left-sided serothorax and direct lung puncture of the CVC with its tip in the upper pulmonary vein. The patient was transferred to our hospital. After admission, video-assisted thoracoscopy was performed for removal of the CVC and left-sided pleural decortication. Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. Adequate antibiotic therapy led to resolution of the pneumonia, and the patient was transferred to the normal ward one week after surgery. The further course was uneventful and the patient was discharged home on day 14.","1190":"Intensive care medicine, as well as palliative medicine, is dealing with the limits of life-preserving care. Decision-making in matters of life and death is one of the greatest challenges for physicians, because it may be an area of conflict with regard to aspects of patient autonomy, medical prognosis and the ethics of medical care. At first sight palliative medicine and intensive care medicine seem to be at the opposite ends of care. In palliative medicine, symptom control and alleviation of suffering are the focus of care in order to achieve or maintain the best possible quality of life in patients with incurable, advanced and life-limiting disease. In intensive care medicine, the main focus of care lies on prolongation of life and restoration of health, whenever possible. Approaches, tasks and goals of palliative and intensive care medicine are covering and targeting at different medical situations but are not at opposite ends of care. Shared priorities are pain control and management of other distressing symptoms, alleviation of suffering, comprehensive communication with both, patient and relatives, empathic care that includes the willingness to reflect on end-of-life matters and respect for a human being's dignity. Other common denominators of the team members are: inter-disciplinary teamwork of highly qualified specialists who are able to face and deal with extensive emotional and physical strain, the breaking down of hierarchical structures and team spirit.","1191":"Although Delirium is the most common psychiatric disease in ICU settings, it is recognized late or not at all in up to 84 % of all cases. Translation of the ICDSC, in accordance with ISPOR guidelines and validation by conducting a screening of 68 ICU patients. The translation process was authorized by the original author. The final German translation of the ICDSC showed a sensitivity and specificity of 89 % and 57 % respectively. The ICDSC is suitable for delirium screening by nurses even on ventilated patients. Besides a high sensitivity another advantage is the possibility to screen for a subsyndromal delirium. ","1192":"The main challenge in the surgical treatment of chronic low back pain lies in the poor knowledge of its etiology. Surgery, however, requires the identification of a surgically curable lesion. In cases of radiologically obvious structural spinal disease like stenosis, instability or deformity, surgery is indicated after failure of conservative measures and achieves acceptable success rates. The vast majority of patients, however, demonstrates only unspecific segmental degeneration. Fusion is only somewhat effective and there is no evidence-based data for the abundant modern and less invasive techniques.","1193":"Low back pain is a burden in health policy and medical care. One of the main problems in that field comes from the fact that a minor part of all patients developchronic pain; those claiming for the main part of all costs. The transition from acute to chronic pain is dominated by psychological factors and there is a strong need to identify them at a very early stage of the illness. Concerning diagnostic procedures it is at first necessary to eliminate red flags. Afterwards, treatment is dominated by motivating the patients to intensify their daily activities and to inform them about the harmless nature of non-specific back pain. In case of chronic pain syndromes there is a strong need for interdisciplinary procedures in diagnosis and multiprofessional treatment. Multimodal treatment should be modelled on the concept of functional restoration.","1194":"Back pain is a frequent phenomenon. Published guidelines should be used to avoid unnecessary diagnostic imaging (\"European guidelines for the management of chronic non-specific low back pain\" - www.backpaineurope.org).

It is of decisive importance to make the diagnosis as quickly as possible in order to limit any further spread of the disease.","1197":"The treatment of acute life threatening conditions normally requires intravenous access for further therapeutic measures. In the current guidelines of the European Resuscitation Council (ERC), published in November 2005, the significance of intraosseous access had been newly regulated. Nevertheless two years after publication of these guidelines, intraosseous acccess in adults is still only implemented sporadically. The translation of scientific knowledge into clinical practise takes several years as a general rule. The following article illustrates the basic literature and two case reports, and is designed to inspire trust in a method, which can provide a useful alternative to peripheral venous access for the emergency physician.","1198":"For the first time since the year 2000 the number of death due to substance abuse of illegal drugs has increased in Germany in 2007 (+8 % compared to 2006). Emergency situations due to drug abuse are frequent, particular in big cities. They may be, however, difficult to diagnose and \/ or treat for an emergency physician on scene because of a lack of diagnostic tools, the local and personal surroundings, and the unknown number and nature of drugs. Many drug intoxications must be considered suicidal. On the other hand, drug intoxications may mask (other) life-threatening conditions. Emergency situations due to withdrawal offer the possibility to motivate patients to take advantage of specialist-guided abstinence programs.","1199":"Electrosurgical instruments are routinely used in many applications by the surgeon. In principle, high-frequency electrical currents are used by passing trough tissue for cutting and coagulation. The heat generated by the electrosurgical unit is proportional to the resistance and diameter of the tissue. There are two commonly used electrosurgical modalities: monopolar and bipolar. Since negative side-effects of electrosurgery are possible (e.g. burn, interaction with other electric devices) a proper knowledge of all staff involved in electrosurgery is warranted. In the context of a safe perioperative patient management the anesthesiologist should know basic principles of high-frequency surgery as well.

In the beginning of such a strategy a roller-pump-driven veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was used, which was characterized by high complication rate. Meanwhile the development of a miniaturized ECMO using centrifugal pumps might have improved the safety of use. Recently a pumpless arterio-venous interventional lung assist (iLA) was introduced. While ECMO enables a complete extrapulmonary gas exchange, iLA provides effective CO(2)-elimination. In this review, technical basements, results from clinical studies, incidence of complications and algorithms for clinical use of extracorporeal lung support systems are discussed.","1202":"The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by a maldistribution of pulmonary blood flow towards non-ventilated atelectatic lung areas being the main reason for intrapulmonary right-to-left shunt with the consequence of severe arterial hypoxemia. The application of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is a therapeutic option to selectively influence pulmonary blood flow in order to improve arterial oxygenation and to decrease pulmonary artery pressure without relevant systemic side effects. Although randomized controlled trials demonstrated no survival benefit in patient populations covering the entire severity range of acute lung injury, iNO represents a feasible rescue treatment for ARDS patients with severe refractory hypoxemia and is, therefore, an important option for ARDS therapy in specialized centers.","1203":"Goal of mechanical ventilation is to improve gas exchange and reduce work of breathing without contributing to further lung injury. Besides providing adequate EELV and thereby arterial oxygenation PEEP in addition to a reduction in tidal volume is required to prevent cyclic alveolar collapse and tidal recruitment and hence protective mechanical ventilation. Currently, there is no consensus if and if yes at which price alveolar recruitment with high airway pressures should be intended (\"open up the lung\"), or if it is more important to reduce the mechanical stress and strain to the lungs as much as possible (\"keep the lung closed\"). Potential of alveolar recruitment differs from patient to patient but also between lung regions. Potential for recruitment depends probably more on regional lung mechanics - especially on lung elastance - than on the underlying disease. Based on available data neither high PEEP nor other methods used for alveolar recruitment could demonstrate a survival benefit in patients with ARDS. These results may support an individualized titration of PEEP or other manoeuvres used for recruitment taking into consideration the regional effects. Bedside imaging techniques allowing titration of PEEP or other manoeuvres to prevent end-expiratory alveolar collapse (tidal recruitment) and inspiratory overinflation may be a promising development.","1204":"Despite the implementation of a multimodal concept of treatment, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is still afflicted with high mortality rates. A reasonable application and combination of possible treatment strategies, such as prone position, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), restrictive volume therapy or nitric oxide (NO), requires pathophysiological and epidemiological knowledge. In the following article we describe basic pathophysiological parameters in development, progression and therapy of ARDS. Furthermore, we try to elucidate possible reasons for considerable limitations of multicentric studies in this field.","1205":"","1206":"For the first time since the year 2000 the number of death due to substance abuse of illegal drugs has increased in Germany in 2007 (+8 % compared to 2006).

A broad and fundamental knowledge of the pathophysiologically involved mechanisms of cardiovascular functions during anesthesia and appropriate anesthesiological approach are crucial for a successful peri-operative management. The anesthesiologist's goal is to perform adequate anesthesia while maintaining cardiovascular stability. Monitoring and management of acid-base-status as well as cardiovascular functions are required to maintain sufficient tissue oxygenation during anesthesia. The postoperative anesthesiological management may also crucially influence the further course and therefore should be considered in the anesthesiological planning.

The average prolongation of stay are 4 days, therefore about 2 Million additional hospital days can be determined. In other words about 6 hospitals with 1000 beds each are only caring for patients with healthcare associated infections. Experts agree that careful hand disinfection is the most important procedure to avoid transmission of pathogens. Studies demonstrate that an increasing compliance to hand disinfection leads to a reduction of healthcare associated infections.

Concerning the route of nutritional support there is no difference in mortality but in complication rates. The enteral food ingestion (oral, gastral, jejunal) seems to be superior the intravenous one. But in case of gastrointestinal failure nutritional support is limited to the intravenous route. Increasingly a combined parenteral and enteral nutrition is proposed in cases of malnutrition or expected perioperative complications with delayed enteral food ingestion. Up to now there is no good scientific evidence for such approach.","1230":"","1231":"MRSA has become a major challenge for the health system. The proportion of MRSA in the total collective of Staphylococcus aureus cases in Germany amounts to about 35 %. The further spread of MRSA must be prevented or at least slowed down. There is controversial discussion about which hygienic measures are meaningful. In Germany most people and institutions attempt to follow the recommendations of the Robert Koch Institute. These recommendations include, among others, the isolation of MRSA patients. However, this measure can only be achieved with difficulty and has limited efficacy. It may even happen that MRSA patients are treated less effectively just on account of the isolation and the other extensive measures and may more frequently experience complications. Thus it must be considered whether or not better results would be obtained without isolation when the standard hygienic protocols are strictly observed.","1232":"The endocannabinoid system reduces sensitization processes. Low doses of cannabinoids may enhance the potency of opioid-drugs and reduce the risk of tolerance to opioids. So far no cannabinoid has been approved for the treatment of acute pain due to lack of consistent data. In contrast, a Cannabis Based Medicine spray consisting of delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol has been approved for the treatment of neuropathic pain in patients with multiple sclerosis. The adjunct of cannabidiol and the oromucosal formulation increase the therapeutic index of delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol. The differentiation of analgetic effects and cannabimimetic effects may be increased while compounds--such as ajulemic acid--are used which preferentially act on peripheral cannabinoid receptors and exert receptor independent effects. A further approach in this direction is the use of enzymes which metabolize endocannabinoids.","1233":"A state of agitation occurs in 15-25% of all patients with mental disorder who are seen by pre-hospital emergency physicians (EPs) in the German emergency medical system. Additionally, there is an unknown number of calls due to injury subsequent to violence. Aggression against EPs and paramedics, however, is rare. This paper gives an overview on the models for the onset of aggression, the single stages of agitation and violence, and the stage-dependent steps for de-escalation and crisis intervention in the emergency situation. Action has to be determined but unexcited and, depending on the situation, swift but well coordinated, including psychopharmacotherapy.","1234":"TEE is one of the most versatile modalities for diagnosing and guiding treatment of critically ill patients due to its ease of use at patient bedside, the high quality imaging, the rapid availability of diagnostic information and its low complication rate (2.6%). Numerous studies habe shown a significant diagnostic (67%) and therapeutic (36%) impact on patient management in critically ill patients, particularly in cardiological and cardiosurgical populations.","1235":"Training of medical personnel using simulation techniques is an acknowledged measure of process optimization and quality assurance in a clinical setting. In 2006, a simulator-based training of anaesthesiologists was introduced in the University Medical Centre of Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Germany. The training was performed on a human patient simulator (Meti, Sarasota, USA) and the course was conducted by instructors and engineers from the Simulation Centre Mainz in an operation room equipped with common anaesthesia devices. Special lectures focused at crisis resource management and human errors were held in separate rooms. Parallel daily trainings of 6 physicians and 4 nurses were conducted during 9 days. The training was offered to the anaesthesia personnel of whole Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. A higher and more balanced overall performance of the participants was determined by the instructor teams in comparison to the training results in their own simulation centre. This improved performance was ascribed to the special circumstances of this training namely the familiar surroundings and team members.","1236":"Various supportive and adjunctive therapies to conventional mechanical ventilation have been evaluated in patients with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (e.g. nitric oxide, prone position, surfactant, glucocorticoids). Although some investigations have shown promising improvements in oxygenation and physiological variables, large randomized trials of adjunctive and supportive therapies showed no impact on survival.","1237":"Based on available data, it can be suggested that spontaneous breathing during ventilator support has not to be suppressed even in patients with severe pulmonary dysfunction if no contraindications are present. Experimental data do not support the contention that spontaneous breathing aggravates ventilator-induced lung injury. During spontaneous breathing increase in PTP is maximal in the depended lung areas in adjunct to the diaphragm and causes recruitment of initially atelectatic lung areas thereby avoiding cyclic alveolar collapse and reopening. This should result in a lung protective effect of adequate supported spontaneous breathing. Clinical data supported this belief demonstrating improvement in pulmonary gas exchange, systemic blood flow, and oxygen supply to the tissue and a decrease in days on ventilator support and duration of stay in the intensive care unit.","1238":"Mechanical ventilation has a considerable potential for injuring the lung tissue. Therefore, attention has to be paid to the proper choice of ventilatory mode and settings to secure lung-protective ventilation whenever possible. Such ventilator strategy should account for low tidal volume ventilation (6 ml\/kg PBW), limited plateau pressure (30 to 35 cm H2O) and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). It is unclear whether pressure controlled or volume controlled ventilation with square flow profile is beneficial. The adjustment of inspiration and expiration time should consider the actual breathing mechanics and anticipate the generation of intrinsic PEEP. Ventilatory modes with the possibility of supporting spontaneous breathing should be used as soon as possible.","1239":"Mechanical ventilation may lead to lung injury depending on the ventilatory settings (e.g. pressure amplitudes, endexpiratory pressures, frequency) and the length of mechanical ventilation. Particularly in the inhomogeneously injured lungs of ARDS patients, alveolar overextension results in volutrauma, cyclic opening and closure of alveolar units in atelectrauma. Particularly important appears to be the fact that these processes may also cause biotrauma, i.e. the ventilator-induced hyperactivation of inflammatory responses in the lung. These side effects are reduced, but not eliminated with the currently recommended ventilation strategy with a tidal volume of 6 ml\/kg idealized body weight. It is our hope that in the future optimization of ventilator settings will be facilated by bedside monitoring of novel indices of respiratory mechanics such as the stress index or the Slice technique, and by innovative real-time imaging technologies such as electrical impedance tomography.","1240":"Patients, general public and health insurance funds focus more and more on the quality of medical performance. Anaesthesia related severe morbidity and mortality are unsuitable to judge the quality of an anaesthesia procedure. Other aspects like rapid and comfortable postoperative recovery or satisfaction of the patients with the anaesthesia procedure experience therefore rising attention. With this critical review we aim to give support for appraisal of already published studies and for design and realization of future trials.","1241":"This case report describes the prehospital care of a person after an occupational accident. The amputation of whole extremities is rare and needs a standardized procedure: at first lifesaving procedures are necessary before saving the limb. The work at a conveyor belt resulted in taking of an arm. On the basis of this case report the prehospital management is discussed focalizing the complete treatment of the patient and his amputated extremity as well as the transport from the scene of accident to a suitable hospital.","1242":"Physicians who take a role as flight physicians in a Helicopter Emergency Medical System (HEMS) will encounter more frequently certain emergencies - such as multiple trauma, mass casualties etc. - compared to physicians in a ground based Emergency Medical System (EMS). Furthermore EMS teams already present on scene have a variance of expectations towards HEMS-Physicians. Therefore HEMS-Physicians not only must have the capabilities to treat patients properly, especially under difficult circumstances. Particularly with regard to leadership and Crew Resource Management (CRM) they will be demanded. Not least HEMS-Physicians need to have knowledge of safety and technical aspects of rescue helicopters and of operation tactics as well. Since there has been no uniform or standardised training for physicians, who will take a role in a HEMS, a course concept has been developed to improve and standardise the preparation for this challenging task.","1243":"Teamwork is an often used word. Not every so called team is really one, for team work has to be non-hierarchical, what is usually not given in the clinical environment. Teamwork is in fact clear defined as another form of work organization. The manager has to decide about teamwork or another kind of work depending on the task that has to be performed. Team members have to feature special requirements in order to succeed. That are for instance the ability to deal with conflicts and solution-oriented communication. Especially leading is required in the world of team working. Systematic know-how should be built up. Implement teamwork in an institution ist part of change management and needs external consultancy.","1244":"Perioperative monitoring of core body temperature is a prerequisite for detection of inadvertent hypothermia and its negative consequences. Oral route using rostral sublingual pocket is pre- and postoperatively the method of choice. Intraoperatively, continuous temperature monitoring is desirable, however continual measurement at least every 15 minutes is mandatory. Acceptable semi-invasive alternative methods comprise nasopharyngeal (oral), esophageal, urinary bladder and rectal measurements taking into account specific limiting factors. Ear-based temperature monitoring cannot be recommended because of its considerable inaccuracy.","1245":"The intraoperative perception of pain, anxiety and helplessness is a serious complication of anaesthesia, the frequency is now 0,1-0,2 %. Post-operative memories can cause posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but this will require a consolidation of conscious awareness in the long-term memory. Memory formation is promoted by high emotional contents and a longer duration of awareness. There are defined risk factors for awareness, including patient factors, surgery and anaesthesia technique. In patients with high risk of awareness EEG monitoring can decrease the incidence. Because of lack of evidence, its use in every anaesthesia cases is an option but not a must.","1246":"Muscle relaxing agents are clinically in use for general anaesthesia to optimize the conditions to the endotracheal intubation as well as the surgical conditions. Therefore different musclerelaxants with specific pharmacological characteristics are available. Many factors that depend on the condition of the patient and the used musclerelaxant agent influence the duration of the neuromuscular blockade. Rapid reversal of their effects, particularly in cases of profound blockades, proved to be difficult. In cases of postoperative residual paralysis hypoxic complications because of failure of the ventilation increase the morbidity and mortality of the perioperative period. To avoid these complications in cause of postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade it seems to be necessary to evaluate the status of the muscle function. For the tactile or visual assessment or the objective measurement of stimulation the train-of-four (TOF), double-burst (DBS) or tetanus-stimulation of peripheral nerves like the ulnar nerve may be used. Established methods for the objective monitoring of neuromuscular function is the mechanomyography (MMG), the acceleromyography (AMG), the electromyography (EMG), the kinemyography (KMG) and the phonomyography (PMG). A sufficient recovery of the neuromuscular transmission is reached to a TOF-ratio of 0,9 and should be aimed before the extubation at the end of surgery. No subjective evaluation of the neuromuscular recovery is able to identify residual paralysis above a TOF-ratio of 0,5. Recent studies suggest that objective methods should be used to monitor neuromuscular function to avoid postoperative residual blockades.","1247":"Both, obligatory non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring and adjunctive hemodynamic monitoring need to be considered perioperatively. Patient as well as surgical requirements may contribute to the decision making process. Effectiveness and quality of the perioperative patient monitoring solely depends on the knowledge and awareness of the anesthesist with regard to the potentials and limitations of the applied monitoring.","1248":"","1249":"The recommendations of the German Robert Koch Institute, concerning microbiological screening of newly admitted hospital patients for MRSA colonization, referred to specific risk groups such as patients admitted from long-term care facilities. New literature data indicate that a general MRSA screening policy of all incoming patients may be a cost-effective measure in intensive care units of large tertiary care hospitals.","1250":"A strong tendency toward body enhancement and body forming in western industrial societies makes it more likely for each anesthesiologist to get involved in the care of bodybuilders. These patients quite frequently consume androgenic anabolic steroids, human growth hormone and other drugs or substances which are believed to accelerate muscle gain. Cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, hormonal and infectious side effects or complications are common and rarely monitored by health care professionals. The anesthesia risk is not exactly known but seems to be determined mainly by cardiovascular events like myocardial ischemia and dysrhythmias.","1251":"Post dural puncture headache is one of the most common complications of neuraxial blockade. Its incidence is reported to be as high as 70 %. Its etiology is a loss of cerebrospinal fluid, which can be minimized among other things by the use of small gauge needles. In addition to symptomatic treatments such as bed rest, hydration and administration of analgesics, the application of an epidural blood patch is the treatment of choice, with a success rate over 90 %. However, side effects and rare complications of the epidural blood patch must be carefully considered.","1252":"In spite of decreasing incidence stress-related gastrointestinal bleeding is still an important problem in intensive care medicine. Especially patients with severe sepsis or septic shock are prone to develop lesions of the upper gastrointestinal tract with consecutive bleeding. In order to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding various pharmacological agents are used to either suppress gastric acid or neutralize its effect. The following article presents an update on important aspects of stress-related mucosal disease. It further reviews current literature to provide evidence-based recommendations for stress ulcer prophylaxis in septic patients.","1253":"Founded in 2002, the German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain includes the major institutions, authorities and medical disciplines engaged in therapy and research on Neuropathic pain. Together they work on a better understanding of the pathophysiology, the development of new therapies and the appropriate usage of established interventions for the treatment as well as the prevention of neuropathic pain. The network's central project is the establishment of a data bank, currently including standardized information of more than 1500 patients with neuropathic pain regarding socio-economic, psycho-social, psychological data and the results of quantitative sensory testing (QST), a standardized protocol implemented by the network.","1254":null,"1255":"The decision for an anticoagulant for renal replacement therapy (RRT) in patients with acute renal failure and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) has to be made carefully. Based on results from the literature argatroban is favoured in patients without hepatic dysfunction, referring to its short halftime and easy feasable monitoring. In the case of coexsisting hepatic disorder, danaparoid provides a safe alternative therapy. However, long halftime and the difficult elimination of the substance are unfavourable. Lepirudin represents another possible anticoagulant therapy. Bleeding complications and monitoring of the ecarin clotting time imposes limitations. Experiences with bivalirudin, fondaparinux and prostaglandines are limited and future trials will have to determine the significance of their application in RRT in HIT patients. Furthermore it has to be proven whether the combination of alternative anticoagulants with citrate prolongates circuit halftime of CVVH.","1256":"Anticoagulation plays a pivotal role for the efficacy of continuous renal replacement therapy. The equilibrium between avoiding bleeding complications and keeping the system open considering patients} multiple diseases demands an individual and dynamic reasoned anticoagulation regime. For patients at risk of bleeding citrate anticoagulation has shown high efficacy and lesser bleeding complications than the standard heparin or other alternative anticoagulants such as regional protamin-heparin-, prostaglandin-heparin-anticoagulation or no anticoagulation.","1257":"Acute renal failure is a common condition in intensive care units. The negative impact of acute renal failure on mortality has been demonstrated in recent studies. All critically ill patients should be regarded as a high risk population for renal failure. The optimization of intravasal fluid status and mean arterial pressure are preventive strategies in these patients. The use of nephrotoxic drugs (including radiocontrast media) should be avoided if possible. In cases of established acute renal failure today therapeutic strategies are still limited to best supportive care. The use of diuretics can facilitate fluid balance, however they seem to have an adverse effect on excretional renal function. A number of patients with acute renal failure need extracorporal renal support. Overload of potassium or fluids, severe acidosis, uremic pericarditis or uremic encephalopathy are urgent indications for the start of renal replacement therapy. Small randomized trials give some evidence that an early start of renal replacement therapy may be beneficial in critically ill patients. In this patient group renal replacement therapy should be considered when serum urea concentrations exceed 100mg\/dl and\/or when early signs of indications mentioned above are present. Large randomized multicenter trials have shown that a favourable effect on mortality can only be achieved when renal replacement therapy is supplied with a sufficient dose. Daily hemodialysis or continuous hemofiltration with a filtrate volume of 35ml\/kg\/h is regarded as a standard of care. There is still controversy whether continuous hemofiltration is superior to intermittent hemodialysis. Large meta-analyses could not show a difference in mortality with either one of the two therapy options.","1258":"","1259":"The prevalence of obesity is increasing and a growing number of people with overweight present for surgery. For preoperative evaluation, the patients have to be checked for obesity-related diseases. The assurance whether the equipment can stand the increased stress needs a thorough check up. Although there is no general tendency for a higher rate of difficult intubation or increased rates of aspiration, there is a need of particular consideration. Cardiovascular function as well as tolerance to surgical stress is diminished. Pulmonary function is deterioated and impaired for at least 48 hours after surgery, which also applies to renal, hepatic function and to coagulation and glucose hemostasis. The pharmacokinetics of most anaesthetics is altered in view of initial distribution, elimination and duration of effects. Obese people without significant impairments are suitable for ambulatory surgery.","1260":"The non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has been practiced successfully for years in the clinical routine. Now this therapeutic option should be transferred in the pre hospital emergency service. But there are many risks, they must be mentioned: As a matter of fact an effective clinical therapy can not be brought to the streets easily - even if there are good and well-tried conservative therapies and just at last just a few patients.","1261":"Non-invasive ventilation has not yet been established in prehospital emergency medicine. This most likely due to missing technical prerequisites. Meanwhile emergency ventilators feasible for prehospital NIV are available. Recognizing the pathophysiology of acute respiratory insufficiency, treatment with NIV is superior in comparison to treatment with oxygen and medication only. The advantages of NIV may lead to reduced morbidity and mortality as long as attention is paid to possible contraindications.","1262":"On the basis of a case report the prehospital management of a newborn child with deep accidental hypothermia (22oC) is discussed. The child was found in a garbage can. The continuous resuscitation during the transport into the clinic is done in an incubator and the child survives without neurologic damages. The used measures of the resuscitation are discussed on the basis of the therapy.","1263":"The German society \"Anaesthesia in Developing Countries\" aims at improving the anaesthetic care in the so called Third World. Main fields of activity are training\/qualification and technical support, chiefly in East African countries; only recently steps towards the French speaking countries of Black Africa have been taken.","1264":"Mass casualty events make demands on emergency services and disaster control. However, optimized in- hospital response defines the quality of definitive care. Therefore, German federal law governs the role of hospitals in mass casualty incidents. In hospital casualty surge is depending on resources that have to be expanded with a practicable alarm plan. Thus, in-hospital mass casualty management planning is recommended to be organized by specialized persons. To minimise inhospital patient overflow casualty surge principles have to be implemented in both, pre-hospital and in-hospital disaster planning. World soccer championship 2006 facilitated the initiation of surge and damage control principles in in-hospital disaster planning strategies for German hospitals. The presented concept of strict control of in-hospital patient flow using surge principles minimises the risk of in-hospital breakdown and increases definitive hospital treatment capacity in mass casualty incidents.","1265":"Patients suffering cardiac arrest still have a poor prognosis. Up to the present, no drug therapy has shown to improve longterm survival after cardiac arrest. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or massive pulmonary embolism (PE) are the underlying causes for sudden cardiac arrest in 50-70 % of patients. Thrombolysis is an effective and causal therapy in patients with AMI or PE. Therefore, combining cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with thrombolysis may be a promising therapeutic approach. Experimental studies have demonstrated that thrombolytic therapy during CPR is not only a causal treatment for coronary or pulmonary arterial thrombi, but may also improve microcirculatory reperfusion after cardiac arrest. Although numerous case series and small clinical studies showed evidence for the success of thrombolytic therapy during CPR, a large randomised study did not confirm these results. Thrombolysis during CPR today can not be recommended as a standard therapy in patients suffering cardiac arrest. However, it should be considered if a massive PE is supposed to be the cause of cardiac arrest or if conventional CPR has not been successful in a patient with presumed thrombotic cause of cardiac arrest. The expected bleeding risk is outweighed by the potential benefit of this therapy in selected patients.","1266":"The early reperfusion of the occluded epicardial coronary artery and the antithrombotic therapy is of eminent importance in the management of the acute myocardial infarction with ST-segment-elevation. The emergency physician has a key role in establishing the diagnosis and deciding about the therapy. The following article describes modern concepts and the evidence of the emergency management of patients with myocardial infarction.","1267":"","1268":"Hospital clothing worn by medical personnel in German hospitals can be divided into two groups, work clothing and protective clothing. Work clothing is not changed between patient visits and hence is no measure of infection control. Its function is to protect private clothing and to identify medical personnel. Protective clothing on the other hand should protect staff and patients from nosocomial infections. It has to be changed between patient visits and is especially recommended with invasive procedures and immunocompromised patients.","1269":"Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC) are considered a main factor increasing postoperative morbidity and mortality. Medical history and clinical examination are highly predictive for the development of PPC. Extended evaluation is indicated in the presence of pulmonary symptoms. Prophylaxis of PPC includes cessation of smoking, antiinfectious measures, optimization of bronchodilator therapy and improvement of cardiac performance. Regional anesthesia is favorable in the presence of bronchial hyperreactivity and for postoperative pain therapy. Postoperative course includes early extubation besides positioning, relief of intrabdominal pressure and physiotherapy.","1270":"The prehospital management of geriatric patients involves an understanding of the physiology of aging and necessitates the special acknowledgement of diagnosis and treatment of emergencies in the elderly. It is essential to keep in mind the prevention of an underestimation of the severity of disease and the necessity of an adequate therapy. The prehospital management of moribund patients gains special importance.","1271":"In the parturient as well as in the pregnant patient with neurological disease, surgery is necessary more frequently than in healthy pregnants. Most pregnancies of these patients will result in a slightly increased rate for cesarean section. The focus of anesthesia care is mostly to avoid damage to the fetus, in some pathologies to protect the mother. Pregnancy itself may change the course of pre-existent chronic neurological diseases such as epileptic seizure, multiple sclerosis, or myasthenia gravis. Other diseases will have their onset predominantly in pregnancy such as back pain, nerve compression syndromes, some brain tumors or cerebrovascular events. Subarachnoidal hemorrhage and intracranial bleeding contribute to 65 % of maternal mortality. Finally, pregnancy induced conditions such as eclampsia and HELLP syndrome and its management are reviewed where the concerns for the nervous system have high relevance for anesthesiological management. Anesthesia care for the pregnant and the parturient presenting with a neurological disease requires 1.) expertise with neuroanesthesia and obstetric anesthesia care, 2.) accurate physical examination of the neurological system preoperatively, 3.) safe choice and conductance of the anesthesia technique (mostly regional anesthesia) 4.) avoidance of unfavorable drug effects for the fetus and the nervous system of the mother and 5.) intraoperative neuromonitoring together with the control of the fetal heart rate.","1272":"Preclinical occuring tachyarrhythmias could represent a life-threatening situation. Signs of haemodynamically instability like systolic blood pressure &lt;90mmHg, heart rate &gt;150\/min, chest pain, heart failure, and reduced conscious level should rapidly be recognized. Immediately treatment using electrical cardioversion is then indicated. A therapeutic option in patients with haemodynamically stable tachycardia is the application of an antiarrhythmic drug. The following case describes the preclinical treatment of a patient with a haemodynamically unstable reentry-tachycardia. In the after-care clinic an electrophysiological evaluation reveals the existence of a reentry-tachycardia induction and clarifies the pathophysiology. In symptomatic tachycardias, catheter ablation is the method of choice.","1273":null,"1274":"What is quality, what is quality management? Who is responsible for quality management in a hospital?

Many of the prescribed drugs can be omitted during the perioperative period. However, perioperative cessation of certain drug therapies may cause decompensation of primarily compensated diseases. After reading this CME article, the reader should be able to decide whether any cardiovascular, pulmonary or antidiabetic drug therapy should be continued or ceased during the perioperative period, respectively.","1276":"Prior to an operation, patients experience a high degree of stress and internal tension. Preoperative drug administration (premedication) is intended to reduce these stresses through anxiolytic and sedative effects. On account of their good anxiolytic actions, there excellent tolerability and only few side effects benzodiazepines are most frequently used for this purpose. To support the induction and continuation of sleep, premedication is usually initiated in the evening before operation with the administration of a benzodiazepine with middle- or long-term activity. The standard drug for the day of operation is the short-acting benzodiazepine midazolam, under the action of which the patient may be transferred to the operation room in a drowsy and calm state. The onset of action of drugs applied as preoperative medication is delayed. Thus, it is of major importance that the premedication be administered at the appropriate time point so that the patient really is shielded fro preoperative stress at the time of the drug's optimal effect. Although midazolam is not the ideal substance for all situations where an anxiolytic premedication is needed, with the exception of a few special indications, no decisive advantages over other drugs have been demonstrated in comparative trials.","1277":"","1278":"An obvious trend of concentrating treatment options on specialized centres may take effect later in an increased need for inter-hospital transfer. Patients initially referred to secondary or tertiary hospitals require a safe and systematically organised transport in order to ensure a continuation of initiated actions in intensive care. This review will focus of appropriate preparations, equipment and transport modalities, possible sources of shortcomings as well as solutions of conflicts during inter-hospital transfers.","1279":"Acute stress-related hyperglycemia is a condition, commonly observed in patients following major surgical procedures, trauma as well as life-threatening illness.

The post-operative delirium is stated in literature to occur in 15 % to 50 % of patients, whereby up to 80 % of patients requiring intensive care with artificial respiration develop a delirium. The delirium correlates with the length of hospital stay and leads to a tripple rate of the six-month-mortality. Nu-DESC, developed by Gaudreau et al. is a measuring instrument for the clinical diagnostics of deliriums which is quickly operable, care-based and which can thus be easily integrated in everyday routine. The aim of this study was the translation of Nu-DESC from English as basis for the use in clinical research and routine. The translation process was conducted in accordance with the internationally acknowledged guidelines of Translation and Cultural Adaptation of Patient Reported Outcomes Measures - Principles of Good Practice (PGP). An interim German version was developed from 3 independently devised translations, a back-translation of which was then conducted by a registered state-approved translator. The back-translation was then presented to the author of the original for evaluation. The back-translation of the German translation was authorised by the author of the original. On the basis of the cognitive debriefing results which were consistently very good to good, the translation process could be finalised and the final German version of Nu-DESC could be passed by the expert team. An evaluation of the German Nu-DESC regarding its practicability showed significant differences between doctors and nursing staff. The German version of Nu-DESC provides an instrument for evaluating the delirium in the area of clinical routine and research.

Georg Marckmann is the coordinator of the project \"Forschungsverbund Allokation\", which was established to examine how to ration medical therapies in an economic and ethical way. The aim of the study is to create standards to take the burden from the physicians and enable decisions about the use of expensive therapies on a higher level.","1283":"Helicopter emergency services (HEMS) carrying doctors trained in emergency medicine represent a well established system for primary care with increasing professionalism since their implementation in the seventies until now. However, considerable differences persist in Europe concerning the structure as well as integration of the system in the entire organisation of area-wide demands. Based on the particular geographic conditions in the alps which are highly associated with challenges for man and material a dense network of helicopter airbases has been established. Hence, this system accounts for the social, economical and touristic requirements of this region in terms of providing sufficient emergency medical treatment. In addition to statutory and professional provisions qualification requirements for emergency doctors comprehend extensive alpine training. Primarily this provides personal safety as well as security for the entire team and the patient which particularly applies for technical rope rescue. Advanced all-season training is compulsory due to seasonal differences in casualties. Well harmonized training with cross-border validity is not available to-date. Hence, the development of obligatory standard operating procedures should be the major goal of medical associations and societies.","1284":"Microcirculatory dysfunction, reduced oxygen supply and thus impaired hepatosplanchnic organ function, play a pivotal role in the clinical manifestation of sepsis and septic shock. Early correction of the perfusion mismatch is essential to maintain end-organ and gut mu-cosa barrier function and thus to prevent bacterial translocation, bacteraemia and possible multiple organ failure. This review will outline the clinical tightrope-walk optimizing hepa-tosplanchnic oxygen supply while maintaining adequate end-organ perfusion pressure and highlight the diagnostic challenges and limitations faced in clinical practice.","1285":"Besides adequate and early antimicrobial therapy, goal-directed haemodynamic in-terventions are crucial for survival of severe sepsis and septic shock. Although cardiac output often is restored in the early phase of sepsis syndrome significant left- and right ventricular impairment may already be present. Clinical presentation, invasive blood pressure tracing and echocardiographic evaluation are pivotal for early recognition, diagnosis and monitoring of therapeutic interventions.","1286":"In severe sepsis and septic shock the severe impairment of the microcirculation is one of the main reasons for tissue hypoxia, multiple organ failure and death. Fast resuscitation of the microvascular blood flow to improve the reduced functional capillary density is necessary. Based scientific evidence, an early haemodynamic stabilisation directed by predefined haemodynamic and metabolic goals and the application of activated protein C (rhAPC) according to the guidelines could be recommended. The specific effects of dobutamine and rhAPC on the microcirculation as well as the effects selective inhibitors of iNOS or vasodilators may be therapeutic options in the future.","1287":"","1288":"The S2e Guidelines for sedation practice of the German Society for Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care recommend a clear prior definition of depth of sedation to be achieved in a given case, monitoring of depth of sedation by means of scoring systems, appropriate selection of analgesics and sedatives and the use of patient-oriented treatment regimens. These measures not only reduce significantly length of artificial respiration, length of time spent on the intensive care unit and overall length of stay in the hospital but also the frequency of complications. Therefore, implementation of the Guidelines will result in significant reductions in costs in a given case. This is a decisive economic benefit for any hospital working under the restraints of the DRG system.","1289":"The prevalence of obesity is high in Germany, almost half of the population are overweight. Hence emergency doctors are increasingly confronted with obese patients for whom special anatomical and physiological factors need to be considered.

In contrast, sodium nitroprusside is the substance of choice for intraoperative control of blood pressure. alpha-blocking agents may be used in phaeochromocytoma but only under sufficient alpha-blockade. Removal of a malignant tumour of the adrenal gland may induce massive haemorrhage, and thus anaesthetic management has to be modified.","1291":"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation of a child is a rare, emotionally affective, challenging and potentially frightful event. Current guidelines have been largely simplified to facilitate teaching and retention, to encourage bystander resuscitation, and to improve the quality of resuscitation by healthcare professionals. This article is a practical approach to the current european guidelines (ERC), including basic and advanced life support algorithms, as well as recommendations on the post-resuscitation periode and parental presence.","1292":"In Germany the economical framework of the health system in general and the hospitals in particular has changed dramatically over the last years. The conversion of funding to DRGs has implicated a reduction of budgets. The apportioning of budgets by keys of officially calculating hospitals forces single departments and disciplines to choose financial goals of a hospital as their particular interest and not the financial goals of a department. The calculation of a budget for a department of anaesthesia and\/or intensive care medicine is possible from fractions of all DRGs, that have been generated inside a hospital within a period of one year. However, this calculation comprises some problems, because anaesthesia and intensive care medicine are interdisciplinary disciplines, which cannot influence its achievements and its processes solely by its own, but are dependent on efficiency and quality of its partners. Internal cost allocation for improving processes seems not to be sensible in the system of DRGs as long as it is used not only as an instrument of controlling, but also as an instrument of benchmarking.","1293":"An increasing number of children who have undergone corrective surgery for congenital heart disease (CHD) reach adulthood every year. These survivors defy commonly used classification schemes for adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery. Due to lack of data, the risk-benefit assessment for undergoing non-cardiac interventions must be individualized. An interdisciplinary team approach is the corner stone for the safe delivery of anesthesia to this patient population. This review is meant to equip the anesthesiologist with the necessary tools for the safe perioperative sailing of his patient suffering from CHD.","1294":"Diagnostic and interventional paediatric cardiology has become an increasing field of activity for anaesthesiologist in recent times. Besides a close interdisciplinary cooperation, the exact knowledge of the pathophysiology of the congenital heart diseases is essential. Especially the spectrum of interventional paediatric cardiology has extended considerably. In addition to traditionally intervention such as atrial septal defect closure and embolization of a patent ductus arteriosus, today's indications are also valvuloplasty and angioplasty as well as ventricular septal defects.","1295":"Anesthesiologists involved in the care of children with congenital heart disease (CHD) have to understand the pathophysiology of each cardiac lesion and anticipate the impact of the planned procedure. Often the dimished margin of hemodynamic stability determines the guidelines of care. In children with CHD maintainance of the homeostasis during anesthesia for a wide variety of procedures is the anesthesiologist's challenge. Left-to-right shunting means a volume load to the left ventricle frequently combined with pulmonary hypertension. Right-to-left shunting leads to a central cyanosis.","1296":"","1297":"The treatment of acute lung injury is one of the most challenging tasks in intensive care medicine. Conventional therapeutic options cover lung protective mechanical ventilation with low tidal volumes and adequate PEEP, restrictive fluid management, prone positioning, and early recruitment maneuvers. These options should be used in parallel and should be accompanied by a suitable anti-infective therapy. In cases of refractory hypoxemia, inhaled nitric oxide offers in most patients a successful rescue option. In specialized centers the application of ECMO remains as a final ultima ratio.","1298":"The noble gas xenon, besides its anaesthetic and analgesic properties, shows many characteristics of an ideal anaesthetic agent. However, due to high production costs, its application is limited In daily clinical routine. Recent studies suggested not only outstanding haemodynamic stability and rapid emergence from anaesthesia, but also xenon's capacity to mediate protection against ischaemic damage in various organs and tissues. Since xenon is devoid of toxicity and relevant side effects, it could be beneficial at least in a subset of patients at high risk, and xenon therefore may become a reasonable alternative in this patient population.","1299":"According to data of international hemovigilance registries, transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) has emerged as the leading cause of transfusion-related mortality. Errors in the transfusion process, leading to ABO incompatible transfusion, represent the second most frequent cause of transfusion-related mortality, while infection risks of transfusion declined significantly. The following article describes the clinical picture of TRALI, its pathogenesis, diagnostic criteria as well as therapy recommendations and discusses possible preventing measures.","1300":"A young man squeezed both hands in a bending machine with the result of complex hand injuries. Because of a high risk for general anesthesia, operation as well as postoperative analgesia was performed under bilateral brachial plexus block with the axillary approach. We discuss the considerations concerning the possible approaches with bilateral anesthesia of the brachial plexus under consideration of side effects and effectiveness. The needed dosage of the local anesthetics will be discussed.","1301":"Within recent years patient safety has become increasingly important. Within US hospitals more than 98.000 deaths have been reported annually due to medical errors, more than 80 % due to preventable mistakes. To improve patient safety it is therefore important to develop training tools, which center on the complexity of preventable mistakes, analyze underlying factors and eventually train to deal with them. Since the Berlin Simulation training was founded in 1997 it focused on the internationally accepted \"global approach\" based on three phases of briefing, simulation and debriefing. It concentrates on the reasons of preventable mistakes and their interaction. Problem solving strategies and the application of NTS ( planing, management, teamwork and communication) and TS (sound scientific knowledge and abilities) are practiced under the supervision of experienced trainers. The goal is to provide insight into the cascades of error and terminate them, to ultimately increase patient safety and provider satisfaction.","1302":"In the present case a reconstruction of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligament is planned. In general, major surgery of the knee as well as reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament is very painful. Continuous peripheral nerve blocks provide good analgesia and are superior to parenteral opioids concerning quality of analgesia and mobility and postoperative range of motion of the knee. Compared to the neuraxial catheters, cPNB have less side effects.","1303":"Patients admitted to an intensive care unit with the diagnosis \"polytrauma\" differ from other patients by their typical trauma-associated morbidity (diffusive bleeding, traumatic brain injury, lung contusion), and by the staged surgical treatment of multiple injuries. The complexity of the clinical picture, and the complexity of the chronological order of the operative phases require a close cooperation of the medical specialist disciplines involved. The perioperative morbidity and mortality of polytrauma victims has been reduced significantly within the last 30 years due to an adapted transfusion- and substitution regime (rational utilization of anemia tolerance, calculated substitution of coagulation factors), due to modern therapeutic regimes for the patient with traumatic brain injury (stabilization of cerebral perfusion pressure, stabilization of adequate cerebral oxygenation), and due to the modern therapeutic strategies of mechanical ventilation (lung-protective ventilation, kinetic therapy, non-invasive ventilation). The aim of this review is to describe these modern therapeutic principles of the intensive care unit treatment of the polytrauma patient.","1304":"Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) provides a structured and efficient approach to the treatment of patients with multiple trauma in the emergency department. The performance of a well functioning interdisciplinary trauma team coordinated by an experienced trauma leader plays a pivotal role during the initial phase of patient care. The team's primary task is to establish and maintain stable vital signs by ensuring adequate oxygenation and fluid resuscitation while diagnostic or immediate life saving interventions and procedures are initiated. The following article describes the management of patients with multiple injuries in the emergency department based on the ATLS algorithm.","1305":"The prehospital management of patients with severe trauma should focus on stabilization of vital signs. Major goal is the early transport in a specialized trauma center. After immobilization of cervical spine maintenance of oxygen delivery is the primary and most important intervention. Unconscious patients and patients with respiratory distress should receive endotracheal intubation and controlled ventilation on scene. Amounts of Infusion should be decided on blood loss, patients with traumatic brain injury need at least a normotensive blood pressure. Patients with uncontrolled severe bleeding should not receive excessive infusion before urgent surgical treatment can be performed. Prehospital induction of anesthesia must be carefully considered because of the enhanced risk.","1306":"","1307":"On the basis of a case report the prehospital management of severely burned patients is discussed. The prevention of hypovolemia, hypothermia or hypoxemia are the primary targets. It is necessary to estimate the burn size and depth. The burn shock fluid resuscitation, prevention of hypothermia, pain- and airway management are described as well as the transport from the scene of accident to a proximal emergency unit or to a specialized burn intensive care unit.","1308":"Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a rare, often life-threatening complication of general anaesthesia. The timely diagnosis of an MH crisis in onset, as a prerequisite for successful therapy, can be difficult for the anaesthetist because of the few and non-specific early symptoms. This is even more so in patients in whom anaesthesia with MH trigger substances has already been performed in the past without any particular complications so leading to a false sense of security with regard to MH sensitivity. The case presented is a healthy young man with a congenital cleft lip, jaw and palette who developed a fulminant MH crisis during his ninth general anaesthesia. Post-operative research into the course of the previous anaesthesias revealed signs of MH crises which however proceeded abortively and were therefore unnoticed. In the case presented, the diagnosis was additionally complicated by the untypical course of the early symptoms. Tachycardia which in 80 % of cases is described as the first symptom of an MH crisis in onset, was at first completely absent and was only moderately pronounced in the full clinical picture of MH. On the other hand, a steady increase in body temperature, a cardinal symptom which usually appears later, was registered early. The suspected diagnosis of MH was then finally confirmed in the fourth hour after start of anaesthesia on the basis of the repeatedly increased end expiratory CO(2) levels. These could not otherwise be explained although several respiratory corrections were performed. Despite immediate MH specific therapy, the crisis developed in the following hour into the full clinical picture: maximum temperature of 41.4 degrees C, end expiratory CO(2) 100mm Hg, consumptive coagulopathy, acute renal failure and shock (systolic blood pressure &lt; 50mm Hg, heart rate 115\/minute). After 2 hours of specific intensive therapy, the patient was finally stabilized and transfer to the intensive care unit was possible. 24 hours after the event, the patient was could be extubated without any complications and 2 days later, he was transferred to the normal ward. The intra-operative diagnosis of MH was confirmed 3 days later by means of genetic analysis. Two mutations of the RYR1 gene were identified.","1309":"In the year 2006 over 1000 liver transplantation (LTX) were performed in Austria, Germany and Switzerland. The feasible association of liver failure with pathologic affections of all other organ systems requires a thorough examination of the potential liver host and a carefully guided anaesthesia. A comprehensive monitoring of the patient and an elaborate therapeutic concept is necessary to meet the peculiar pathophysiologic conditions during LTX. This report describes the anaesthesiological relevant aspects of the LTX and provides suitable therapeutic options.","1310":"Since economization of medicine continues, marketing is becoming more and more important. To shape marketing activities in correspondence with their professional ethics, physicians need some basic knowledge about marketing. The process of marketing consists of SWOT-analysis, market segmentation, market differentiation, positioning and the marketing-mix with ist most important component, the marketing communication. Specific aspects in the marketing of medical services derive from their nature as a service and the determinants of perceived service quality.","1311":"Invasive monitoring is rarely used in children undergoing routine anaesthesia. Therefore the management of fluid therapy and its maintenance depends often on the experience of the anaesthetist. In situations of high volume uptake and during critical surgical procedures haemodynamic state can easily be underestimated and hypovolaemic episodes remain undetected. This article summarises recent developments of less invasive and continuous monitoring techniques available for paediatric use which probably represent a useful addition in optimising the perioperative haemodynamic performance.","1312":"The purposes of perioperative fluid therapy are to balance deficits that have occurred preoperatively, to realize the continuous infusion of maintenance requirements referred to body weight an to effect a correction of the intraoperative losses of water, electrolytes and blood components. Premature and new-born infants as well as children at risk for hypoglycaemia should additionally receive glucose in order to stabilise the glucose concentration and metabolism. Full electrolyte solutions containing 1 % glucose are sufficient. In cases with larger volume requirements, the circulatory system can be stabilized by the additional infusion of a glucose-free full electrolyte solution. Also in the cases of small children, artificial colloids may also be administered additionally. The efficacy of fluid and volume therapy should be controlled by an appropriately adapted circulation monitoring and regular blood gas analyses, especially for major interventions.","1313":null,"1314":"Regional anesthesia has many advantages as intraoperative and more important as postoperative analgesia in pediatric anesthesia. There are special requirements for a sufficient acute pain management in preterms, newborns and small infants. This review focuses these special features regarding to local anesthetics and supplements, caudal and spinal anesthesia, and peripheral blockades.","1315":"","1316":"The criteria for the diagnosis of the atypical facial neuralgia make it is possible to classify under this neurological diagnosis also psychiatric disorders as conasthetic depression. In two case reports it is told about patients with both diagnosis. Due to this they were treated with an atypical neurolepticum (Olanzapine) to reach three targets: Therapy of the depression, pain i.e. atypical facial neuralgia and mood stabilizing. Within the last four years there were no side-effects as EPMS to observe.","1317":"No patient needs to have pain? Providing the best possible pain relief is as challenging for the anaesthesiologist as it is necessary for the patient's quality of life. The WHO algorithm allows sufficient and satisfactory treatment of 90 % of all cancer patients. This case report describes alternatives to the WHO algorithm for the remaining 10 % of cases. The alternatives concern opioid rotation, intravenous administration, and neuroaxial application. Indications for these alternative strategies are either opiod-insensitive incidental pain or neuropathic pain. Procedure and complications are discussed with the reader.","1318":"Adequate nutrition of the critically ill patient is a cornerstone of intensive care medicine. While the enteral route should be used whenever possible, parenteral supplementation of insufficient enteral nutrition has been shown to be beneficial and is not considered to be lethal anymore. The daily energy supply should not exceed 20-30 kcal\/kgBW in the acute phase of the illness. Vitamins and trace elements should be supplied daily to avoid any deficiency.","1319":"The management of a nuclear, biological or chemical mass casualties event (MCE) is a great challenge for emergency medical services and the hospitals of the region. Planing, exactly prepared protocols, adequate resources, instructions and extended training are the most important elements for successfull management of the MCE. This review presents a concept of managing a MCE including recognizing the threat, personal protection, evacuation, lifesaving procedures, decontamination, treatment, transport, hospital management, as well as procedures to avoid further contamination and panic.","1320":"In volume-controlled mechanical ventilation with constant inspiratory gas flow, which is most often used during general anesthesia, only the end-expiratory airway pressure (PEEP) has to be set by the user. Inspiratory airway pressures result from the combination of tidal volume and respiratory compliance as well as instantaneous gas flow and respiratory resistance. Given a normal respiratory compliance of 50-60 ml\/mbar in mechanically ventilated patients, a driving pressure of 7-10 mbar is necessary for a tidal volume of about 6 ml\/kg predicted body weight. The profile of airway pressure over time offers valuable information about respiratory mechanics. However, since the respiratory settings have a tremendous influence on the airway pressure-time profile, its interpretation has to be performed knowing the specific ventilator settings like inspiratory gas flow, presence or absence of an inspiratory pause and respiratory rate. Surprisingly, PEEP does not improve gas exchange in an unselected group of patients, although PEEP decreases the size of atelectasis and atelectasis can be detected after induction of anesthesia in 90% of adult patients. However, in obese patients gas exchange improves significantly when PEEP is applied. Furthermore, PEEP increases the apnoea interval tolerated without desaturation and thereby increases the safety margin during induction of anesthesia. If atelectasis shall be completely recruited, an airway pressure of 40 cm H2O is needed for 40 seconds. In order to avoid a severe drop in arterial blood pressure which may be accompanied by cardiac arrhythmia, such a recruitment manoeuvre should only be performed in normovolemic patients.","1321":"The oxygen reserves of infants are low because of high oxygen demand in combination with low transport capacity. Respiratory adverse events are one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality during paediatric anaesthesia. During the last years our knowledge has grown substantially about the influence of artificial airways on the airway of paediatric patients. Modern anaesthetic concepts in infants and children include the use of cuffed tubes as well as a spontaneous breathing child.","1322":"All patients receive oxygen perioperatively during general anesthesia. It is easy to provide and relatively inexpensive. However, the oxygen concentration varies widely not only between different operation procedures but also between different countries. There is, so far, no general accepted guideline or agreement about an optimal inspiratory oxygen concentration. In the last years, many studies demonstrated that the choice of a certain inspiratory oxygen fraction influences not only the intraoperative but also the postoperative outcome of the patient. Supplemental oxygen improves immune function leading to a decreased rate of wound infections. In addition, a drop in the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) was observed with a higher concentration of oxygen. Unfavourable but inevitable is the formation of atelectasis induced by a high oxygen concentration.","1323":"","1324":"Concerning the current discussion about cardiovascular toxicity of the selective COX-2 inhibitors, recently advertised in the media as a new milestone in the management of pain, culminating in the market withdrawal of the preparations Vioxx (rofecoxib) in 2004 and Bextra (valdecoxib) in 2005, the classical NSAIDs are now spotlighted. How safe are the \"well established\" NSAIDs regarding adverse cardiovascular events? Long term studies now show a similar overall risk compared to the selective COX-2 inhibitors. The short lasting perioperative administration of both drug classes are still indicated. However, even here they should be only used after a systematic risk-calculation and not on a routine basis.","1325":"After collapsing, a 70-year-old patient with certain comorbidities developed an extensive hematoma of the lower leg because of anticoagulation-therapy. For operative intervention the patient received general anesthesia, because of the risk of bleeding. As a consequence a severe hypotonia occurred with renal failure. For revision, the patient received peripheral regional anesthesia despite an elevated bleeding risk. Risk-benefit analysis in case of an elevated bleeding risk while performing peripheral regional anesthesia will be discussed.","1326":"This case report describes the prehospital care of a person with severe polytrauma due to being jammed in a vehicle in a traffic accident. After understanding the forces involved in causing the trauma, the therapy of impaired vital functions is demonstrated with particular regard to time management. Use of a rescue helicopter allowed for minimizing the delay to initial treatment as well as the duration of transport.","1327":"The abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is a life threatening disorder in critically ill patients caused by rapidly decreasing intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) &gt; 12 mm Hg, which may result in multiple organ dysfunctions with a possibly fatal outcome. Under various causes for the development of an ACS, pelvic trauma, volume resuscitation after severe hemorrhage and reperfusion after aortic aneurysm repair as well as intra-abdominal packing figure at the first place. An increased BMI is a risk factor for patients to suffer from ACS. In addition, excessive volume requirement and significantly increasing airway pressures within the first 24 hrs after admission in the ICU are indicators for an impending ACS. Increased IAP causes venous stasis and arterial malperfusion of all intra- and extra-abdominal organs thus resulting in ischemia, hypoxia and necrosis. In parallel, respiratory, cardiocirculatory, renal, intestinal and cerebral decompensation can be registered. Final multiorgan failure has a mortality around 60-70 %. Timely diagnosis of ACS remains sometimes difficult in spite of clinical indicators such as increased airway pressure, hypoxia, oliguria, shock and acidosis. For the early recognition of intra-abdominal hypertension repetitive measurement of the intra-vesical pressure (&gt; 20 mm Hg) can be helpful. Besides intensive care treatment with artificial ventilation, circulatory support with volume and catecholamines, the decision for a prompt abdominal decompression and open abdominal treatment is life-saving and can preserve further functional damage to vital organ systems.","1328":"As alternative for drug administration, the intraosseous access is an important option in emergency medicine. Plasma concentrations of drugs, safety and rapidity as well as rate of complications are comparable to the intravenous access. These findings are reflected in the recent resuscitation guidelines, which recommend intraosseous access as an alternative to intravenous access both in children and adults, considering the tracheal route as backup only if the other two options fail. Rescuers should learn safe techniques of establishing an intraosseous access. Equipment of rescue vehicles with adequate devices for children and adults should be considered standard.","1329":"Paediatric neurosurgical procedures request special considerations for the anaesthetic management. Due to patients age and diagnostic findings certain therapeutic procedures are performed under anaesthetic care. Main reasons for craniotomy are hydrocephalus, intracranial tumors and craniofacial synostosis. Neurosurgical therapy of newborn children is related mostly to hereditary spinal dysraphism. In spinal surgery and specific intracranial procedures for monitoring reasons sensory and\/or motor evoked potentials (SEP, MEP) are used to improve surgical outcome. Due to sensibility for anaesthetic drugs these techniques request sound knowledge of physiologic and pharmacologic interaction. Cerebrovascular malformations are today usually treated using radiologic interventional procedures. Operative access will be performed for selected cases additionally to embolization, but is associated with risk of massive bleeding. Severe traumatic craniocerebral injury leads to compromised cerebral blood flow and hypoxic ischemia. The article imparts funded knowledge of surgical as well as anaesthetic rationale and techniques in neuropaediatric therapies.","1330":"Due to the complexity of neurosurgical and neuroradiologic interventions and diagnostic procedures in pediatric patients the anesthesiologist is particularly challenged. Anesthesiological management in neuropediatric interventions necessitates both profound knowledge of pediatric anesthesia and thorough understanding of neurological pathophysiology. This review describes in detail neuropediatric anesthesiology with an emphasis on airway management, intraoperative positioning, volume therapy and intraoperative monitoring.","1331":"","1332":"","1333":"An 84-year-old patient with a fracture of the humerus suffered from severe pain. Analgesia was not sufficient using opioids. Because of a chronic heart disease a blockade of the brachial plexus was used for analgesia without any technical examination. The necessity of different medical examinations before block performance will be discussed.","1334":"Hypothermia after out of hospital cardiac arrest should be clinical practice for years. But is it really meanwhile daily trained practice? A survey at northern German hospitals gives an answer to this question.","1335":"After cardiac arrest, mortality in the postresuscitation period is still up to 70%. Therefore, optimal intensive care of these patients is of great importance. This article summarizes current knowledge and recommendations for postresuscitation care. Particular focus is given to mild therapeutic hypothermia. This is currently the only therapeutic concept for which randomized clinical trials have shown improved survival and neurological outcome after cardiac arrest.","1336":"Restrictive and obstructive pulmonary diseases are major risk factors of perioperative morbidity and mortality. The incidence of pulmonary complications may be in the range of 3 and 40% (3), depending on the underlying disease and the type of surgery. In this review the specific pathophysiology, preoperative evaluation and suitable anesthesia procedures are discussed for patients with restrictive and obstructive pulmonary diseases.","1337":"","1338":"A participant of the annual Hamburg marathon collapses on the finish line. Medics at the scene find a conscious patient and prepare transport to the finish area medical center. During transport the patient becomes unconscious and pulseless. The medics immediately perform basic life support and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). An automated external defibrillator (AED) is attached and after analysis of the patient}s heart rhythm the patient is defibrillated twice. The ambulance service reach the scene with a delay. The emergency physician}s ECG shows ventricular fibrillation (VF) and two more defibrillations are delivered. Return of spontaneous circulation can be achieved. After stabilisation the patient is taken to hospital by ambulance. The ECG shows an anterior myocardial infarction and right bundle-branch block. The coronary angioplasty (PTCA) shows single-vessel disease with complete stenosis of the proximal part of the anterior interventricular branch. Revasucarisation is successful and a coronary stent is applied. The patient survives neurologically intact. This case report demonstrates the importance of readily available AED and specially trained medics. By immediately using the AED this patient was defibrillated before the ambulance service and emergency physician arrived at the scene. Spontaneous circulation was restored.","1339":"Neuraxial anaesthesia offers the most effective form of obstetric pain relief and is superior to other methods of analgesia, and it does not increase the risk of caesarean section. In daily practice, various techniques are used including the options of patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) and combined spinal epidural analgesia (CSEA). Risk information is one of the prerequisites for 'informed consent'. Omitting the epidural test dose and using low-dose local anaesthetics with lipophilic opioids enhances early mobilisation.","1340":"Besides epidural analgesia combined spinal-epidural anaesthesia (CSE) is one of the favourite techniques of regional anaesthesia for pain relief in obstetric patients. CSE combines the advantage of spinal anaesthesia, e.g. rapid onset and reliable effect, with the advantage of continuous epidural anaesthesia, e.g. titration of analgesics and prolongation. While subarachnoid injection of solely opioids provides fast pain relief for nearly 2 hrs in the first stage of labour with an opportunity of ambulation for the parturient (\"walking epidural\"), the subarachnoid injection of a combination of low doses of opoids and local anaesthetics provides profound analgesia with minor motor blocking side effects for 1-2 hrs in the second stage of labour.","1341":"","1342":"\"Nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come.\" (Victor Hugo) Originally referring to the beginning of the enlightenment (reconnaissance) of the French revolution the transcription of this words regarding to German palliative Care structures would mean a tremendous effort. The meaning of the new idea is a holistic kind of care for patients with a chronic disease at the end of their lives, so that they can die as most self determined as possible at a location of their choice. The special aim of palliative care, the need of interdisciplinary cooperation leading to multidisciplinary solutions is pointed out. The meaning of palliative care team as a team with special communication skills in between the team and with further cooperating partners is described. Communication in palliative care means more than telling facts.","1343":"It is the goal of palliative care to provide as large a relief of the disease symptoms as possible for patients, who are incurably sick, in order to improve the quality of the remaining life. Some of the symptoms can hardly be treated; others like pain, dyspnea, gastrointestinal complaints or sweating can usually be well alleviated. The condition for this is a careful evaluation of the clinical status before the treatment, in order to reach symptom relief by purposeful actions without new side effects.","1344":"The beginning of the modern hospice movement and palliative medicine relates to the recognition of the fact that a cure-oriented health care system often neglects the critically ill and the dying in terms of appropriate treatment and human care. Therefore, the idea was born to offer comprehensive medical, nursing, psychological, social and spiritual care for these patients and their families at a suitable location . This first location was St Christopher's Hospice in London; the starting point of a still ongoing humanly and ethically demanded development.","1345":"","1346":"","1347":"Pediatric transfusion therapy is complex since there is a remarkable physiological change from neonate to child. Here we report the blood transfusion management of a 6-year-old male child after abdominal trauma. Particular normovolemia with ringer\/hetastarch, the estimation of the maximal allowable blood loss, target transfusion hematocrit, transfusion with platelets and FFP are discussed.","1348":"Discogenic pain has been responsible for a countless number of missed workdays and millions if not billions of dollars of lost revenue. Minimally invasive interventional therapies of the discogenic back pain gained significant acceptance among the proceduralists. The centuries old dilemma of discogenic low back pain has by no means been answered. We know today that discogenic low back pain has a multitude of causes. The leaking \"chemical soup\" within the nucleus pulposus is certainly responsible for causing inflammation and thus pain. However, neuropeptides released from peripheral endings of nociceptive afferents are also inflammatory mediators and pain generators. The nerves innervating the discs have been identified and in many cases denervated with good results. These nerves from posterior to anterior include the sinuvertebral nerve, the rami communicantes, and the sympathetic trunk. Diagnosing discogenic low back pain is the key to successful treatment. Classically this should be a low back pain in a \"band-like\" distribution without radiculopathy that is worse in the morning, worse with Valsalva, and aggravated by standing in flexion. Provocative discography with manometric monitoring is essential in aiding the diagnosis. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, a multitude of invasive therapy may be offered including: L2 root sleeve blocks, intradiscal RFTC, RFTC of the rami communicantes, or Comparative data on the effectiveness of the above-mentioned procedures is lacking and may in fact be an excellent topic for future discussion.","1349":"Since the first description of Bolton et al., critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) and critical illness myopathy (CIM) are increasingly observed as a complication in intensive care patients. CIP and CIM commonly occur in patients with an ICU length of stay exceeding one week. Typically, these patients show weakness of the limbs and difficulties in weaning from the respirator. Neurological and electrophysiological examinations as well as muscle biopsies if myopathy is of concern may help to characterize and identify polyneuropathy and myopathy.","1350":"Regional anesthesia for Caesarean delivery is often accompanied by a reduction in maternal blood pressure. Maternal hypotension may lead to a reduction in uteroplacental blood flow with consecutive fetal acidosis. In order to avoid reductions in uteroplacental blood flow, tremendous research has been performed, showing that the avoidance of aortocaval compression, compression of the lower extremities, and prehydration with colloids are effective in reducing maternal hypotension. Further means include the recent introduction of low dose spinal anesthesia with a combination of small amounts of local anesthetics and opioids. Nevertheless, maternal hypotension is not always preventable and the use of vasopressors is still frequently required. Although ephedrine has been considered the vasopressor of choice over the last decades, current studies show that fetal acidosis is less frequently encountered with the use of phenylephrine, which should thus be considered as a first-line agent.","1351":"Neuraxial regional anaesthesia is now widely used in obstetric anaesthesia. Specifically, the rate of spinal anaesthesia increased considerably and is favoured for scheduled caesarean section. Former concerns to use regional anaesthetic techniques in non scheduled cases, e.g. spinal anaesthesia for pre-eclampsia are not supported by recent study data. Spinal and epidural anaesthesia are both safe in patients presenting with pre-eclampsia, if contraindications for neuraxial anaesthesia are taken into account.","1352":"Numerous scientific case reports and observational studies, including that of Curtis Mendelson with its great historical relevance, have reported the problem of aspiration pneumonitis during labour. Because of this, strict fasting prior to delivery to reduce pulmonary aspiration has been doctrine since the 1940s. However, maternal mortality from anaesthesia, particularly from aspiration, has dropped dramatically over recent decades. This is due both to far-reaching improved quality of care as well as technical progress in anaesthesia, which increasingly challenge the scientific basis for fasting in obstetric anaesthesia. Strict fasting has never been proven to reduce morbidity or mortality in labouring women. Because of the physiological and anatomical changes of pregnancy, gastric emptying is theoretically prolonged, and therefore the risk of aspiration is assumed to be increased. However, the available data with patients receiving clear fluids run contrary to this assumption, or at least dispute its clinical relevance. Recent studies report positive influence of reduced fasting time on both maternal comfort and maternal\/fetal metabolism without increased risk. This has already led to meaningful discussion regarding a corresponding change in official recommendations.","1353":"","1354":"The central anticholinergic syndrome should be considered in patients with altered mental status following anaesthesia. Physostigmine, a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, is a first-line medicament for the therapy of the central anticholinergic syndrome. Physostigmine crosses the blood-brain barrier and elevates acetylcholine levels in the brain. For prevention of postanaesthetic shivering, for treatment of intoxications and postoperative pain, and for patients suspected of having antimuscarinic delirium physostigmine is also indicated.","1355":"Perpetual noise, pain, disturbed day-night-cycle, the inability to talk and the difficulty, especially during weaning, to differentiate alertness from sleep and dream from reality are some of the burdens ICU patients are suffering from. Additional sedation and potential sedation gaps plus the medical treatment itself put strain on critically ill humans. Those external stimuli partly cannot be handled well by the patients. Some of these factors or a combination of them, combined with a predisposition and\/or insufficient coping mechanisms can result in a wide range of psychiatric disorders. Often psychiatric symptoms appear unspecific and difficult to categorize. Firstly some psychopathological cardinal symptoms are described and potential differential diagnoses are mentioned. After that the following article focuses on sleep, adjustment, depressive and the spectrum of anxiety disorders (especially generalized anxiety disorders, panic disorders, acute stress disorder (ASD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)). The article provides prevalences, etiology and risk factors as well as symptomatology, diagnostics and therapeutic options. Those disorders can be diagnosed in ICU but also after transferring to general ward. In our own experience the transfer period is a vulnerable phase for psychopathologic symptoms. As apart from the individual suffering the course of the somatic disease as well as the rehabilitation process are impaired and the disorders have a tendency to have a chronic course, close and early collaboration of ICU physicians and psychiatrists is mandatory.","1356":"Perioperative management of patients with adrenal gland diseases requires detailed information on the individual endocrine status and the potential complications. Typical signs of primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn's syndrome) comprise arterial hypertension, hypokalaemia and metabolic alkalosis. In such cases preoperative treatment with spironolactone is highly recommended. In patients with hypercortisolism (Cushing's syndrome) the following concomitant disorders must be considered particularly: arterial hypertension, osteoporosis, vulnerable skin, diabetes mellitus, and increased risk for infection and thromboembolism. In all patients with proven or suspected adrenocortical insufficiency (i.e. Addison's disease, after removal of a cortisol producing tumour or as the result of long-term therapy with glucocorticoids) consequent perioperative supplementation of hydrocortisone is mandatory. In patients with phaeochromcytoma hypertensive crisis and tachyarrhythmias may occur intraoperatively resulting from massive catecholamine release. Thus, preoperative treatment with the beta-antagonist phenoxybenzamine is obligatory. In contrast, nitroprusside is the substance of choice for intraoperative control of blood pressure. beta-blocking agents may be used in phaeochromocytoma but only under sufficient beta-blockade. Removal of a malignant tumour of the adrenal gland may induce massive haemorrhage, and thus anaesthetic management has to be modified.","1357":"","1358":"While adenoidectomy in childhood is a standard procedure, different alternatives of airway and anaesthesiologic management are discussed. Therefore we investigated retrospectively paediatric anaesthesias with laryngeal mask (LMA) or endotracheal intubation (ITN) during adenoidectomies in our department of otorhinolaryngology. A retrospective analysis of 385 anaesthesia records of the last three years was performed. Variables were age and weight of the children, anaesthetics, surgical procedures, size of LMA, recovery time, anaesthesiological complications as well as the incidence of abandoning the laryngeal mask in favour of a tracheal intubation. Recovery time was significantly reduced (3.63 min) in LMA group compared to ITN group (p &lt; 0.001). Complications did not arise more frequently in the LMA group. LMA had to be changed into ITN in 11 cases (5,6 %) only. Our study shows the LMA being a safe and effective alternative to ITN in airway treatment of children undergoing adenoidectomy. ","1359":"There is a direct relationship between antibiotic use and resistance. A two-stage model for the development of antibiotic resistance has been suggested: antibiotic resistance is first induced (emergence) and then followed by its spread, facilitated by antibiotic selection pressure. Importantly, the decline in resistance after treatment cessation or a reduction in the volume of antibiotic use is much slower than its emergence. Excessive antibiotic use has individual and ecologic effects that can alter clinical practice and increase treatment costs.","1360":"Ventilator-associated pneumonia remains the most serious nosocomial infection in critically ill patients. Providing appropriate antibiotic therapy promptly is crucial for successful treatment; whereas the diagnostic approach seems to play a minor role. The empirical antibiotic therapy should be guided by the risk for infections due to multiresistant bacteria. For patients at risk a combination therapy, considering local resistance data and formerly applied antibiotic substances, is recommended. Reevaluation and deescalation of antibiotic therapy based on microbiological culture results and discontinuation of antimicrobial treatment after one week is essential for the control of broadspectrum antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance.","1361":"Antibiotic resistance has become a worldwide problem. This article gives an overview over the methods used for the surveillance of antibiotic use and resistance. Advantages and disadvantages of different national and international surveillance systems will be discussed as well as orientation on reference data.","1362":"The treatment of infections is one of the central elements in post-operative intensive care and contributes significantly to outcome. Measures of quality of antibiotic therapy include survival, duration of ICU or in-patient stay and rates of organ failure, antibiotic resistance or nosocomial infection. The pre-requisites for antibiotic prescribing in the intensive care unit are as follows: the treatment has to be started early, the antibiotic must be effective against probable causative organisms, the patient's risk factors for infection with multi-drug resistant organisms must be taken into account, local patterns of resistance must be known, an effective dosage must be used and the duration of therapy should be adjusted to the patient's risk factors and probable causative organisms. The multiplicity of factors which must be taken into account when determining timely empirical therapy and the fact that this must be possible at any time of the day, make local standard operating procedures for antibiotic prescribing imperative. These standards should reflect local resistance patterns and should be regularly reviewed. The aim of this educational article is to portray a selection of the pre-requisites and strategies available in the treatment of infections with antibiotics in intensive care medicine.","1363":"","1364":"EMS is called to a construction worker with serious cutting injuries of the neck from an angle grinder. The patient was found on the upper floor of a construction building accessible only through a scaffolding with narrow ladders. Primary examination reveals severe hemorrhagic shock. The Fire Department is called for evacuation of the patient with a turntable ladder. Further examination in the hospital shows complete dissection of the left carotid artery and the left internal jugular vein. The history reveals alcohol abuse and depression. Attempted suicide appears to be the most likely cause of the injury. The case report further discusses proper coordination of medical and technical measures in rescue operations, recommended treatment of hemorrhagic shock, and the unusual finding of paradoxical bradycardia despite volume depletion.","1365":"Besides pain management in obstetric patients epidural anaesthesia plays a major role in the perioperative setting. Especially the technique of thoracic epidural anaesthesia (TEA) provides better postoperative analgesia when compared with systemic pain therapy. TEA is associated with improved outcome in high-risk patients and patients undergoing extensive surgery. An acute pain management service is required to guarantee high effectiveness and a low complication rate. TEA is an important part of a multimodal perioperative concept, especially in fast-track surgery, which means advantages for patients outcome and hospitals economics.","1366":"Neuroaxial anesthesia has become an integral part of perioperative pain therapy and provides several advantages over systemic opioids. Despite these benefits, rare but serious complications occur with epidural analgesia including epidural haematoma, spinal-epidural infections and local anesthetic cardiac toxicity. Epidural haematoma and epidural abscess after catheter placement may cause irreversible neurological complications and an immediate diagnostic and therapeutic approach is crucial to assure complete recovery. Furthermore, local anesthetic-induced cardiac toxicity is another rare but potentially lethal complication during regional anesthesia. Based on lipophilic and hydrophilic properties, local anesthetics can interfere with ion channels such as sodium, potassium and calcium channels of the CNS and the heart leading to severe neuronal and cardiac (arrhythmia and contractile depression) adverse effects. In this review we take an in-depth look at severe complications associated with regional anesthesia, describe their symptoms and discuss appropriate diagnostic and therapeutical approaches.","1367":"Pain is the most frequent and straining symptom after surgery. Regardless of the severity of the surgical trauma patients may suffer from severe pain and may therefore not tolerate or even refuse important postoperative interventions for fear of pain. This may influence the outcome and worsen the prognosis of surgical patients. Physicians are therefore ethically and legally bound to care for adequate pain management. Regional anesthesia, especially epidural analgesia, is most effective to treat postoperative pain. It is discussed whether the incidence and severity of chronic postoperative pain can be reduced and postoperative complications can be prevented by this technique. Epidural analgesia may reduce the risk of postoperative complications (i.e. myocardial infarction) by reducing the surgical stress response and inhibiting the pathophysiological cascade that may trigger undesirable sequelea.","1368":"Postoperative pain is now a critical focus of perioperative patient care. The current perioperative analgesic strategy is a \"balanced-multimodal analgesia\". Cornerstones of this treatment approach are patient controlled neuraxial administration of local anesthetics and opioids or patient controlled intravenous administration of opioids. However, systemic opioids are limited by side effects. Thus, adjuvants like anticonvulsants, NMDA receptor antagonists, alpha-2 adrenergic agonists and other non-Opioid analgesics are considered to reduce pain and opioid requirements in the perioperative period. In the present review we discuss recent findings about the effectiveness of different systemic administered adjuvants including ketamine, lidocaine, gabapentin, pregabalin and corticosteroids for postoperative pain treatment. Furthermore a nurse based oral analgesic concept using controlled released Oxycodon for all postoperative patients without a patient controlled analgesia device will be introduced.","1369":"","1370":"Lesions to retroperitoneal blood vessels are rare but serious complications of surgical discectomies. Through ventral perforation during laminectomy life-threatening bleedings may occur if arteries are injured. We present a patient with haemorrhagic shock after disc surgery. The complication could be treated adequately by immediate anaesthesiological and surgical intervention and the patient recovered completely.","1371":"Psychiatric emergencies are catatonia, stupor, central serotonine syndrome, malignant neuroleptic syndrome, suicide risk and agitation. In this article some clinical features of the aforementioned and its therapy are summarized.","1372":"This is the first report of the Regional Anesthesia Surveillance System (RASS) analyzing complication data of the relatively new cervical posterior approach to the brachial plexus. The Regional Anesthesia Surveillance System (RASS) was introduced in October 2003. All regional anesthesia punctures and continuous catheters in place are recorded as part of the midnight-statistic and forwarded to the RASS databank. Complications are registered and coded according to standardized definitions ( www.UIRASS.com ) by the acute pain service. Plausibility of coding is checked against the medical record by the RASS-coordinator for data quality assurance. From October 2003-October 2005 there have been 360 cervical posterior punctures and 547 catheterdays. The utilization ratio of the cervical posterior brachial plexus block is 1.42 %. A pneumothorax occurred in 2.7\/1000 punctures, local anesthetic toxicity and short term neurologic deficits were also observed in 2.7\/1000 punctures. Catheter dislocation occurred in 5.4\/1000 catheterdays and severe neck pain was noticed in 16.3\/1000 punctures. There were no catheter associated long term neurological deficits, bleeding or infectious complications. The cervical posterior approach to the brachial plexus is an alternative to the interscalene approach with the advantages of high success rate and secure catheter placement. Neck pain can be a disadvantage of the technique and acute complications like pneumothorax and local anesthetic toxicity seem to be similar to those reported with interscalene blocks in the literature. ","1373":"Ultrasound is an emerging new imaging and guiding technique for diagnostic or therapeutic interventional pain procedures. Advantages are the real time monitoring of the targeted structures, the placement of the instruments and the visualization of local anaesthetic spread without exposing patients and personal to radiation. Pain specialists need a large anatomical knowledge and training to use the new method safely and distinctively. The increasing published data available and the personal experience of the authors suggest a potential usefulness in interventional pain therapy, but also limitations.","1374":"Various sonographic techniques that are implemented in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) for cardiovascular monitoring, allow for an extensive cardiac structure and function analysis. Major priority is assigned to the judgement on myocardial contractility, ventricular filling end ejection, valvular morphology and structure, as well as diagnosis of the ascending and descending aorta. Correct interpretation of the imaged structures increases diagnostic safety, but is built on high requirements on the investigator. On these grounds, this article aims to inform you on the clinical applications of TEE.","1375":"In anaesthetic practise ultrasound can facilitate cannulation of veins and arteries not only in adults but also in children. It is the main advantage and safety feature of this technique, that the targeted vessels and the surrounding anatomical structures are visualized and that the needle is advanced under continuous observation. Moreover, its systematic use can reduce the rate of unsuccessful cannulation attempts, which can be caused by anatomical variations or thrombi, occluding the targeted vessel. Ultrasound guided vascular cannulation can decrease complication rates and might improve patients safety e.g. by avoiding puncture of the carotid artery. However, in order to pass on these potential benefits to the patient and justify the increased expenses related to the purchasing of preferably portable ultrasound systems, it is mandatory to offer an appropriate ultrasound training programs for physicians using this technique.","1376":"","1377":"Post-operative pain therapy of chronic pain patients poses a challenge. Here we report the perioperative management of a 39-year-old male under chronic therapy with oxycodon, gabapentin and tolperison. Particular the pharmacointeractions regarding premedication and postoperative dose finding of opioids with intravenous PCIA are discussed.","1378":"","1379":"Delirium is the most common psychiatric disorder on ICU. Without sufficient treatment there can be stupor, coma or exitus of the patient. Close collaboration of ICU physicians and Psychiatrists leads to quick diagnosis and effective treatment. This article reviews the different forms of delirium, its causes and therapy strategies. Also changes of the ICU environment to prevent patients from delirium are mentioned.","1380":"Current therapy of septic\/vasodilatory cardiovascular failure includes volume resuscitation and infusion of inotropic and vasopressor agents. Norepinephrine is the first-line vasoconstrictor, and can stabilize hemodynamic variables in most patients. Nonetheless, irreversible cardiovascular failure which is resistant to conventional hemodynamic therapies still is the main cause of death in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. In such advanced, catecholamine-resistant shock states, arginine-vasopressin (AVP) has repeatedly caused an increase in mean arterial blood pressure, a decrease in toxic norepinephrine-dosages, as well as further beneficial hemodynamic, endocrinologic and renal effects. Although AVP exerted negative inotropic effects in previous clinical trials and in selected animal experiments, a continuous low-dose AVP infusion during advanced septic\/vasodilatory shock caused a decrease in cardiac index only in patients with a hyperdynamic circulation. Adverse effects on gastrointestinal circulation and the systemic microcirculation can not be excluded, but have not yet been confirmed in clinical prospective trials. Negative side effects of a supplementary AVP therapy are an increase in total bilirubin concentrations, and a decrease in platelet count. A transient increase in hepatic transaminases during AVP infusion is most likely related to preceding hypotensive episodes. Important points which must be considered when using AVP as a \"rescue vasopressor\" in septic\/vasodilatory shock states are: 1) AVP infusion only in advanced shock states that can not be adequately reversed by conventional hemodynamic therapy (e.g. norepinephrine &gt;0,5-0,6 mug\/kg\/min), 2) presence of normovolemia, 3) AVP infusion only in combination with norepinephrine, 4) strict avoidance of bolus injections and dosages &gt;4 IU\/h. Effects of a supplementary AVP infusion in advanced vasodilatory shock on survival are currently examined in a large, prospective multicenter trial in North America and Australia.","1381":"","1382":"Triplet pregnancies are at an increased risk for perinatal complications. Cesarean delivery is the preferred choice in most cases. In the presented case of a Jehovah's witness the special features of anaesthesiological managements are discussed.","1383":"We report on the severe course of a Streptococcal Toxic Shocklike Syndrome (STSLS). The initial diagnosis as well as the causal therapeutic approaches were complicated and prolongated definitely by the serological detection of auto-antibodies. Besides the presentation of clinical and paraclinical findings the report responds to relevant differential diagnoses and the corresponding strategies of therapeutic intervention.","1384":"In the postoperative phase after thoracic surgery in children patients can suffer considerable pain. The repertoire of analgesic treatments consist of basic treatment with non-opioid analgesics such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, as well as need-determined treatments with opioids given under intensive care monitoring. In addition, local and regional anaesthetic methods are an important part of the big picture of effective pain control after thoracic surgery in children.","1385":"Single lung ventilation is indicated in many cases for thoracic surgery in children. The indication for single lung ventilation and the airway management should always be discussed thoroughly with the surgeon in order to tailor the effort, complexity and risk of airway management to the needs of the patient. According to the height and age of the child endobronchial intubation, bronchial blockers, the Univent-tube and double lumen tubes can be used. During single lung ventilation infants are particularly predisposed to hypoxemia, because unlike adults in the lateral decubitus position the dependent ventilated lung is prone to alveolar collapse and does not receive a larger part of pulmonary perfusion than the non ventilated lung.","1386":"In the day life in a thoracic surgery department interventions in childage are more or less seldom. The skill of the surgical and anesthesiological team is strictly related to the outcome of the patient. Beneath benign tumors of the lung and mediastinum are inflammatory diseases first of all pleuraempyema in the focus of interest. VATS is an increasing point of diagnostic and therapies.","1387":"Positive pressure ventilation in children is associated with problems similar to those in the adults: development of atelectasis and barotrauma. During anesthesia atelectasis develop in up to 90% of patients, requiring the use of higher inspiratory pressure to recruit the collapsed lung regions. Especially in the preterm, newborn and younger infants, prolonged ventilation disturbs the anatomical structure of the soft and vulnerable immature airways and their subsequent growth and development, leading to tracheomegaly, tracheal collapse, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia and predisposing to bronchial obstruction. On the basis of pathophysiologic knowledge and studies of ventilation in children, protective modes of ventilation have evolved. They allow to reopen atelectatic lung regions without overdistension. Through solid knowledge of the underlying pediatric physiology and pathophysiology, the required ventilation management can be optimally adjusted to the young patients in order to achieve the best long-term outcomes.","1388":"","1389":"Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing noncardiac surgery (NCS) pose a special challenge for the anaesthesiologist, as the risk of serious perioperative cardiac complications, which represent a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, is increased in this population. Here we report about a patient with a solitary liver metastasis, who was admitted for hemihepatectomy. The patient with a known single vessel CAD, reporting no current cardiac problems, was cleared for the surgical procedure which carries a high risk of cardiac complications. Cardiology reports were present for evaluation. After an unremarkable placement of the peridural catheter and endotracheal intubation the patient presented with bradycardia and hypotension. Pharmacological resuscitation was initiated. After the patient was stabilized and the differential diagnosis suggested a cardiac problem, surgery was postponed. Following the end of anaesthesia, the patient remained in stable condition without catecholamine support. Coronary angiography on the next day revealed a progression of the CAD. The peridural catheter was removed before the intervention, Aspirin and clopidogrel were given on the same day. The patient was operated successfully without complications six weeks after the coronary intervention.","1390":"Nowadays 40-50 % of the patients receive inappropriate antibiotic treatment. Evidence based recommendations are not considered and there is an increasing burden of resistant pathogens. Therefore, standard operating procedures (SOPs) should be implemented considering guidelines and resistant species in the specific ICU. The authors developed algorithms and generated a user friendly computer program available for all ICU physicians all the time.","1391":"","1392":"Invasive airway management techniques are the bottom line of most difficult airway management algorithms when less invasive measures (e.g. endotracheal intubation, bag-valve-mask ventilation, or supraglottic airways) have failed. Various devices for transtracheal jet ventilation in children are available, while cricothyrotomy is the gold standard for establishing an invasive airway in adults. Percutaneous tracheostomy could become an alternative to cricothyrotomy if applied by experienced physicians, however, clear scientific evidence to advocate percutaneous tracheostomy in airway emergencies is still pending.","1393":"Difficult airway management is among the key requirements in routine anaesthesia. Failures to secure the airways resulting in a \"Cannot intubate, Cannot ventilate\" situation can drastically increase morbidity and mortality of patients within a very short time. Therefore, an algorithm for management of the expected and unexpected difficult airway describing the sequence of various procedures, adapted to internal standards and to techniques that are available, has to be provided by each anaesthesia department. This not only facilitates the preparation of equipment and the training of personnel, but also ensures efficient decision making under time pressure.","1394":"","1395":"We report the case of a 30 year old driver of a car who was jammed after a severe traffic accident. In a step-by-step description of the out-of-hospital and early clinical management of the patient, the case report focuses on diagnostic, therapeutic, and strategic issues. Current controversies in the management of patients with combined thoracic and abdominal trauma are discussed in the light of recent literature.","1396":"The impact of invasive hemodynamic monitoring on patient safety and outcome in perioperative medicine remains inadequately tested and unproven. The indications for the use of these tools should, therefore, be evaluated according to an individual risk-benefit analysis. The measurement of central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) is of little invasiveness as most high-risk patients are instrumented with central venous catheters, and ScvO2 has been shown to improve outcome in patients with septic shock. Transpulmonary thermodilution (e.g. PiCCO-system) delivers information not only on global cardiac function and intravascular volume status but also helps to define the pulmonary consequences of cardiovascular therapy. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a valuable tool in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and represents the beside-method of choice for rapid assessment of acute life-threatening cardiovascular instability. Apart from special indications, these tools tend to replace the pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) which has been shown to be of little value in various patient populations.","1397":"Caudal anesthesia is a safe, simple and very effective method to provide excellent perioperative analgesia. It is used routineously in pediatric anesthesia and can be applied to nearly all children with surgery below the umbilicus. In contrast, spinal anesthesia is a very special technique for former preterm infants below the 50th postconceptive week who are prone to develop postoperative apnea. It has been suggested that some of the problems associated with general anesthesia in these patients may be avoided by the use of spinal anesthesia.","1398":"Fever is an unspecific symptom of most intensive care patients during their stay on an intensive care unit. The reasons for the increase of body temperature often remain unclear, even extended diagnostic measures are performed. The pathogenetic relevance of fever is commonly underestimated and leads to unreflected treatment of every increase of body temperature above 38 C. But the development of fever in patients is quite often useful and should not be treated with antipyretics. Physical measures like ice packs and surface cooling are only allowed to be used, if the central set point is lower than the actual core body temperature. This gradient can be recognized, when the patient starts to sweat. Principally, the treatment of fever in cardiovascular risk patients, patients with high risk for adverse neurological outcome, pregnant women during the first trimenon and in children with seizures must start with pharmacological interventions,which can be followed by physical measures.","1399":"Postoperative analgesia for total knee replacement with a continuous nerve catheter is more effective than any other form of systemic analgesia. For complete analgesia a combined technique of a femoral with a proximal sciatic nerve block is recommended. An easy and reliable way to achieve this is a femoral or a fascia iliaca compartment block together with a subgluteal sciatic nerve block.","1400":"Peripheral regional blocks are not only appropriate for intraoperative anaesthesia. More and more they become popular for postoperative analgesia after painful operations of the extremities. For this reason in this article only techniques are presented, which are suitable as well for a \"single shot\" block as for a continuous technique with an indwelling catheter. In detail the interscalene technique according to Meier, the infraclavicular block according to Kilka, Geiger, and Mehrkens (or alternatively according to Raj, modified by Borgeat) and the perivascular axillary brachial plexus block are described. The continuous technique of the block of the suprascapular nerve is very helpful in patients with chronic pain in the shoulder, if no surgery is performed. The authors are very interested in a praxis relevant description of the techniques including numerous \"tips and tricks\".","1401":"Without miniaturization resulting in affordable hand-held ultrasound systems, ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia would not be practicable. Nowadays facilitation of nerve blockade by means of ultrasound is achievable even in remote locations. Non-traumatic technique, visualisation of nerves, surrounding structures and the ability to assess the spread of the injected local anaesthetic combined with a high and predictable success rate are the major advantages when ultrasound is used in regional anaesthetic practise. After a short recapitulation of physical principles related to ultrasound this article focuses on the specific features related to ultrasound-guided identification and blockade of peripheral nerves. Technical pitfalls and their implications for a successful nerve block are put into perspective. Ultrasound can be used to facilitate blockade of the upper and lower extremity. The advantages and limitations of the technique when applied to the classical approaches for blockade of the brachial plexus and the femoral and ischiadic nerve are discussed. Ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia is a valuable tool to improve safety, success rate and patient comfort in daily anaesthetic practise.","1402":"The use of peripheral catheter techniques for regional anaesthesia and analgesia is quite common today. Although electrical nerve stimulation facilitates the correct placement of the insertion cannula, nobody knows where exactly the tip of the advanced catheter will be located after insertion. With the help of stimulation nerve catheters the stimulation of the target nerve via the tip of the catheter during insertion enables a placement nearby the nerve without additional devices. These new catheter systems require--in comparison to the conventional--a modified insertion technique. This article illustrates how to use these catheters in clinical practice and provides information about investigations to success rate and failure.","1403":"","1404":"The German guidelines for the treatment of acute perioperative and posttraumatic pain from 1999 have been revised during the last three years and will be published at the end of 2006 as a guideline on S3-level. 20 medical societies evaluate with the instruments of the centre of evidence based medicine of Oxford (CEBM) the available randomised controlled trials, systematic reviews and existing guidelines and consent in final Delphi rounds the detailed recommendations (grades A - C).

We performed a retrospective analysis of 136 patients undergoing elective \"fast-track\" colonic surgery (sigma resection and right hemicolectomy). Data collection in regard of fluid administration during surgery and in the post anaesthesia care unit (PACU) was based on anaesthesia charts and a prospectively generated surgery database. Classification into three volume groups (up to 3500 ml = group 1, 3500 - 5500 ml = group 2, more than 5500 ml = group 3). Basic patient characteristics, pre-existing conditions, type and duration of surgery and anastomoses were documented. We analysed the incidence of postoperative complications such as wound infections, anastomotic leak, bleeding, bowel obstruction, cardiovascular failure, hypertension, pulmonary failure, pneumonia, renal failure, urinary tract infection, neurological and psychiatric complications in the different volume groups. 115 patients were infused with up to 3500 mLs of fluids, 19 patients received more than 3500 mLs, two patients were infused with 6000 ml and 7500 mLs, respectively. This was in median 36 ml\/kg in the restrictive and 53 ml\/kg in the higher volume groups (group 2 and 3 together), respectively. The duration of surgery and anaesthesia was significantly different between both fluid groups (p = 0,023). In a logistic regression model only intraoperative blood loss was independently associated with the volume of infused fluid (OR 0,393, 95 % CI 1.028 - 2.306, p &lt; 0.01).

The anaesthetist needs to identify risk patients and to optimize his strategies for perioperative management. The present article gathers the current data and summarizes effective strategies for anaesthesia in patients with ischemic heart disease.","1418":"Disorders of the cardiovascular system are among the most important accompanying diseases in operative medicine. These diseases increase the perioperative risk; the risk is assessed on the basis of the case history and tolerance of the patient as well as the extent and invasiveness of the surgical intervention. Depending on the results of this stratification further examination and therapy may be necessary. The aim of these mainly preventative measures is the highest possible preoperative hemodynamic stability. Besides pharmacological prevention, a therapy for hypertension or ischemia belongs among these measures. The selected anesthesia process must guarantee and efficient prevention of pain.","1419":"Comorbid cardiovascular diseases can significantly increase the risk for perioperative morbidity and mortality. Increasing age of surgical populations and increasing invasiveness of surgical procedures further contribute to a significantly increased perioperative cardiovascular complication rate. Treatment of cardiovascular comorbidities and prevention of cardiovascular complications can decrease the perioperative risk. For detection and treatment of cardiovascular risk patients a thorough understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is of utmost importance. This article therefore reviews clinically relevant features of cardiovascular diseases with an emphasis on coronary artery disease and heart failure.","1420":"Preexisting cardiovascular diseases are the most important risk factors in the perioperative period. They can cause complications that have a major impact on the morbidity and mortality of surgical patients. The current issue of AINS thus presents the actual state of knowledge about the pathophysiology, preoperative evaluation, and perioperative management of cardiac risk diseases in three practice-orientated review articles. Only sound knowledge of the pathophysiological background together with the diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities will allow the clinically active anesthesiologist to adapt the available therapeutic and preventative options in the best possible way to the individual patient and to avoid not only medical but also economically unnecessary and\/or potentially harmful interventions.","1421":"For a large number of anesthesiologists, airway management in infants is not part for their daily routine and thus represents a major challenge. In the present review the special anatomic and physiological features of the infant airways are summarized. Various technical aids for airway management in infants are described in the context of their development and utility in routine clinical practice.","1422":"Bronchopleural fistula (BPF) and bronchial stump insufficiency (BSI) after lobectomies and pneumonectomies are dreaded complications with incidences of up to 12 % and a mortality rate of up to 51 %. Apart from the basic illness causes include complications like aspiration-pneumonia and ARDS, formation of empyema as well as histories of sepsis. Corticoid treatments, old age, diabetes mellitus, previous irradiation as well as post-operative mechanical ventilation (barotrauma) are often counted among contributing causes. Suturing the bronchus and reinforcement by tissue are still the methods of choice, but they are often counter-indicated in high-risk patients. Endoscopic treatments with partial lung occlusions, e. g. by insertion of spongiosa, coils, and\/or fibrin glue have been described. However, they require the respective area to be probable. With only one third the rate of success is quite unsatisfactory. The retro-graded instillation of inflammatory-selerotizing substances, like doxycycline, via a chest tube leads to a pleurodesis caused by adhesion of the remaining lung parenchyma to the thoracic wall and a reduction in size of the residual pleural space. In an 82-year old female patient a BPF of the second upper lobe bronchus was detected after a middle lobe resection for abscess and post-radiation ulcer following a mastectomy for carcinoma. The leakage was detected on bronchoscopy by retro-graded instillation via the chest tube of methylene-blue solution into the thoracic cavity. After administering the water-soluble contrast agent amidotrizoic acid in a similar manner a CT confirmed the diagnosis. As the bronchial segment concerned could not be entered selectively, preservation of the right lung lobe's residual ventilation by endoscopic-occlusion procedures was ruled out. Employing a strictly conservative therapy (spontaneous ventilation, retro-graded doxycycline instillations) complete healing with a fully ventilated lower lobe could be achieved over a period of 78 days. BPF as well as residual intro-thoracic cavities after lobectomies pose a serious problem. Using methylene blue for a retro-graded demonstration of BPF during bronchoscopy presents a feasible and cost-efficient diagnostic method. A strictly applied conservative therapy including short-time low-pressure artificial respiration as well as obliteration by fibrous tissue of the thoracic cavity using doxycycline is a feasible procedure for inoperable high-risk patients.","1423":"A rare though extremely harmful complication in neuraxial anaesthesia is an epidural hematoma which can be associated with deleterious consequences for the patient, e. g. persistent paraplegia. The risk of epidural haematomas after neuraxial blockade is dependent on abnormal anatomy of the spine, difficult and multiple punctures and coagulation disorders. Especially when patients undergo therapy with anticoagulants like low molecular heparin or platelet inhibitors (tyclopidine) or a combination of them, the indication for neuraxial blockade must strictly outweigh risk of spinal bleeding. In this context, the precautions and contraindications are the same for spinal puncture and catheter insertion as for catheter removal. We describe the case of a patient who underwent emergency coronary angioplasty in combination with coronary stent implantation due to acute postoperative myocardial infarction following knee replacement in continuous epidural anaesthesia. Under the symptoms of a beginning local infection at the puncture site the epidural catheter had to be removed in spite of ongoing antithrombotic therapy. A possible management of such cases is discussed with regard to risk minimization.","1424":"","1425":"","1426":"","1427":"","1428":"","1429":"","1430":"","1431":"","1432":"","1433":"","1434":"Diabetics with cardiovascular autonomous neuropathy (CAN) can show severe hypotension during the course of anaesthesia. To improve the safety of anaesthesia, pre-operative evaluation of this concomitant disorder is recommended. The conventional test battery described by Ewing and Clarke to diagnose CAN is relatively time-consuming and complex. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether patients at risk could be reliably identified with less diagnostic effort. Fifty patients with diabetes mellitus undergoing an ophthalmosurgical procedure were investigated. To evaluate their cardiovascular reflex status, the following tests were performed one day before surgery: determination of heart rate variation (HRV) under deep respiration (6 breaths\/min), and the response of heart rate (max\/min 30:15 ratio) and blood pressure after getting up from a supine position. Anaesthesia was induced with thiopental and fentanyl and maintained with enflurane\/N (2)0; vecuronium was administered for tracheal intubation. Patients whose systolic blood pressure fell below 90 mm Hg during the induction phase were assigned to Group H (hypotensive), the remaining patients to Group N (non-hypotensive). The groups were compared regarding the pre-operatively collected variables. The demographic data were comparable in the two groups with exception of the length of diabetes. Regarding blood pressure reaction during orthostatic load, there was no significant difference between the groups. In contrast, the parameters of HRV under deep respiration (with exception of the \"mean circular resultant\") and the max\/min 30 : 15 ratio were significantly lower in patients of Group H than in Group N. The best differentiation between the groups offered the E\/I ratio (= quotient resulting from the longest R-R interval during expiration (E) and the shortest R-R interval during inspiration (I) under deep breathing) as a measure of respiratory sinus arrhythmia. The incidence of hypotension during anaesthetic induction in patients with a normal E\/I ratio was 8.7 %, but in patients with a pathologically reduced E\/I ratio 51.9 % ( P = 0.0019). The sensitivity of this test concerning hypotension that occurred was 87.5 %, the specificity 61.7 %. The available results prove the close connection between the pre-operatively measured breadth of respiratory sinus arrhythmia and blood pressure response during anaesthetic induction. Patients at risk of hypotension can be identified reliably and quickly during pre-operative screening with the help of a single, simple test procedure. ","1435":"The ProSeal laryngeal mask airway (PLMA) is increasingly used for surgical procedures that might require the intraoperative use of neuromuscular blocking agents. The airway seal of the PLMA depends on the interplay of the surrounding soft tissue of the neck and the cuff of the mask. An intraoperative neuromuscular blockade could lead to a decrease of the airway leak pressure (P (leak)) secondary to the relaxation of the muscles of the neck. With this study we tested the hypothesis that a neuromuscular blockade can result in a decreased P (leak) of the PLMA. The P (leak) of the PLMA was studied in 73 female patients under total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol (0.1 - 0.15 mg kg (-1) min (-1)) and remifentanil (0.1 - 0.3 microg kg (-1) min (-1)) before and after a complete neuromuscular blockade produced by intravenous injection of 0.6 mg kg (-1) Rocuronium. The P (leak) decreased by more than 10 % of the baseline P (leak) in 8 out of 73 patients (11 %); however, in the entire study population there was no significant difference between the mean baseline P (leak) (28.5 +\/- 7.3 cm H(2)O) and the mean P (leak) after complete neuromuscular blockade (29.1 +\/- 7.0 cm H(2)O); (p = 0.128). No general correlation between application of a neuromuscular blocking agent and a decrease of the mean P (leak) was found. However, the decrease of the P (leak) by more than 10 % in 11 % of the patients shows that in certain patients the application of neuromuscular blocking agents can result in a decreased P (leak) of the PLMA and indicates the necessity to control the P (leak) of the PLMA under complete muscle paralysis preoperatively when neuromuscular blocking agents are used. ","1436":"In light of the increased use of the LMA-ProSeal (P-LMA) it seems desirable to consider the P-LMA for prolonged surgical cases or post-operative ventilation. Long-term use could carry the risk of serious complications. An experimental pig model could be used to gain basic knowledge about long-term use before conducting clinical trails. In this randomized controlled study we tested the hypothesis if prolonged positive pressure ventilation (PPV) with the P-LMA in the pig is possible. The P-LMA was used for airway maintenance under general anaesthesia and PPV in 15 German country pigs. Randomised into 3 groups, the animals were ventilated for 90, 150 and 390 minutes, respectively. Arterial blood gas measurements were used to determine adequacy of ventilation. Airway leak pressure (P (leak)) and maximum tidal volume (TV) were measured in the supine, lateral and prone positions. A bronchoscopic examination was performed to detect signs of aspiration. Adequate ventilation was demonstrated both after 120 min (4.7 +\/- 0.4 kPa) and 360 min (4.7 +\/- 0.5 kPa). The corresponding PaO(2) at FiO(2) = 1.0 was 59 +\/- 5 kPa and 64 +\/- 10 kPa, respectively. The mean P (leak) was 34 +\/- 7 cm H(2)O. Change of position did not result in any significant change in P(leak) or maximum TV kg (-1). There was no bronchoscopic evidence of aspiration in any pig. It was possible to ensure sufficient PPV with the P-LMA in the pig over different periods of time and in different body positions without any complications of airway management. The P-LMA can be used for PPV in the pig for durations of up to 390 minutes. We conclude that investigations into the long-term use of the LMA can be carried out in a pig model. ","1437":"Racz's minimal invasive epidural catheter procedure, also known as \"epidural neuroplasty\" is not only utilized in patients suffering from failed spine surgery (\"failed back surgery syndrome\") but also increasingly applied to non-surgical back pain patients to prevent chronification or deterioration. Its hypothesized principle of action is local epidural lysis of adhesions, neurolysis of vertebral nerve roots and local lavage of proinflammatory mediators by repeated injection of local anesthetics, corticosteroids, hyaluronidase and hypertonic saline solution. However adverse events are well known to occur in epidural neuroplasty. Complications of epidural neuroplasty are due to the procedure itself or due to specific drugs-related side effects. Unintended dural puncture, administration of the drugs to the subarachnoid or subdural space, catheter shearing, infection and severe hemodynamic instability during application are most commonly observed adverse events. Complications related to the procedure itself occur immediately, while complications relating to drug administration show later onset. Within this context, we report a case of severe meningitis with neurologic sequelae in a patient who received Racz catheter-treatment for unspecific low-back pain and provide an overview of the literature on other potential severe complications. As a consequence, we recommend that the Racz catheter procedure as yet should be restricted to controlled clinical trials with rigorous inclusion- and exclusion criteria.","1438":"The principle purpose of this study was to collect data on the conditions and practice of anaesthesia education as well as the teaching qualification of consultants at German university hospitals. Based upon the collected data, areas of weakness and strength as well as measures required to improve anaesthesia training are described. A questionnaire containing 26 items was mailed to 607 consultants employed at 41 German university hospitals in June 2003. A total of 255 questionnaires was analysed (response rate: 43 %). Genuine training activities account for 14 % of the working hours of the participating consultants. On average, at the institutions of participating consultants, novices work for a duration of 1 month together with a consultant anaesthetist before they give anaesthetics without direct and constant supervision. When asked to describe the predominant method of training at their institution 71 % indicated \"case-oriented teaching\"; however, 53 % chose \"see one, do one, teach one\" and 49 % \"learning by doing\" as method of training as well (multiple choice). According to 63 % of respondents, departmental educational activities usually happen after their regular working hours. \"Daily workload\" (96 %), \"time pressure\" (96 %), \"lack of time\" (96 %) and \"lack of personnel\" (90 %) were indicated as the main obstacles of teaching. According to 80 % of respondents, a dedicated financial budget for education does not exist; instead, financial resources of third parties (industry) (58 %), of the state (for research und undergraduate education) (60 %) and of patients service (66 %) are used to ensure training of anaesthesia residents. Due to a lack of a dedicated financial budget for resident training and an increasing economic pressure, \"lack of time\" and \"lack of personnel\" are the main factors leading to the situation at German university hospitals that consultants can only spend 14 % of their working hours for teaching purposes despite of sufficient qualification and motivation. As a consequence, novice anaesthetists are faced with the situation to be working without direct and constant supervision after 1 month of training.

Acute onset of bilateral cranial neuropathies associated with symmetric descending weakness as well as some key features of the botulism syndrome including absence of fever, symmetric neurologic deficits, the patients remaining responsive and no sensory deficits, with the exception of blurred vision, led to the clinical diagnosis in the first presenting case which was then easily made in the second.

A new optimal-target-controlled-infusion (OTCI) technique enables an individual plasma-targeted adjustment by including the concentration in the effect-compartment. This study compared practicability and costs of the new system with a conventional MCI-based propofol anesthesia regimen. In a prospective study, 50 patients scheduled for elective surgery of nose or nasal sinuses were randomly enrolled to receive BIS-controlled anaesthesia (level: 40-55) using either OTCI (n = 25) or MCI (n = 25). Hemodynamics, extubation times and time of awaking, rate and quality of propofol adjustment, total drug requirements, costs, postanaesthetic care unit (PACU) stay, Aldrete and pain scores, and adverse effects (postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), shivering) were recorded. Demographics, hemodynamics, and perioperative data including extubation times were comparable for both study groups. Propofol consumption was similar within the first 60 min for both groups, thereafter, significantly less propofol in the OTCI group (5.03 mg\/kg\/h) than the MCI group (5.79 mg\/kg\/h) was used. Costs for propofol was significantly reduced with OTCI (0.2 vs. 0.23 Cent\/anaesthesia minute\/kg), the administration of other anaesthetics (fentanyl, remifentanil, cis-atracurium) did not differ between the groups. The number of infusion adjustments to BIS values were not significantly different. The new OTCI-system is a safe and easily controllable technique. The obvious advantage of this infusion system appears to be a reduction in propofol consumption and direct drug costs for anaesthesia lasting longer than 60 min.

The isoform hemeoxygenase-1 is inducible by oxidative stress and may mediate cytoprotection mainly attributable to endogenously produced carbon monoxide.

The medication with clozapine was suspended because of the suspicion of NMS. When the acute symptoms were abated, the treatment with clozapine was resumed again after 14 days. The very next day, the patient suffered again from raised body core temperature, leucocytosis, elevated serum creatine kinase and new catatonia. The therapy with clozapine was stopped definitively and benzodiazepines were administered assuming a relapse of an alleviated, probably reconvening NMS. Under the treatment with benzodiazepines the patient was free of symptoms even after 1 month.

To evaluate, if combined measures using a specially arranged central venous catheter (CVC) set result in economical and clinical advantages, we compared both cost and time differences of a CVC complete set with ECG guide wire lead and an adhesive fixation with a standard set requiring additional materials, ECG fluid column lead and surgical suture. Furthermore, quality of different ECG leads, the reliability and tolerability of the adhesive fixation was compared. 76 elective adult surgical patients were randomly assigned to receive either a control CVC set or a test CVC complete set, which was featured by preconnected stopcocks, included sterile drapes, guide wire ECG position control, and an adhesive fixation. We performed ECG-guided placement of the central venous catheter using a guide wire lead in the test CVC set vs. fluid column lead in the control CVC set. Time was recorded for preparation phase of the nurse and the anesthetist, for the puncture phase, for the ECG position control and time for CVC fixation. Quality of ECG position control using guide wire or fluid column was determined by forming Pmax\/R ratio. Costs of the complete set and the standard set with additional material were compared. Times for preparation of nurse and anesthetists, for ECG position control and catheter fixation were significantly shorter using the test catheter set and resulted in a total time saving of 6 min (P &lt; 0.01). Times for sterile preparation and central venous puncture were not significantly different between the groups. ECG position control using the guide wire was successful in 37 out of 38 patients (97%) and in 34 of 38 patients (89%), respectively.

There were only 2 out of 38 adhesive fixations, that had to be replaced, while the mean duration of adhesive fixation was 6.2 days (3-15 days). Avoidance of disposable materials in the test CVC set led to a significant reduction of costs compared to the control CVC set. The test CVC complete set allows a significant time saving and cost reduction in performing a central venous catheter line because of completely included disposable materials. CVC position control via guide wire needs less time and shows significantly better quality of ECG compared to fluid column ECG lead.

NPPE, also addressed as post-obstructive pulmonary edema (POPE) presents in most cases as a complex of symptoms with rapid onset, consisting of acute respiratory failure with dyspnea, tachypnea, and strained respiratory efforts. Additional signs are paradoxe ventilation, pink frothy sputum, stridor, and severe agitation. UAO produce extreme reduction of intrathoracic pressure during spontaneous ventilation, consecutively causing increase in venous return to the right ventricle and in intrathoracic blood volume, resulting in elevated hydrostatic pressures and interstitial transudation of fluids. Partially due to largely differing criteria used for diagnosis, opinions about incidence and prevalence of NPPE are unhomogenous in medical literature. It has been shown that generation of NPPE is not only limited to patients being intubated and ventilated, but occurs also in patients requiring higher fractions of oxygen.","1459":"","1460":"Amputations of extremities, especially in the childhood, impose high demands on the perioperative management.

The answers (n = 16) showed following results: Balanced anaesthesia with continuous application of opioids was the standard method (80 %). Different volatile anaesthetics as well as different opioids were used, isoflurane (66.7 %) and fentanyl (53.3 %) were the most common. Veno-venous bypass was never or occasionally used (86.7 %). The differentiated use of catecholamines, based on discussions in the last years, was also reflected in the results. Dobutamine\/noradrenaline as combination seemed to be the first choice (46.7 %). Whereas there was an accordance with the employment of blood components, there was a large variation in the effectively applied blood products.

Comparable to a specialist neurological ICU a wide spectrum of neurological diseases could be observed on an interdisciplinary ICU. In comparison to other patient groups, patients with neurological disease had a higher rate of ventilation, a longer hospital stay and a higher mortality.

In 12 patients we observed neurological deterioration for more than 2 spinal segments. Six of these patients had been diagnosed preclinically with paraplegia at a neurological level of T4 or T5, whereas the evaluation in the hospital showed cervical spinal cord injury and tetraplegia. Possible reasons for this neurological deterioration can be secondary damages of the nervous tissue due to vascular, metabolic or biochemical mechanisms, transportation trauma or insufficient preclinical diagnostics. There is no evidence for a higher risk of secondary tissue damage for patients with cervical spinal cord injury. None of the six patients had additional injuries of the spinal cord or the vertebral column in the thoracic region, therefore transportation trauma is also unlikely.

Recent studies have shown that preclinical care carried out by an emergency physician assure better results. An ongoing improvement in the quality of care should be achieved by the introduction of the new professional training for physicians \"emergency medicine\". In a direct comparison of two emergency medical services, one with emergency physicians, one only with paramedics it could be demonstrated that the integration of emergency physicians will increase the rate of patients, whose vital status could be improved by more than 20 %. The rate of patients discharged from hospital after cardiopulmonal resuscitation is 3 fold higher than in a rescue service without emergency physicians.

Following endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation by an emergency physician at the scene, the patient was delivered to the emergency room of an university hospital. An ultrasonic check of the abdomen revealed free fluid in the abdominal cavity, and a rupture of liver and spleen was suspected. Since breath sounds over the right lung were diminished, a chest tube was inserted immediately in the fifth intercostal space in the anterior axillary line. About 300 millilitres of blood were drained by the tube. Shortly thereafter, a laparotomy was performed, where spleen and liver rupture were confirmed and treated. After 60 minutes, the patient developed severe hypotension coupled with ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, and resuscitation measures had to be initiated. Since breath sounds over the right lung were missing, a tension pneumothorax was suspected and a thoracotomy performed immediately. While huge amounts of air and blood were emerging from the thoracic cavity, a rupture of the right mainstem bronchus as well as of the right pulmonary artery and vena subclavia was identified. The chest tube was found dislocated into the subcutaneous tissue. Despite of open heart compression, application of adrenaline and noradrenaline and substitution of packed red blood cells and of crystalloid and colloid solutions, all resuscitation measures failed so that the patient died shortly after on the operation table. This case illustrates first the difficulties of an adequate thoracic trauma management, particularly, when clinical symptoms are discrete, second the problems of the insertion and control of a chest tube, and third risks associated with wrong position or secondary dislocation which may include - as in our case - \"masking\" of severe injury patterns and delay of life-saving measures such as an immediate thoracotomy. In order to improve prognosis of patients with poly-\/thoracic trauma, establishment of spiral-CT in emergency centres, routine bronchoscopy and safe handling of chest tubes may be helpful.","1476":"Determination of cardiac output (CO) enables to assess the hemodynamic situation as well as to administer optimal catecholamine therapy especially in critically compromised patients with hemodynamic instability. Invasive determination of CO is possible via a Swan-Ganz-catheter with its associated risk of implantation in the hospital. Using the Doppler technique, we evaluated the feasibility of the USCOM-system for non-invasive CO determination in preclinical emergency medicine in air rescue service. In 32 patients (17 months to 92-years-old) cardiac output was determined non-invasively (USCOM) at the scene and during the helicopter transport at Christoph 4, based at Hannover Medical School. Simultaneously, blood pressure, ECG and oxygen saturation were determined. Non-invasive CO was assessed by a suprasternal access aiming at the aorta ascendens. 19 patients were unconscious due to cardial and non-cardial reasons, and 13 were conscious (sepsis, status epilepticus, anaphylactic reaction). 7 patients were hemodynamically unstable. In three patients the monitor was used during interhospital transfer by helicopter. Non-invasively determined CO via the USCOM system was 4.8 +\/- 0.7 l\/min with a cardiac index of 2.4 +\/- 0.3 l\/m (2). Highest CO values were determined in a patient with sepsis and during a grand-mal-status in epilepsy (CO 8.2 l\/min). All examinations were done by the same emergency physician of the emergency helicopter Christoph 4 immediately after arrival at the scene. The examination took on average 25 seconds. During the helicopter transport, several consecutive CO measurements were performed to assess volume and catecholamine therapy with increase of stroke volume after volume load with colloidal fluids. Using the USCOM system it is possible to determine the beat-to-beat cardiac output in air rescue service non-invasively. The emergency physician gains additional crucial hemodynamic information to diagnose and treat adequately by administration of volume load and catecholamines at the scene and during flight conditions. Further preclinical prospective trials are mandatory to elucidate the value of this novel device in emergency medicine. ","1477":"The German physician based emergency medical system (EMS) might confront physicians with advance directives in the field. A multi-question survey was used to evaluate emergency physicians' experience with advance directives in the prehospital setting and to assess their attitudes towards forms and statements of advance directives. A questionnaire was mailed to the members of the Association of Emergency Physicians of Northern Germany (\"AGNN\"), an interest group of emergency physicians, in 2001. 511 emergency physicians (50,4 % of the AGNN members) filled in the questionnaire completely and sent it back for evaluation. 75 % of the participants were working as emergency physicians at present, 72 % had emergency experiences of more than 5 years. One third had previously dealt with advance directives in the prehospital setting. 77 % of these physicians thought advance directives generally helpful. Nevertheless 88 % based their management on the context of the individual circumstances (e. g. emergency conditions, underlying diseases, expected prognosis), only 7 % said they would always exactly follow the statements of the directive. In the view of the emergency physicians the advance directive should contain information on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR: 88 %), intensive care-treatment (75 %) and preclinical emergency treatment (55 %). Information on underlying diseases (87 %) and a legal substitute (84 %) should be contained as well. As formal requirements, 47 % of the physicians wanted the family doctor to be involved, 49 % desired a notary authenticity confirmation, additionally or solely. Pragmatically, the advance directive should be kept with the personal documents (84 %). A regular reconfirmation was deemed necessary (twice to once a year: 64 %). The current legal situation was regarded as unclear by 81 % of the emergency physicians, 85 % favored a unique, officially authorized type of directive. The high number of returned questionnaires shows the importance of the topic \"advance directives\" for emergency physicians. Despite some practical and legal problems, a big majority of the experienced emergency physicians in this survey thought the advance directives in the prehospital setting to be helpful.

Clarke et al. showed that in the hypotensive patient with blunt abdominal trauma and bleeding a delay in the surgical treatment over 90 min increases mortality of 1 % every 3 minutes. So called trauma algorithms are used as systematic approach to the seriously injured patient that can be easily reviewed and practiced. One impact of this algorithm is to shorten time in the emergency room and may improve outcome of the patient. The patient outcome is directly related to the length of time between the injury and the beginning to proper definitive care. Are improvements still necessary and possible in the care of the seriously injured patient? New technical developments like multislice-CT are able to shorten time until definitive care. The practicability of an multislice-CT orientated treatment algorithm was evaluated. After integration of an multislice-CT into the emergency room the treatment of the seriously injured patient (ISS &gt;16) was changed. Therefore an algorithm which puts the CT diagnostics in the first minutes of the clinical care was developed. 50 patients were treated following the new algorithm. The time in the emergency room decreased from 87 min to 36 min. This algorithm requires a differing from previous surgical standards, but it proved to be timesaving, effective and practicable. It makes the beginning of the definitive care possible within the first 40 min after patient arrival in the emergency room.

We studied maximum blood flow velocity in defined areas of hepatic and portal veins by duplex ultrasonography in 20 healthy volunteers (12 male, 8 female; age: 24,7 +\/- 4,7 years [mean +\/- SD]) before, during and after application of CPAP (10 cm H(2)O). As many measurements as possible were taken in both vascular systems. After division into five minute intervals arithmetical mean values were calculated for each interval. The experiment was divided into a control interval (\"before CPAP\"), three \"CPAP\" intervals and finally two \"after CPAP\" intervals. Heart rate and blood pressure were taken at the beginning of these intervals. Compared with the control interval, maximum blood flow velocity in the area of the hepatic vein decreased significantly by 13,2 %, 16,8 % and 15,7 % (p &lt; or = 0,001 in each case) during each of the three \"CPAP\" periods.

An increasing number of interventions in carotid surgery are performed under regional anesthesia in conscious patients. Carotid endarterectomy in local anesthesia requires block of the cervical nerves C2-C4, which may be accomplished in different ways. The most frequent method of regional anesthesia in carotid surgery is a combined block of profunda and superficial cervical plexus (by using a nerve stimulator). Ultrasound is frequently used in anesthesia for venous access and peripheral nerve block. By ultrasound, it is possible to visualize puncture needle and spread of local anesthetics at the correct position for block of cervical plexus in carotid surgery. The aim of the case reports was to demonstrate the effectiveness of using ultrasound for regional anesthesia in carotid surgery. At the level of carotid bifurcation, scalene muscles were visualized by ultrasound (10-MHz-transducer). At this position, a puncture needle was inserted in the beam of ultrasound. Between the anterior scalene and the sternocleidomastoid muscles the local anesthetics were injected (10 ml prilocaine 1 %, 20 ropivacaine 0.375 %). In addition, superficial cervical plexus was performed by subcutaneous injection (10 ml prilocaine 1 %, 40 ropivacaine 0.375 %). Sedation was performed by application of remifentanil (max. 0.02 microg\/kg\/min), as needed. Ultrasound guided cervical block was performed in 29 patients. In all cases cervical plexus block was complete. A conversion to general anesthesia during operation was not necessary in any case. Ultrasound presents an alternative to cervical block using nerve stimulation, especially in patients with anatomical abnormalities. The method proves to be effective and may improve the approach to profundeal cervical plexus. ","1501":"Clonidine is a mixed alpha (2)-\/alpha (1)- adrenoceptor agonist. It decreases sympathetic tone and increases parasympathetic tone, which results in a lowering of blood pressure and heart rate. It was introduced as an antihypertensive medication in the late sixties. Yet Clonidine also has a sedative effect due to alpha (2)-adrenoceptor stimulation in the locus coeruleus and antinociceptive action caused through postjunctional noradrenergic pathways in the brainstem and spinal cord. This analgesic property of Clonidine has raised broad interest in its beneficial use in anaesthesiology. In adults and pediatric anaesthesia, clonidine can be safely and effectively used for premedication, intraoperative and postoperative analgesia, postoperative shivering, and for analgo-sedation in intensive care.

Usual tube connectors and newly developed connectors with check valve were examined with respect to ventilation pressures, ventilation volumes, and leakage before and after insertion of suction catheters and bronchoscopes. Using normal connectors, ventilation pressures and volumes collapsed even at lowest expiratory pressures, and significant leakage occurred. The insertion of catheters or bronchoscopes had only little beneficial effects. In contrast, the new connectors with check valve showed only small leakage, even at high ventilation pressures.

Perioperative aspiration of gastric contents resulted in severe ARDS. Invasive therapeutic options including ECMO had to be used to obtain full recovery. After critical evaluation of the chain of causation it must be postulated that an improper airway was chosen for an intervention that comprises a high risk of aspiration per se. Further risk factors were a long period of fasting, untimely removal of the mask before the patient regained full consciousness, the late confirmation of the diagnosis and the hesitant initial therapy. Since PLMA provides a higher airway occlusion pressure compared to the classic laryngeal mask airway (CLMA), the use of this device may be justified for elective laparoscopic surgery. In emergency patients with increased risk of regurgitation endotracheal intubation still remains the gold standard.","1516":"The ProSeal laryngeal mask airway (PLMA) has some design features, which in contrast to the classic LMA allow separation of the respiration from the gastrointestinal canal, a higher leak pressure and a better position assessment. It can be debated if these instrumental improvements justify the application of the PLMA for elective abdominal surgery in cases without aspiration risk. Insertion of airway instruments and gastric tube with regard to insertion time and difficulties and frequency of side effects were to be compared for the tracheal tube and the PLMA. The pharyngolaryngeal morbidity for both methods was also of interest. It was approached with direct and indirect postoperative interview techniques. 65 patients were investigated both at the university hospital and at the hospital Neu-Bethlehem in Goettingen. The surgical intervention was a surgical or gynecological laparotomy. Anaesthesia was performed with a standardized application of propofol, alfentanil and rocuronium. Glycopyrroniumbromide was applied to minimize salivation. A total of 34 patients received the PLMA, 31 were intubated. All of them were provided with a gastric tube. The insertion of the PLMA took 70 seconds (21 - 234) on average, the intubation 57 seconds (35 - 145). Endotracheal intubation was accomplished in a shorter time period, but there was no significant difference in comparison with the PLMA-group (p = 0.1924). Insertion of the PLMA was significantly more difficult than oral intubation (p = 0.0006). The base of the tongue and the dorsal pharyngeal wall, but not the vocal cords or the epiglottis were visible in those cases, where the PLMA could not be positioned at all. Here the tip of the cuff was bended. The time period for positioning of the gastric tube was 38 seconds (15 - 75) in the PLMA- and 57 seconds (22 - 219) in the tracheal tube group. With these results the gastric tube positioning was accomplished in a significantly shorter time period in the PLMA-group (p = 0.0267), but not at a significantly higher level of difficulty for endotracheal intubation (p = 0,6247). In one case there was regurgitation through the drainage tube without aspiration before gastric tube placement. At the direct interview 16 patients in the PLMA-group and 23 of the tube group mentioned postoperative throat symptoms. The most frequent symptom was hoarseness (11 PLMA- and 18 intubated patients). There was no significant difference between PLMA- and tracheal tube application with regard to the total number of patients with pharyngolaryngeal morbidity and the frequency of single symptoms. The same is true for the degree of the symptoms. There was a tendency for a longer prevalence of throat symptoms after intubation, but no significant difference. In this investigation the PLMA could be successfully applied for elective laparotomies in cases without the risk of aspiration. Proper patient selection and a deep level of anaesthesia are important. The advantage for patients receiving the PLMA is a smooth recovery without cough, but not so much a reduced amount of pharyngolaryngeal morbidity. From this observation it might be concluded that the invasiveness of the surgical intervention might also influence the tolerance for the airway instrument. The disadvantage in this study was the more difficult insertion of the PLMA compared with the oral intubation. Further studies with a larger number of patients must show if these first results of the \"Proseal\"-LMA for lararotomies are to be confirmed.

Depending on the size of the department the LMA is used in 1 - 60 % of all anaesthetics. The LMA is used significantly more often (p &gt; 0.001) in smaller departments providing up to 10 000 anaesthetics per year compared to larger departments providing up to, or more than, 20 000 anaesthetics per year.

Only during the last decades has tremendous progress been made in developing new, highly-sophisticated equipment: matching spinal and epidural needles and catheters, epidural needles with a separate conduit for the spinal needle or with an additional hole for the exit of the spinal needle as well as fixation devices for the spinal needle. A specific feature of the method is the only recently recognised epidural volume extension, which allows the use of low-dose drug combinations with sufficient analgetic properties but less cardiovascular compromise and fewer side-effects. This review describes the main and most important developmental steps and offers practical examples for its use in day-case surgery of the lower limb, in the \"walking epidural\" in obstetrics and in caesarean section.

Neuraxial blockade: use of sterile gloves, a surgical face mask, and a sterile gown is recommended; 3. Intravenous anaesthesia: equipment not manufactured for re-use may not be used for more than one patient under any circumstances.

The entire rational behind this phenomenon is still unclear. An ATP-shortage in the vascular musculature, disregulation of vasopressin release, and the activation of ATP-dependent potassium-channels are discussed. In the last years, attention is drawn towards the activation of ATP-dependent potassium-channels and the possible therapeutic inhibition by glibenclamid. However, inhibition of potassium-channels does not normalize blood pressure under all circumstances. In particular in septic shock other mechanisms have to be involved. Overall, the sometimes desperate clinical situation has led to a large number of case reports und uncontrolled series of retrospectively analysed cases, where vasopressin or methylenblue were discribed as successfully reversing catecholamine resistent hypotension. Nevertheless, in hemorrhagic and septic shock scientific evidence of the clinical effects and the right dose as well as placebo controlled studies comparing the agents and possible combinations of agents are desirable but hardly available yet. In the case of severe hypotension following surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass results of the first randomized and placebo controlled studies describe successful restoration of blood pressure and even a decrease in perioperative mortality. Concerning the side effects, vasopressin and methylenblue, like most vasopressors, can cause gastrointestinal ischemia, but with the small number of patients enrolled so far, further major side effects can not be ruled out. Accordingly, the identification of risk factors for the development of vasoplegia and the prediction of the extent of the response or the rate of non-responders to these treatments are widely unknown. However, although the administration of vasopressin and methylenblue can not be recommended as a standard treatment it provides an additional option in individual cases of life threatening vasoplegia.","1524":"Obturator nerve block is used for transurethral resection of lateral bladder wall tumors to prevent adductor muscle spasm and associated complications.

Motor blockade intensity was significantly higher with ropivacaine 0.75 % at all time points of assessment. Intraoperatively, severe spasm only occurred in the prilocaine 1 %-group. Ropivacaine 0.75 % is a more appropriate agent for direct obturator nerve block than prilocaine 1 %, providing a faster onset and a more intense and longer-lasting motor blockade.

A main objective of these measures is to render patient care more cost efficient. Within the hospital, the operating room (OR) is the most expensive factor accounting for 25 - 50 % of the costs of a surgical patient and is also a bottleneck in the surgical patient care.

ICU mortality of patients with nosocomial pneumonia was 8.8 %, of patients with primary bloodstream infection was 10,9 %. Of the ICU patients with nosocomial pneumonia and primary bloodstream infections about 3554 die annually, in about 1131 cases the nosocomial infection was the cause of death. It may be estimated that the ICU acquired cases of pneumonia and primary bloodstream infection contributed to the death of about 2400 patients annually in Germany. Because of the substantial mortality of patients with ICU acquired infections preventive measures have a high priority. Further studies leading to improved infection control measures are very wellcome. ","1545":"Injection-induced pain during induction of anaesthesia can result in patient's discomfort. This can prevent the use of propofol-anaesthesia in paediatric patients. Because of the high incidence of pain on injection with propofol numerous interventions have been tested to prevent this pain including the use of different drugs and physical measures as well as the combination of methods. The use of a single intervention is not as effective as the combination of different preventive measures. Thus the additional application of a venous tourniquet improves the pain reducing effect if drugs with peripheral mechanism of action are used for prevention of pain. Injection of lidocaine with a rubber tourniquet before the propofol injection is recommended as best effective method. In any case a propofol-MCT\/LCT-Emulsion should be used for propofol-anaesthesia. Additionally a multimodal strategy that is adapted to the daily clinical practice seems to be convenient. That means, for general anaesthesia opioids or ketamine and for sedation a sub-anaesthetic dose of thiopental can be used for effective prevention of pain. If the prevention of nausea and emesis is intended, antiemetics that are appropriate for prevention of injection pain should be given. For paediatric anaesthesia the application of EMLA-cream seems to be suitable, because it alleviates the pain during venous cannulation at the same time. Although a painfree propofol injection is not possible with every prevention strategy there exist a wide range of effective interventions to prevent pain on injection with propofol. This article reviews methods that have been investigated and established to minimise the incidence of pain.","1546":"","1547":"","1548":"","1549":"In the past years an ongoing controversial debate exists in Germany, regarding quality of the coroner's inquest and declaration of death by physicians. We report the case of a 90-year old female, who was found after an unknown time following a suicide attempt with benzodiazepine. The examination of the patient showed livores (mortis?) on the left forearm and left lower leg. Moreover, rigor (mortis?) of the left arm was apparent which prevented arm flexion and extension. The hypothermic patient with insufficient respiration was intubated and mechanically ventilated. Chest compressions were not performed, because central pulses were (hardly) palpable and a sinus bradycardia 45\/min (AV-block 2 degrees and sole premature ventricular complexes) was present. After placement of an intravenous line (17 G, external jugular vein) the hemodynamic situation was stabilized with intermittent boli of epinephrine and with sodium bicarbonate. With improved circulation livores and rigor disappeared. In the present case a minimal central circulation was noted, which could be stabilized, despite the presence of certain signs of death ( livores and rigor mortis). Considering the finding of an abrogated peripheral perfusion (livores), we postulate a centripetal collapse of glycogen and ATP supply in the patients left arm (rigor), which was restored after resuscitation and reperfusion. Thus, it appears that livores and rigor are not sensitive enough to exclude a vita minima, in particular in hypothermic patients with intoxications. Consequently a careful ABC-check should be performed even in the presence of apparently certain signs of death, to avoid underdiagnosing a vita minima. Additional ECG- monitoring is required to reduce the rate of false positive declarations of death. To what extent basic life support by paramedics should commence when rigor and livores are present until physician DNR order, deserves further discussion.","1550":"Onset time and recovery from non depolarising neuromuscular blockade depends on the tested muscle and is influenced by the age of the patient. This study compares the neuromuscular blocking effect of rocuronium on the diaphragm, adductor pollicis and orbicularis oculi muscle in young and elderly patients. After institutional ethics committee approval and written informed consent, 20 adult patients (ASA I - II), age 18 - 59 and &gt; 65, have been included. Neuromuscular response was measured by accelerography for the adductor pollicis and orbicularis oculi muscle. Monitoring of the diaphragm consisted of measurement of the airway pressure against an occluded tracheal tube during magnetic phrenic nerve stimulation. Onset time and recovery were measured after injection of 0.6 mg\/kg Rocuronium. The adductor pollicis had the fastest onset time ( young 2.3 min, old 2.2 min), followed by diaphragm ( young 3.6 min, old 3.4 min) and orbicularis oculi muscle ( young 3.7 min, old 4.8 min). There was a complete blockade of the diaphragm in 50 % of all patients (Adductor pollicis 100 %, orbicularis oculi 40 %). Neuromuscular recovery, recovery index and TOF 0.8 differed significantly between young and elderly patients. Onset of recovery was earlier at the diaphragm ( young 15.9 min, old 22.0 min) compared to the peripheral muscles (adductor pollicis young 25.6 min, old 37.9 min, orbicularis oculi young 23.8 min, old 27.5 min). 2 fould ED95 of rocuronium often results in an incomplete neuromuscular blockade of the diaphragm. Therefore monitoring of the peripheral muscles in patients given a single dose of rocuronium often overestimates the degree of diaphragmatic relaxation, but is a save predictor of recovery. Especially in elderly patients were prolonged neuromuscular blockade should be expected, a neuromuscular monitoring is recommended. ","1551":"Purpose of the study was to investigate the mitotic index (MI) and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) levels to identify the mutagenic and carcinogenic effects of sevoflurane (sevoflurane). 42 non-smoking male and female turkish patients of ASA-risk I and II were included. The patients received an anaesthesia induction with 8 % sevoflurane in 100 % oxygen (\"tidal volume methode\") and 0.1 mg\/kg BW vecuronium for neuromuscular block and endotracheal intubation. Anaesthesia was maintained with 2.0 - 2.5 sevoflurane in 60 % N(2)O and 40 % O(2). Four 5 ml venous blood samples werde taken: before induction (control), 60 minutes, 24 hours and 5 days after sevoflurane anesthesia. Samples were prepared according to the periferic blood culture assay, modified by Morhead and co-workers, and levels of MI and SCE were examined. 60 minutes after sevoflurane-anaesthesia a significant decrease of MI was found compared to controls (p &lt; 0.01). This depression was lower after 24 hours (p &lt; 0.05) and reversible after 5 days. SCE increased significantly during 60 minutes of anaesthesia (p &lt; 0.001), was also lower after 24 hours (5.6 +\/- 2.4 vs. 4.4 +\/- 1.7) and returned to normal levels after 5 days (p &gt; 0.05). The application of sevoflurane for anaesthesia may influence the cell division in humans and may have a mutagenic effect on DNA at the cell level, which is reversible. ","1552":"Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia is a potentially life-threatening ventricular tachycardia. The arrhythmia can be treated with antiarrhythmic drugs, when the patient is hemodynamically stable. Class IC antiarrhythmic drugs like flecainide and propafenon or ajmaline (class IA\/IC) are very effective. The use of lidocaine is obsolete. Sotalol is also effective, however, caution is advised because of its significant beta-sympatholytic properties. Amiodaron is frequently used, although it has never been studied in the setting of stable ventricular tachycardia. Earlier studies have demonstrated that it is effective in the treatment of recurrent, hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia. When a particular drug does not terminate tachycardia, further drugs should not be given. Electrical cardioversion is preferred.","1553":"Extracorporeal liver support methods have been tested for over 50 years now. Standard techniques of blood purification like dialysis, adsorption, hemo- and plasma filtration as well as bioreactor-based approaches using liver cells or tissues have been used. Most clinical experience, however, is limited to use in acute liver failure (ALF). Since 1993, the Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System (MARS) has been used clinically -- a system that combines dialysis, filtration and adsorption in a biocompatible method. Human serum albumin (HSA) acts as a selective molecular adsorbent binding protein-bound compounds like bile acids or bilirubin. These substances can contribute to the maintenance or even further aggravation of liver failure. They are linked with the pathogenesis of hyperdynamic hypotonic circulation, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, impaired hepatic protein synthesis, and intractable pruritus seen in chronic liver failure. HSA takes over the toxic substances from a patient's blood and passes through a remote detoxification process including bicarbonate-dialysis and a two-step adsorption. It is then recirculated in the patient's blood. Up to today, more than 4000 patients have been treated in approximately 16,000 single sessions. Thus, MARS represents the most frequently used liver support method at the present time. In addition to ALF, mainly acute decompensations of chronic liver failures (ACLF) have been treated. The impact of the extracorporeal treatment on relevant medical parameters of intensive care medicine is discussed with regard to the specific situation of the liver-failure patient (susceptibility to infection, atypical picture and course of infection, coagulation disorders and bleeding tendencies).","1554":"On the one hand gender studies are based on the differentiation of biological (sex) and social (gender) identities. Above all, gender studies in public health research are seen as an biological, psychological and social entity. To understand the complexity linked to the term \"gender\" in medicine, different perspectives are required. Apart from the uncertainty, which may occur by the changing perspective on gender, it also holds the option for innovation in anesthesiology, too. The goal of gender based medicine is an optimized, individual adjusted medical care. Precondition to realize this aim is the understanding of the genesis, the consolidation, and the elimination of gender biases in all fields of research, publications and education. The transfer of methods and guidelines for gender sensitive research, adapted from the public health research, allows an access to detect the meaning of gender specifics and gender differences, to verify its clinical relevance and to exercise the results in clinical daily work. With gender sensitive methods desiderata should be reduced, and methodological standards for gender sensitive medical\/clinical research can be developed and implemented into medical education. In the light of knowledge about sex specific differences in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic as well as undesired drug interactions, basic research may help to overcome the gender gap and to individualize and optimize the anesthesiological approach as well. A main problem in implementing gender studies into medicine is the limitation of sex sensitive biomedical significance. Nevertheless, the already existing measures in public health should be evaluated and modified for clinical practice. The current review is to be read as an introduction into different aspects of gender studies in medicine, in order to extend the understanding of its importance for anesthesiology, too. It shows that the relevance transcends still existing studies based on biomedical gender diversities.","1555":"","1556":"Percutaneous disc decompression using the Decompressor system is another treatment option for patients suffering from chronic discogenic leg pain. This is the first report on a patient undergoing this procedure under CT-control. A 49 year old man with radicular leg pain showed significant pain reduction after percutaneus decompression of a discal herniation at the L4\/5 level. The new system enables qualitative and quantitative measures of the removed disc material. CT-control ensures exact positioning of the device.","1557":"The aims of this study were to evaluate the incidence of mechanically ventilated children in participating units, to find out the demographic data of the patients, to evaluate ventilator settings and to assess the mortality of ventilated children. Prospective observational multicenter study between 1. 2. 2002 and 30. 4. 2002. Seven paediatric intensive care units in tertiary hospitals in the Czech Republic. All children between 1 month and 18 years admitted to the participating paediatric intensive care units who required intubation and mechanical ventilation were enrolled. Following parameters were recorded in all patients: demographic data (age, weight, gender), the origin of the admitting diagnosis, severity of illness (Pediatric Risk of Mortality Score - PRISM, Multiorgan System Failure - MOSF, Lung Injury Score - LIS), the origin of respiratory failure, presence of chronic disease and immunosuppression, length of ventilation, length of stay, ventilator setting, the use of unconventional ventilation, outcome (mortality), blood gas analyses and indices (alveoloarterial oxygen difference - AaDO (2), oxygenation index - OI, hypoxemia score - PaO (2)\/FiO (2) and ventilation index - VI), deadspace to tidal volume ratio-Vd\/Vt and dynamic respiratory system compliance (Cdyn). One hundred and forty four children (42 % girls) were enrolled in total which represent 23 % of all admitted children. The mean age of the patients was 70 months and mean weight was 23 kg. PRISM score and the length of stay were twofold against mean values (11.7 vs. 5.7 and 10.4 vs. 4.8 days respectively). The mean length of ventilation was 117 hours, 66 % of the patients had an extrapulmonary origin of respiratory failure, 19 % of the patients were chronically ill, and 0,7 % had the evidence of immunosuppression. Pressure regulated volume controlled and Biphasic positive airway pressure were the most frequently used ventilator settings. Unconventional ventilation in all was used in 13 % of the patients. Mortality was 3.5 %. Children on mechanical ventilation create 23 % of all patients admitted to paediatric intensive care units. The severity of illness and length of stay were twofold against mean values. Mortality rate was 3.5 % and hypoxia was not a cause of death in any patient. ","1558":"Cardiovascular surgical procedures with extracorporeal circulation (ECC) lead to neutrophil activation followed by the release of proteases such as neutrophil elastase (NE) and oxidants. The mis-balance between proteases and their physiological inhibitors may contribute to morbidity in the postoperative period. In this study, the effects of cardiac surgery on neutrophil mediators were evaluated. Release of neutrophil elastase and plasma levels of the natural NE antagonists alpha (1)-proteinase inhibitor (API) and secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor (SLPI) were measured. The oxidative burst and the phagocytic activity were also evaluated. Tissue destruction was quantified by measuring the serum concentration of fibronectin. Blood samples were obtained from 30 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 30). NE and SLPI concentrations were measured by ELISA, API and fibronectin plasma levels were determined by nephelometry. Neutrophil phagocytic activity and oxidative burst were evaluated by flow cytometry. Neutrophil elastase plasma concentrations rose during ECC (245 +\/- 107 microg\/ml versus 44 +\/- 14 microg\/ml after induction, p &lt; 0.001), whereas SLPI and API were decreased after onset of ECC. 24 h after ECC SLPI (54 +\/- 17 ng\/ml versus 41 +\/- 10 ng\/ml, p &lt; 0.05) and API (3 +\/- 0.5 g\/l versus 1.6 +\/- 0.3 g\/l, p &lt; 0.05) increased significantly compared to baseline values. A minor increase in phagocytic activity was observed after the onset of ECC. There were no significant changes in the oxidative burst. Cardiac surgery with ECC leads to neutrophil activation and elastase release. The imbalance between NE and the NE inhibitors API and SLPI may increase the risk for tissue damage due to granulocyte activation after cardiac surgery. ","1559":"Venous thromboembolism is a common complication in critically ill patients, resulting in high morbidity and mortality. Most patients treated in intensive care units (ICU) face a high risk of thromboembolic complications. There is a need for well-defined strategies for prevention of thrombosis in ICU patients. Mechanical methods such as compression stockings are frequently used, even though evidence for these measures in ICU patients is limited. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is still the leading drug for thromboprophylaxis in ICU patients, but pharmacokinetic disadvantages such as low predictability of effect on anticoagulation are relevant, especially in ICU patients. Additionally, there is no sufficient evidence from clinical trials to support subcutaneous or intravenous prophylaxis with UFH. At least equivalent efficacy and safety of subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) compared with subcutaneous UFH have been shown in numerous studies investigating non-ICU high-risk groups. First studies on the use of LMWH in critically ill patients are promising. Some conclusions for safe use of subcutaneous LMWH in ICU patients can be drawn. Intravenous LMWH may be the optimal prophylaxis in most ICU patients, but there is a lack of sufficient data on dosing. Precautions such as monitoring of anticoagulation in patients with renal insufficiency are fundamental if LMWH is given. Further investigations into prevention of venous thromboembolism in ICU patients are urgently needed.","1560":"In the months of winter 2002-2004, three cases of non-traumatic cardiac arrest occurred in the skiing area of the Stubaier Gletscher in Tyrol, Austria. All patients were initially resuscitated by ski patrol members, including the use of an automated external defibrillator (AED). Two of the patients were alive at hospital admission, one patient was discharged from hospital without neurological damage. The article describes the chain of survival in a high-alpine area, the installation of a modified public-access-defibrillation (PAD) system in a skiing area, and the prerequisites necessary for a successful PAD-program far away from an organized emergency medical system.","1561":"Ultrasound is well established in medicine. Unfortunately, ultrasound is still rarely used in the area of anesthesia. The purpose of the article is to illustrate the possibilities and limitations of ultrasound in regional anesthesia. The basic principles of ultrasound are the piezoelectric effect and the behaviour of acoustic waveforms in human tissue. Ultrasound imaging in medicine uses high frequency pulses of sound waves (2.5-10 MHz). The following images are built up from the reflected sounds. The ultrasound devices used in regional anesthesia (commonly by 10 MHz) deliver a two-dimensional view. The main step for a successful regional anaesthesia is to identify the exact position of the nerve. In addition, specific surface landmarks and the use of peripheral nerve stimulator help to detect the correct position of the needle. Nerves are demonstrated as an composition of hyperechogenic (white) and hypoechogenic (black) areas. The surrounding hyperechogenic parts are epi- and perineurium, the dark hypoechogenic part is the neural tissue. The composition of peripheral nerves are always similar, but the quantities of each part, of surrounding perineurium and nerval structures, differ. Further the imaging of nerves is significantly influenced by the angle of beam to the nerve and the surrounding anatomic structures. Only experience and correct interpretation make the ultrasound a valid method in clinical practice. Correct interpretation has to be learned by standardized education. Three examples of peripheral nerve blocks are described. The detection of nerves and the visualization of the correct spread of local anesthetics to the nerves are the main principles of effective ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia, whereas closest proximity of the needle to the target nerve is not necessary. The described examples of ultrasound guidance for nerval block illustrates the specific procedures with reduced probability of nerval irritation, high success and low rate of complications.","1562":"In anaesthesia, relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States as well as Great Britain are traditionally good and long established. Political conditions have not interfered with the scientific exchange. In the years after World War II, these contacts helped to establish anaesthesia as a special field of medicine in Germany. Today, these contacts are mutual and indispensable. Important steps in establishing anaesthesiology in Germany were the support of the USA and Great Britain in reconstructing the field in general and enabling the education and advanced training of physicians. The participation of Sir Robert Macintosh in the German Surgeons' Congress in 1950 and his presentation there contributed decisively to the professionalization of anaesthesia. This was the starting point for the consolidation of anaesthesia as a special discipline of medicine in Germany in the 1960s.","1563":"","1564":"","1565":"","1566":"A 22 year old female was admitted to the emergency department with high fever up to 41,5 degrees C, tachycardia, and arterial hypotension. Clinically, she presented with bilateral pulmonary coarse crackles. Diagnosis on admission was pneumonia with septic shock. Intriguingly, procalcitonin (PCT) was increased early, reaching up to 435 ng\/mL, while C-reactive protein levels were only moderately increased, with several days delay. The sepsis was originated from a multi-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia. Remarkably, the course of PCT levels reflected the severity of septic shock in that it paralleled noradrenaline demand. Ten months previously, the patient had been diagnosed with acute disseminated brainstem encephalitis (ADEM), and had received two cycles of intravenous cyclophosphamide. Our case illustrates that PCT is an early marker for sepsis and it indicates that PCT may also be a valuable marker for the severity of sepsis in immunosuppressed patients.","1567":"Does the electrocardiographic method for central venous catheter positioning distinguish between a correct intravasal and a malpositioned extravasal position? 24 cardiac surgical patients were enrolled in this prospective observational study. In 18 patients the left, in another 6 patients the right internal jugular vein was cannulated. Using a J-wire within a triple-lumen catheter the amplitude of the P-wave was measured at 3 different intravasal sites: Intra-1: (intravasal baseline electrocardiogram), i. e. 10 cm marking of the catheter on skin level; Intra-2: clear rise of the P-wave amplitude upon further insertion of the catheter; Intra-3: maximum P-wave amplitude. At this position the control of the catheter tip was achieved by means of transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE). Intraoperatively, another J-wire within a triple-lumen catheter was placed by the heart surgeon on 3 extravasal sites and the ECG was recorded: Extra-1: extravasal at the left innominate vein above the pericardial reflection; Extra-2: extravasal on the superior vena cava below the pericardial reflection; Extra-A: extravasal on ascending aorta below the pericardial reflection. The catheter was suture fixed with its tip in position Intra-3. Post surgery a chest radiograph was taken. All catheter tips were visualised at the basis of the Crista terminals (border between right atrium and superior vena cava) by TOE control. The rise of the P wave amplitude at Intra-2, Extra-2 and Extra-A was highly significant compared to the base line at Intra-1 (Intra-1\/Intra-2, Intra-1\/Extra-2, Intra-1\/Extra-A: p in each case &lt; 0.001). The P wave amplitudes of the corresponding intra- and extravasal positions of the left innominate vein (Intra-1\/Extra-1, n = 18, p = 0.096)) as well as those of the superior vena cava (Intra-2\/Extra-2, n = 24, p = 0.859) did not differ. The electrocardiographic method can not differentiate between intra- and extravasal position of a central venous catheter, and thus, presumably fails to identify malpositioning as a result of vascular perforation.

Recently by CDC published Guidelines for Preventing Health-Care-Associated Pneumonia describe prevention measures based on evaluated studies, randomized controlled trials or meta-analyses. In this paper the most important prevention measures are given, as well as the evidence classification. \"Among the changes in the recommendations to prevent bacterial pneumonia, especially ventilator-associated pneumonia, are the preferential use of or tracheal rather than naso-tracheal tubes in patients who receive mechanically assisted ventilation, the use of noninvasive ventilation to reduce the need for and duration of endotracheal intubation, changing the breathing circuits of ventilators when they malfunction or are visibly contaminated, and (when feasible) the use of an endotracheal tube with a dorsal lumen to allow drainage of respiratory secretions.\"","1570":"The development of low resistance oxygenators widens the therapeutic options for patients with acute respiratory failure (ARDS). Pumpless arteriovenous interventional lung assist systems (ILA) can be used in a subgroup of patients with ARDS. ILA might be indicated in earlier stages of ARDS following a multimodal treatment approach.","1571":"","1572":"In the clinical setting, artificial oxygen carriers are needed when a patient has a tissue oxygen deficiency which he\/she can not automatically compensate. There are two quite different situations where this might occur: (1) Heavy blood loss (e. g., following an accident) and (2) insufficient perfusion (e. g., as a result of arteriosclerosis or myocardial infarction) or anaemia, both without blood loss. In the first instance, an iso-oncotic oxygen-transporting plasma expander is required, whereas in the second instance a (hypo-oncotic) so-called blood additive is needed. This second type of situation also presents the greater range of very important indications. Experimental work has shown that, in comparison to erythrocytes, dissolved haemoglobin is able to release oxygen more rapidly (effective plasmatic transport), while at the same time also facilitating oxygen release from erythrocytes (mediator function). Blood additives occur naturally in lower forms of life (e. g., earthworm) where they can be found in the form of giant oxygen-carrying molecules. Using these natural forms as a basis, new oxygen-transporting blood additives were designed and developed (so-called haemoglobin hyperpolymers: HP (3)Hb) which exhibit a strong oxygen affinity (half saturation partial pressure p (50) = 16 Torr) and high cooperativity (n (50) = 2.1). One product has, up until now, been produced aseptically on a small technical scale and consists of highly purified, polymerised and pegylated porcine haemoglobin which is free of monomers and oligomers, with a mean molecular weight of approximately 800 kDa. It is sufficiently low in endotoxin (&lt; 0,029 EU\/mL), blood plasma compatible, and - at an effective concentration of 3 g\/dL in blood plasma - causes only minor increases in oncotic pressure or viscosity. The product has a shelf-life of up to 2 years and is administered as a carbonyl derivative. Its half-life in the conscious rat is 30 h. This product was found to prevent death in rats where acute lung injury was induced using oleic-acid. In human self-experiments this product was repeatedly administered: No effects on blood pressure and heart rate, no increase in blood transaminase concentration and no immunological reaction were seen; the latter was also not found in selected sensitive mice. Furthermore, the blood additive is universally applicable as an oxygen transporter, since, when mixed with a conventional plasma expander, it can also be used to treat an oxygen deficiency occurring together with blood loss.","1573":"Because of an impending shortfall of allogeneic blood products within the next decades and ongoing problems such as transfusion reactions, immunomodulating side effects and the risk of bacterial, viral and prion transmission associated with relevant costs for testing and storage of banked RBC units which, additionally, suffer from aging processes, the development of alternatives has been intensified during the last 15 years. Modern chemically modified hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOC) are free of red blood cell membrane remnants eliminating renal toxicity, and they do not possess AB0 antigens which allows transfusion without knowledge of the respective blood group of a patient. Bovine polymerized cell-free hemoglobin can be stored at room temperature for three years. In contrast to the perfluorocarbon solutions, HBOC can be applied at room air oxygen concentrations. Animal experiments have shown that HBOC can compensate for intravascular volume deficits in hemorrhagic shock, including restoration of colloid osmotic pressure and organ perfusion, and deliver oxygen to organs and tissues during nearly complete blood exchange. Chemical modifications of HBOC are able to reduce the vasoconstrictive side-effect of HBOC which is caused by NO scavenging. In spite of vasoconstriction the increased oxygen extraction in presence of HBOC in combination with the plasmatic oxygen transport provides enhanced tissue oxygenation even in post-stenotic tissues. HBOC seem to improve the diffusive oxygen transport at the microcirculatory site thus decreasing tissue damage in acute pancreatitis and the heart and brain after ischemia\/reperfusion injury. Clinical studies have shown that the peri-operative use of different HBOC (Hemopure, PolyHeme, Hemolink and HemAssist) can reduce the number of allogeneic RBC units and increase the avoidance rate of allogeneic transfusion in emergency bleeding, vascular, cardiac and non-cardiac surgery. Polymerized HBOC appear to have a lower potential of side effects in comparison to intra-molecularly cross-linked preparations. However, HBOC-201 (Hemopure) is the only substance which has been licensed for the treatment of patients with acute peri-operative anemia in South Africa until now.","1574":"We present a case of severe accidental hypothermia (core temperature 22 degrees C) after a suicide attempt.

In a prospective controlled study the effects of a single intravenous (i. v.) bolus injection of 4 mg\/kg carprofen (CARP; n = 14), 0.01 mg\/kg fentanyl (FENT; n = 12) or 0.9 % saline solution (NaCl; n = 13) on lumbar CSF concentrations of NA and 5-HT were evaluated in non-stimulated sheep. In addition, CSF concentrations were evaluated in isoflurane-anaesthetised sheep at different time points T1 (30 min after i. v. treatment with 4 mg\/kg carprofen [n = 8] or saline [n = 7], T2 (20 min of constant end-tidal isoflurane concentration of 2.4 %) and T3 (during stifle arthroscopy at 2.4 % end-tidal isoflurane). CSF concentrations of NA (NaCl: 170.23 +\/- 16.86 pg\/ml [x +\/- SEM], CARP: 200.79 +\/- 28.94 pg\/ml, FENT: 209.58 +\/- 27.67 pg\/ml; p = 0.524) and 5-HT (NaCl: 2752.46 +\/- 413.87 pg\/ml, FENT: 2969.08 +\/- 684.05 pg\/ml, CARP: 3232.93 +\/- 713.93 pg\/ml; p = 0.978) were not significantly different between the three treatment groups of non-stimulated sheep. In the anaesthetised sheep, mean CSF-5-HT at T3 (NaCl: 6670.25 +\/- 313.63 pg\/ml; CARP: 4080.80 +\/- 539.59 pg\/ml) was significantly increased compared to T1 (NaCl: 2818.4 +\/- 1104.54 pg\/ml, p &lt; 0.001; CARP: 2926.13 +\/- 818.66 pg\/ml, p = 0.022) and T2 (NaCl: 2593.67 +\/- 618.89 pg\/ml, p = 0.002; CARP: 2724.13 +\/- 395.39 pg\/ml, p = 0.012) in both treatment groups. Moreover, mean CSF-5-HT at T3 in the saline group was significantly higher (p = 0.006) compared to the CARP-group. Unlike changes in CSF-5-HT, no significant changes in mean CSF-NA were recorded neither within nor between the two treatment groups. During arthroscopy in isoflurane-anaesthetised sheep, surgical stimuli may significantly increase mean CSF-5-HT concentration. This effect can be attenuated by pre-treatment with 4 mg\/kg carprofen intravenously. Therefore, the analgesic effects of carprofen may be at least in part mediated by central serotonergic mechanisms.

Assuming that the willingness to undergo the same anaesthetic again reflect overall satisfaction with the procedure satisfaction in both groups was high: 25\/26 (PNB) and 27\/28 (EA) would have preferred their regional blockade (p = 0.95). Patients in the PNB and EA group both were satisfied with their anaesthetic procedure. While there are obviously differences in favour of the EA, PNB is an alternative in the case of contraindication or patient rejection to EA. ","1577":"According to scientific publications focusing on emergency medicine and published in international journals in the past few months, new and clinically important results can be identified. In patients with severe head trauma (SHT), application of hypertonic solutions is possible; long term outcome, however, is not improved by this measure. Prehospital capnometry is important, because otherwise up to 40 % of all mechanically ventilated patients are hypoventilated. In a study in 200 patients with prehospital cardiac arrest and ventricular fibrillation as initial cardiac rhythm, subgroup analysis (alarm-response time &gt; 5 min) showed an increase in survival rate (14 % vs. 2 %), if defibrillation was proceeded by 3 min of conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for reperfusion. If ACD (\"active compression decompression\")-CPR is combined with a specific ventilatory valve (\"inspiratory impedance threshold device\", ITD) which does not allow passive inspiration, survival rate after cardiac arrest is increased for up to 24 h. Such a device facilitates an increase in venous return to the heart during decompression of the thorax. High-dose adrenalin for intrahospital CPR in children is not associated with better survival but with worse outcome. Comparison of an emergency medical service (EMS) system from U.K. with paramedics and a physician-staffed German EMS system demonstrated that survival rate following prehospital cardiac arrest is markedly increased with doctors on board. The European multicentre trial comparing vasopressin vs. adrenalin as first vasopressor during CPR in 1219 patients did not reveal any differences between both groups. In subgroup analyses of patients with asystoly and prolonged CPR, vasopressin was superior without being associated with a benefit on neurological outcome. Further subgroup analyses revealed beneficial effects of amiodarone and thrombolysis during CPR. Thrombolysis during CPR apears to be associated with an increased rate of haemodynamic stabilisation without increased risk of bleeding complications. In a very clear advisory statement, the \"International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation\" (ILCOR) has recommended mild therapeutic hypothermia (i. e., cooling of cardiac arrest victims to 32 - 34 degrees C central body temperature for 12 - 24 h following cardiac arrest of cardiac etiology) not only for unconciuous patients with ventricular fibrillation as initial prehospital rhythm, but also for all other adult patients (other rhythms, intrahospital CPR) following cardiac arrest. In randomised controlled clinical trials, this therapy has markedly improved survival rate and neurological outcome. Such therapeutic cooling can be initiated nearly everywhere and with simple methods - like the infusion of ice-cold cristalloid solutions.","1578":"","1579":"","1580":"Recent publications reported enhanced coagulability in hemodilution determined by TEG. In contrast, earlier reports have shown prolongation of in-vivo bleeding time in anemia. In order to take a closer look at this discrepancy undiluted and diluted anticoagulated blood samples (20 % with saline solution, hydroxyl-ethyl starch 6 % (HES), autologous platelet poor plasma (PPP)) were investigated by TEG (n = 10), ball (n = 10), and hook coagulometer (n = 15) as well as tests simulating primary hemostasis ex vivo (Platelet Function Analyzer PFA-100, n = 10). Dilution with plasma changed TEG parameters in a way, when started by recalcification of the blood sample, which is characteristic of enhanced coagulability (r decreased in all and k in 8 of 10 samples, maximal amplitude increased in 9 out of 10). With HES, changes in TEG parameters mainly indicated reduced coagulability (k increased in 7 out of 10, MA decreased in 10 out of 10). When the coagulation was additionally activated by PTT reagent (InTEG) the TEG parameters also mainly showed hypocoagulation with the three dilution solutions. Coagulation times with ball and hook coagulometers were significantly prolonged by dilution especially with saline (+ 25 % and + 17 %, p &lt; 0.001). Dilution always significantly (often abnormally) prolonged closure time in PFA-100 (saline + 41 +\/- 18 %, PPP + 37 +\/- 20 %, HES + 69 +\/- 24 %) demonstrating disturbance of primary hemostasis, particularly with HES. From the results obtained it can be concluded that the changes in the classical TEG (without addition of PTT-reagent), suggesting an enhanced coagulability, may be caused methodically as they are also found with autologous PPP. On the other hand, a disturbance of the primary hemostasis in hemodilution has to be taken into account from the results seen with the PFA-100 and a number of published data. ","1581":"When no fresh frozen plasma is available, acute major blood loss is compensated above all with crystalloids, colloids and erythrocyte concentrates, meaning that all plasma clotting factors are diluted. Consumption coagulopathy is almost always accompanied by dilutional coagulopathy. Formulas for calculating critical blood loss and standard coagulation tests are often not helpful in the case of massive transfusion. On the other hand, systems suitable for point of care, such as thrombelastography, have important advantages. In the case of consumption and dilutional coagulopathy plasma coagulation is disturbed and critical values are first seen for fibrinogen. Not only is fibrin polymerization impaired by the bleeding-induced loss and dilution of fibrinogen, but also by interaction with artificial colloids, particularly hydroxyethyl starch preparations. Therapy of consumption and dilutional coagulopathy calls for fresh frozen plasma. If this is not available in sufficient quantity or within a reasonable time, coagulation factor concentrates must be used. Neither fresh frozen plasma therapy nor treatment with coagulation factor concentrates has been the subject of detailed clinical study. Further studies are needed to work out guidelines for coagulation management in the case of massive blood loss.","1582":"Recent changes in quality of transfusion supply, transfusion triggers as well as fluid therapy promote the development of dilutional coagulopathy. Nevertheless, up to now guidelines generally assume presence of hypocoagulability when more than one individual circulating blood volume is lost. This might be true for some patients under some conditions but is not necessarily true for every patient. Routine coagulation tests are insufficient in predicting increased bleeding and, moreover, available after an unacceptable time delay. Therefore the occurrence of diffuse microvascular bleeding is often used as clinical sign to start hemostatic therapy. However, such severe derangement of hemostasis might lead to the development of secondary tissue damage and frequently is unresponsive to conventional treatment. Coagulopathy occurring during extensive surgery or after polytrauma can be detected and treated early when using the ROTEM monitoring. Recent data showing a direct beneficial effect of hemostatic therapy on blood loss and final outcome are scarce. However, evidence exists that the amount of blood loss, presence of coagulopathy and number of transfusions needed are associated with poor outcome in bleeding patients. Although manifold articles have been published already using thrombelastography for various indications (medline research \"thrombelastography\", 2022 articles), further data are needed to confirm the clinical experience that this technique is an excellent tool for safe patient management.","1583":"We report on a 36 year old patient who collapsed at home and was resuscitated by prehospital medical emergency services. He presented on scene unconscious with severe ST-elevations on the ECG and hardly palpable pulses. His previous medical history included only idiopathic hypertension and his professional background as manager of a company was associated with high stress levels. The prehospital diagnosis was myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock. A hypovolemic shock was excluded from the differential diagnosis because of the age of the patient, lack of a precipitating trauma and inconsistent symptoms. The patient died after terminating prolonged resuscitation. A post mortem showed as cause of death the rupture of a splenic artery aneurysm. We emphasize that a cardiovascular collapse in a young patient without specific history or trauma still can be caused by hypovolemic shock due to intra-abdominal or -thorac bleeding.","1584":"In comparison to preceding infraclavicular methods, vertical infraclavicular blockade of the brachial plexus (VIP), as described by Kilka et al. in 1995, has quickly established itself because of the high success rates and comparatively low risks. Users define the blockade success achieved at around 85 %. However, this figure includes a more or less large number of patients who require supplementary analgesia\/sedation and\/or sleep induction in addition to pre-medication. Such a combined procedure, VIP plus analgesia\/sedation is sometimes problematic e. g. in geriatric patients with a number of additional diseases. This patient group in particular could possibly profit from VIP without additional medication. Based initially on purely clinical observations, the following study reports on a method to improve the success rate of VIP blockade (operability) without additional analgesia and\/or sedation. Altogether 499 patients were included in a retrospective study. In 88 patients (Group 1), the method of Kilka et al. was strictly applied. In a second Group (99 patients) the determined puncture site was moved 1 cm laterally. In Group 3 (312 patients), elicitation of a response to stimulation of the fasciculi of the brachial plexus was examined. This was performed by multiple punction, as a rule lateral to the puncture site of Kilka et al. In this group, the total dose of anesthetic (identical in all groups) was divided into 2 - 3 single doses. The pre-operative data of the patients in all groups were comparable. In the course of the VIP (Group 1), the method was changed in 13 patients (14.8 %) with incomplete blockade and after initial modification (Group 2), this was necessary in 12 patients (12.1 %). By means of targeted stimulation of individual sections of the brachial plexus (Group 3), the rate of incomplete blockade could be reduced to 8.3 %. The clearly improved blockade success was achieved without an increase in complications. In contrast to other authors, we came to the conclusion that the success rate was considerably higher when the anaesthetist had several years of experience. In the case of the authors of this study (longest experience), only 3.7 % of the plexus blocks were incomplete. For the use of VIP in practice it can be concluded that the optimal puncture site is often somewhat lateral to that defined by Kilka et al. By means of multiple stimulation with the aim of locating the individual fasciculi of the brachial plexus, the success of blockade, in terms of operability with unchanged low complication rates, can be considerably improved without the need for additional analgesics and\/or sedation.","1585":"Introduced is a new approach to the brachial plexus marked out in opposition to the common methods by some theoretical advantages. The needle is proceeded in an acute angle to the course of the plexus. Thus reduces the possibility of nerve damage. Second the insertion of catheter is simplified. The accidental puncture of the pleura is unlikely except in cases of gross deviations of the puncture instruction. In addition the plexus is hit before the musculocutaneous nerve leaves the brachial plexus. The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the usefulness of the subcoracoidal retrograde access in daily practice. Beside the influence of stimulating different fascicles or the necessity of reaching a defined low stimulation level on the success rate and effectiveness of the plexus blockade was investigated. 75 patients undergoing elective surgery in upper limb received plexus anesthesia with the subcoracoidal retrograde access. Necessary deviation of the planned direction of puncture, stimulated fascicle, the reached minimum level of stimulation, the onset of anesthesia, point of time of the complete anesthesia were recorded. Deficiencies were also recorded and registered as sufficient or insufficient nerve blockade. The success rate of the stimulation of the different fascicles were evaluated by the chi(2)-Test to find out a preference a certain fascicle. The deviation and medium of the lowest found current levels for the different fascicles were evaluated by the Kolmogorov-Smirnow Test and the Two Sample Test Z to show to what extent a certain lowest current level influences the success rate. The overall success rate was 92 %, particularly the anesthesia in the region of the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm was achieved in all cases. As a side effect caused by the retrograde injection of the local anesthetic anesthesia of the shoulder was also achieved with a high frequency. The low complication rate of 3 % consists only in accidental puncture of vessels. We found no significant influence of stimulating a certain fascicle or reaching a defined minimum stimulation level on the success rate of nerve blockade. The described subcoracoidal retrograde access to the brachial plexus (SCREP) proved to be a safe and easy method with a low complication and high success rate compared with the known practised accesses. In contrary to other authors our findings do not support the connection either between success rate and stimulating certain fascicles nor achieving a defined lowest stimulation level.

Modern techniques in dentistry and the widespread use of regional anaesthesia should lead to a more individual approach to this problem. From a legal standpoint, the information about advantages and disadvantages concerning the removal of dentures can be explained without problems to the patient without medical background.","1587":"","1588":"","1589":"","1590":"","1591":"It is uncontested that blood-saving strategies should also be applied in children. However, in the past, blood-saving techniques saw limited use in children, although they are well-established in adults. This is due to technical and methodical problems, but also to the physiologically limited compensatory mechanisms for diminished oxygen delivery in this age group. For this reason, the various blood saving-techniques cannot be universally applied to all age groups. During the first year of life most perioperative techniques are of only limited benefit: even only a small amount of blood loss in relation to total blood volume makes a transfusion of allogeneic blood necessary, which is far before enough shed blood can be recovered for retransfusion. Preoperative autologous donation of blood calls for a high degree of cooperation by the child and the parents an is equally demanding in terms of organization and skills. Therefore, this procedure is used mainly in school-age children and in adolescents. Intraoperative blood salvage, by contrast, is already worthwhile in children from age one year with an expected blood loss of 20 % of blood volume. Acute normovolemic hemodilution and deliberate hypotension should be recommended only in an age group where cardiovascular compensatory mechanisms are given. Supporting procedures aimed at avoiding the need for allogeneic blood include perioperative administration of erythropoietin, iron supplementation, blood-saving surgical techniques and careful hemostasis. These prerequisites, the combination of various techniques, as well as the definition of an age-specific low transfusion trigger have contributed to a marked decrease in the need for allogeneic blood products in children in recent years.","1592":"","1593":"","1594":"The requirement for intraoperative blood salvage (IBS) in cancer surgery stems from the high transfusion rate, the unfavourable effects of an anaemia, and the impact of transfusion risks like immunomodulation in tumor patients. The advantages of IBS are availability, the low waste rate, and the excellent quality of this autologous, unstored blood. The only effective elimination of the risk of tumor cell dissemination after retransfusion of wound blood is achieved by blood irradiation. The combination of the established methods of IBS and blood irradiation is practical, and allows a very efficient saving of blood. For Jehovah's witnesses it may open the possibility for tumor surgery. From an anaesthesiological point of view it is part of the therapy, but any context that puts it compatible to medicolegal regulations is welcome. For him as the one responsible for the therapy of intraoperative blood loss it represents the safest and best blood for an optimal hemotherapy in tumor patients.

The surgical attempt to stop the bleeding failed. The laboratory evaluation before surgery showed normal coagulation parameters (aPTT 23.4 sec, TPZ &gt; 100 %, platelet count 267 000\/microl). Despite treatment with the plasminogen activator inhibitor Tranexamic Acid (2 x 500 mg) and 10 units of concentrated platelets as well as 31 units of fresh frozen plasma and 31 units of red blood cell concentrates the bleeding continued. Reaching an cumulative blood loss of 15 000 ml the patient developed ventricular fibrillation necessitating cardiac resuscitation including defibrillation and application of epinephrine 7 mg. At this point systolic blood pressure decreased from 90 to 70 mm Hg, the core temperature was 31,9 degrees C. After successful resuscitation (systolic blood-pressure 90 mm Hg after 15 min) the bleeding started again with a blood loss of 2000 ml requiring 3 units of fresh frozen plasma and 3 red cell concentrates Use of recombinant activated Factor VII (r.FVIIa): 6 mg (300 KiU) r.FVIIa have been applied (92 microg\/kgKG [4.6 KiE\/kg]). Within 10 minutes the bleeding stopped. More transfusions were not necessary. The patient left the intensive care unit 8 days after the operation without neurological deficit.

We investigated the use of high-dose Rocuronium for RSI in prehospital emergency medicine. Rocuronium was used in two physician staffed units of emergency medical service for RSI in 79 patients aged 4 - 81 yrs (mean 46 yrs). Anesthesia was induced with etomidate\/fentanyl or ketamine and 1 mg\/kg of rocuronium. Recorded data were number of intubations, time interval application rocuronium-intubation, rating of intubation conditions and side effects. In 75 of 79 (94,9 %) patients intubation could be performed at the first attempt. In three (3,8 %) patients a second attempt and in one pt. a third attempt was necessary. In 78 (98,7 %) patients intubation could be performed within 60 seconds, in one patient intubation was completed within three minutes. The intubation conditions were estimated as excellent (n = 69; 87,3 %) or good (n = 10; 12,7 %) in all patients. No specific side effects could be observed. The use of muscle relaxants improves the intubation conditions and may help to avoid unnecessary high doses of anesthetics in hemodynamic unstable emergency patients.

In a retrospective case control study, 394 accidents in which the air bag was released were analysed. At least medium severe injuries (Maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale: MAIS &gt; or = 2) occurred in 69 cases. Three different patterns of injury were distinguished depending on the level of difficulty of diagnosis by the emergency physician. Damage to the vehicles was scored in five intensities or damage grades. Thoracic injury was most frequently diagnosed in the patients (in 61.5 % of cases), followed by injuries to the lower (50.8 %) and upper extremities (47.7 %). Single injuries with a grade of severity of 2 (MAIS) predominated (59.7 %). In most of the cases the injury was easy to diagnose (64.6 %) because of external signs, in 24.6 % internal injuries were assumed and in only 10.8 % were there no sings of damage to body cavities. Most frequent were occult injuries in the thoracic region (100 %) and in the abdomen (74.4 %). However, occult injuries did not always conform to the grade of deformation to the vehicle, since in 66.7 % the grade of damage was 3. This was not true for the remaining types of injury because external injuries increased with the grade of damage to the vehicle. After the release of the air bag, occult injuries of the body cavities have to be expected, even if there are no signs of external injury. Women under 35 years of age are particularly endangered. There exists no minimum velocity for the occurrence of injuries to the body cavities because harm can simply be a result of the release of the air bag.

This therapeutic efficacy provides further evidence for a critical role of CGRP in the pathophysiology of migraine.

Indispensable, however, is the availability of face masks, naso- and oropharyngeal airways and laryngeal mask airways in different sizes at each induction site. This paper is especially devoted to recalling the Oxford non-kinking tube and its specific way of handling, as a lot of cases of unexpectedly difficult airway can be safely managed with this tool. Alternatives to safeguarding the difficult airway are the intubation laryngeal mask airway or the esophago-tracheal combitube.

The study comprised 11 patients with normal intracranial pressure (8 female, 3 male, group 1) and 10 patients with elevated intracranial pressure (6 female, 4 male, group 2). The patients underwent a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt operation, external ventricular drainage or ventriculocisternostomy. The measuring times were set as follows: time 1: pre-operative; time 2: intra-operative; time 3: post-operative. The anaesthetic for the operations was administered as a total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol and alfentanil, muscle relaxation being achieved with rocuronium bromide or cis-atracurium. Measurements of the catecholamine levels (adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopamine) at the three set times revealed an intra-operative fall compared to the initial pre-operative value and a rise in the catecholamine level again after the operation. It is likely that this largely reflects the course of the anaesthetic. The fall in the plasma catecholamine level was much slighter in group with elevated intracranial pressure. But in the group of patients with elevated intracranial pressure the catecholamine levels found in the plasma were much higher than those of the patients without elevated pressure. In the case of adrenaline, it was possible to demonstrate a statistically significant difference at the three measuring times. This suggests that especially the analyzed adrenaline level in the plasma could take on the role of a marker in cases of elevated intracranial pressure. In group 2, with elevated intracranial pressure, the catecholamine levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were considerably higher than those in group 1, but the difference did not reach the significance level. The lack of correlation between the catecholamine values in the plasma and CSF described in the literature (comparison of the corresponding values at time 2) was confirmed for noradrenaline and dopamine in patients with elevated intracranial pressure (group 2). In both groups of patients there was a CSF plasma gradient for dopamine at time 2, i. e. the dopamine level was higher in cerebrospinal fluid than in the plasma. The study shows that even a slight rise in intracranial pressure without clinically detectable ischaemia may result in elevated plasma and CSF catecholamine levels. Although catecholamine values are not routine parameters, they can be used in developing procedures to protect the brain in neurosurgical patients.

Heart rate, arterial oxygen saturation (psaO (2)) and non-invasive blood pressure were recorded prior to and immediately after induction of sedation, when at the level of vocal cords, during the interventional diagnostic procedure (IDP) and 15 min after the end of the FOB. The mean heart rate and systolic pressure were significantly lower in group P when compared with group M when at the level of vocal cords and during the IDP (p &lt; 0.05).

The quality of stored autologous red cells is comparable to that of allogeneic products. Results of systematic sterility monitoring lead to the conclusion that under the conditions practised the risk of transfusion-associated sepsis is not higher to that of allogeneic products.

Intubation and ventilation was performed and anticonvulsive treatment was escalated with thiopental. Fifteen minutes later he developed ventricular fibrillation. CPR was started. The patient became asystolic after 90 min CPR following the ILCOR (International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation) Instructions. CPR was continued for another 30 min without success. The patient died after 120 min of maximal efforts. Autopsy and toxicology were performed, neuropathologic examination showed general brain edema and neuronal cell loss in purkinje cell layers of the cerebellum and olive knots which may be the consequence of generalised convulsive status epilepticus. We conclude: status epilepticus becomes refractory in approximately 30 % of cases. Until now, there are no randomised trials on the optimal treatment of refractory status epilepticus. Better treatment algorithms are urgently needed.","1621":"It is very important to investigate the patient's disability and pain. Interviews of intubated and tracheotomised patients were neglected because of inadaequate measuring methods. This is the first prospective study that evaluates the disability and pain of intubated and tracheotomised patients. Disability, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Visuelle Analogue Scale, Glasgow Coma Scale and structured questions were used to investigate the disability and pain of ventilated patients. 26 patients of an interdisciplinary operative intensive care unit took part in the study. Sociodemographic parameters, ventilation, sedation and pain were evaluated. Doctors and nurses were asked to assess the patient's pain and disability. 17 intubated and 9 tracheotomised patients were included in the study. Mean intensity of pain was 30.3 (SD = 31.4), anxiety 40.8 (SD = 31.4), disability 30.0 (SD = 11.5) and disability caused by ventilation 61.9 (SD = 28.5). 46.2 % of the patients had a pathological subscale of anxiety and 50 % of depression in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Nurses assessed the patient's disability and pain better than the doctors. A high disability has to be taken in account in the therapy of intubated and tracheotomised patients. ","1622":"Gastrtis and esophagitis are frequent and severe complications in intensive care patients, mainly caused by increased duodenogastral reflux. Opioids, commonly used in intensive care, are known to impair gastrointestinal (GI) motility which increases retrograd flow of gastric content. In a previous study, we showed that enteral administered naloxone reduces gastric reflux by selectively blocking GI opioid receptors. Therefore, in a subpopulation of these patients we studied the effect of enteral naloxone on the incidence of mucosal injury in opioid-treated, mechanically ventilated patients. After IRB approval, mechanically ventilated, fentanyl-treated patients without gastrointestinal surgery or diseases were assigned to receive 8 mg naloxone or placebo four times daily via a gastric tube. Additional inclusion criteria were opioid treatment for at least three days and endoscopy of the upper GI tract. Frequency of gastritis and esophagitis was quantified according to the Savary-Miller Score, and further parameter of GI motility (frequency of propulsive medication, amount of enteral feeding) were measured. In four of seventeen patients of the naloxone group (24 %) and 14 of 22 patients of the placebo group (64 %; p = 0.02), esophageal or gastral mucosal injuries were detected. In the naloxone group, gastral reflux as well as need for propulsive medication were significantly lower. Volume of enteral feeding showed an increasing trend in the second half of the study. Reduction of esophagogastral mucosal injury and reduced need for procinetic medication suggests an improvement of GI motility by enteral naloxone in fentanyl-treated, mechanically ventilated patients. ","1623":"Perioperative management of geriatric patients is becoming an important component in anaesthetic practice in the 21st century. This phenomenon is due to the fact that people aged 65 and over are the segment with the fastest growing population. Thus, it is estimated that by the year 2025 20 % of the population in the western hemisphere will be &gt; 65 years of age. Currently, elderly patients comprise one-third of all operations, and one out of two patients older than 65 years of age will undergo an operation in their lifetime. The dramatic change in demographics of surgical patients will have a tremendous impact on the use of anaesthetics. Older patients facing surgery can generally be expected to be a more complex case than their younger counterparts. They have more systemic diseases (e. g. cardiac, pulmonary, endocrine), and usually these diseases have advanced to more serious stages. These patients may suffer disability, both physical and mental, and may show differences in the pharmacokinetic as well as the pharmacodynamic of compounds such as opioids. While neuronal numbers, dendrites and synapses decline with age and the ventricular volume triples, cerebral circulation is similar to young adults, although there is a reduction in cerebral blood flow (CBF). This is because of the lower unit weight, lower CBF and CMRO (2), which are tightly coupled in aging where autoregulation is preserved. However, because of a decline in dopaminergic, serotonergic, cholinergic and GABAergic transmitters, anticholinergic compounds (atropine, scopolamine) as well as some anaesthetics such as ketamine, benzodiazepines or even propofol may produce delirium and\/or an increase in efficacy when given together with opioids. Therefore it is mandatory to consider a pharmacologic interaction with a potentiation and\/or an addition in effects of other drugs when judging the net action of opioids in the elderly. Physicians and nurses treating geriatric patients tend to have an unfounded level of fear of complications associated with treating perioperative pain. Although it is known that inadequate analgesia may delay recovery, the treatment of perioperative pain in the geriatric patient remains inadequate, even relative to younger patients. It is well established that there is increased responsiveness to the effects of opioids in the elderly. This may result in an increased risk of respiratory depression, while especially the elderly female patient demonstrates an increase in the duration of effects, but the risk of nausea is not augmented. Increased sensitivity of older patients to systemic opioids mostly involves pharmacokinetic factors such as a higher proportion of unbound and active substances as well as changes in drug redistribution. Because of a 40 % reduction in stroke volume in the elderly, there is a protracted redistribution of opioids to the liver. This results in a prolonged metabolisation, a lesser inactivation over time followed by an increase in duration of effects, mainly impairment of respiration. To a much lesser extent, pharmacodynamic factors with an increased response at opioid receptor sites have to be considered. Although the mechanisms causing differences of opioid action in the elderly may be complex, the clinical implications are not. They include slow titration of opioids to allow for long circulation times, lower total doses because of increased sensitivity, and anticipation of a longer duration of action because of reduced clearance. Since elderly patients present multimorbidity, therapy of chronic pain has to be considered in the light of multidrug intake, which, due to interaction, results in marked side-effects, and a prolonged duration of action. Those opioids should be used which, due to their pharmacokinetic properties, have a reduced volume of distribution, present a low plasma protein binding and finally result in the formation of no pharmacologically active metabolites.","1624":"Paediatric patients quite often have to undergo painful or stressful procedures, e. g. blood sampling, dressing of wounds or removal of a drainage. The key problem is to decide if a child has pain or if there are other reasons for crying. Establishing a high standard in an institution requires regular evaluation and documentation of pain scores. For many clinical situations, clear and functioning concepts exist - we just have to use them. Unanswered questions are the evaluation of pain in small children, the side-effects of opioids, surgery involving the airways and the risk-benefit-ratio of certain techniques. Pain therapy after tonsillectomy is still troublesome: relevant postoperative pain occurs. Local infiltration of the tonsillar bed has no pre-emptive effect and only a minimal impact on the postoperative pain. Management relies on opioids, steroids and non-opioids. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should not be used because of an increased risk of bleeding. Promising data have been reported on COX-2-blockers, but experience in children is still limited. Pain management after circumcision is relatively easy to perform. A conduction block with a long-acting local anaesthetic combined with one dose of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug provides sufficient analgesia in over (2\/3) of patients. Today, penile block is the standard of care and complications only rarely occur. However, despite successful pain prevention, circumcision remains a stressful procedure for the small patients. Pain treatment per se is not sufficient to relieve all the suffering connected with surgery in children. The concept of balanced analgesia is successful under many circumstances, but continuous efforts are needed to improve the management for difficult situations, e. g. tonsillectomy.","1625":"","1626":"","1627":"","1628":"","1629":"","1630":"","1631":"","1632":"","1633":"The aim of the study was to compare the effects of different fluid warming systems on their heating capabilities during low infusion rates. Heating capabilities of four different fluid warming systems and their capabilities to warm fluids with 20 +\/- 0.5 degrees C above 32 degrees C were measured: 1) Hotline(R) Fluid Warmer, 2) Gymar, using three disposable tubing systems - \"Pediatric\", \"Standard\", and \"High-Flow\", 3) Astotherm, and 4) Astotherm plus 260. Low to moderate infusion rates (100, 300, 600, and 900 ml\/h) were achieved using motor pumps. Infusate temperatures were measured at 17 degrees C and 20 degrees C room temperature at the distal end of the disposable tubing. Statistical analysis was performed using a computer based program (NCSS). Differences between the groups were analysed by the unpaired Wilcoxon Test. Significance was defined with a p &lt; 0.05. During low to moderate infusion rates (100 - 900 ml\/h), infusate temperatures of &gt; 32 degrees C were attained only by the Hotline-device in a reliable manner independent of the applied room temperature. The devices Astotherm plus 260 und Astotherm attained these temperatures during infusion rates of 300 ml\/h and 600 ml\/h respectively. Final temperatures of &gt; 32 degrees C were maintained by Gymar during infusion rates of 600 ml\/h, when the disposable tubing system \"Pediatric\" was used. Using the same device but different tubing systems, final temperatures of &gt;32 degrees C were attained during 900 ml\/h (\"Standard\") or failed (\"High-Flow\"). With all devices, increasing the room temperature by 3 degrees C was followed by higher infusate temperatures, which were more pronounced in those devices without disposable tubing warming (p &lt; 0.01). In this laboratory investigation, Hotline performance was superior with respect to providing final temperatures &gt; 32 degrees C during low to moderate infusion rates. Astotherm Plus 260 seems to be an alternative cost effective device in case of infusion rates of more than 300 ml\/h. ","1634":"To determine the heat transfer by circulating-water mattresses placed under the back and over both legs of human volunteers. With approval by the local ethics committee and informed consent eight minimally clothed volunteers were included in the study. Six calibrated heat flux transducers were placed on the back and additionally eight sensors were placed on both legs of each volunteer. The volunteers reclined on a circulating-water mattress (ComfortPad Plus(R), Cincinnati Sub-Zero Products Inc., Cincinnati, OH, USA) coated with gel (Granulab International, Armersfoort, Niederlande). Another circulating-water mattress (Plastipad trade mark, Cincinnati Sub-Zero Products Inc.) was placed over both legs. Both devices were heated to 41 degrees C by a hypo-hyperthermia system (Hico-Variotherm 530, Hirtz and Co. Hospitalwerk, Cologne, Germany). Heat flux data were sampled during steady-state conditions. After determination of the contact area between the mattresses and the skin, heat transfer was calculated by multiplication of the heat flux per area by the contact area. Heat flux per area to the back was 45.6 +\/- 4.5 W m (- 2), the contact area was 0.39 +\/- 0.03 m (2). This resulted in a heat transfer of 18.0 +\/- 2.4 W. Heat flux per area to the legs was 24.7 +\/- 4.3 W m (- 2), the contact area was 0.12 +\/- 0.01 m (2). This resulted in a heat transfer of 2.9 +\/- 0.6 W. The heat transfer of the circulating-water mattress to the back was much higher than the heat transfer to the legs. Nevertheless, model calculations show that conductive warming of the legs is more important for the prevention of perioperative hypothermia than conductive warming of the back, because it has a higher impact on the heat balance. ","1635":"In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), recruitment maneuvers have been proposed as an adjunct to mechanical ventilation to open up atelectasis and to keep these alveoli open by the application of adequate high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Though several studies reported that the responsiveness to recruitment maneuvers resulted in a marked improvement of oxygenation with a concomitant decrease in airway pressure and\/or inspiratory fraction of oxygen, the performance of recruitment maneuvers still remains a matter of dispute, especially in patients ventilated with a lung protective ventilation strategy. In this review we discuss the pathophysiological background, factors affecting the responsiveness to recruitment maneuvers and their clinical impact in the light of recently published studies. Successful recruitment depends on several factors like the applied recruitment pressure, the level of PEEP set before and after the recruitment maneuver, the stage and the underlying disease of the ARDS, chest wall mechanics and the transpulmonary pressure as well as the positioning of the patient. Regarding the current literature, recruitment maneuvers may be considered as a rescue therapy in the early stage of severe hypoxemic lung failure, if a lung protective ventilation strategy and other additive adjuncts like prone positioning or the application of inhaled vasodilators failed to induce adequate gas exchange.","1636":"Besides it's anaesthetic properties, xenon may induce biological effects that may protect various organs from ischaemia-reperfusion injury. Xenon is an antagonist of the NMDA-receptor and reduces the neuronal injury mediated via these receptors. In contrast to other NMDA-receptor antagonists, xenon has no neurotoxic side effects. Xenon also protects the heart in ischaemia-reperfusion situations. Xenon reduces the post-ischaemic reperfusion injury and offers cardioprotection by inducing pharmacological preconditioning. These organ protective properties of xenon might be useful in special clinical situations.","1637":"","1638":"","1639":"In this report we present a 35 year old pregnant woman (no significant disease in patient history, non smoker, primipara, gestational week 15) who had to undergo elective tumorectomy due to suspected pregnancy associated breast cancer.

We decided to anesthetize the patient with a cervical segmental epidural block.","1640":"Evaluation of patient satisfaction with the perioperative care is an integral part of modern quality management. For this purpose simple questioning techniques are often used in clinical practise or reports of clinical trials. However, little research has been performed to investigate whether these tools and methods are useful and provide valid information. Two-hundred patients undergoing elective surgical procedures were interviewed. Five different simple techniques or questions that have been used in the international and in the German literature throughout the last years were applied in random sequence together with the validated German translation of the QoR-9 questionnaire to measure quality of recovery. All analyses were performed descriptively. All investigated techniques could be answered without help by another person in 95 % up to 100 %. All simple dichotomous questions regarding satisfaction were insufficient to discriminate satisfied from less satisfied patients. A rating using grades known from the German school system (1 - 6) and a visual analogue scale (VAS; 0 - 100 mm) obtained ratings lower than the maximum possible values in 10 % and 11 % of the patients respectively. Furthermore, the flexibility that was provided by these tools was not utilized by the patients. The results of the QoR-9 questionnaire as a marker of postoperative recovery showed only a moderate correlation with ratings of patient satisfaction. Until now, there is no method or questioning technique in the German language that can be recommended for a quality assurance program. Thus, further research is needed to develop tools that provide valid information with adequate resolution to allow discrimination of patient satisfaction with perioperative care. ","1641":"Old age and bad nourishment are risk factors for the postoperative period. In this study, the \"mini nutritional assessment\" (MNA) of elderly patients was evaluated before the operation and compared with their ASA-classification. 215 outpatients (age &gt; 60 years) were included. MNA-score was fixed as follows: MNA 24 - 30 = normal (MNA I); MNA 17 - 23.5 = risk of malnutrition (MNA II; MNA &lt; 17 = undernourished (MNA III). In addition, the ASA-score of all patients was registered. chi (2)-, Mann-Whitney-U- and correlation analysis were used for statistical analysis. A cut off-value of 24 was fixed for MNA and correlated with the ASA-score. 34.9 % of all patients were allocated to MNA II or III, but only 19.9 % to ASA III or IV. The sensitivity of the ASA-classification for evaluation of the nutritional status was 0.33, selectivity was 0.87, positive predictive value was 0.58 and negative predictive value was 0.70. ASA evaluation is not suitable for assessment of the nutritional status. With regard to typical postoperative complications, the nutritional status of patients should be assessed separately.

In 20 patients undergoing thoracotomy (ASA II\/III) two sequential ventilation methods were used during OLV: a) FiO (2) of 1.0 (OLV-100) and b) a FiO (2) of 0.5 in N (2)O combined with CPAP of 5 cm H (2)O to the non-ventilated lung (OLV-CPAP), whereby the sequence in 10 patients was OLV-CPAP followed by OLV-100; and the opposite in the remaining 10 patients. Operating conditions were graded by the surgeon. OLV-CPAP was associated with a better oxygenation and a lower shunt compared to OLV-100 (paO (2) : 198 +\/- 40 mmHg vs 181 +\/- 38 mmHg; p &lt; 0.05 and Qs\/Qt: 30 +\/- 6 % vs. 34 +\/- 8 %; p &lt; 0.01, respectively). The different sequence of the ventilation methods did not cause significant differences in the results. The surgical conditions were not impaired by the CPAP of 5 cm H (2)O. The application of low FiO (2) with CPAP provided a better oxygenation and a lower pulmonary shunt during the OLV compared to high FiO (2) without CPAP. ","1647":"In this prospective, randomised study a double lumen tube (DLT) or an Arndt bronchial blocker (BB) was used for one lung ventilation (OLV). Intraoperative oxygenation, ventilation, haemodynamics, and ease of placement were compared. In 32 patients undergoing robotic harvesting of the left internal thoracic artery (ITA) a left-sided DLT or a BB controlled by bronchoscopy was used for OLV of the right lung. In 2 patients randomised for DLT, a single lumen tube and BB was used for difficult visualisation of the larynx. These 2 patients were excluded from the study. Correct placement of DLT (8.8 +\/- 5.4 min, 87.5 % of the patients) as well as BB (6.5 +\/- 4.0 min; n. s.; 100 % of the patients) was achieved rapidly. The Cormack-Lehane score for visualisation of the larynx was 2, 1 - 3 (median, range) in group DLT and 3, 1 - 4 (median, range) in group BB (p &lt; 0.05). OLV lasted for 93 +\/- 29 min in group DLT and 88 +\/- 34 min in group BB (n. s.). Satisfactory conditions for harvesting ITA were achieved in all patients of both groups. There was no difference in any haemodynamic parameter at any time between the two groups. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance were increased without significant differences between the two groups during thoracoscopy for robotic preparation of left ITA. During OLV, index of paO (2)\/FiO (2) was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) lower in DLT patients compared to BB patients. Time to extubation did not differ between the two groups (DLT 14.3 +\/- 4.6 h; BB 11.8 +\/- 3.8 h). OLV in patients undergoing robotic cardiac surgery was safely achieved either by BB or by left-sided DLT. Positioning of the BB was easier than that of a DLT when intubation was difficult and tube exchange at the end of surgery is avoided. Therefore, we prefer a BB in patients undergoing robotic harvesting of left ITA. ","1648":"This study was conducted to compare two different techniques used for tracheal intubation (TI). We evaluated airway management conditions for a conventional Macintosh laryngoscope and the Brummert EasyScope, a new device. A prospective trial was conducted with 20 medical students who had no prior airway management experience. Intubation was performed on an Ambu manikin. Following didactic instruction, each participant took turns performing TI using the Macintosh and EasyScope devices under direct supervision. Time required for TI, the number of attempts, and the number of times teeth were contacted were documented for each device. All participants also completed a questionnaire to determine self-assessed comfort and skill level for both the Macintosh and EasyScope devices. Time required for TI was comparable for both devices, although a trend toward slightly lower times for the EasyScope was observed. There was a lower rate of tooth contact during laryngoscopy and a lower rate of unsuccessful intubation attempts while using the EasyScope. Furthermore, the students felt the EasyScope was subjectively easier to use and required less effort during TI when compared with the Macintosh laryngoscope. Personnel not accustomed to a particular airway management technique achieved comparable outcomes when using either the Macintosh laryngoscope or the EasyScope device for TI. Possible reduction of effort required for tracheal intubation or better dental protection have to be evaluated for the EasyScope in further clinical studies.

The introduction of the LMA was possible in an arched movement down to the hypopharynx using appropriate sizes for different sizes of LMA's. The intubation in 500 surgical cases (30 % adult, 70 % children, mostly in ENT-surgery) was easy and rapidly performed. A leading finger for placement was not necessary. There were neither cases of rotation nor retrograde flexion of the top of the mask. Direct vision by the ENT-specialist revealed no evidence of any injuries of the palate or throat.

","1650":"Tracheotomy is commonly performed in long-term ventilated patients. The aim of this review is to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of tracheotomy. Review of the literature. Disadvantages of tracheotomy include the risk of bleeding, infection, injury of the truncus brachiocephalicus, and of long-term tracheal injury. These risks must be compared with the risk of vocal cord trauma, laryngeal trauma, and subglottic stenosis following translaryngeal intubation. Despite a number of disadvantages and potentially even life-threatening complications, however, tracheotomy is a well-established technique for long-term airway management in critically ill patients. Potential advantages of tracheotomy include enhanced patient comfort, reduced airway resistance and dead space, a lower incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia and a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay. Patient comfort before and after tracheotomy has not yet been seriously evaluated, using modern ventilators airway resistance does not longer play a major role. No data from randomized controlled trials actually support the thesis that tracheotomy reduces the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia. There is weak evidence for the concept that the duration of mechanical ventilation can be reduced in patients while using tracheotomy. Patients undergoing percutaneous dilational tracheotomy seem to have a reduced risk of bleeding and site infection and a shorter duration of the procedure when compared to those with conventional surgical tracheotomy. Many clinicians perform tracheotomies on the basis of expert opinion and clinical experience. So far, the benefits, however, have not been proven in large-scale randomized trials. Many of these studies suffer from design flaws, insufficient randomization and the absence of blinding. On the other hand, the lack of positive results do not rule out that tracheotomy may be beneficial for the ventilator-dependent patient. Percutaneous tracheotomy procedures may be superior to conventional surgical tracheotomies. Long-term results, however, will have to prove this preliminary observation.

Later, the haemodynamic state of the patient deteriorated, so that cardiopulmonary resuscitation had to be started. While great amounts of blood transfusions were applied via the catheter using a rapid transfusion device, the blood loss over the left sided chest tube increased rapidly. Emergency thoracotomy was performed, revealing that the catheter was not in intravenous position, but in intrapleural malposition. Haematothorax was caused by a laceration of the upper lobe of the left lung with severe bleeding from great vessels. This case shows that successful aspiration of blood does not exclude malposition of a central venous catheter. Correct position of the catheter must be verified using appropriate methods including chest X-ray, intracardiac ECG tracing or display of the central venous pressure curve on a monitor.","1654":"Measurement of \"depth of anesthesia\" is of enormous interest to the anesthesiologist. New monitor systems, based on the electroencephalogram (EEG) were developed.

After IRB approval and written informed consent we investigated 19 female patients during minor gynecologic surgery. Target controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol was increased in a step-by-step mode (0.5 micro g\/kg) every 1 min until the patients lost response to the modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness\/Sedation scale (MOAAS). 5 min after the patient lost response remifentanil 0.4 micro g\/kg\/min was started. Every 20 s SNAP index, BIS, spectral edge frequency, mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate and MOASS were recorded. Prediction probability ( P(K)) was used to analyze the relationship of MOAAS, TCI propofol, and all investigated parameters. Changes after start of remifentanil were analyzed with Friedman and Wilcoxon test. SNAP index ( P(K) = 0.91) and BIS ( P(K) = 1.0) were able to distinguish reliably between MOAAS = 5 and MOAAS = 0. Start of remifentanil infusion resulted in statistically significant changes for all parameters except the SNAP index (p &gt; 0,05).

Since that publication, additional data has accumulated and thus an updated meta-analysis was performed. A systematic search of the literature was performed using different search strategies in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Six randomized controlled trials including 538 patients were identified investigating ginger to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Data on the incidences of PONV, nausea, vomiting, and the need for rescue antiemetics within the first 24 postoperative hours were extracted and the pooled relative risk and the numbers needed to treat (NNT) were calculated using a random effects model. The pooled relative risk to suffer from PONV after pre-treatment with ginger was 0.84 (95 %-confidence interval 0.69 - 1.03). About 11 patients must be treated with ginger for one additional patient remaining free from PONV (NNT: 11; 95 %-CI: 6 - 250).

The difference in costs were measured by the hospital management. Cardiac and circulatory side effects with hypotonic reactions were similar in both groups (TIVA 18 = 69.2 %\/BA 20 = 76.9 %). Hypertonic reactions were mainly seen in BA (Tiva 1.9 %, BA 69.2 %\/p &lt; 0,001). There was no problem in the treatment of these side-effects. The frequency of postoperative nausea and vomiting was lower (but not significantly) in the TIVA group (TIVA 8 %\/ BA 27 %) than in the BA group (7 and 4). The recovery times were shorter (p &lt; 0.001) in TIVA, those patients were staying 24 (+\/- 6.70) minutes in the post operative unit vs. 59 (+\/- 28.83) minutes in BA. Patients satisfaction was better in the TIVA-group (1.65) than in the patients treated with BA. In the calculation of costs there was a disadvantage in BA. This study showed, that in respect of cardiac and respiratory side effects TIVA and BA are safe methods in anaesthesia for elderly people in ophthalmic surgery. Nevertheless, because of shorter recovery-times, lower incidence of hypertonic reactiones, more patients satisfaction and lower costs TIVA had better results in this study. We have to ask for the evaluation of economy in anaesthesia that not only prices of medicaments but the complete costs of the cases have to be calculated.

At present, the aircrafts used for such deployments are four C-160 Transall, one CL-601 Challenger and two Airbus A310, which, if necessary, can be equipped with one or more intensive-care \"patient transportation units\" (PTU). Contrary to the two other aircrafts, the CL-601 Challenger is only equipped for the intensive-care transport of one individual patient. The PTU corresponds to the technical equipment of the intensive care unit of a level-1-trauma centre and ensures an intensive-care therapy on highest level also during longer transportation. The work with this equipment, the characteristics of the long-distance air transport and the special situation of the military deployment causes special demands on the qualifications of the assigned personnel. Primarily planned for the repatriation of injured or ill soldiers, in the mean time, this concept is also essential for the medevac of civilian victims after mass casualties worldwide.","1659":"","1660":"","1661":"","1662":"","1663":"","1664":"","1665":"","1666":"","1667":"Total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) is increasingly used in diagnostic surgery such as stereotactic biopsy of the brain. TIVA could lead to a faster recovery of cerebral function, which may lead to a better behavior and advantages in the postoperative management. The aim of this prospective, single-blind study was to compare the hemodynamics, the postoperative recovery period, the side-effects and the need for additional cardiovascular medication during and after the operation between the three study groups. After giving informed consent and approval by the ethical committee of our hospital, 51 patients (ASA I and II) undergoing stereotactic biopsy of a brain tumor were randomized to receive either propofol via the TCI-system (group 1: TCI-TIVA), propofol by a manual technique (group 2: MAN-TIVA) or methohexitone-sevoflurane (group 3: BAL-SEVO). Remifentanil was used as the analgetic component in all groups. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate und transcutaneous oxygen saturation were noted before and after induction and before and after the end of anaesthesia. The time until return of complete orientation relative to person, location and time were measured. The patients' ranking of their satisfaction with the anaesthesia was questioned 60 min and 24 hours after the end of the procedure (VAS). Undesirable side-effects (i. e. PONV, shivering, pain, dysphoria, tiredness) were noted, whenever they occurred. The number of hemodynamic interventions by the anaesthesiologist was counted, and the total doses of remifentanil and propofol were quoted. Depth of anaesthesia was monitored by using a BIS-system, a range between 40 and 50 was thought to be adequate. Besides this, the total doses of remifentanil, propofol and sevoflurane were ruled out and the costs of the three regimens were ranked. Heart rate dropped markedly in all groups with a maximum in the TIVA-collective. Systolic and diastolic pressure also fell in the groups. In the SEVO-group, the difference was statistically significant only at the end of anaesthesia. After extubation, the three groups reached their hemodynamic starting-point with a slight overshoot in the SEVO-group. The number of required hemodynamic interventions was two (TCI-TIVA) vs. 7 (MAN-TIVA) vs. 8 (BAL-SEVO) in each group, respectively. The difference scarcely failed to get significance. The remifentanil requirements were similar between the collectives, group 1 needed more propofol per time than group 2. The number of side-effects was very little after the different regimens. There were no differences with regard to the other measured parameters between the groups. The use of TCI-TIVA was more expensive than manual TIVA (18,85 euro vs. 12,50 euro). Surprisingly, balanced anaesthesia using Sevoflurane was the most expensive method during the first hour, mainly due to the use of methohexitone as the induction agent (23,90 euro). Each of the three techniques compared in our study is suitable for anaesthesia in diagnostic neurosurgery. Since fast recovery of vigilance is important to justify the neurological outcome, none of the methods seems to be superior to the others. The hemodynamics were largely stable with a strong trend towards minor necessity for hemodynamic intervention in the TCI-TIVA group. This is also the best method from the subjective point of view of the anaesthesiologist due to the easy handling and the low number of interventions. The use of newer TCI-systems (e. g. fm-controller, Braun, Melsungen) not operating with special application syringes will cheapen TCI-TIVA.

We investigated whether morphine and fentanyl influence CD 11b and CD35 surface receptor expression, phagocytic activity and superoxide anion generation of monocytes in a whole blood flow cytometric assay. Whole blood of 13 healthy volunteers was incubated with different morphine and fentanyl concentrations. Expression of surface receptors CD 11b and CD35 was determined by fluorochrome-labelled antibodies. Phagocytic activity was assessed by ingestion of fluorescent bacteria. Conversion of dihydrorhodamin served for oxidative burst measurements. Morphine inhibited monocyte function in a concentration and time dependent manner. Morphine-induced changes were abolished by preincubation with the NO synthase inhibitor N-nitro-l-arginine as well as naloxone. Fentanyl failed to inhibit receptor expression, phagocytosis and reactive oxygen production by monocytes in clinically relevant as well as supraclinical concentrations. Our results suggest that these monocyte functions are inhibited by a morphine-stimulated NO release mediated by a mu opiate receptor subtype expressed on the surface of monocytes. In contrast, fentanyl did not share morphine's inhibitory effects on monocyte activity. ","1669":"Chronic heart failure is a major cause for mortality and morbidity in western civilizations.

The expression of cytokines can be modulated from specific ACE-inhibitors as well as from different beta-blockers and angiotensin type 1 antagonists. Numerous investigations have shown that cytokines depress left ventricular function and can be responsible for different characteristics of chronic heart failure.

In the context of the special constellation an initial dose of Dantrolene of 10 mg\/kg body weight was administered. The patient was stabilised within 30 minutes, and the enzyme levels remained low compared with other case reports. The post-operative in vitro caffeine halothane contracture testing confirmed that son and mother were susceptible to MH, contracture testing in the father was negative. All known triggers may cause life-threatening MH crisis - even after hours and after inconspicuous multiple exposures to known trigger substances. Therefore all trigger substances must be avoided in all patients susceptible to MH.","1675":"Theophylline, a methylxanthine, leads to an increase of the cytoplasmic Ca(2+)-concentration in the muscle cell. Since the in-vitro contracture test (IVCT) with halothane and caffeine does not distinguish a 100% between malignant hyperthermia susceptible (MHS) and non-susceptible (MHN), we examined the in-vitro effects of theophylline in porcine skeletal muscle preparations. After approval by the local animal care committee ten MHS- and nine MHN-swine were anaesthetized and muscle biopsies taken. For IVCT, muscle specimens were exposed to bolus administrations of theophylline in concentrations of 3.0 respectively 5.0 mmol\/l. Muscle contracture development and twitch amplitudes were recorded over a period of 30 minutes. Data are expressed as medians and ranges. After both theophylline bolus administrations MHS-muscles developed significantly higher contractures compared to the MHN-specimens. The MHS-muscles reached a maximum contracture of 17.0 mN (7.2-59.6 mN) after administration of 3.0 mmol\/l theophylline. In comparison, two MHN-specimens showed weak contractures with a maximum of 1.4 mN. The 5.0 mmol\/l theophylline IVCT resulted in maximum contractures of 19.1 mN (2.1-39.2 mN) for the MHS-preparations. Just in three MHN-muscles weak contractures of 0.0 mN (0.0-0.8 mN) were recorded. Thus, a significant difference without overlap was revealed for the maximum contracture. Theophylline in concentrations of 3.0 and 5.0 mmol\/l revealed a clear difference between MHS- and MHN-porcine muscle preparations. Further examinations on human skeletal muscles are needed to demonstrate the value of theophylline in the IVCT MH-diagnosis.

Different solutions (saline, colloid solution and packed red blood cells PRBC) were tested varying the infusion flow, temperature of the solution and infusion pressure. Effective warming was defined as an infusion temperature &gt; or = 33 degrees C. Haemolysis was measured by the increase of free plasma haemoglobin. The infusion warmers were effective within the following flow ranges: Low flow rate (&lt; 250 ml\/h): Autoline, 500OR\/241 and H250\/D60.

Total intravenous anaesthesia was performed by the same anaesthesiologist. Mean arterial pressure, heart rate, at 4 and circuit pressure at 2 measurement points, and the incidences of coughing and sore throat. Insertion of the ET and the PS-LMA was scored by using a four-point scale. Ease of placing the gastric tube was judged by measuring the number of attempts at insertion and the insertion times. A p-value of &lt; 0.05 was considered as significant. There were no differences between PS-LMA and ET concerning circuit pressure at any measurement point. At the end of anaesthesia, mean arterial pressure (92 +\/- 13 vs. 100 +\/- 14 mmHg; p &lt; 0.01) and heart rate (66 +\/- 13 vs. 76 +\/- 14 beats\/min; p &lt; 0.01) were lower in the PS-LMA-group compared to the ET-group. At the end of anaesthesia 25 patients of the ET-group coughed but nobody in the PS-LMA-group (p &lt; 0.00001). There was no difference with regard to postoperative sore throat. The insertion of the PS-LMA was easier compared to ET (p &lt; 0.05), but we found no significant difference concerning insertion times. Fewer attempts at insertion of the gastric tube were necessary in the PS-LMA-group than in the ET-group (p &lt; 0.01), whereas insertion times did not differ.

Is it wise to use a speculum for the insertion of the endotracheal tube? What is the optimum size of the tube? A surgical cricothyroidotomy with a speculum was carried out on 30 cadavers from the Institute of Legal Medicine, Medical School Hannover. This took place as part of a official and voluntary course for students of advanced semesters, anaesthetists and emergency doctors with the subjects \"cricothyroidotomy, chest drainage and venous cut-down\". The surgical cricothyroidotomy without the use of a speculum was carried out on 5 cadavers by two clinicians well practiced in this technique. The elapsed time between skin incision and the insertion of the endotracheal tube was measured on all five subjects. After the course the participants were asked if they were able to carry out a cricothyroidotomy in an emergency. They were also asked whether this course should be a compulsory part of their curriculum and whether practical sessions should take place. During autopsies at the Institute of Legal Medicine the length of the ligamentum conicum was measured on 40 corpses with reclined and non-reclined heads. The average time of storage of the cadavers was 4.2 days +\/- 1.9 days. The cricothyroidotomy was possible on all 35 cadavers. In one case (3,3 %) the result was a complete rupture of the cricoid cartilage. In 5 cases (16.7 %) the horizontal incision was torn due to prising with the speculum. Difficult situations always occured when the skin incision was not exactly in the midline. The average time to place the endotracheal tube into the trachea by the surgical procedure of cricothyroidotomy was 22.4 seconds +\/- 3.1 seconds (minimum 18 seconds, maximum 26 seconds). 10 % of the medical students and 50 % of the anaesthetists and emergency doctors felt they would be prepared to carry out a cricothyroidotomy in an emergency. 90 % of the students and respectively 80 % of the anaesthetists and emergency doctors stated that they would like to practice the technique on a cadaver again. Almost all participants were of the opinion that the course should be integrated as a compulsory course in a future educational curriculum. The average distance between the thyroid cartilage and the cricoid cartilage was 9.5 mm +\/- 1.9 mm with non-reclined head (minimum 6 mm, maximum 14 mm) and 11.9 mm +\/- 2.5 mm with reclined head (minimum 7 mm, maximum 18 mm). The average difference of distances was 2.4 mm +\/- 1.2 mm (minimum 1 mm, maximum 6 mm) in reclined and non-reclined heads. In our opinion it is highly recommended that the technique of cricothyroidotomy should be practiced on cadavers and that the course should become a compulsory part in a future educational curriculum. In addition the incision of the ligamentum conicum using dilators or a speculum is not to be recommended from the point of view of this study.

Also, incomplete questionnaires were included in the analysis. There was a 54 % response rate. Ultrasound guidance is used by 83 (18.7 %) departments for central vein cannulation. Of these, only 7 (8.4 %) use it routinely and 43 (51.8 %) use it when faced with a difficult vein cannulation. Only one third of the departments with ultrasound facilities are using it optimally, e. g. cannulation under ultrasound guidance. Of those units not using ultrasound for central vein cannulation, 136 (37.7 %) said it was because of lack of equipment and 199 (55.1 %) did not think that it was necessary. In Germany, placement of central venous catheters is usually based on anatomical landmarks. Every anaesthetist and intensive care physician should be able to place central venous catheters without an ultrasound device. Still there is not a doubt that ultrasound assistance is useful for beginners, in children, and when blind cannulation fails.

The pur-pose of this study was to investigate the ability of bolus CEP-applications to distinguish between porcine MHS- and MHN-muscle specimens using the IVCT. After approval by the local animal care committee 8 MHS- and 8 MHN-swine were anaesthetized and muscle biopsies taken. For IVCT, muscle specimens were exposed to bolus administration of CEP in concentrations of 75 resp. 100 micro mol l (-1). Predefined parameters were: (1) onset time of the contracture development, (2) time to the achievement of the 2, 5 and 10 mN contracture level and (3) maximum contracture level. Data are expressed as medians and ranges. After 75 micro mol l (-1) CEP administration all MHS-muscles showed contractures after 0.5 min (0.2 min\/0.9 min). The 2 mN contracture level was reached by all MHS-, the 5 mN level by four MHS- and the 10 mN level by one MHS-specimen. The maximum contracture was 5.3 mN (2.4 mN\/12.9 mN). The onset time after 100 micro mol l (-1) CEP was registered as 0.3 min (0.1 min\/0.7 min) in the MHS-preparations. Again, the 2 mN level was achieved by all MHS-specimens, the 5 mN level by 5 and the 10 mN level by one MHS-bundle. The maximum contracture was measured as 5.9 mN (2.8 mN\/13.9 mN). In 7 MHN-specimens no contracture development was measured. After 75 micro mol l (-1) CEP one MHN-muscle showed a maximum contracture of 1.0 mN, after 100 micro mol l (-1) CEP one MHN-bundle demonstrated a maximum contracture of 1.1 mN. Hence, a significant difference between MHS and MHN without overlap was revealed with both CEP-concentrations in the onset time of contracture, in the 2 mN contracture level and the maximum contracture. Since a clear differentiation between MHS and MHN porcine specimens was achieved after bolus application of 75 and 100 micro mol l (-1) CEP, MH-diagnosis might be possible with a CEP-IVCT. It seems worthwhile to examine this hypothesis in men.

In Germany, numerous types of HES preparations with different combinations of concentration, weight-averaged mean molecular weight (Mw), and hydroxyethylation pattern are available. They differ with regard to their volume-supporting capacity, intravascular half-life, and side effect profile. The elimination of HES molecules varies with the Mw and degree of substitution (DS). Large HES molecules undergo hydrolytic cleavage by alpha-amylase and are excreted in the urine, or they are phagocytosed by the reticuloendothelial system. The smaller HES molecules are eliminated by glomerular filtration. The higher the DS, the slower the metabolism and elimination of the molecule. Although HES can be used safely even in large doses in patients without altered kidney function, renal dysfunction and acute renal failure after HES infusion have been reported in patients who share several risk factors, such as preexisting renal disease, advanced age in combination with dehydration, or treatment with high doses of slow degradable HES solutions. Since there is no direct chemical toxicity of HES, the most likely mechanism for HES-induced renal dysfunction may be swelling and vacuolization of tubular cells (\"osmotic nephrosis-like lesions\") and tubular obstruction due to the production of hyperviscous urine. Considering this pathogenesis, it can be hypothesized that all hyperoncotic colloid solutions can induce renal impairment. In the case of HES, the risk of high plasma colloid osmotic pressure and thus the risk of acute renal failure are probably increased by high concentrations of the colloid or repeated administration of slowly degradable HES with a high Mw and DS. With adequate hydration, using sufficient amounts of crystalloids, HES has little if any adverse effects on renal function. Furthermore, modern -rapidly degradable HES solutions with a low Mw and DS, such as HES 130\/0.4, do not increase the risk for renal dysfunction even when used in large amounts perioperatively.","1691":"","1692":"","1693":"Numerous investigations have demonstrated that the ability of passenger airbag systems to reduce both injury severity and mortality in car accidents is restricted to the simultaneous application of seatbelts and airbags.

For ICUs reporting focuses on device-associated primary bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, as well as on pneumonia and bronchitis. The data collected for each patient who acquires a nosocomial infection include the site of infection and patient demographics. Up to 4 pathogens can be recorded for each infection. From 1997 until 2002 274 ICUs were participating. The data of 590 695 patients with 18 073 device associated infections (ventilator-associated pneumonia and bronchitis, central line-associated bloodstream infection (BSI) and urinary catheter-associated urinary tract infection (UTI)) were analyzed. In the group of device-associated NI S. aureus was most frequently isolated (16.5\/100NI) followed by Ps. aeruginosa (14.2\/100NI), E. coli (13.9\/100NI), enterococci (13.4\/100NI) and C. albicans (11.2\/100NI). Of all S. aureus isolates 20.0 % were MRSA. There was an increase of the MRSA rate from 8 % in 1997 to 26.9 % in 2002. The most frequent pathogen in BSI was coagulase-negative staphylococcus (31.0\/100NI). In ventilator-associated pneumonia and bronchitis S. aureus was the most frequent pathogen (24.2 and 24.9\/100NI).

","1696":"A disadvantage of Propofol (commercial preparation containing long-chain triglycerides; Propofol-LCT) is pain on injection, which is reported by 54 - 100 % of the patients. Many different approaches have been used in an attempt to decrease the pain on injection of propofol. The currently most efficacious treatment is lidocaine given intravenously with a tourniquet prior to Propofol injection. In previous studies, larger concentrations of free propofol in the aqueous phase of an emulsion were associated with more pain on injection. A new formulation of propofol (a mixture of long-chain and medium-chain triglycerides in the carrier emulsion; Propofol-MCT\/LCT) reduces the incidence of pain on bolus injection. This study was designed to investigate, whether the use of Propofol-MCT\/LCT alleviates pain on injection to a similar degree as pretreatment with lidocaine. Eighty patients (ASA I - III) were randomly assigned to four groups according to a double-blinded protocol, to receive either lidocaine 2 % or normal saline given iv. with a 60 seconds tourniquet time before the injection of Propofol-LCT or Propofol-MCT\/LCT.

Assessment of pain on injection was performed after 30 % of the induction dose was given. Pain on injection caused by Propofol-LCT with pre-treatment of lidocaine and Propofol-MCT\/LCT alone is shown to be equivalent. Comparison of Propofol-MCT\/LCT with pre-treatment of lidocaine and Propofol-LCT alone shows a statistical noticeable p-value of 0.035. Propofol-MCT\/LCT with pre-treatment of lidocaine suggests a tendency of causing less pain compared to Propofol-MCT\/LCT. Analysis of the postoperative questionnaire supplies no significant difference. The results suggest that pain on injection is reduced equivalent using either Propofol-MCT\/LCT alone or Propofol-LCT with pre-treatment of lidocaine. Pre-treatment with lidocaine before Propofol-MCT\/LCT seems to have an additional effect.

We reviewed various studies and manufacturer characteristics regarding the parameters and algorithms for analyzing arrhythmia ECG signals. Asystole threshold values of several defibrillator manufacturers were collected and a literature review was performed including the following parameters: amplitude, frequency, bispectral analysis, amplitude spectrum area, wavelets, nonlinear dynamics, N(alpha)histograms, and combinations of various parameters. The manufacturer dependent asystole thresholds vary substantially. We show ways to optimize an ECG-based analysis for the next technological generation of defibrillators. During advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) the probability of defibrillation success should be estimated. Optimal defibrillation waveform, depending on transthoracic resistance, should be individually determined. In case of prolonged VF with a low ECG amplitude defibrillation should not be attempted unless coronary perfusion has been improved by further measures of ACLS. The combined evaluation of VF amplitude and frequency is effective in predicting defibrillation success. Estimation of further parameters is potentially useful for guiding optimal timing of defibrillation. At present, the implementation of most parameters in out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is limited by the lack of technical feasibility of online computing. Analysis of VF ECG signals should allow adequate VF detection as well as prediction of defibrillation success. Suitable asystole thresholds for analysis of ECG signals have to be determined, and the adverse effects of CPR associated artefacts on data analysis have to be reduced. Analysis of VF ECG signals is a precondition of individually optimized defibrillation and may contribute substantially to an increased quality of CPR. ","1705":"Controlled hypotension (CH) is an established method to reduce intraoperative bleeding. The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of CH induced by sodium nitroprusside (SN) or esmolol on hepatocellular integrity. Prospective, randomized, controlled study. 45 patients scheduled for elective endonasal sinus surgery were allocated to one of the following three groups: 1. SN-group (n = 15): CH induced by SN. 2. Esmolol-group: CH induced by esmolol. In both groups mean arterial pressure was kept between 50-55 mmHg. 3. Control group (n = 15): no hypotension was performed (MAP &gt; 70 mmHg). The cytosolic liver enzyme alpha-glutathione S-transferase (alpha-GST) and standard liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyltransferase) were measured at the following timepoints: preoperative (T0), at the end of surgery (T1), 2 h (T2), 24 h (T3) and 48 h (T4) postoperatively. alpha-GST concentrations were significantly higher in patients receiving CH (SN: 5.9 +\/- 3.4; Esmolol: 6.5 +\/- 2.8 microg\/L) in comparison with controls (2.5 +\/- 1.4 microg\/L) at T1. Already at T2 there were no significant differences between the three groups. Standard liver enzymes showed a similar course in all groups. The small but significant increase of alpha-GST in both hypotension groups suggests that hypotension induces a mild damage of hepatocellular integrity. ","1706":"The most frequently used drugs for premedication are benzodiazepines and alpha (2)-adrenoceptor agonists. In this study we examined midazolam and clonidine for premedication in combination with target controlled infusion anaesthesia (TCI) in patients undergoing orthopaedic shoulder surgery and analysed the effects on the peri- and postoperative course. Forty-five Patients (ASA I-III) were included in this prospective randomized, double blind study. Sixty minutes prior to anaesthetic induction the patients received clonidine in a dosage of 2 microg x kg(-1) (group ND) or 5 microg x kg(-1) (group HD) or 0.1 mg x kg(-1) midazolam (group midazolam) per orally. Anaesthesia was performed as TCI with propofol (plasma concentration 2.0-4.0 microg x ml(-1)) und remifentanil (plasma concentration 0.2-0.4 microg x ml(-1) x min(-1)). 15 minutes before the operation was finished, all patients received a bolus dose of 0.1 mg x kg(-1) piritramid i.v., followed by administration of piritramid via a PCA pump (patient controlled analgesia) for a duration of 24 hours. During the time of the operation the influence of premedication on the anaesthetic course was determined by vital parameters and ranking scales. For statistic evaluation we used the Kruskal-Wallis test, ANOVA with Tukey as post hoc test and the test named after Fisher (p &lt; 0.05). The effects of premedication on haemodynamic parameters and ranking scales for sedation as well as anaesthetic requirements were comparable in all three groups. In the postoperative period the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) (ND: n = 8, HD: n = 2, midazolam: n = 6) and the use of pritramid were lower in the clonidine HD group (HD: 38.7 +\/- 30.7 mg, ND: 51.7 +\/- 25.1 mg, midazolam: 45.1 +\/- 30.4 mg) than in the other groups. Premedication with the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine is as good as with benzodiazepines in combination with TCI. Because of the lower incidence of PONV and the need of piritramid in the postoperative period patients premedicated with 5 microg x kg(-1) clonidine may benefit from this premedication. ","1707":"Ketamine was shown to increase coronary blood flow. It was the aim of this study to answer the question whether ketamine directly dilates coronary arteries. Using the model of isolated vessel rings we studied the effects of ketamine (2.5, 25, and 250 microg ml(-1)) on the contractile response to three vasoconstrictors, acetylcholine, histamine, and serotonin in porcine coronary artery segments. Other rings were contracted with KCl or PGF (2a) and then treated with ketamine (5 up to 500 microg ml(-1) added cumulatively). Ketamine dose-dependently dilated coronary arteries in concentrations beyond those used in clinical practice. In intact rings ketamine racemate (250 microg ml(-1)) attenuated contractions mediated by acetylcholine by 38.8 +\/- 2.8%, histamine by 33.0 +\/- 4.4% and serotonin by 42.1 +\/- 3.7% (p &lt; 0.05). There were no differences between intact and denuded rings (acetylcholine 38.5 +\/- 2.8%, histamine 26.6 +\/- 4.7%, serotonin 30.0 +\/- 3.2%). With low concentrations of ketamine (2.5 microg ml(-1)) a slight tendency towards a contraction was recorded (n. s.). In rings precontracted with either KCl or PGF (2a) ketamine caused a small enhancement of contraction (KCl: 101.4 +\/- 0.4%, PGF (2a): 101.3 +\/- 1.4%) when administered in low concentration (5 microg ml(-1)), but almost complete relaxation (KCl: 0.4 +\/- 1.3%, PGF (2a): 0.0 +\/- 5.4%) in high concentration (500 microg ml(-1)). It is concluded that ketamine dose-dependently dilates porcine coronary arteries in concentrations beyond those used in clinical practice and that this effect is independent of endothelial function. ","1708":"Phantom-limb pain is a common sequel of amputation, occurring in up to 80 % of the amputee population. It must be differentiated from non-painful phantom phenomena, residual-limb pain, and non-painful residual-limb phenomena. A comprehensive model of phantom-limb pain is presented that assigns a major role to pain occurring before the amputation and to central as well as peripheral changes related to it. Special emphasis is put on the role of cortical reorganization in the development of phantom limb pain. Finally, new approaches to the prevention and treatment of phantom limb pain are presented that have a positive influence on phantom limb pain by preventing or reversing cortical reorganization.","1709":"Alcohol is a socially tolerated drug. Its consumption is associated with several physiological and pharmacological negative side-effects during anaesthesia and intensive care. The impact of chronic and acute alcoholism on perioperative morbidity and mortality and especially on anaesthetic risk are important, due to pharmacological interactions, pathophysiological changes and direct pharmacological interactivities between alcohol and narcotics. In contrast to opioid withdrawal symptoms of alcohol withdrawal are a serious and potentially life-threatening complication and should be avoided or the risk for occurrence must at least be reduced. Patients with a high risk of developing perioperative symptoms of alcohol withdrawal can be detected by laboratory tests and questionnaires. A prophylaxis of withdrawal should be started preoperatively solely with benzodiazepines or in combination with clonidine. Haloperidol is the drug of choice for emerging symptoms of alcohol withdrawal with productive psychosis. To estimate the pharmacological changes during anaesthesia, it is necessary to differentiate whether the patient is an occasional drinker with acute intoxication, a chronic abuser without limitations of hepatic function or a chronic user with insufficiency of the liver. The most important implication for anaesthesia are the choice of a rapid sequence induction to reduce the risk of aspiration and the maintenance of haemodynamic stability and liver perfusion. For the acute alcoholic providing prolonged postoperative surveillance is necessary, for the chronic alcoholic intensive care seems to be mandatory. For regional anaesthesia the indications and limitations are the same as for other patients (cooperativeness, coagulation, consent, etc.).","1710":"","1711":"","1712":"A pregnant woman at the 28th gestational week and three other members of the family had mushrooms for dinner.

These strategies are: Low tidal volume of 6 ml\/kg(-1) body weight in patients with ARDS, early goal-directed therapy, activated protein C therapy, moderate-dose corticosteroids, and tight control of blood sugar. Following further review of the main critical care medicine related journals for strategies to reduce mortality, the non-invasive ventilation is worthwhile mentioning. Moreover, this review summarizes articles on the topics of: Low-dose dopamine does not prevent acute renal insufficiency, increase of mortality is not related to albumin infusion, subglottic suctioning prevents early onset of ventilator associated pneumonia, prone position in ARDS patients has no influence on mortality, the safest site for central venous catheterization, and pulmonary-artery catheter directed therapy has no influence on mortality of high-risk surgical patients.","1714":"The postoperative continuous epidural application of local anesthetics can cause side effects like motor blockade and systemic intoxication. The study was performed to evaluate the plasma levels of two local anesthetics and their analgesic and side effects in continuous postoperative epidural analgesia. In a prospective, randomized and double-blind study we have compared side effects of ropivacaine 0.375% (group R) vs. bupivacaine 0.125% in combination with sufentanil 0.5 microg ml(-1) (group B\/S) via thoracic epidural catheters for a duration of 96 hours after major abdominal surgery in 30 gynaecological tumor patients. Analgesic effects, side effects and plasma levels of the respective local anesthetic were measured 24, 48, 72 and 96 h after start of epidural infusion. No differences were seen in demographics, perioperative data and analgesic effects. The following cumulative doses of local anesthetics were applied (Group R vs. B\/S (median\/minimum-maximum ml)): 24 h: 151\/121-225 vs. 141\/83-171; 48 h: 311\/237-424 vs. 299\/184-497; 72 h: 454\/366-566 vs. 440\/256-598; 96 h: 572\/399-859 vs. 568\/284-711. Plasma levels of local anesthetics remained far below the toxic threshold of 0.6 micro g\/ml (Group R vs. B\/S (median\/minimum-maximum micro g\/ml): 24 h: 0.05\/0.03-0.24 vs. 0.0\/0.0-0.02; 48 h: 0.06\/0.02-0.15 vs. 0.006\/0.0-0.02; 72 h: 0.05\/0.0-0.11 vs. 0.0\/0.0-0.02; 96 h: 0.02\/0.01-0.32 vs. 0.0\/0.0-0.01). The incidence and intensity of motor block (Bromage scale) and other side effects did also not differ between groups. The present study shows that thoracic epidural infusion with bupivacaine 0.125% and with a higher concentration of ropivacaine 0.375% during 96 h provides plasma levels of unbound local anesthetic far below the toxic threshold.

Furthermore, 4-8 ml Mepivacain 2 %\/Bupivacain 0.5 % (n = 52) or saline (n = 50) were injected into the retrobulbar space after anaesthetic induction. Piritramid (0.1 mg\/kg) was given for postoperative analgesia 30 minutes before end of surgery. Metamizol (1 g i.v.) and Dolasetron (12.5 mg i.v.) were provided on request as \"rescue\" medications. Variables were assessed by standardised questioning (NRS; yes\/no) before and 1, 6, and 24 hours after surgery. Chi(2)-, Mann-Whitney-U-, Kruskal-Wallis-test and logistic regression analysis, p &lt; 0.05. Although retrobulbar anaesthesia decreased ocular pain (p = 0.013) and total postoperative complaints (p = 0.017) the incidence of PONV was not diminished. Droperidol was the only antiemetic to decrease PONV significantly (p = 0.001). Although prophylactic blockade of nozizeptive afferents by retrobulbar anesthesia decreased ocular pain and postoperative complaints, it failed to decrease the incidence of PONV. Thus, PONV after ocular surgery under propofol-remifentanil anaesthesia is not attenuated by preoperative blockade of noziceptive afferents. In patients undergoing total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol-remifentanil, droperidol prevented PONV more effectively than the used serotonin receptor antagonists. ","1717":"Only very few remember Georg Haas as the scientist who--in 1924--was the first to successfully conduct an extracorporal hemodialysis on a patient in Giessen. Haas began his experiments in 1914 shortly after joining the Medical Clinic of the University of Giessen. Neither protocols nor any of the set-ups were preserved from these early experiments. In addition, the WW1 interrupted Haas' early experiments between 1917-1919. Until 1923 Haas himself never mentioned his early experiments. \"Outside circumstances\" and a \"shortage of materials\" (hirudin) prevented Haas from continuing his work on hemodialysis. Also, the early trials had disappointing results as the experimental animals, mostly dogs, died after a few hours. The hirudin preparations Haas had used turned out to be toxic. While the toxicity of the hirudin preparations prevented the application of dialysis in humans early on, the war with its many cases of nephritis provided new inspiration to develop dialyzing techniques. Haas experimented with reed tubes, calf peritoneum and paper membranes. None of these worked satisfactorily. Not until Pregl introduced collodion tubes was the first barrier overcome. Haas started experimenting with collodion tubes produced by himself. However, the toxicity problem with the hirudin preparations remained. Haas resumed the hemodialysis experiments in 1923. Significantly, 1923 was the year when Necheles published his work describing an alleged purified leech extract. Necheles' paper also described American experiments that focused on dialysis in animal trials. It was J. Abel of Baltimore who informed Haas that purified hirudin was available. After learning of this availability through the American studies in 1924, Haas conducted his first hemodialysis on a uremic patient in late 1924. This experiment lasted only 15 minutes and was without complications. A second dialysis attempt followed in 1925 and even lasted 30 minutes. Finally, four further experiments followed in 1926. The turning point was the availability of purified heparin from 1925 on. Haas, who in 1924 conducted the first dialysis using hirudin, in 1927 conducted the first hemodialysis using heparin. Further hemodialysis treatments followed. Haas concluded: \"The problem of hemodialysis is still in the first steps of practical application. Nevertheless it could be shown that hemodialysis has developed sufficiently to find applicability even in patients with serious kidney ailments and irritable heart...Hemodialysis was not only well tolerated but also brought a temporary subjective improvement. Of course, the technical aspects of hemodialysis still need improvement and further development to qualify as detoxicant therapy.\" A look at the early history of the artificial kidney and its applicability to humans reveals that J. Abel conducted the first hemodialysis on experimental animals. It also becomes evident that Haas conducted the first hemodialysis in humans. The American experiments pursued the quantitative optimization of the method in animal trials, while Haas' experiments focused on the development of a therapeutic method following the principle \"primum nil nocere.\"","1718":"","1719":"","1720":"The management of a diving-related emergency is frequently a great challenge for an emergency physician without a special diving medicine training or experiences. Almost every physician knows something about the medical therapy of diving-related accidents which are combined with a barotrauma or a decompression sickness.

In consideration of the present case of an acute diving-related lung edema we discuss the different reasons and differential diagnosis of diving emergencies.","1721":"Pain on injection is one of the most described side-effects of the intravenous application of propofol. This study was designed to assess the efficacy of lidocaine 40 mg in preventing incidence and severity of injection pain for two different propofol solvents. In a double-blind and prospective study 202 patients were enrolled and randomized to 4 different groups: group A receiving 2 ml NaCl 0.9 % and propofol-LCT (Disoprivan; AstraZeneca), group B 40 mg lidocaine and propofol-LCT, group C received 2 ml NaCl 0.9 % and propofol-MCT\/LCT (Propofol-Lipuro, B. Braun Melsungen AG) and group D 40 mg lidocaine and propofol-MCT\/LCT. According to the protocol, all patients were cannulated with a 18-G venous cannula at the dorsum of the hand and no other medicament was injected before the study drug. Time interval between test agents and propofol application in a dosage of 2 mg\/kg was one minute. Severity of pain was evaluated during propofol injection over 30 seconds until loss of consciousness using a 4-point rating scale. The incidence of injection pain did not differ between propofol-LCT and propofol-MCT\/LCT (64 % and 53 %). Propofol-MCT\/LCT significantly reduced the severity of pain compared to propofol-LCT (p &lt; 0.05). The application of lidocaine resulted in a significant reduction in incidence (Propofol-MCT\/LCT: 16 %; Propofol-LCT: 31 %) and severity of injection pain compared to placebo. Propofol-MCT\/LCT showed a significant advantage compared to propofol-LCT considering the severity of injection pain, but not in reducing the incidence of pain. The use of lidocaine resulted in a significant reduction of incidence and severity of injection pain for both propofol solvents. ","1722":"Due to rising health care costs there is a need to verify that the treatment by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) systems is efficient and cost effective. The integration of emergency physicians is inherent part of out-of-hospital emergency care and regulated by law in Germany but not in England and the United States of America. Aim of this study therefore was to conduct a cost performance analysis by evaluating the underlying structure, the costs incurred and the achieved performance in two EMS systems with paramedics or emergency physicians on scene. The study was carried out in West-Birmingham, a part of the West-Midlands-Ambulance-Service (WMAS), and the EMS of Bonn. Pre defined questionnaires, EMS protocols, calculations of purchasing power parity and recent publications concerning out-of-hospital resuscitation (CPR) were used to evaluate the operating costs, to describe the structure and to measure the quality of performance. Significance was assumed at p &lt; 0.01 for CHI(2)- or t-test, respectively. Birmingham used state of the art technology for dispatch and logistics whereas Bonn trusted in high qualified personnel. In the 1st quarter 1997 the Mainz-Emergency-Evaluation Score could be achieved before (MEES A) and after preclinical treatment (MEES B) in 3502 and 3422 patients in Birmingham and Bonn, respectively. In Birmingham 7.5 % and in Bonn 17 % of all patients could be improved by the EMS treatment, respectively (p &lt; 0.01). Looking at severely ill patients (MEES A &lt; 22) the EMS in West-Birmingham achieved an improvement in 27.9 % of these patients with an averaged change in MEES of 0.9 +\/- 1.7 points in all of them. In contrast the Bonn EMS improved the status in 47.8 % of these patients and MEES A could be improved considerably by 2.3 +\/- 3.4 points (p &lt; 0.01). Pharmacological treatment was less frequently used in Birmingham than in Bonn (12.9 % vs. 32.4 %, respectively; p &lt; 0.01). At equal incidences of CPR attempts discharge rate after CPR was only 4 % in WMAS compared to 14.7 % in Bonn-North (p &lt; 0.01). Per inhabitant and year total costs amounted to 10.43 euro for the EMS system in Birmingham, which is 42 % less than in Bonn. Unit hour utilisation reached 0.6 in Birmingham and only 0.33 in Bonn. In severely ill patients the improvement of MEES A by 0.1 points cost per inhabitant and year 1.16 euro in Birmingham and only 0.65 euro in Bonn. The survival of one patient after CPR was calculated to 0.7 euro in Birmingham and 0.17 euro in Bonn. The provider of the EMS in West-Birmingham--WMAS--organised a reliable system with high efficiency concerning unit hour utilisation and response time reliability. In the EMS of Bonn, in contrast, the complex therapy by the emergency physicians improved MEES considerably and increased probability of survival after CPR at a higher level of efficiency. Further investigations however are necessary to evaluate the presented parameter of efficiency. ","1723":"Emergency medicine is part of the oldest fields in medicine, however, organized rescue services were at first recognizable in the end of the 19th century or rather in the beginning of the 20th century. In 1908, on the first international congress for rescue services in Frankfurt, the preclinical part was described as a special science, for which a medical instruction would be necessary. In spite of an initially general rejection of an involvement of physicians in the rescue services, it was ascribed to physicians very early to carry out first aid in accidents or sudden illness. In 1958 Kirschner demanded an early medical care at the scene of the accident. After the second world war, the public rescue services were mainly controlled by the occupying powers. The realization of the rescue service was delegated to aid agencies and the fire brigades. In 1956 Bauer was the pioneer of the emergency physician service by dispatching a physician to the scene of the accident with a bus. Out of this resulted the first emergency physician service, which was imitated in many big cities within the Federal Republic of Germany. Since the care for accident casualities stood in the foreground at the beginning, surgeons mainly carried out this service. As the system became more and more established, the characteristics of the patients changed and medical emergency patients increasingly constituted the population of patients. That leaded to a shift in the specialties of the physicians taking part in the emergency physician service. Regarding the qualification specific guidelines were released in 1983 by the federal chamber of physicians in Germany.","1724":"","1725":"A 27 year old woman suffering from a congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries was admitted for vitrectomy due to progressive diabetic retinopathy. The congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries is a rare form of congenital heart disease based on malrotation of the embryonic cardiac tube with complete atrio-ventricular and ventriculo-arterial discordance. The anatomic right ventricle with the tricuspidal valve supports the systemic circulation and tends to decompensation. The patient had undergone several episodes of cardiac decompensation and the implantation of a DDD-type pacemaker because of a. v. block III degrees in the past. General anaesthesia has to be performed under invasive monitoring to recognize and treat cardiocircular problems as soon as possible.

Protein Z seems to assist haemostasis by binding thrombin and promoting its association with phospholipid surfaces, and it downregulates coagulation by forming a complex with the plasma protein-Z-dependent protease inhibitor, which inhibits activated factor Xa. Studies in patients with a bleeding tendency of unknown origin during and after surgery displayed diminished protein-Z-concentrations in about 50 % of the patients with recurrent bleeding. We report about a 19 year old patient, who suffers from a posttraumatic paraplegia subTh 8 since childhood. In 1998 a correction operation in order to reduce scoliosis with restrictive ventilatory defects had to be stopped before successful spondylodesis because of massive bleeding. After a second intraoperative bleeding incident and exclusion of other more frequent thrombocytic or plasmatic causes of hypocoagulability protein-Z-deficiency finally was diagnosed. Under substitution of protein-Z using PPSB (Beriplex P\/N) a repeatedly postponed implantation of a sphincter-externus (Brindley-) stimulator could be performed without bleeding complications in 2001, and this was also true for two other urological interventions in 2002. This report about repeated life-threatening intraoperative bleeding in a patient with protein-Z-deficiency, which could be successfully counteracted using selected plasma concentrates with guaranteed protein-Z-amounts, underlines the importance of protein-Z-assessment in some rare cases of bleeding tendency of \"unknown origin\" and documents the preventive plasma Protein-Z-levels achieved with the substitution of PPSB.","1727":"Atrial fibrillation is the most common clinically relevant arrhythmia. Anesthesiologists will be faced with atrial fibrillation of new or undetermined onset at their preoperative evaluation of patients as well as during intra- and post operative care. Because of fast electrophysical and structural remodeling, atrial fibrillation tends to persist and reoccur after successful conversion with increasing time of duration. Therefore, atrial fibrillation with an onset of less than 48 hours should be attempt to convert as soon as diagnostic work up has been made and possible causes have been corrected. New developments of electrophysiological and pharmacological treatment have improved the short term success rate of cardioversion. Further developments might give even more specific treatment options for the individual patient. In contrast, for treatment of chronic atrial fibrillation rate control therapy and thromboembolic prophylaxes seems to be more advisable with a lower risk of drug side effects and stroke. Anticoagulation should be initiated not later than 48 hours after the onset of atrial fibrillation. Finally, the development of implantable devices for the treatment of atrial fibrillation seem to be a promising therapeutic option for patients in end-stage heart diseases.","1728":"This study was designed to compare the time course of action and the safety profile of Rapacuronium and Mivacurium in day case dental surgery.

Endotracheal intubation was performed when maximum blockade was achieved and scored by a blinded intubator. Neuromuscular block was monitored using the train-of-four response to supramaximal stimuli at the ulnar nerve every 15 seconds using acceleromyography (TOF Watch SX). Onset time, clinical duration (reappearance of the third twitch of a TOF-stimulation) and recovery to T4\/T1 &gt; 0.9 were recorded. Speed of recovery was evaluated by the time difference between reappearance of the third twitch and T4\/T1 &gt; 0.9. The intubating conditions at the time of maximum block revealed no statistically significant differences between the three groups. Changes in blood pressure, heart rate and airway pressure were not significant. Onset time in subjects who received Rapacuronium (99 +\/- 29 s) was faster compared to the onset time in those who received Mivacurium (157 +\/- 36 s). Also clinical duration was significantly shorter following Rapacuronium without reversal (12 +\/- 4 min) as well as with reversal (9 +\/- 1 min) compared with Mivacurium (21 +\/- 5 min)).

Patients are warmed with forced-air systems prior to induction of anaesthesia. Thus the drop in core-temperature caused by redistribution is minimized.

Thus it has vasodilatory properties and cardioprotective effects at a dose enhancing myocardial contractility. These unique properties of levosimendan might be of great advantage in patients with myocardial ischemia simultaneously requiring inotropic support.

Two cases of pseudoaneurysm formation as a complication of accidental arterial puncture in liver transplant patients with coagulopathy are presented. Punctures of the common carotid artery, thyrocervical trunk, respectively were the source for these lesions. Coagulopathy is seen as an essential factor in the formation of pseudoaneurysm. Especially in patients with coagulopathy the threshold for ultrasound guidance should be low. Under these circumstances using the external jugular vein seems to be more prudent as it eliminates the risk for arterial punctures. We illuminate the genesis, signs and symptoms, diagnosis, and therapy of pseudoaneurysm. Recommendations for risk reduction are given.","1736":"The case of an 89 year old patient is reported, in whom an aspergillus myocarditis was unexpectedly found at autopsy. Preoperatively, the patient showed no risk factors for an invasive mycosis. 5 days after uncomplicated surgery he developed septic shock due to peritonitis. After surgery and intensive care therapy the patient recovered initially. 23 days after the first operation the patient suddenly developed catecholamin-resistant myocardial failure and died. Ten days before, aspergillus spec. was found in a specimen of bronchial secretion. This finding was interpreted as colonisation and not treated.","1737":"A central anticholinergic syndrome (CAS) can be related to the majority of anesthetic agents, but is often not recognized as such. Thus, most anesthesiologists seem to miss the occurrence of an anticholinergic syndrome especially when agitation and\/or restlessness are the major symptoms. Therefore, the following study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that routine administration of the anticholinergic agent physostigmin is of benefit for patients in regard to vigilance, the cardiovascular system and the need of analgesics easing the time in the post anesthesia care unit (PACU). After approval by the local ethics committee and written informed consent, 100 patients undergoing a cholecystectomy or a struma resection, were given either physostigmin (n = 51) or saline 0.9 % (n = 49) in a randomized fashion. The study was conceived to block a possible isoflurane-N2O\/O2 (opioid-based plus relaxant) induced central anticholinergic syndrome and to evaluate the effects on the cardiovascular system on vigilance and on postoperative analgesic demand. Following parameters were measured: systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and arterial blood gases. In addition, vigilance was determined and typical anticholinergic symptoms (disorientation, slurred speech, agitation, nausea, emesis, cardiac arrhythmia and muscle shivering) were determined 10, 20, 40 and 60 minutes following the intravenous injection of physostigmin. Also, the need for the postoperative analgesic pethidine was evaluated among the two groups. Except for a significant reduction in the need of analgesics, a reduced diastolic pressure and heart rate and a lower incidence of muscle shivering there was no difference among the two groups. One major side effect following the use of physostigmin was the higher incidence of nausea in the im mediate minutes following injection. This effect may be due to the rapid injection of the anticholinergic compound. Otherwise there were no detrimental effects of physostigmin in patients. From the results it can be concluded that routine administration of an anticholinergic agent results in a short term beneficial effect in regard to vigilance, a lesser incidence of muscle shivering and a lesser demand for analgesics. However, because of the low incidence of a classical central anticholinergic syndrome, routine physostigmine is only indicated when agitation is diagnosed. ","1738":"","1739":"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a common treatment for severe respiratory failure. However, ECMO can also be used as cardiac support. ECMO is the most common mechanical circulatory assist device in pediatrics, followed by pulsatile ventricular assist devices. Advantages are the simultaneous support of respiratory and hemodynamic functions and the fast bedside availability. The major disadvantage is the limited duration of therapy. The transthoracic connection of ECMO after cardiac failure in cardiothoracic surgery in childhood allows a controlled weaning on the intensive care unit. Weaning from ECMO is successful in about 45 to 80 % in cases of circulatory support; survival rates depend on patient selection, treatment protocol and indication. Bleeding problems, thromboembolic complications, hemolysis, infections, renal and neurologic complications are major problems.","1740":"","1741":"","1742":"","1743":"","1744":"","1745":"","1746":"","1747":"","1748":"","1749":"","1750":"Plasma atrial and brain natriuretic peptide (ANP and BNP) are cardiac hormones secreted mainly due to cardiac overload.

We studied 45 patients scheduled for elective CABG. Patients were allocated in three groups: group A received CPB with a duration less than 60 minutes, group B more than 60 minutes and patients without CPB were allocated in group C. ANP and BNP were measured after induction of anaesthesia (T0), at the end of surgery (T1), 4 hrs. (T2), 24 hrs. (T3) and 120 hrs. postoperatively (T4). In all groups, ANP-levels increased from T0 to T4 (group A: from 3.7 +\/- 2.1 to 8.9 +\/- 8.0; group B: from 3.3 +\/- 1.7 to 8.0 +\/- 6.0; group C: from 3.0 +\/- 1.6 to 5.3 +\/- 2.3 pg\/ml), but there were no significant differences between the groups.

","1751":"Whenever evidence-based medicine (EbM) is mentioned among physicians, it evokes many different and contradictory reactions. On the one hand a lot of physicians have heard of this concept, but may hardly associate anything with it. On the other hand most of the physicians seem to be skeptical rather than in favour of evidence-based medicine. They seem to be concerned about restrictions in daily clinical decision-making or negative implications for the relationship between patient and physician. In this article we would like to deal with the question whether evidence-based medicine is useful for clinicians and which chances are provided for both the physicians and the patients by using it. First, the methodology and aims of evidence-based medicine are introduced. Second, by using an example of clinical anaesthesiology, we discuss the six formal steps for implementing this method. Third, important points which help to assess clinical studies are mentioned. In conclusion we would like to point out that evidence-based medicine is no entirely new concept of medicine but aims to highlight a solid and conscientious scientific basis of clinical decision-making. Thus, evidence-based medicine may act as a methodological strategy helping to clear the proceedings of decision-making and improve the provision of medical care to patients. Furthermore, it may guarantee a rapid transfer of knowledge from outcome-related research to patient care.","1752":"Smallpox is an acute contagious and sometimes fatal infectious disease. It is caused by the variola-virus. Smallpox is characterized by a typical disease form with a progressive distinctive skin rash, especially at face, arms and legs. Smallpox has a fatality rate of about 30 % and the therapy of infected patients is only symptomatically. As prevention the WHO initiated worldwide vaccination programs in the year 1967. The last naturally occurring case of smallpox in the world was in Somalia in 1977. Since then the only known cases of smallpox happened from an outbreak in Birmingham, England caused by a laboratory accident in the year of 1979. On May the 8 th 1980 the disease was declared as eliminated from the world by the WHO (WHO-Resolution 33.33). A natural occurrence of the variola-virus seems to be not given. Nevertheless the virus exists for research in two laboratories, the American Centers of Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia and in the Russian Research Center for Virology and Biotechnics in Kolzowo, Sibiria. Threatening infections with smallpox or other microorganisms, used as bioweapons, get a new dimension through global terrorism. The variola-virus represents an optimal candidate for bioweapons. It is easy to replicate, it is highly contagious and the transmission over aerosol or direct contact from man to man is easy to handle. After the disease was eliminated from the world, routine vaccination among general public was stopped. Therefore younger people don't possess any vaccination protection. Older formerly vaccinated people probably have only a non-sufficient protection. Because of the smallpox elimination a lot of physicians have no experience with this disease. An outbreak of this smallpox isn't only controlled by new vaccination. In our times we need adapted prevention-standards, pox-alarm plans and quarantine standards.","1753":"","1754":"","1755":"","1756":null,"1757":"We tested the hypothesis that mucosal pressures are higher for the laryngeal tube airway trade mark than the ProSeal laryngeal mask airway. Fifteen fresh cadavers were studied. Microchip pressure sensors were attached to the laryngeal tube airway and ProSeal laryngeal mask airway at four similar anatomical locations (base of tongue, lateral pharynx, posterior pharynx and posterior hypopharynx) and three dissimilar locations (laryngeal tube airway trade mark, anterior and lateral hypopharynx; ProSeal laryngeal mask airway, pyriform fossa). The cuff volume (laryngeal tube airway, &lt; or = 140 ml; ProSeal laryngeal mask airway, &lt; or = 30 ml) was adjusted until the oropharyngeal leak pressure was 15 cm H2O and the mucosal pressures recorded. This was repeated at an oropharyngeal leak pressure of 20, 25 and 30 cm H2O. Mucosal pressures in the lateral pharynx were always similar. Mucosal pressures at the base of tongue and posterior pharynx were similar for the laryngeal tube airway and ProSeal laryngeal mask airway at 15 and 20 cm H2O, but were higher for the laryngeal tube airway at 25 cm H2O at 30 cm H2O. Mucosal pressures in the posterior hypopharynx were always higher for the laryngeal tube airway (all: p &lt; 0.03). Mean mucosal pressures for the laryngeal tube airway ranged from 8-31, 2-13 and 15-41 cm H2O for the base of tongue, lateral pharynx and posterior pharynx (proximal cuff) respectively and 3-7, 3-7 and 7-18 cm H2O for the anterior, lateral and posterior hypopharynx (distal cuff) respectively. Mean mucosal pressures for the ProSeal laryngeal mask airway ranged from 6-23, 3-10, 8-25, 6-17 and 2-8 cm H2O for the base of tongue, lateral pharynx, posterior pharynx, pyriform fossa and posterior hypopharynx respectively. We conclude that mucosal pressures are higher for the laryngeal tube airway, particularly when oropharyngeal leak pressure greater than 25 cm H2O. This suggests that mucosal ischemic injury will be more common with the LTA than the PLMA.","1758":"The revised American guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 'Guidelines for the prevention of catheter-related infections' were published on August 9, 2002. The goal of the guidelines is to promote patient safety and to decrease preventable infections by providing evidence-based recommendations for those healthcare providers who insert and maintain intravascular catheters. Since the guidelines were last issued in 1996, the science of prevention has yielded several important advances in new technology to prevent infection. In addition this update makes allowances for the fact that many new randomised controlled trials for the prevention of catheter-related infection were published in the last six years. Furthermore, several approaches, long known to be effective, need more emphasis by practitioners. The following publication summarizes the state of knowledge about the most important controversial prevention strategies and explains the recommendations.","1759":"After the glut of doctors in the past, we find a shortage of doctors in the present time. Approximately only 60% of all doctors would decide to become a doctor again. These alarming news should urge us to improve the situation for the rising generation of doctors especially for young anaesthesiologists. The actual situation in the hospital is rather unattractive and there is increasing risk that we will not have a sufficient number of anaesthesiologists in our hospitals in the near future. Improvement of the financial situation is without doubt important--this must include payment according to performance principle rather than payment with regard to age. Moreover, training programs (e. g. financial support of meetings) of the young anaesthesiologists, working conditions for all staff members (e. g. limitation of overtime), and importance of the role of anaesthesia must be modified to improve motivation and to guarantee high standards of quality of anaesthesia for the future.","1760":"","1761":"Emergency medical services (EMS) systems represent and important part within our health care system. However rapidly changing basic conditions define the need to reconsider current structures and objectives of the German EMS system and to implement appropriate modifications. The steadily decreasing number of emergency physicians advises to delegate more and more \"technical\" duties to paramedic personnel. In contrast the mobile intensive care unit will be reserved to cases in which complex treatment strategies or decisions have to be undertaken (i.e. thrombolysis). Moreover, the emergency physician's role will deeply expand beyond individual medical assistance. The most urgent duties Medical Advisers for Emergency Services will have to comply with are: 1. to develop plans of action and guidelines for paramedic personnel and 2. to secure a consistently high level of emergency medical care. As a consequence of ongoing structural reforms in the German Health Care System (ie. the implementation of diagnosis related groups, DRGs) emergency medicine will break down with traditional EMS structures. In contrast emergency medical departments of large hospitals will be reorganized to deliver both prehospital and in-hospital emergency medical care (\"Centers of excellence\"). Devoted to comply with clinical pathways this concept will improve medical efficacy as well as economic efficiency. The breakdown of traditional social structures as well as the increasing number of psychosocial emergencies constitute a major challenge to out EMS system. As it is not suitable to strictly differentiate medical from social emergencies we urgently need to establish integrated psychosocial networks. For a long period of time the role of the emergency physician has been restricted to the stabilisation of disturbed vital functions. To assure the competitiveness of the German EMS system it will be indispensible to expand our scope of practice. As anesthetists we should not hesitate to take over our new position as \"managers in acute care medicine\".","1762":"We report on a patient intoxicated with ethanol, who was found unconscious with fixed dilated pupils, deviation of eyes, absent cough and corneal reflexes, with her arms in decerebrate posture. Because of an orbital haematoma a traumatic intracranial hemorrhage with elevated intracranial pressure and compression or concussion of the brain stem was suspected. A CT-scan of the head did not reveal an intracranial mass or any radiographic signs of intracranial hypertension. Drug screening, blood gas analysis and other laboratory tests as well anamnestic data were not indicative of other intoxications or a metabolic decompensation. These unusual neurological findings were caused by a life-threatening ethanol intoxication with a blood-alcohol concentration of 700 mg\/dl (151.8 mmol\/l). The patient was extubated after several hours of mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit and was discharged to a regular ward on the following day.","1763":"Acquired spontaneous hemophilia is a rare but potentially life-threatening disease, which poses a major challenge to intensive care medicine. We report a case in which the disease occurred postoperatively in a patient following uncomplicated lumbal discectomy. The clinical sequelae involved hemorrhagic shock (cHb 4.1 g\/dl; hct 17 %; systolic BP 60 mmHg; HR 130\/min; saO2 73 %) due to retroperitoneal hematoma eight days after neurosurgical intervention. While lesions of the retroperitoneal vessels were not found during emergent angiography and laparotomy, the laboratory results showed a slightly prolonged activated prothrombin time (aPTT; 47 s). However, application of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) even prolonged the aPTT (53 s). Analysis of clotting factors proved a deficiency of factor VIII with a reduced activity of about 20 %, which was resistant against therapy with desmopressin (DDAVP) and substitution of factor VIII. Thus, the plasma-mix-test was performed, showing complete inactivation of the factor VIII-activity of the pooled plasma. This evidenced the presence of acquired inhibitors against factor VIII. Hemostasis was successfully and immediately restored with the application of recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa), including boluses of 60 - 80 microg\/kg every 6th - 8th hour (supplemented with tranexamic acid, 3 x 1 g\/d), leading to a continuous infusion of 12 microg\/kg per hour. With prednisolone (1 mg\/kgBW\/d) over the ensuing 8 weeks, the antibodies were sufficiently suppressed and no additional substitution of factor VIII was necessary to maintain normal hemostasis.","1764":"Participation in courses for health and hospital management is increasingly becoming a conditio sine qua non for candidates for executive positions in the health professions. The aim of this study was thus to evaluate the two-semester university course for health and hospital management offered by the University of Innsbruck since 1994. A structured telephone survey was conducted to poll the participants (n = 184) of previous courses concerning time invested, cost-benefit ratio, quality of the course as well as implementation of course content. The university courses (n = 7) for health and hospital management of the University of Innsbruck evaluated in this study were rated in the upper half of the of the five-part scale (scores 2 to 3) for overall quality, cost-benefit ratio and implementation of course content. Only approx. 25 % of the course participants reported that the course had a positive influence on their career. The relatively high course fee was borne in part by the local hospital operator, a fact that had a certain influence on the selection of course participants. Participation in the course was largely made possible by exemptions from job duties (approx. 75 %) and to a lesser extent by vacation time (approx. 20 %) or time off for overtime (approx. 5 %). Of total absences from the course (3.18 +\/- 3.41 d) 75 % was for job-related reasons, 6 % for illness and 19 % for other reasons. Overall, participants were absent more often, the larger the number of personnel in their department or clinic. All in all, the courses were considered important and recommendable, particularly with regard to communication, organization, time management and cost awareness. Streamlining (i. e. more content in less time), stronger practical orientation and a switch from mainly local to more international speakers would be important steps toward improving course quality. Thanks to its demonstrated quality, it can be said that the university course for health and hospital management held by the University of Innsbruck and evaluated in this study is certainly a worthwhile course offered in a still emerging market, namely one that will come under increasing pressure from the candidates for executive positions in the health professions to provide what is best for their careers and the health services industry in general. ","1765":"To identify factors affecting the decision to withhold resuscitative attempts or to terminate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the prehospital setting. In a physician-based emergency medical system (EMS) standardised interviews with the emergency physicians were performed within 24 hours after unsuccessful or withheld CPR-efforts. Over a period of one year 170 prehospital cardiac arrests were evaluated. 47 patients (28 %) were declared dead on arrival by the emergency physician. The decision to withhold CPR was based on obvious clinical signs of death (32 patients) or the diagnosis of cardiac arrest due to severe trauma (8 patients). In 4 cases the terminal state of a fatal illness was the emergency physician's criterion not to initiate resuscitative efforts. In 3 patients an extended response time (more than 10 minutes) was mentioned, in combination with a primary rhythm of either asystole or electromechanical dissociation and additional information given by the family doctor. In 123 patients CPR was attempted. In 72 cases (59 %) resuscitative efforts were terminated as no return and stabilisation of spontaneous circulation was achieved. In 58 patients the decision to stop CPR was based on the evidence of cardiac death. Additional criteria for the termination of the resuscitation attempt were the duration of CPR, an extended response time, pre-existing diseases, age, pupillary status, missing brain stem reflexes, the reason of cardiac arrest, information given by the family or the family doctor and secondarily evolving signs of death. In 14 patients the emergency physicians reported that their decision to terminate CPR was primarily based on these co-factors, the evidence of cardiac death was not explicitly mentioned in these cases. In the pre-hospital setting the decision to withhold or to withdraw CPR is mostly based on reliable criteria such as obvious clinical signs of death, fatal trauma or evidence of cardiac death. Nevertheless, in a small but considerable number of cases exceptions to this rule are made by emergency physicians.

The identification of a large number of different proteins is an essential part of future therapies, since they, as enzymes, receptors or ion channels, are specific relays in the nociceptive system and therefore have key functions in pharmacotherapeutic therapy. Nature itself supplies a variety of substances which are of therapeutic value, some of which are already in scientific trial. In contrast, even today not all available pain therapy measures are in use in Germany, at least not in all areas. Especially the treatment of children is not state of the art. Thus a further increase of chronic pain patients is to be expected in the future. This development has to be stopped, not only for ethical reasons, but also to prove the economical value of adequate pain therapy. Qualified treatment of acute pain within well defined limits can help to avoid chronification and further costs. This will be the decisive argument with which to mobilize the necessary funds for the development of the pain treatment of the future.","1769":"Beyond doubt the provision of pain therapy for patients with acute and chronic pain in Germany has improved over the last 30 years. This positive development comprises i. e. the growing impact of acute pain services on the treatment of patients with postoperative pain and the implementation of new developments in research into the clinical setting of obstetric pain therapy. Nevertheless, the provision of pain therapy for patients with chronic pain syndromes, for children, and in the fields of cancer pain and palliative medicine is neither qualitatively nor quantitatively sufficient.","1770":"This short historical report describes the course of development of interdisciplinary pain management starting from the early US-American pain clinics (nerve block clinics).

Therefore emergency medicine has become the \"third column\" of this speciality. As a \"generalist with special skills\" the anaesthetist fulfils the requirements of an emergency physician to a high degree. The scientific field of emergency medicine is subjected to a considerable amount of changes and requires qualified training and further education; in this context the guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation are of outstanding importance. In the governmental-controlled emergency care system, the emergency physician and the chief emergency physician are responsible for both the individual treatment of patients and the management of major incidents and catastrophes. Moreover, the interhospital transfer is gaining increasing importance. Even though a high quality standard of the German emergency medicine system can be stated, there are still clear deficits such as the lack of integrated dispatch centers and the lack of the position of a medical physician as emergency care leader in each area. A leading structure for the management of major incidents and disasters is established to a great extent, nevertheless personal and material deficits exist in this field especially considering a rising terroristic threat. In the in-hospital emergency medicine anaesthetists are of essential importance for the interdisciplinary teamwork in the resuscitation room, medical treatment of in-hospital emergencies on the wards and outside on the hospital ground, and for internal as well as external major incidents and disasters. This is not always recognized in public opinion, so that the interdisciplinary integration must be secured and reinforced. A major goal is to preserve emergency medicine as the third column of anaesthesiology and to protect achieved standards, to reinforce research in preclinical and clinical emergency medicine, and to take up new challenges in the future. ","1772":"It was only during the early sixties that emergency medicine started developing both world wide and especially in Germany. Although it had been realised already in the 19 th century that absence of treatment for a period after infliction of a wound had a crucial effect on recovery, and in spite of the fact that in 1938 Kirschner had stressed the need for preclinical medical care, results of research on the pathophysiology of sudden death were not available until 1960. At the same time it became possible to develop measures and methods enabling to preserve the vital functions essential for survival already at the site of an accident and during transportation or to restore them after circulatory arrest. Basing on these realisations, an emergency sequence of survival measures was worked out and within a period of 20 years the prerequisites were translated into reality that ensured a chain of emergency measures including the necessary organisational, structural and personal requirements for immediate and effective action, including the requisite means of transportation and the essential diagnostic and therapeutic equipment. The following article describes both the positive developments and the deficits that still existed in 1990. German anaesthesiology has made highly decisive contributions to the present and internationally recognised efficiency of emergency medicine and emergency intensive-care services.","1773":"","1774":"Physicians, nurses and many other allied health professions join in intensive care as a team for the treatment of patients whose vital functions are either endangered or impaired. Apart from continuous monitoring, which represents the smallest common denominator of all types of intensive-care treatment, intensive-care therapy also encompasses continuous treatment and support of failing organ functions and likewise continuous intensive nursing. The complexity of intensive-care medicine is a strong argument against intensive-care becoming a medical specialty of its own. Nevertheless, the coordination of intensive care-medicine by an experienced intensive care physician is of utmost importance. The present situation in intensive-care medicine is characterised by an increasing tension between new and fascinating medical possibilities (such as right and left ventricular assistance device systems, liver support, pharmacologic treatment of sepsis, avoidance of the complications of critical illness) on the one hand, and limited budgets on the other hand. This conflict is reflected by two basic fears within the population: firstly, the fear that not everything medically possible is being done for the patient due to economic reasons, secondly, a fear of futile treatment at the end of life, merely prolonging inevitable death. Accordingly, ethical questions regarding intensive-care are emerging at all levels of the health system.","1775":"","1776":"As in past and present times anaesthesiology will remain the central and original part in the spectrum of anaesthesiology, emergency, pain and intensive-care medicine also in the future. Nevertheless, profound changes will take place within the next few years promoting the anaesthesiologist to the manager of the perioperative workflow. Soft and hard skills like qualification in organisation, team-leading, costing and overall quality management will be mandatory. On the other hand, medical and scientific visions should also remain in scope. Improvements in selectivity of pharmacology and monitoring in anaesthesiology and reduction of perioperative morbidity should also be actively promoted. To provide independence from commercial goals of industrial companies and to enable developments from basic research up to evidence-based clinical applications, concentration of knowledge and financial resources in centres of excellence will be imperative.","1777":"Anaesthesia today is a cross-over of all medical sub-specialities, based on a stable scientific fundament and a high margin of safety. Anaesthetic techniques are sophisticated and enable a differentiated treatment of pre-, intra- and post-operative medical demands. The physician-patient-relationship and the patients' satisfaction are main aspects of peri-operative care by anaesthetists even in the area of conflict by economic pressure. Nonetheless, the credit to anaesthetists given by physicians and also by the general public is inadequate resulting in difficulties to recruit a sufficient percentage of the decreasing number of aspiring physicians. This could be prevented by an improved medical school and training.

The tracheal tube was removed after 16 h of artificial ventilation, the patient was awake and responded to questions. The neurological examination was normal, as well as the control CT scan. With regard to a mydriasis the following differential diagnosis have to be considered: cerebral ischemia, cerebral hematoma, metabolic encephalopathy, shock, and a drug side effect.

The general principle behind point-of-care (POC) testing is that \"faster is better\" ('from vein to brain'). The entire process for laboratory testing includes withdrawal of blood into special (pre-labelled) tubes, transportation of the sample to the central laboratory where the plasma is separated from the blood cells by centrifugation, carefully pippeting of a defined volume of plasma that is placed in the analyzer. POC instruments provide us with the potential to do old things in new ways. With the help of portable POC analyzers a variety of laboratory parameters including coagulation parameters, blood gas analysis, electrolytes, markers of organ function can be measured next to the patient's bed thus significantly shorting turnaround-time (TAT). Cost analyses of new monitoring devices are necessary in today's climate of cost savings. It is important to capture all costs and not only costs of the test kits. Direct costs (e. g. test cartridges, costs for the analyzers, cost for quality control) may constitute only a small percentage of the true costs. Hidden costs consist of overhead costs (e. g. transportation) and the consequences of delayed results. The present overview summarizes the available POC systems in Germany and may serve as a decision maker for those who are interested in introducing POC monitoring systems.","1793":"There is no doubt that underlying medical problems such as concomitant diseases or risk factors play a role in increasing patient morbidity and mortality. These factors are already integrated in trauma scores but preexisting diseases have no impact on burn scores yet. This study was performed to examine the predictive value of the classical burn variables that are integrated in the Abbreviated Burn Severity Index (ABSI). The preexisting diseases and risk factors in burn patients within our burn center were evaluated, with the aim of incorporating these evaluations into a new burn score. This modified burn score was used to optimize the predictive value of burn mortality. This study included 443 intensive care burn patients. Demographic, injury, age, total body surface area burned (TBSAB), full thickness burn (FTB), inhalation injury (IHT), sex, medical comorbidities, intensive care and outcome data were documented. Univariate analyses, stepwise logistic regression and the Receiver Operating Curve were used to generate values for the probability of death. Univariate analyses identified the following risk factors for their relationship with mortality: TBSAB, age, IHT, FTB, sex and medical comorbidities (cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal and endocrinological). Logistic Regression showed that total body surface area burned and age correlated most significantly with the probability of poor outcome. There were weaker correlations between IHT and FTB. No main effect was registered for gender and preexisting medical problems. The greatest area under the ROC curve was registered for our modified ABSI when comorbidities and risk factors were integrated. The results of this study show that the Abbreviated Burn Severity Index is an appropriate burn score for estimating the risk of mortality after burn trauma. However, in addition to the classical variables, preexisting diseases and risk factors have a significant influence on the outcome and therefore should be incorporated into a new burn score to predict mortality more accurately.

Therefore hypertonic solutions have been introduced to the in-hospital intensive care treatment of brain-injured patients. In view of the disturbed cerebral perfusion and oxygenation in the acute phase following traumatic brain injury, early initiation of treatment is desirable to improve long-term outcome and to minimize secondary brain damage. Two different hypertonic isooncotic solutions are licensed in Germany for prehospital and in-hospital treatment of acute hypotension due to hypovolaemia and haemorrhagic shock. Both solutions offer interesting therapeutic options for treatment of patients with increased intracranial pressure. Limitation of license to the treatment of shock in Germany does not allow routine prehospital use in isolated head trauma at the moment. In other European countries, the approval for the prehospital use of hypertonic isooncotic solutions has been modified.","1795":"","1796":"","1797":"Acute myocardial infarction following blunt chest trauma is a well reported but rare finding.

Coronary recanalization by PTCA and the implantation of coronary stents were successful in both vessels. Despite of a non-optimal blood flow after recanalization and stenting in one vessel (LAD TIMI II flow after recanalization), and a non-optimal accompanying medical therapy, during and after intervention (intravenous heparin starting 8 hours after the coronary intervention and platelet inhibitors starting 4 days after the intervention) the coronary angiogram after 2 months documented both vessels patent without a reocclusion or a restenosis. The case report documents, that in traumatic myocardial infarctions the treating of both, the attending injuries and the myocardial ischemia, is feasible. Early coronary angiography and coronary interventions, with or without stent-implantation, are indicated, even in cases in which an adequate accompanying medical therapy with heparin and platelet inhibitors is contraindicated.","1798":"The standard laryngeal mask airway LMA-Classic is recommended in the ILCOR guidelines as alternative to facemask and tracheal tube during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. LMA-Unique, LMA-Fastrach and LMA-ProSeal are additional variants that are compared with the standard LMA in a resuscitation model. Tidal volumes, chest compressions and signs of gastric inflation are measured in a standardized resuscitation model (Ambu Cardiac Care Trainer with notebook and thumper). Ten 3-minute resuscitation cycles were performed with facemask and all LMAs (Classic, Unique, Fastrach, ProSeal, all size 4) with a ventilation : compression ratio of 2:15. To allow comparison with tracheal tube and to judge safety margins, another ten resuscitation cycles were performed with tracheal tube and all laryngeal masks with continuous chest compressions after two initial ventilations. The bag-valve device used for ventilation was replaced by an automatic transport ventilator in a third series with continuous chest compressions. Cuff pressures were set at 80 cm H2O. During interrupted chest compressions, adequate ventilation was possible with all devices. Tidal volumes for facemask, LMA-Fastrach and LMA-ProSeal were significantly (p &lt; 0.001) higher than with LMA- Classic and LMA-Unique. During continuous chest compressions, significant differences (p &lt; 0.001) occurred when comparing tracheal tube, Fastrach and ProSeal with the other two laryngeal mask airways, which did not reach recommended tidal volumes. During ventilation with the automatic transport ventilator, values for all devices except LMA-ProSeal dropped significantly, adequate ventilation was possible with tracheal tube, Fastrach and ProSeal. Signs of gastric inflation were found during ventilation with facemask and - to a lesser extent - with LMA-Classic. In the resuscitation model chosen, all laryngeal mask airways are possible alternatives for ventilation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The new LMA-ProSeal and also the LMA-Fastrach allow higher tidal volumes even during elevated intrathoracic pressures caused by continuous chest compressions, performing superior to the standard laryngeal mask airway. For inclusion of these devices in the ILCOR guidelines, further research in patients is warranted. ","1799":"The evaluation of services by patients is an integral part of continuous quality improvement in anaesthesia. Patient satisfaction is affected by various objective and subjective variables. Individual experiences, impressions and needs represent an important part of overall patient satisfaction. Data of 519 patients were collected in a standardised anonymous questionnaire independent of the post-anaesthetic visit. Anaesthesia staff appeared to be friendly to 97 % of patients asked, 95 % of patients wanted to be treated by the same staff in case of another anaesthesia, nearly 87 % felt relaxed and satisfied after anaesthesia. Up to 26 % of patients felt tense after pre-anaesthetic visit and 38 % before anaesthesia, 35 % felt that waiting before operation was endless and 20 % complained about loss of humaneness because of technical equipment and monitoring. Significant differences could be found between specific groups of patients: Older and male patients were in all more satisfied compared to younger and female patients, patients after regional anaesthesia were more satisfied compared to ones after general anaesthesia. The inquiry of subjective patient impressions can be performed in anaesthesia departments without much effort. The results help to identify and avoid psycho-vegetative stressing situations and to improve patient satisfaction with anaesthesia. ","1800":"The first cases of general anesthesia were already cases with awareness. Until today, case reports of patients with awareness are published. These published cases are likely to be the top of the iceberg, as most patients with postoperative recall do not inform their anesthesiologist. Incidence of awareness with recall is between 0.1 and 0.2 %. In a large multicenter-study, incidence of recall was 0.1 % without, and 0.18 % with the use of muscle relaxants. The risk is increased with decreased doses of anesthetics, e.g. in patients with hemodynamic instability (trauma cases), patients undergoing cesarean section or cardiac surgery. Intraoperative awareness does not necessarily cause explicit (conscious) memory. Even in the absence of explicit memory, implicit (unconscious) memory can still have consequences for the patient. In the worst case, it can cause post-traumatic stress disorder. There is doubt whether patients may profit from positive suggestions given during intraoperative awareness. Recommendations to administer benzodiazepines to prevent explicit memory must be reconsidered. Complete neuromuscular block should be avoided whenever possible. If a patient is thought to be aware, he should be contacted, his situation should be explained and affirming comments should be given until consciousness is lost again. Postoperative visit should include questions about awareness and recall. The anesthetist should not disbelieve reported recall. Explanation of what had happened and referral to an experienced psychologist must be offered. Thus, the incidence of severe sequelae should decrease.","1801":"","1802":"","1803":"According to scientific articles focusing on emergency medicine published in international journals in the past few months, early defibrillation by lay persons, thrombolysis during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and treatment with mild therapeutic hypothermia have been identified as relevant, new and clinically important treatment options to improve outcome following cardiac arrest. Early defibrillation using automated external defibrillators by lay persons reduces the time interval between collapse and first attempts at defibrillation and thus improves outcome after prehospital cardiac arrest. Thrombolysis during CPR -- for which the results regarding safety and efficacy are available from nonrandomized trials -- can also be safely performed in case of pulseless electrical activity. Thrombolysis during cardiopulmonary resuscitation has, however, no significant effect in this subgroup of patients with pulseless electrical activity in whom outcome is poor if the drug is administered at the end of conventional CPR procedures. Mild therapeutic hypothermia, i. e., cooling of cardiac arrest victims to 32-34 degrees C central body temperature for 12-24 h following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, markedly improves survival rate and neurological outcome. Since this has now been clearly documented in two randomized clinical trials, it can be assumed that this kind of intervention will be recommended and translated into clinical practice soon. In conclusion, new and clinically relevant methods to improve outcome following cardiac arrest are available and can now be widely used clinically.","1804":"","1805":"The rupture of the trachea is a rare but serious complication after endotracheal intubation.

The patients general condition and the infaust prognosis resulted in the lack of therapeutic options and the death of the patient. According to the forensic autopsy the secondary perforation is probably a consequence of intubation or a pressure lesion of the tube in combination with a weakness of the membraneous part of the trachea due to impaired microperfusion. Every physician performing an intubation has to be aware of the risk and the consequences of a tracheal rupture.","1806":"","1807":"","1808":"","1809":"","1810":"","1811":"The status of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in intensive care units (ICU) in Germany was analysed by a national survey.

Of the 716 questionnaires sent 223 (32 %) were returned and analysed. The use of NIV in all specialties increased during the last 3 years. 14 % of ICUs in some specialties treated more than 30 % of patients with NIV. CPAP (88 %), BIPAP (45 %) and ASB\/PSV (48 %) were most frequently used as NIV-strategies. 10 % of all ICUs reported to have experience with proportional assist ventilation. NIV was most frequently used for disease states like COPD (82 %), pneumonia (64 %), pulmonary oedema (50 %), bronchial asthma (35 %) and ALI\/ARDS (22 %). The use of NIV was considered when clinical signs of ventilation (93 %) and oxygenation [arterial blood gas analysis (92 %) and oxygen saturation (66 %)] were inadequate. Complications observed during NIV were panic reaction (83 %), ulceration of nose (38 %) and aspiration (14 %). The reasons to reject NIV were (total 13 %): lack of ventilators (64 %), expenditure of personnel (57 %) and risk of the procedure (11 %). 38 % of the ventilators used were older than 5 years. 56 % of the ICUs were content with the equipment for NIV. 76 % of the ICUs were interested to buy new equipment of NIV. 99 % of the survey have declined NIV as an alternative method of ventilation. In summary we found NIV as an accepted additional method of ventilatory support in respiratory failure in German ICUs.

We examined 200 cases of medical treatment initiated by paramedics before arrival of the MICU team at the site of the medical emergency. Using a questionnaire, all emergency procedures performed by the paramedic team on scene were recorded and defined as \"required\", \"carried out\", and \"accurately performed\". The documented emergency procedures were divided into three categories: basic procedures (e. g. positioning, CRP, oxygen administration), additional procedures (e. g. placement of iv-lines, application of intravenous medication), and routine emergency diagnostic measures (e. g. monitoring of cardiopulmonary status). Further documented were the time of onset of emergency physician treatment, and the definitive transport vehicle used. To evaluate the time required for the measures performed, three different groups were identified according to the time gap between the arrival of the paramedic and the emergency physician teams (&lt; 3 min, 3 - 5 min and &gt; 5 min). In the 200 emergencies included in the study, 76 - 95 % of the required procedures were accurately performed prior to the arrival of the MICU team, at a success rate ranging from 87 to 100 %. In this study, a large number of emergency procedures could be performed by the paramedic team within a short period of time (in some cases &lt; 3 min), and adequate effectiveness. Based on our results, the activation of paramedic-staffed first-tier ambulances with shorter response times is recommended in addition to the MICU system. ","1813":"One often identified effect of opioid administration is that of the development of tolerance to the analgesic effect. While it is generally agreed that tolerance to opioid analgesia does occur, it does not appear to be a limiting factor. Dose escalation in chronic pain therapy is considered to be predominantly a consequence of increasing pain, which is a result of increasing nociceptive input as the disease progresses. The underlying cause of tolerance to opioids, however, as commonly identified in the ICU can be identified as an adaptation process. When the opioid is given continuously several causes of adaptation can be identified, all of which can be traced back to the cellular and molecular level. Initial effects of opioid administration in most individuals are analgesia, sedation, nausea\/vomiting, respiratory depression, pupillary constriction, constipation and euphoria or dysphoria. However, numerous studies and clinical experience suggest that tolerance to different opioid effects develop at different rates, which has been termed selective tolerance. While tolerance to nausea, vomiting, sedation, euphoria and respiratory depression occur rapidly, there is minimal development of tolerance to constipation and miosis. Such diversity suggest receptor-related differences in the speed of development of tolerance. In the ICU other compounds such as benzodiazepines, when given together with opioids, seem to speed up the rate of development of tolerance of the latter. Such an effect very likely is due to a reduction in activity of the descending inhibitory nervous system. In addition, there is surmountable data suggesting that the higher the intrinsic activity of the opioid at only one receptor site, lesser receptors are needed in order to induce a potent analgesic effect. As a net result the incidence of tolerance is less likely to become clinically apparent when potent ligands such as fentanyl or sufentanil are administered. N-METHYL-D-ASPARTATE (NMDA) ACTIVATION, OPIOID RECEPTOR INTERNALIZATION AND DESENSITIZATION: An altered metabolism has little effect on the rate of development of tolerance. In chronic pain treatment with morphine, however, an increased ratio of the metabolite morphine-3-glucuronide, with antiopioid effects, to morphine-6-glucuronide is associated with staggering doses of the analgesic. Opioids which interact with micro - and\/or kappa-binding sites, demonstrate an adaptation process called desensitization which is due to a reduced interaction with the internal second messenger system called G-protein. This is only a short-lived phenomenon following binding of the ligand. Another underlying mechanism of tolerance development is that of internalization of the opioid receptors. This short-lived phenomenon, termed endocytosis, results in lesser binding sites available for the mediation of analgesia. Another and more relevant mechanism of long-term opioid binding is that of subsequent protein kinase C (PKC), phospholipase C (PLC) translocation and activation of nitric oxide synthetase (NOS). All of this contributes to a N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation with ensuing antiopioid effect and tolerance. Most likely genetic difference in opioid receptor synthesis and difference in their affinities for various ligands is the cause for the wide margin of dose variability in patients (genetic polymorphism). Once tolerance to the analgesic effect of the opioid is observed and in order to avoid unnecessary further development of tolerance, simultaneous administration of other receptor mediated analgesics is advocated. In the perioperative period strategies like the multimodal analgesic concept is fostered. It consists of the simultaneous administration of low-dose ketamine, co-administration of an alpha 2-agonist, and the administration of a selective COX-2 inhibitor (refecoxib, parecoxib) respectively. In chronic pain therapy combined administration with either dextromethorpharphane, or opioid rotation of a more potent ligand such as methadone, fentanyl TTS or oxycodone is suggested. Since conversion factors are not reliable in opioid rotation, it is best to start off with 50 % of the equivalent dose and rapidly titrate to the desired effect. With regard to tolerance development in the ICU, co-administration of an alpha 2-agonist (clonidine, dexmedetomidine), and daily intermittent cessation of benzodiazepine administration are advocated. Since continuous dosing of an opioid, commonly handled in the ICU setting is more likely to induce tolerance, intermittent administration is advocated. Taken together, there is an abundance of experimental data which suggests, that with every dose of an opioid several adaptive processes are being initiated. Due to genetic polymorphism such adaptation is seen clinically with striking individual different dosages, the degree and the time of onset of tolerance. Although tolerance development may result in staggering doses of an opioid, there is no reason to evade the use of such agents. On the contrary, the concept of multimodal analgesia consisting of the simultaneous use of analgesics with a different mode of action can counteract tolerance development. ","1814":"This is the second part of a survey which analyses the history of inhalative oxygen therapy and its interactions with the history of anaesthesiology. Specific emphasis is put here on illustrating inventions of modern pressure gas technology such as pressure reducing valves. These enabled Draeger Inc. to be the first firm to develop and trade on a large scale technically convincing products allowing a rational, therapeutic application of oxygen. Especially Draeger anaesthesia apparatus (e. g. the \"Roth-Draeger Anaesthesia Apparatus\") and respiratory protective devices, which were available from 1902, proved also internationally successful from the very beginning. In the international historiography on inhalative oxygen therapy, however, these contributions have to our knowledge so far never been systematically considered. Consequently, J. S. Haldane (1860 - 1936) is regarded there to have \"founded\" of modern oxygen therapy in 1917. Critically reviewing this earlier research, we propose a historical reassessment, concluding that the year 1902 was the historically decisive \"turning point\" towards the development of modern oxygen therapy.","1815":"","1816":"","1817":"Central venous catheters are exchanged in cases of malfunction, suspected infections, or when another catheter type is required.

Handling of the instruments and application criteria were to be tested. 7 anaesthesia departments were able to take part in this study. 280 patients could be investigated after approval of the ethics committee of the medical faculty of the university of Goettingen. 145 patients received the PLMA and 135 the LMA. The surgical interventions were small to moderate procedures with a duration of at least 20 minutes in the sections general surgery, trauma\/orthopedic surgery, urology, vascular surgery, gynecology, ENT-surgery and ophthalmology. There was equivalence of the two instruments PLMA and LMA concerning duration and ease of insertion, endoscopic position check, observations on emergence, potential for injury and some postoperative complaints. This equivalence could be confirmed statistically. Laryngospasm was observed in three, Bronchospasm in two patients with the PLMA, in no one with the LMA. In one case of laryngospasm and another of bronchospasm a mechanism of supraglottic laryngeal stenosis has been involved which may occur in rare instances with the PLMA. This mechanism is due to the double cuff of the PLMA with the instruments proximity to the laryngeal inlet. The seal pressure in both groups differs significantly (p = 0.001). The mean value for the seal pressure was 29,3 +\/- 0,21 mbar for the PLMA and 20,9 +\/- 0,21 mbar for the LMA. In the PLMA the gastric tube could be positioned with the first attempt in 118 patients, with the second attempt in 17 cases. In 10 patients the gastric tube could not be placed. Contrary to the LMA the tip of the PLMA cuff may be bent in some cases with loss of airway safety and positioning of the gastric tube. The symptoms sore throat and painful swallowing on the first postoperative day were more frequent with LMA application. These differences could be confirmed statistically (sore throat p = 0.01, painful swallowing p = 0.04). They may be explained by the more rigid LMA compared to the PLMA and by the fact that the LMA in this study was older than the PLMA, loosing plasticizer. The drainage tube within the PLMA offers safety from aspiration in patients with no primary aspiration risk, additional reassurance for a correct position and a better stability of the airway. Our data may support a wider indication range for the PLMA compared with the LMA. The PLMA may be applied in laparoscopies and lower abdominal surgical interventions. Careful clinical observation will show, if the minimal invasiveness of the PLMA offers an advantage for these patients. The PLMA should not be applied in patients with increased aspiration risk.","1827":"Inhibition of gastrointestinal motility by drugs used for anaesthesia or sedation in critically ill patients in the ICU is a major problem leading to various complications. Thus this study examines whether the thio- and oxybarbiturates thiopentone and pentobarbitone exert an inhibitory effect on intestinal peristalsis. Peristalsis in isolated segments of the guinea-pig small intestine was elicited by distension of the gut wall through a rise of intraluminal pressure and recorded via the intraluminal pressure changes associated with the aborally moving peristaltic contractions. Thiopentone and pentobarbitone (0.1 - 300 microM)-induced inhibition of peristalsis was reflected by an increase of the peristaltic pressure threshold (PPT). Thiopentone (EC50 = 19,8 microM) and pentobarbitone (EC50 = 99.7 micro M) concentration-dependently increased the PPT. While the vehicle (saline) and 0.1 - 10 micro M thiopentone and pentobarbitone were without any effect on the PPT, 100 micro M caused a significant increase in PPT, and complete abolition of peristalsis occurred after 300 micro M thiopentone or pentobarbitone in all segments tested. Inhibition was reversed by changing the bath solution. Thio- and oxybarbiturates inhibit intestinal peristalsis in the guinea-pig ileum. It is assumed that thiopentone and pentobarbitone affect propulsive peristalsis also in the human small intestine.

Clinical observation and physiological reasoning suggest, that in BIPAP patient and ventilator can interact in various ways. This study was to elucidate the mechanical interaction. Ventilation and interaction between patient and ventilator were analysed in digital and mechanical simulations of BIPAP with a variety of patient effort magnitudes and durations, machine pressures and phase durations, and passive respiratory system (RS) mechanics. Patient efforts were most likely to effect a breath if they were strong relative to the machine pressure swing, and if they occurred late in a ventilator phase. Conversely, efforts occurring with or shortly after a machine pressure swing or relatively weak efforts were more or less ineffective. The postulated permanently unrestricted spontaneous breathing in BlPAP mode, although indeed assured in the technical sense, has to be qualified: Every change in machine pressure defines a new balance of the forces driving the RS, and the lung volume will approach a new elastic equilibrium volume ( = relaxation volume); the speed of this approach is determined by the time constant (tau = R x C) of the RS. Patient efforts are most effective when the RS is at or close to an equilibrium. An increase in the assisting machine pressure swing can unload the patient and assure a minimum ventilation, but it reduces the patient\"s influence on ventilation and thus potentially patient comfort. In contrast, Automatic Tube Compensation (ATC), an assist component accelerating the RS by reducing resistances, combines unloading with more patient influence; this has to be weighed against the potential disadvantage of higher peak flows. ","1838":"Unilateral spinal anaesthesia (\"hemi-spinal\") is theoretically associated with the advantages of fewer cardiovascular effects and longer duration of action while offering high density motor block of the extremity affected. In a prospective, randomised study 60 patients received 2 mls of 4 % hyperbaric mepivacaine intrathecally. Group I (n = 30) was returned into the supine position after 5 minutes in the lateral position, Group II (n = 30) was kept in the lateral position for 15 minutes. Spread and subsequently offset of sensory and motor block were assessed separately for each side at predetermined time intervals pre-, intra-, and postoperatively. Both groups were identical regarding their morphometric parameters. In Group I (5 minutes), the mean cephalad spread of sensory block of the initially dependent side was T6 after 15 mins and T4 after 25 mins. On the initially non-dependent side, the sensory block reached to T5 after 25 mins. In Group II (15 mins), the initial mean difference was equivalent to two segments (T7\/T9). After 25 minutes there was no difference to the results in Group I. Unilateral spinal anaesthesia (\"hemi-spinal\") is an attractive concept, supposed to be associated with the above mentioned advantages and the additional benefit of a partially maintained sensation of one limb. The results demonstrated in this study seriously question this theoretical concept. The most likely reason for the lack of inter-lateral differences in sensory block is the high concentration of hyperbaric local anaesthetic in the cerebrospinal fluid on the dependent side, which, on turning the patient to the supine position, will transit to the previously non-dependent side subsequently leading to a significant block. ","1839":"Classically hormones are defined as molecules that are secreted by endocrine glandular or neurosecretory cells into the blood stream and transported to their target tissue where they induce physiological processes at very low concentrations. Studies on the potential origin and the evolution of cell-to-cell communication systems suggest that exocrine pheromones (food signals and toxins) might have been the primitive bioregulatory molecules of unicellular organisms for chemical communication with each other and with the biosphere. The broad distribution and the structural diversity of pheromones suggests that these molecules and their receptors were predecessor modules of cell communication systems in metazoa. Neurosecretory cells, as we find them in Cnidarians, possibly served as basic modules for the evolution of neurohormonal systems of higher animals. Studies on genetic model organisms, such as Drosophila or the mouse, have demonstrated that chemical communication between neighbouring or more distant cells does not just involve endocrine and neurosecretory cells, but also unexpectedly tissues and organs such as the heart or the adipose tissue (e. g. the leptin signalling pathway). Comparative endocrinology could show that molecular components of hormonal systems represent signalling networks that are generally used during cellular communication processes and the differentiation of cell types during ontogenesis. Some of their functions are evolutionarily conserved, others not, as disscussion on steroid hormones and the prolactin signalling pathway will demonstrate.","1840":"","1841":"","1842":"Marfan Syndrome (MFS) is associated with an increased anaesthesia risk because of the pathological manifestations in anaesthesia-relevant organ systems.

An urgent Caesarean section was indicated in order to perform the equally urgent vascular surgery as quickly as possible. The most important goal of the anaesthesia management is to determine an anaesthesia procedure which addresses the combination of aorta dissection, gestation and MFS. On the one hand, the risk of an aorta rupture needs to be kept as low as possible and on the other hand, the vital functions of the baby have to be maintained.

Methods All cardiosurgical patients (NYHA II - IV) were included from Jan 1998 - Dec 2001. After failure of the first intubation attempt by means of direct laryngoscopy (with non-adjustable vocal cord level) this intubation was qualified as an difficult intubation. In all these cases a lightwand device (Trachlight(R), Laerdale, USA) was applicated. Success, duration of the procedure, blood pressure, heart rate were recorded. Results 195 patients (out of total 7406) who could not be directly intubated by laryngoscopy (vocal cord level and arytenoid cartilage not visible), were classified as a difficult intubation. During the first year 1998 the light guided intubation (LGI) was successful as secondary procedure in 94 %, 3 cases, in which LGI failed the intubation was performed by fiberoptic method or McCoy blade. From 1999 to 2001 all difficult intubation could be managed by light guided intubation. In all cases of unexpected difficult intubation the procedure of the light guided intubation took as less than 3 min. The directly measured arterial blood pressure elevated by 14 % in comparison with the pressure prior to the passage through the larynx. Discussion and Conclusions 1998 after sufficient familiarisation of staff with the light wand device the transillumination technique was introduced as an alternative of using the McCoy blade or of using the fiberoptic method in the case of difficult intubation. Short neck or obesity, which occur as main reasons for intubation problems are surprisingly easy to control by light wand device. Therefore the light guided intubation could be an alternative procedure for unexpected difficult intubation in the setting of adult cardiac anesthesia.","1845":null,"1846":"The aim of the second part of this review article was to describe common scoring systems in intensive care, and to point out their possible benefits and limitations.

Because of its simplicity and easy handling the ASA classification has worldwide popularity and recent studies demonstrated at least equal prognostic performance.","1857":"In the present paper the problem of giving anaesthesia to a child with a full stomach is discussed using a case report. Children are not by nature more in danger of aspiration than grown-ups. Even the higher risk of aspiration in children with a full stomach, which seems plausible, is not proven in all published studies on this subject. Since there is a more or less large amount of residual gastric secrete even 6 - 10 hours after the accident, due to stress or opioids, and prophylaxis against aspiration must be taken in any case, narcosis for the emergency treatment of these children can be applied immediately at the same risk. Rapid sequence induction is the world-wide standard as prophylaxis against aspiration today. Should aspiration happen, bronchoscopic draining is the main measure. Artificial ventilation is not a cogent measure, if the airway is free as far as the visible segmental bronchus and there are no disruptions in the respiratory exchange.","1858":"","1859":"","1860":"","1861":"","1862":"Since 1977 procedures for automatic documentation of anesthesias have repeatedly been described. Because of a limited arrangement of the desk top and because of its focussing on intraoperative documentation only a widespread introduction could not be established so far. Todays systems are offered with graphically orientated desktops which can be operated by intuition. The CompuRecord(R)-System (Philips Healthcare) is a perioperative management system for anaesthesia. It is constructed with modular components, recording the complete anaesthesiological care of a patient from preanaesthesiological assessment to the recovery room. Additional modules allow an economical check, provide for quality management and exportation of a core data base. Except for the original software all other components of the system including the net work components are IT standard products allowing reduced costs for supplementation, expansion and support. The advantage of an automatical documentation system of anaesthesia is frequent and detailed recording of anaesthesiological data as well as the possibility of a meticulous calculation of cost for each patient. The anaesthesiologist's time used for documentation is reduced remarkably with a limited and reasonable amount of data to be recorded. This leaves more time of attention for the patient himself. Time necessary for training is kept low with the touch screens of the CompuRecord(R) - System, which can be operated intuitively. Primary to purchase an exact analysis of process and of subsequent costs should be done. Standardized documentation allows to establish Standard Operating Procedures in a department of Anaesthesia. Using the given systems an implementation is possible already today despite restricted resources of man power.","1863":null,"1864":"Problems encountered during the installation and introduction of an automated anaesthesia documentation system are discussed.

Moreover the areas of net administration and hardware configuration as well as general administrative issues also represent possible sources of drawbacks. System administration and reliable support provided by personnel of the department of anaesthesiology assuring staff motivation and reducing time of system failures require adequately staffed departments. Based on our own experiences, we recommend that anaesthesiology departments considering the future installation and use of an automated anaesthesia documentation system should verify sufficient personnel capacities prior to their decision.","1865":"Due to increasing requirements on medical documentation, especially with reference to the German Social Law binding towards quality management and introducing a new billing system (DRGs), an increasing number of departments consider to implement a patient data management system (PDMS). The installation should be professionally planned as a project in order to insure and complete a successful installation. The following aspects are essential: composition of the project group, definition of goals, finance, networking, space considerations, hardware, software, configuration, education and support. Project and finance planning must be prepared before beginning the project and the project process must be constantly evaluated. In selecting the software, certain characteristics should be considered: use of standards, configurability, intercommunicability and modularity. Our experience has taught us that vaguely defined goals, insufficient project planning and the existing management culture are responsible for the failure of PDMS installations. The software used tends to play a less important role.","1866":"","1867":"","1868":"","1869":"Monocytes play an important part in all phases of both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. In our study, we examined the influence of various drugs used in intensive care (omeprazole, ranitidine, potassium canrenoate, furosemide, clonidine, verapamil, and metamizole) on monocyte chemotaxis in vitro. The 0,1 fold, 1 fold, and 10 fold concentrations, which are detectable in serum after a clinically efficacious bolus injection of the respective drug, were tested. Using centrifugation, mononuclear cells were isolated from venous blood samples obtained from 10 healthy volunteers. Monocyte chemotaxis was determined by means of a microchemotaxis chamber. N-formyl-methionylleucylphenylalanine served as chemoattractant. Omeprazole, ranitidine, and potassium canrenoate did not influence monocyte chemotaxis. While the 10 fold concentrations of the clinically efficacious serum concentrations of furosemide and verapamil caused a significant inhibition, the 10 fold concentrations of the clinically efficacious serum concentrations of clonidine and metamizole significantly stimulated monocyte motility. Clinically relevant concentrations of the drugs tested did not alter monocyte chemotaxis in vitro. However, 10 fold concentrations of the clinically efficacious serum concentrations, which might occur in vivo due to drug interaction, cumulation, altered elimination, or accidental overdose, caused an inhibition (furosemide, verapamil) or a stimulation (clonidine, metamizole). An in vitro investigation does never permit to jump to clinical conclusions. However, our study gives impulses to conduct intensive care examinations concerning the influence of drugs on monocyte functions particularly since these cells are of great prognostical importance regarding sepsis. ","1870":"","1871":"Mammals are at the end of a gradual metabolic evolution in the course of which the step from anaerobic to aerobic cellular metabolism and the transition from water to land life formed the basis for an increase in metabolic rate (from brady- to tachymetabolism). The increased metabolic rate and the resulting endogenous heat production were the preconditions for enhanced long-term performance as well as for homeothermy which allowed mammals and birds to invade temperate zones. However, the underlying increase in membrane permeability also results in an increased energy demand (for membrane pump activity) which leads to the reduced hypoxia tolerance of mammals and requires a permanent substrate supply. As an adaptation to a seasonal discrepancy between increased thermoregulatory energy demand and decreased food supply, some small mammals apparently extended the newly evolved non-REM-sleep into hibernation. Mammalian hibernation is characterized by a profound metabolic reduction which is influenced by acidosis and limited to a tolerable degree by maintained thermoregulation. The lower limit of cooling seems to be determined by a critical minimal metabolic rate which is common to all mammals. The higher the normothermic metabolic rate, the lower is the temperature at which this minimal metabolic rate is reached. Since specific (i. e., weight-corrected) basal metabolic rate increases with decreasing body mass, small mammals exhibit a higher hypothermia tolerance than larger ones. On the other hand, the metabolic decrease to a uniform minimal level reflects an inactivation of the overall metabolic size relationship and, thus, forms a counterpart to the metabolic increase from a lower fetomaternal to the higher size-related level, occurring after birth. The postnatal metabolic increase which favours the onset of thermoregulation, parallels the increase in oxygen tension at the transition from fetal to adult circulation and, thus, probably enables mammalian neonates to readjust their metabolic needs in response to hypoxia. There is increasing evidence that, similar to the step from anaerobiosis to aerobiosis, the increase in metabolic rate resulting from any increase in oxygen supply is a general principle of evolution that, apart from its further adaptive benefits, protects tissues from oxygen excess and subsequent oxidative stress.","1872":"","1873":"","1874":"Exposure of platelets to anaesthetic agents may alter their functional characteristics and in patients undergoing surgery or long-term sedation this may be clinically relevant.

In patients undergoing surgery blood samples were taken from a peripheral vein cannula before induction of anaesthesia with propofol (3.0 mg kg (-1) BW) or thiopentone (7.0 mg kg (-1) BW) and five minutes later (n = 11 in each group). Surface expression of the fibrinogen receptor complex (GP Ib\/IIIa), P-selectin, and the percentage of leukocyte-platelet aggregates were measured by flow cytometry after stimulation via the ADP or thrombin receptor pathway.

In 34 cases mechanical ventilation has to be started during the emergency room procedures. Two patients were intubated after they were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Insertion of a chest tube was done in 5 patients at the scene by the emergency team, in 15 cases after admission to the hospital and 21 at the ICU. Although the average age of years of patients was higher in group B (37,2 +\/- 15,0 y vs. 46,9 +\/- 21,1 y), p values calculated by ANOVA test revealed no significant difference.

","1876":"Neurogenic inflammation is elicited by activation of unmyelinated sensory neurons through noxious stimuli and subsequent release of neuropeptides such as substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) from peripheral nerve endings. The nerve-mediated inflammatory responses in the tissue consist of hyperaemia and oedema which under some circumstances may be accompanied by pain. Neurogenic inflammation has been implicated in the pathophysiology of various human diseases with uncertain etiology. Signs of inflammation and hyperalgesia associated with chronic pain syndromes such as migraine, arthritis and complex regional pain syndrome resemble the characteristics of neurogenic inflammation. By extrapolation of convincing evidence obtained in rodent models, neurogenic inflammation is assumed to contribute to diseases of the respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract, urogenital tract, and skin in humans. Since, however, highly selective substance P receptor antagonists, found to be effective against inflammation in rodents, failed to inhibit inflammatory processes in clinical trials, the hypothesis of an involvement of neurogenic inflammation in human diseases is discussed critically in this review. Beyond its primarily inflammatory character neurogenic inflammation can be regarded as a mechanism that activates protective responses, thus bringing about a first line of defence to maintain the integrity of the tissue and to contribute to tissue repair.","1877":"Difficult intubation can unexpectedly occur in clinical practice and emergencies.

","1890":"Activation of sensory unmyelinated neurons by noxious stimuli evokes the release of neuropeptides, such as substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) from peripheral nerve endings. These neuropeptides and subsequently released mediators cause a local oedema, hyperaemia and an erythema which extends beyond the site of stimulation (so-called flare response). Since these inflammatory signs depend on the function and integrity of peripheral sensory nervous systems, the response has been termed neurogenic inflammation. Due to the fact that nearly all tissues in mammals including humans are innervated by afferent sensory neurons, this neurogenic inflammation can occur ubiquitously throughout the body. Albeit first evidence showing that sensory neurons contribute to the inflammatory signs, described as antidromic vasodilatation, axon reflex, triple response, neurogenic inflammation, elicited at the level of tissue that they innervate was first obtained more than one hundred years ago, it was in the last two decades that inflammation caused by the release of neuropeptides from afferent nerve endings was recognised as a physiologically and pathologically relevant process. A large number of exogenous and endogenous substances and autacoids may stimulate or sensitise sensory nerve endings, thus simultaneously producing pain and nociceptive responses, as well as neurogenic inflammation. On the basis of recent research a variety of pharmacological substances and antagonists of putative mediators have been identified to modulate or suppress neurogenic inflammation, thus providing a rationale for therapeutical strategies for various diseases in which neurogenic inflammation is suggested to be involved. Among them, capsaicin and other newly developed agonists and antagonists at the vanilloid receptor have attracted particular attention, since they were found to be capable of desensitizing nociceptive nerve structures and thus of preventing development of neurogenic inflammation or even of abolishing an ongoing inflammatory process.","1891":"This review tries to establish a synthesis between the comparative\/morphological approach and the molecular analysis of ontogenetic processes in development and evolution.

The in vitro hemodilution was performed with blood samples taken from the volunteers before the infusion was started. These samples were diluted with HES-solution until the same hemoglobin concentration measured at the end of the infusion was attained. The in vivo TEG-parameters remained in the reference range of the method, however all in vitro TEG-parameters are out of the range of normal values. The isolated interpretation of the in vitro data shows an impairment of blood coagulation. The shortening of the reaction time as an indicator for the initiation of blood clotting points to activated coagulation by in vivo hemodilution with HES, whereas in vitro the prolongation of the reaction time is indicative for retardation of clotting. The evaluation of the TEG-parameters and of other clotting parameters determined prior to the beginning of the infusion, at the end of the infusion and four hours after termination of the infusion of HES 130\/0.4 and of HES 200\/0.5 to healthy volunteers show alterations of blood coagulation parameters caused mainly by dilutional effects. The more pronounced alterations found in vitro cannot be interpreted as impairment of haemostasis in vivo. On the other hand, the likewise haemodilution in vitro causes an impairment of coagulation. Therefore, the effects of in vitro hemodilution with HES on coagulation differ qualitatively and quantitatively from the effects of in vivo hemodilution.","1898":"It has been known for years that variations in atrial stretch and intrathoracic blood volume may affect kidney function.

After approval of the local ethics committee, 40 patients scheduled for major lower abdominal surgery were randomly allocated to receive bupivacaine 0.25 % or ropivacaine 0.2 %, both with sufentanil 2 microgram\/ml in a double blind manner. General anaesthesia (midazolam, etomidate, fentanyl, vecuronium, and desflurane in N2O\/O2) and postoperative management of the patients were standardised. Postoperatively, the motoric function and ability for active early mobilisation was examined clinically (application of the Bromage scale, ability to leave the bed and ability to walk). Reduction of muscular force of the legs was measured postoperatively using a scale and compared with preoperative baseline values. To ensure a similar level of analgesia, a 10-cm visual analogue scale was applied at rest and while coughing. The two groups did not differ with respect to the demographic data and postoperative levels of analgesia. Less reduction of motoric function at rest was observed in the ropivacaine group (p = 0,044). However, this did not lead to an increased ability to get up from bed (p = 0,57) or to walk around (p = 0,17). A high number of patients did not meet the requirements for early ambulation. Almost half of the patients of both groups were unable to leave their beds in the morning of the first postoperative day. On the second postoperative day about 25 - 30 % of the patients could not walk even when support was applied. Furthermore, median reduction (10th\/90th percentile) of muscular strength was reduced to 50 % (37 %\/76 %) in the ropivacaine group and to 48 % (31 %\/61 %) in the bupivacaine group compared with preoperative values. While quality of analgesia was similar, mobility of the legs at rest is better preserved with ropivacaine 0.2 % than with bupivacaine 0.25 %. However, despite the fact that high dose sufentanil was added to both local anaesthetics, there was marked motoric impairment in both groups probably due to the lumbar site of the epidural catheter.

","1911":"Since the introduction of new German health legislation, operations formerly performed on an in-patient basis have been transferred to the out-patient sector. Due to this development evaluating the postnarcotic arousal period has become increasingly important. Vigilance, reactivity and state of health determine a patient's well-being and time of discharge after an operation and consequently influence economical and legal issues. Former studies investigating the arousal period have mainly focused on patient interviews and assessment of patients by staff. The aim of our study was to objectivize postnarcotic vigilance and reactivity (critical flicker fusion frequency and multiple choice reaction) using neurophysiological monitoring (psychometric system Combitest 2: CFF, EWR, MWR). The applied methods have been defined as valid, reliable and sensitive tools to investigate this question. Inter-individual and gender-specific differences as well as variations due to the type of anaesthetic employed can be detected. The study participants assessed the test battery's practicability and overall described this method as easy to use. Vigilance (CFF), basic and complex sensomotor reactivity (performance in simple and multiple choice tests) were restored after a postanaesthetic phase of 90 minutes (narcotics applied: isofluran and propofol). The results show that the use of modern anaesthetics does not justify the current medical and legal claim to 6 hours of postanaesthetic observation. The computer-supported psychometric system Combitest 2 has recently been used to assess the arousal phase after application of different types of anaesthetical procedures (TIVA, volatile, balanced) and has been found to be superior to parameters traditionally used to assess discharge criteria (time until patient opens eyes, orientation concerning time and location, time spent in postanaesthetic recovery room). Besides employing our study methods, subjective factors such as well-being and pain sensation should also be evaluated when determining the time of a patient's discharge.","1912":"Delirium is the most common acute organic psychosis postoperatively, and occurs more frequently in the elderly than anticipated.

These patients were investigated with the AMT simultaneously by a second investigator. Delirium was present in four orthopaedic patients (10 %) and was diagnosed correctly in these patients by the AMT. All but one patient without delirium showed no deterioriation in AMT score.

","1913":"During the last decade, there has been an emergence of multiresistant Gram-positive bacteria in intensive care units. Oxazolidinones are a new class of antibiotics without cross-resistance to other antimicrobial agents, and linezolid was recently introduced as first oxazolidinone on the German market. In this overview, we summarize important data and discuss possible indications for linezolid in the treatment of infections in critically ill patients. ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY AND PHARMACOLOGY: The antimicrobial spectrum comprises mainly Gram-positive bacteria, especially Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococci, and streptococci. Linezolid is mostly bacteriostatic and inhibits the bacterial protein synthesis at an early stage. Adults may receive 600 mg b.i.d. intravenously or p. o. About 30 % of the dose are excreted by the kidneys as mother compound and 50 % as metabolites. Dosage reductions are not necessary, even in severe renal impairment, but about one third of the dose is eliminated during dialysis. Overall, linezolid is well tolerated, but approximately 5 % of the patients may suffer from diarrhea or nausea and there have been a few reports about reversible myelosuppressive side effects. Linezolid has been compared to vancomycin for treatment of Gram-positive nosocomial pneumonia, and the clinical cure rates were 66.4 % and 68.1 %, respectively. Linezolid is highly active and bactericidal against pneumococci. The clinical cure rates for treatment of skin and soft tissue infections were 88.1 % with linezolid and 86.1 % with penicillinase-stable penicillins. MRSA were excluded in this study, but it may be assumed from data in vitro that linezolid is equally effective against these bacteria. Data for the treatment of catheter-associated and other forms of bacteremias are mainly derived from the compassionate-use-program, where linezolid has been used in complicated cases, mainly after failure of standard therapy. The majority of infections was caused by multiresistant Enterococcus faecium and the clinical cure rates were approximately 80 %. The currently available data suggest that linezolid will serve as useful agent in the treatment of severe infections caused by multiresistant staphylococci and enterococci. Further studies are necessary to define the role of linezolid as first-line agent, e. g. in the treatment of central venous catheter infections. In light of the severe prognosis of pneumonias caused by MRSA, studies on the combination of linezolid and vancomycin are warranted. Despite the low level of resistance, it seems prudent not to use linezolid as first line agent in the treatment of uncomplicated infections, as long as effective standard antibiotics are available. ","1914":"Several systems of gas transport have developed during evolution, all of which are able to sufficiently supply oxygen to the tissues and eliminate the CO2 produced by the metabolism, in spite of great distances between the environment and the individual cells of the tissues. Almost all these systems utilize a combination of convection and diffusion steps. Convection achieves an efficient transport of gas over large distances, but requires energy and cannot occur across tissue barriers. Diffusion, on the other hand, achieves gas transport across barriers, but requires optimization of diffusion paths and diffusion areas. When two convectional gas flows are linked via a diffusional barrier (gas\/fluid in the case of the avian lung, fluid\/fluid in the case of gills), the directions in which the respective convectional movements pass each other are important determinants of gas exchange efficiency (concurrent, countercurrent and cross-current systems). The tracheal respiration found in insects has the advantage of circumventing the convective gas transport step in the blood, thereby avoiding the high energy expenditure of circulatory systems. This is made possible by a system of tracheae, ending in tracheoles, that reaches from the body surface to every cell within the body. The last step of gas transfer in these animals occurs by diffusion from the tracheoles (\"air capillaries\") to the mitochondria of cells. The disadvantage is that the tracheal system occupies a substantial fraction of body volume and that, due to limited mechanical stability of tracheal walls, this system would not be able to operate under conditions of high hydrostatic pressures, i. e. in large animals. Respiration in an \"open\" system, i. e. direct exposure of the diffusional barrier to the environmental air, eliminates the problem of bringing the oxygen to the barrier by convection, as is necessary in the avian and mammalian lung, in the insects' tracheal system and in the gills. An open system is found in the respiration via the skin, which is of significance in some amphibians, but is limited by the thickness of the skin that constitutes a substantial diffusion path for O2 and CO2. The thick skin, on the other hand, provides mechanical protection as well as flexibility for the animals' body and helps avoid massive water loss via the body surface. The gills of fishes, in contrast, exhibit rather short diffusion distances, are located in a mechanically protected space, and the problem of water loss does not exist. The flows of blood and water occur in opposite direction (countercurrent flow) and this situation makes an arterial PO2 approaching the environmental PO2 possible. A major disadvantage is constituted by the environmental medium since water contains little O2 compared to air and, to compensate this, much energy is expended to maintain a high flow rate of water through the gills. In the mammalian lung (\"pool system\"), the presence of a dead space and the rhythmic ventilation that replaces only a small fraction of the gas volume of the lung per breath, are responsible for an arterial PO2 (2\/3 of the atmospheric PO2) that cannot reach the expiratory PO2. However, an advantage of this feature is the constantly high alveolar and arterial PCO2, which provides a highly effective H(+) buffer system in the entire body. The apparent disadvantage of the mammalian lung is avoided by the avian lung, which uses an extended system of airways to establish continuous equilibration of a part of the capillary blood with fresh air (cross current system), during inspiration as well as during expiration. In this system, arterial PO2 can significantly exceed expiratory PO2. A disadvantage here is the enormous amount of space taken up by the avian lung, in animals of 1 kg body weight three times as much as taken up by the mammalian lung. All respiratory exchange systems considered here exhibit high degrees of optimization - yet follow highly diverse construction principles. There is no such thing as an ideal gas exchange system. The system that has evolved in each species depends to an impressive extent on environmental conditions, on body build and size, on the animal's patterns of movement and on its energy consumption.","1915":"","1916":"","1917":"","1918":"","1919":"We describe the clinical course and outcome following decompressive craniectomy in six patients.

This treatment may reduce high lethality rate and high frequency of severe neurological disorders.","1920":"Back pain after spinal anaesthesia is often attributed to the spinal anaesthesia and the accompanying puncture. We demonstrate two cases where this problem was not caused by spinal anaesthesia but was due to sacroiliac joint blockage caused by bedding. As far as we know, this complication has not been described yet. When taken into account, it can be treated easily and with success.","1921":"The postdural puncture headache (PDPH) is a possible complication after spinal or epidural puncture. The therapeutic concept is usually organised step by step, but the epidural blood patch is the most reliable and effective therapy. In earlier studies myelographie, epidurographie and MRT were used, to visualise the localisation of the dural defect and to describe the effects of patching the epidural space. Our working group focused on the utilisation of ultrasound and we decided to use this technique for the visualisation of bloodpatches. With agreement of the local ethics committee we monitored the performance of 4 epidural bloodpatches in pregnant women, who suffered from PDPH. We used a General Electric LQ 400 ultrasonograph with a 7-MHz-probe. To ensure sterile conditions we used sterile ultrasound sleeves and sterile ultrasound gel. In 3 of 4 cases a continuity loss could be represented in the doppel layer signal of the dura. It had the size of the diameter of a Tuohy needle. In one case the defect of the dura was larger than in the preliminary investigations (2,5 - 3 mm). The ultrasonography of the epidural space was performed in the paramedian scan. All patches were placed by using the conventional loss of resistance technique with using online ultrasound support. The epidural puncture and the application of the blood patches were visualised simultaneously in all cases. With the injection of blood a brief expansion of the epidural space was seen. The patients recieved a mean injection volume of 17 ml sterile blood. 10 to 40 seconds after the injection of blood the disconituity of the dura doppel layer signal was no longer provable. Within a short time we could detect the increase of cerebrospinal fluid and the patients headache was treated sucessfully. The clinical use of this diagnostic technique can be found in the simultaneous presentation of the dura leakage and the intervention while performing an epidural bloodpatch. Since these informations are relevant for further clinical practice further investigations are warranted.","1922":"The tension-free vaginal tape operation (TVT) is a new surgical treatment of stress urinary incontinence in women. The tape has to be placed at the level of midurethra in the left and right paraurethral canal and has to be brought up to the abdominal wall in close contact with the back of the pubic bone with a special needle instrument. The performed anesthesia is decisive for the operative success, because a sufficient analgesia is demanded and, on the other hand, the correct placement and tension of the urethral tape has to be controlled by the patient performing a stress test by coughing and pressing. In this context the opioid remifentanil seems to be specially suitable because of its pharmacologic characteristics. In this retrospective analysis the anesthesia related data of a total of 70 patients undergoing TVT surgery with remifentanil analgesia within one year were reviewed according to their anesthesia protocols. All patients underwent remifentanil analgesia in combination with local anesthesia. In no case the performed procedure had to be changed. In 7 cases a temporary decrease of the pulsoximetrically measured oxygen saturation to less-than-or-equal 92 % occurred, which could be treated by reduction of the infusion rate of remifentanil or by assisted ventilation. All patients were adequately able to perform the intraoperatively required stress test. 16 patients suffered from nausea and\/or vomiting postoperatively. Continuous infusion of remifentanil is suitable for the short time profound analgesia needed for the TVT operation because of the pharmacologic characteristics of remifentanil. A antiemetic prophylaxis should be performed with this analgetic regime. ","1923":"The abuse of cocaine can cause serious medical complications like tachycardia, rhabdomyolysis, and hyperthermia. Because of the clinical similarities, it has been suggested that cocaine might be a trigger of malignant hyperthermia (MH). Therefore, aim of this study was to investigate the in-vitro effects of cocaine in skeletal muscle specimens of MH susceptible (MHS) and normal (MHN) patients. 62 patients undergoing the in-vitro contracture test (IVCT) according to the protocol of the European MH Group (EMHG) for diagnosis of MH susceptibility were included in this study. In muscle specimens surplus to diagnostic requirements cocaine was added in order to achieve tissue bath concentrations of 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 mM. The contracture development and twitch response have been registered. 21 patients were diagnosed as MHS and 36 patients as MHN. 5 patients tested as MH-equivocal (MHE) were excluded from the study. Following bolus administration of cocaine, no contracture development was observed in MHS, as well as MHN specimens. The muscle twitch decreased after cocaine administration significantly in both diagnostic groups. In contrast to the established MH trigger substances like volatile anaesthetics, cocaine produced no contracture development in MHS muscle specimens. Furthermore, cocaine produced a negative inotropic effect in all skeletal muscle preparations, which might be explained by local anaesthetic effects. Regarding these results, cocaine seems not to be a MH trigger agent. ","1924":"The neuromuscular disorders described are divided into four groups: motoneuron diseases, peripheral neuropathies, disturbances of neuromuscular transmission and myopathies. In motoneuron diseases problems mainly result from respiratory insufficiency and the predisposition for aspiration caused by progressive muscular weakness. Depolarising muscle relaxants may elicit myotonic reaction and massive hyperkalemia. In contrast to non-depolarising muscle relaxants there may be an extreme hypersensitivity. In peripheral neuropathies the cardiac function is often limited whereby dysautonomia may enhance cardiovascular instability. The negative inotropic effect of anaesthetic agents must be observed with care and patients with higher degree of AV blocks may need a cardiac pacemaker during general anaesthesia. The Charcot-Marie-Tooth-Syndrome is characterized with a high sensitivity to thiopental. Disturbances of neuromuscular transmission frequently cause respiratory problems The fluctuating weakness of bulbar and respiratory muscles may impair swallowing and can lead to recurrent aspirations. Due to the reduced number of acetylcholine receptors the sensitivity to non-depolarizing muscle relaxants is elevated and the response to succinylcholine is reduced. Drugs reducing neuromuscular transmission such as antibiotics and beta-blockers may enhance these symptoms and should be avoided. In progressive muscular dystrophies the anaesthetic risk is mainly dependent on cardiac and respiratory impairment. Administration of succinylcholine leads to the risk of hyperkalmic cardiac arrest. Patients with metabolic myopathies are also at risk due to the involvement of cardiac muscle but respiratory problems are less frequent. Muscle metabolism should be supported by administration of substrates depending on the underlying disorder. In membrane disorders muscle rigidity (myotonic reactions) or weakness may lead to respiratory insufficiency. In addition to the depolarising muscle relaxants also anticholinesterase drugs, hypothermia and dyskalaemia can evoke myotonic reactions.","1925":"","1926":"A 40 year-old woman with a prominent abdomen was hit by a car on the motorway. The emergency call was \"cardiac arrest after multiple trauma in a woman in the late stages of pregnancy\". The patient was asystole as indicated by the electrocardiogram 6 minutes after the primary emergency call. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation and endotracheal intubation was performed and a total dose of 3 mg epinephrine was given intravenously. The patient remained asystole. In this preclinical situation the suspected pregnancy could neither be excluded nor confirmed. At least 30 minutes would have been necessary to transfer the patient to the next hospital to perform a caesarean section under controlled conditions. A second physician - trained in obstetrics - was called to perform caesarean section preclinically. In addition, a special ambulance was called to provide sufficient postdelivery care of the neonate. However, the second physician who arrived 18 minutes later was not an obstetrician but also an anaesthesiologist who was trained in neonatal intensive care. At this time - 33 minutes after the first emergency call - the emergency physicians decided to perform a caesarean section immediately. However, the patient was not pregnant. Obviously, the primary emergency call was misleading. The skills of the emergency physicians and the conditions at the site of the emergency have to be weighed carefully against the expected time that is needed to reach the next hospital where a caesarean section can be performed under controlled conditions. In this case, both emergency physicians were anaesthesiologists and they had no doubt that the patient was in the late stages of pregnancy. Due to the prolonged cardiac arrest that did not respond to cardiopulmonary resuscitation both physicians were convinced that immediate preclinical caesarean section represented the only therapeutical option for the unborn patient.","1927":"We report on the general anesthesia in the case of an orthopedic surgery conducted on two brothers with sickle cell anemia. After concerted planning with a pediatric hematologist concerning the perioperative management an exchange transfusion was conducted ambulatorily before surgery. The following anesthesia under continuous fluid infusion, warming and regular hemoglobin and temperature control could be conducted without problems. One of the boys was treated with two heterologous red cell packs after an unexpected hemoglobin drop intraoperatively. The postoperative course was uneventful, especially concerning sickle cell relevant complications. The case reports are intended to show up the pathogenesis of patient-relevant sickle cell crises and critically evaluate central points of anesthesiological management, especially the choice of preoperative transfusion.","1928":null,"1929":"Patients who have an operation under general anaesthesia with muscle relaxation often complain about neck pain if the head needs to be placed in extreme reclination to facilitate surgical access. Patients complain about vertigo, light muscle tenseness but also about severe joint blockages in the neck region. Due to this complication the standard practise in some hospitals is to refer these patients routinely to a physiotherapist postoperatively. This study investigated the influence of an axial traction - a treatment which can easily be learned by anaesthesiologists - on blockages of the cervical spine in those patients. In two randomised groups (n = 15 each) of preoperative inconspicuous patients the following directions of motion were investigated: Ante- and retroflexion of C0\/1, side inclination C0\/1, side nodding and side movement C2\/3 to C6\/T1, dorsal movement C5\/Th2. The examinations took place at the preoperative anaesthetic round, shortly before extubation, two hours after extubation and the next day. Additionally the patients were asked about their discomfort. An axial traction of the cervical spine was performed in one group after extubation. The number of new blockages and the subjective discomfort of the patients was compared with the Chi-Square test. An axial traction of the cervical spine reduces the frequency and the intensity of symptoms significantly. It was investigated whether an axial traction of the cervical spine - a treatment that can easily be learned by anaesthesiologists - could improve patients' comfort. The study showed that an axial traction of the cervical spine immediately after extubation reduces the frequency and intensity of symptoms significantly. This treatment is highly effective, not very time consuming and, if done correctly, without any risk for the patient. By using this treatment routinely, additional expenses for physiotherapeutic interventions could be reduced. ","1930":"Many investigations described a positive effect of clonidine for premedication (reduction of perioperative stress response, analgetic effect, anaesthetic-saving effect, prophylaxis of postoperative shivering). The most important objective in premedication is undisputed anxiolysis. The anxiolytic effect of clonidine is differently discussed. Therefore we investigated the anxiolytic effect of clonidine in comparison to midazolam. 50 patients (ASA 1 - 3) were included in the present doubleblinded, prospective study. These patients got an oral premedication with 1 mg flunitrazepam in the evening before surgery and 5 microg\/kg(-1) clonidine or 100 microg\/kg(-1) midazolam 60 - 90 minutes before surgery. By using Spielbergers State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-G X1) we registered the degree of state-anxiety before and after premedication. Both clonidine as well as midazolam showed a significant reduction of the state-anxiety over time (p &lt; 0,001). Between the groups there were no differences in the STAI-scores at any time (p &gt; 0,05). The degree of reduction in the state-anxiety were comparable between the groups. In addition to the higher up listed effects clonidine showed a anxiolytic effect, which is comparable to midazolam. Therefore clonidine is an interesting alternative to benzodiazepines, which are commonly used drugs for premedication. ","1931":"Tumescent local anesthesia was originally used in liposuction but is also carried out for other plastic, cosmetic, dermatological procedures and for surgery of the venous system, often in outpatients. For this purpose, large amounts of fluids containing diluted lidocaine or prilocaine and epinephrine are infused subcutaneously. In this review of the literature, this technique is assessed in view of potential anesthesiological complications such as intoxication with lidocaine, prilocaine, overdosage of epinephrine or overload with fluids. While originally a lidocaine dosage of 35 mg\/kg b.w. was considered to be safe, dosages were then increased to 55 mg\/kg b. w. and even 90 mg\/kg b. w. without data showing the safety of such high doses. Published data of plasma concentrations were obtained from small numbers of patients, showing that the concentrations were below 5 microg\/ml which is considered the nontoxic range. The maximum levels were observed after 4 - 12 hours, if epinephrine was used. In a few patients, however, the values had not yet begun to decrease at the end of the 23 hours observation period. Replacing lidocaine by prilocaine shifts the problem of toxicity to that of the formation of methemoglobine, which can reach levels of more than 10 %. Data about effects of high-dose epinephrine in the literature are sparse, but tachycardia, arrhythmias and hypertension remain a major concern. Although fluids are applied subcutaneously, an overload with fluids may occur. Cases of lung edema have been reported, however, hypovolemia caused by a loss of fluid into the third space cannot be excluded. Because of these possible complications, tumescent local anesthesia should be employed in outpatients with great care. Patients should be monitored during the procedure and for a sufficient period of time thereafter by adequately trained staff. Patients with cardiac or pulmonary risk factors should not undergo tumescent local anesthesia.","1932":"Disorders of skeletal muscle and peripheral nervous system are collectively called neuromuscular disorders (NMD). Important for anesthesia is that these disorders show various symptoms and have a high risk during general anesthesia. Especially administration of succinylcholine and volatile anaesthetics may cause problems. Under special circumstances opioids, nondepolarising muscle relaxants and intravenous anaesthetics can interfere with this kind of disorder, too. Complications during and after anaesthesia may result in malignant hyperthermia, malignant hyperthermia-like reactions and primary or secondary changes relating to the underlying NMD. These include cardiac and respiratory problems, dysautonomia as well as hypothermia or hyperthermia. Thus the perioperative management must be determined individually to assure the best possible safety for each patient. Preoperative examination such as ECG, echocardiography, respiratory function test including arterial blood-gas analysis, x-ray of the thorax, neurological status, and extended serum chemistry (such as CK and myoglobin) needs to be done. For premedication no drugs suppressing respiratory function should be administered. Regional anesthesia should be used whenever possible, especially in patients with respiratory and cardiac problems. The dosage of all recommended drugs should be as low as possible. Volatile anaesthetics should not be administered in the majority of NMD and succinylcholine is contraindicated, with the exception of myasthenia gravis. Additionally to the usual intraoperative monitoring, the invasive measurement of blood pressure allows frequent blood-gas analysis. It is obligate to monitor neuromuscular function and body temperature. During recovery special attention should be paid to maintain normal body temperature and electrolytes and acid-base status. The discharge of the patient from the recovery area to the normal ward should be performed only after respiratory function is normalized.","1933":"The human immune system is composed of two closely cooperating entities: innate, \"unspecific\" immune defense on one hand and adaptive, \"specific\" immunity on the other. Innate immune defense mechanisms were already developed very early in the evolution of the animal kingdom. By contrast, adaptive immunity exclusively evolved in jawed vertebrates within a surprisingly short time span. New data especially from genome sequencing projects now allow first glimpses on those events that resulted in the formation of adaptive immunity.","1934":"","1935":"","1936":"","1937":"","1938":"","1939":"","1940":"","1941":"","1942":"Despite favourable clinical data on the successful use of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO), only limited investigations have been carried out to date regarding the influence of hyperoxia on leukocyte function. In a murine model, CD4+ T-cell population remained unchanged after repeated HBO exposure, however CD8+ cells were found to be increased. The aim of this study was to investigate whether repetitive exposure to hyperoxia would affect human monocyte and lymphocyte function. Methods: After Ethics Committee approval the effects of elevated partial oxygen pressure were studied in the course of a ten-day HBO therapy (2.5 atmospheres absolute over a daily period of 90 min). Monocytes and lymphocytes of 30 patients with acute hearing loss were determined by flow cytometry before, throughout and after HBO therapy using monoclonal antibodies to CD3, CD4, CD8, CD14, CD25, CD45 and HLA-DR. Statistical analysis was made by ANOVA (analysis of variance). The relative percentage of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD25+, CD14+, and HLA-DR+ cells remained unchanged during the course of and after HBO therapy. We conclude that repetitive exposure to hyperoxia does not influence human monocyte and lymphocyte functions in contrast to experimental data. ","1943":"Compared to other procedures, gynaecological laparoscopies are followed rather frequently by postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Therefore, we investigated the prophylactic antiemetic efficacy of metoclopramide and droperidol under general anaesthesia with isoflurane (part 1). Given the rather unsatisfying results of this monoprophylaxis we examined the effects of a quintuple prophylaxis in this setting (part 2). Part 1: Following ethical committee approval and written informed consent 120 patients scheduled for elective gynaecological laparoscopy were allocated prospectively, randomly and observer-blinded to the following groups: group P (placebo): 2 ml NaCl 0.9 %, group D: 2.5 mg droperidol, group M: 10 mg metoclopramide. Part 2: Subsequently 50 patients scheduled for elective gynaecological laparoscopy and bearing a minimum risk of 25 % to experience postoperative vomiting were allocated prospectively and blinded to the observers to a quintuple prophylaxis group: group X: 10 mg metoclopramide, 2.5 mg droperidol, 12.5 mg dolasetron, 62.5 mg dimenhydrinate, 8mg dexamethasone. Part 1 and 2: Anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl, etomidate and succinycholine and maintained with isoflurane\/N2O, fentanyl and cisatracurium. The antiemetics were applied intravenously 20 min prior to end of surgery. Within the first 24 h postoperatively vomiting occurred more frequently in group P (44 %) compared to group D (21 %, p = 0.046) and group M (33 %, n. s.). Nausea also occurred more frequently in group P (61 %) compared to group D (24 %, p = 0.003) and group M (48 %, n. s.). Intensity of nausea was reduced both in group D and group M compared to group P (p = 0.03). Likewise the requirements for antiemetics as a rescue medication were reduced in group D (p = 0.02) and group M (p = 0.047) compared to group P. In group X no patient suffered from postoperative vomiting, no patient required a rescue antiemetic. Whereas droperidol provides a reliable antiemetic effect, the prophylactic effect of metoclopramide is rather uncertain. Therefore, further studies regarding a dose response-relationship for metoclopramide are deemed necessary. Since a monoprophylaxis with droperidol or metoclopramide failed to attain a satisfying PONV-prophylaxis in patients at high risk for PONV, the quintuple antiemetic combination might be an effective and safe solution.

A lethal perioperative \"carcinoid-crisis\" may occur. We report on a patient with carcinoid-syndrome due to liver metastases undergoing hemihepatectomy. For prophylaxis, the patient preoperatively received H 1- and H 2-histamine-receptor antagonists, corticosteroids, and a continuous somatostatin infusion. Besides monitoring cardiovascular variables we intermittently measured serotonin- and catecholamine concentrations. Initially increased serotonin concentration decreased during the course of anaesthesia. However, it increased again during liver resection despite Pringle's manoeuvre and was associated with a decrease in arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and central venous pressure. Hypotension was treated by volume and noradrenaline infusion. Thus, despite somatostatin infusion serotonin release is still possible, especially during surgical manipulation.","1980":"We report a rare anaesthetic complication: NPPE (negative pressure pulmonary edema).

However, in children effective doses and onset of action of rocuronium have not been reported during sevoflurane anaesthesia. To test in children the hypothesis that sevoflurane speeds the onset and potentiates the degree of rocuronium induced neuromuscular blockade we studied 50 children aged 2 - 7 years following approval by the local ethics committee. After induction and maintenance of anaesthesia with either 2 % endtidal sevoflurane in 60 % N(2)O\/O(2) (n = 30) or with propofol (3 mg small middle dot kg(-1) and 10 mg small middle dot kg(-1)h(-1), n = 20) and 60 % N(2)O\/O(2) for 17 +\/- 1 min, we injected either 0.15, 0.22, or 0.3 mg small middle dot kg(-1) rocuronium and quantified by mechanomyography the evoked (0.1 Hz ulnar nerve stimulation) response of the adductor pollicis muscle. Dose-response relationships of rocuronium under both anaesthetic regimes were assessed using a generalised linear model based on the maximum-likelihood-technique. Data were compared by analysis of covariance, F-test, and Mann-Whitney-U-test as indicated, p &lt; 0.05, mean +\/- SD, (95% confidence interval). The degree of neuromuscular blockade was greater (p &lt; 0.05) during sevoflurane (estimated ED 50: 0.15 (0.076 - 0.177) mg small middle dot kg(-1)) than propofol (ED 50: 0.25 (0.15 - 0.35) mg small middle dot kg(-1)) anaesthesia. Furthermore, onset time was significantly faster under sevoflurane\/N(2)O compared to propofol\/N(2)O anaesthesia (110 +\/- 31 versus 230 +\/- 52 s, p &lt; 0.01, after rocuronium 0.3mg small middle dot kg(-1)).

The distribution of clinical versus experimental research of German university departments of anesthesiology was analysed. With the help of Medline all articles published from all German university anesthesiology departments in German and English in 1998 and 1999 were analysed and specified with regard to the following subtypes: experimental research, clinical research, miscellaneous (reviews, questionnaires). 369 articles in German and 545 articles in English language were specified. From the German publications 129 articles were derived from clinical research (35 % of all papers), 29 papers were from experimental research (8 % of all papers), and 211 papers were miscellaneous articles (57 % of all papers). From the publications in English language, 291 papers were from clinical research (53 % of all articles), 195 were from experimental research (36 % of all articles), and 59 papers were miscellaneous articles (11 % of all articles). Clinical research was published more often in German, whereas experimental studies were published more often in English.

","1983":"The \"period-to-help\" (Hilfsfrist) is defined by the federal states as a measure for further planning and structure the emergency services. This period is composed of distinct time intervals and ends with the arrival of the rescue team at the emergency. From a physician's point of view it is merely the time to the first contact with the patient that is of vital interest. Data on the discrepancy between arrival at the emergency scene and the first contact with the patient are lacking. We analysed prospectively 680 emergencies outside the hospital and calculated the so-called \"access-to-patient\" period (Zugangszeit). 552 emergencies supplied with an ambulance and 128 emergencies supplied with a helicopter ambulance service were analysed. The mean total time period for the ambulance arriving at the patient was 8.17 minutes +\/- 30.3 seconds while being 10.52 minutes +\/- 73.3 seconds for the helicopter ambulance service. The \"access-to-patient\" period was 50.9 minutes +\/- 8.2 seconds for the ambulance and 75.7 minutes +\/- 21.7 seconds for the helicopter ambulance service. For road accidents the \"access-to-patient\" period was significantly shorter for both the ambulance (12.4 +\/- 4.1 seconds) and the helicopter (19,6 +\/- 10,8 seconds), while in emergencies taking place inside closed buildings these time intervals were 5 and 6.5 times longer (ambulance 64.2 +\/- 10,9 seconds). As outer circumstances counted most to prolonged access-to-patient periods the latter did not correlate with the severity of the injury or the emergency. Appropriate guidance and briefing of the crew of an emergency service at the scene is able to minimize the access-to-patient period (74.5 versus 60.4 seconds for the ambulance and the helicopter, respectively). Delays were caused in 22.6 % of all emergencies, mostly due to imprecise orders, impassable terrain and the inability to identify the building. If we consider that road accidents count for merely 10 % of all emergencies it seems appropriate to re-define the so-called \"period-to-help\" (Hilfsfrist) that takes into account the \"access-to-patient\" period (Zugangszeit) that is on average 50 seconds. The primary goal of any further planning must be to keep the interval without sufficient therapy as short as possible. ","1984":"Current management of acute stroke is characterised by an aggressive approach including specific therapy i. e. reperfusion therapy. However currently stroke patients often arrive too late in hospitals offering adequate treatment. Therefore optimized logistics play a predominant role in modern stroke management. 1. Does teaching of EMS staff and the public result in reduced prehospital latencies 2. Will EMS personnel be able to effectively screen patients potentially suitable for thrombolysis? During a six week-period all EMS patients presenting with possible signs of an acute stroke were prospectively registered (period 1). Data of interest were age, mode of primary contact, prehospital latencies, mode of transportation, destination and final diagnosis. Next an algorithm was established allowing EMS personnel to transfer patients with an assumed stroke to the best suitable hospital. Teaching comprised clinical signs, indication of CT scanning, pathophysiology, specific therapeutic options (thrombolysis), and criteria to identify patients suitable for thrombolysis. In a second step the public was continuously taught about stroke symptoms and the necessity to instantly seek EMS assistance. After 12 months data were compared to baseline (period 2). (period 2 vs. Period 1): Rate of patients transferred to a stroke center: 60 % vs. 54 %; rate of those transported to hospitals not offering CT scans: 17 % vs. 26 % (p &lt; 0.05).

","1985":"Over the last five decades the progress in intensive care has extended the limitations of controlling the process of dying and given doctors more influence in determining the time of death. More recently, palliative care has emerged as a new approach in response to the ethical dilemmas of modern medicine, which accepts that dying is a natural process that should not be hastened or delayed through medical interventions. While in Germany in 1999 more than 50 000 people have died in intensive care units, only a small number of 8000 patients have died in palliative care. In comparison to the highly-developed intensive care sector, palliative care is a much neglected area. The public debate following the legalisation of euthanasia in the Netherlands has highlighted concerns in Germany that intensive care has the potential of inappropriately prolonging life and raised expectations about the alternative therapies offered by palliative care. Doctors in intensive care and in palliative care face similar ethical dilemmas, though with a different weighting: the dilemma between professional judgement and patient autonomy, between traditional medical roles and patient self-determination and the dilemma of extending the span of life at the expense of quality of life. The approach of palliative care with its strong focus on alleviating the suffering of the terminally ill, has influenced the ethical debate of dying in intensive care. Although intensive care and palliative care have different aims and priorities, there are common problems of decision-making which could benefit from a shared orientation and interdisciplinary debate. Both the interpretation of a dying parent's will as well as withdrawing or withholding treatment in patients who are unable to decide for themselves should not merely be guided by the debate on active and passive euthanasia, but rather take into account the appropriateness or inappropriateness of medical actions in the specific situation.","1986":"","1987":"","1988":"","1989":"A standardized questionnaire was used to find out if and what kind of intraoperative cerebral monitoring method, respectively, is practised for carotid surgery in Germany.

In 43.3 % (n = 90), hospitals did not practise any kind of cerebral monitoring. In contrast, most hospitals monitored cerebral function and\/or cerebral haemodynamics, intraoperatively. Median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP; n = 60) and electroencephalography (EEG; n = 39) dominated, whereas carotid stump pressure measuring (n = 40), transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD; n = 10), cerebral venous oximetry (n = 8) and near-infrared spectroscopy (n = 4) were used less frequently. In 60 hospitals, the indication to install temporary intraluminal shunting was based primarily on monitoring results. The results of our study mirror the present practice of intraoperative cerebral monitoring for carotid surgery in Germany. SEP monitoring is preferable because this method can reveal an imminent cerebral ischaemia with high sensitivity and specifity. TCD and cerebral oximetry are less suitable for this purpose. Measuring carotid stump pressure is not recommendable to reflect the status of cerebral haemodynamics, however this method is still in frequent use. Recommendations whether to practise cerebral monitoring or not, and what method should be used for this purpose, cannot be given presently.","1990":"Without any doubt there is an increasing need for accurately measuring depth of anesthesia - from the viewpoint of the anesthesiologist and also of the patient. The ideal monitoring should fulfill the following criteria: It should be applicable for any type of anesthesia (intravenous as well as inhalative anesthesia); the monitor must have an extremely high sensitivity (each patient being awake must be recognized by the device).If the monitor does not have a high sensitivity, the monitor itself might lead to an increasing number of patients being awake during anaesthesia, because the anesthesiologist might rely on the monitor and does not deepen anesthesia while the patient is awake. Specificity is not as important as sensitivity. As incidence of interoperative awareness is low, one must monitor more than 750 patients to recognize only one patient who is awake. Finally, the monitoring device must be economic. If costs are considerably increased by measuring depth of anesthesia in today's climate of cost consciousness, the monitoring has to be restricted to special high risk groups of patients. If monitoring depth of anesthesia will become simple, safe, and economic, each anesthesia should be monitored for its depth, as today each patient needs pulseoxymetry. We try to give an orientation about the available devices for monitoring depth of anesthesia. Since the introduction of BIS interest in measuring depth of anesthesia is growing very dynamically. Due to the dynamic growth we hope that we were able to present an actual and complete overview about the monitoring systems for measuring depth of anesthesia. Until today no monitoring system has proven to fulfill the mentioned criteria. Monitoring of the depth of anesthesia will be based on any processing of the spontaneous EEG or its evoked potentials. Which type of monitoring, entropy, BIS, PSI, or MLAEP will be used in clinical routine will be shown in the future. All available monitors are no predictors, whether depth of anesthesia is sufficient for the next painful surgical stimulus. They can only monitor the anesthetic state at the time of measurement. There is no \"golden number\" predicting absolutely safely that the patient is in adequate anesthesia. The anesthetist must consider any technique for monitoring of the depth of anesthesia as an additional help in improving care for his patient.","1991":"The particularities in the medical treatment of children, especially those concerning premature infants, new-borns and babies, do not only stem from the immaturity of the organs (kidneys, liver etc.) but also from pharmacokinetic factors which are result of the immaturity of the brain. There are maturation deficits on all levels of transmission, from the nerve with electric transmission to the synapsis with neurotransmitter propagation, even though the whole system is basically laid out. The presented paper concerns itself mainly with the ontogenesis of the receptor-systems, a small part is dedicated to the question of myelination. Number and distribution of the receptors in premature or new-born infants and babies should not only be viewed in the context of the future function in mature humans (i.e. transmission and modification of information) - the receptors themselves are important factors in the maturing process of neuronal pathways, synapses and the differentiation of the neuronal cells themselves. Basically the number of receptors can change as follows: 1. Continuous increase until maturity, 2. Increase to a maximum during maturation with slight or stronger decrease after, 3. High initial number with following distinct decrease, 4. Even number throughout maturation, 5. Passing expression during maturation. The aim of this paper is to present an overview on the ontogenesis of opioid-, NMDA-, GABA-, dopamine-, acetylcholine- and serotoninreceptors. The data derived from animal and human-pharmacological experiments will be used to carefully conclude how the particularities of drug reactions of children (i.e. increased respiratory depression after opioid application in premature and newborn infants, higher incidence of paradox reactions to benzodiazepines etc.) can be explained.","1992":"","1993":"Industrial countries are experiencing substantial increases in cancer prevalence. While advanced cancer therapies resulted in prolonged survival most neoplasms still are incurable. Especially advanced stages of cancer are often accompanied by severe pain and other disabling symptoms. Sufficient pain and symptom control is needed to maintain a decent quality of life for cancer patients. However, expert palliative care for patients suffering from cancer pain is still insufficient. These deficits have encouraged pro-euthanasia pressure groups demanding legitimation of physician-assisted-suicide in Germany. Acting under the guise of promoting patient's autonomy these groups are gaining additional momentum from similar legislation passed in the Netherlands. Hospice movement and specialists in palliative medicine reject euthanasia as unethical and instead push for the global development of palliative care services. To address these issues the project SUPPORT was established in the Southern part of Lower-Saxony in 1996 with approval by the local ethics committee and sponsored by the German Ministry of Health. A palliative-care-team (PCT) of nurses and physicians with expert knowledge in palliative medicine supports patients after discharge from hospital by providing state-of-the-art palliative care at home. The PCT is available as a 24\/7 standby service and can be called on demand by general practitioners, members of outpatient nursing services as well as by patients and their relatives. By cooperating with the PCT these professional and lay caregivers improve their knowledge and skills regarding pain and symptom control for terminally ill patients. During almost 4 years of practical work more than 50 % of the patients enrolled in the project died at home compared to about 20 % under regular conditions. These data point out quite impressively that due to the PCT-interventions recurrent hospitalisations in a majority of cancer pain patients can be avoided when expert knowledge and help is available at home for patients, their relatives and caregivers whenever needed. When sufficiently supported at home by palliative experts the number of patients dying at home is reasonably higher than the rate observed under regular conditions. This would also comply with the wishes of most patients who prefer to die in the privacy of their own home. The project data suggest that the concept of SUPPORT should be capable to improve the current state of palliative medicine in other areas of Germany as well.

UGP of the internal jugular vein was recommended in 29 prospective randomized studies, 21 prospective and three retrospective studies as well as in several clinical reports. UGP of the subclavian vein was supported by only 4 studies, whereas two studies did not show any improvement of puncture results with UGP. Due to the visualisation of the vessel and the cannula imaging techniques represent the \"gold standard\". However, with conventional Doppler devices nearly the same success rates can be obtained. It does not seem to be justified to perform every central venous cannulation with Doppler or ultrasound support. Each anaesthetist and intensive care physician should be able to perform central venous cannulation without a Doppler or ultrasound device. However, in cases of abnormal anatomy UGP can be helpful to prevent complications. Especially children, patients with coagulation disorders and physicians with limited experience in central venous cannulation can benefit from UGP.","2006":"","2007":"","2008":"","2009":"Treatment of chronic low back pain is a difficult problem and usually of low effectiveness. Aim of the study was to analyse the effectiveness of a multimodal treatment procedure. From the basis of functional restoration concepts primarily established in the USA we conceptualized a treatment program which initially was funded by the German ministry of research. Over the years the regimen was modified in several respects (programs of different intensity). From 1990 to 2000 762 patients were treated in this way with one-year follow-up examination. Patients who were off work had significant differences in psychosocial and pain-related variables in comparison to those patients who were still working. Treatment procedures were in general very effective, although a modification of the program with less treatment (no work-hardening) failed in repeating the same effects. Pain intensity, disability, amount of depression and psychological distress improved significantly as well as work capability and use of the health care system. Nearly all results were seen to stabilize at the 12-month evaluation. Functional restoration programs for treatment of chronic low back pain have demonstrated effectiveness in several countries. By early use of these programs the high amount of costs due to back pain disability may be consequently reduced. Up to now in Germany these concepts are not well-known and insurance companies as well as the health system do not yet acknowledge them.

Ambulance records of nursing home residents from Goettingen\/Germany who had a cardiac arrest were examined retrospectively. During a seven-year period (1992 - 1998) the ACLS team was called to 71 residents (mean age 81.8 years) who sustained cardiac arrest. In 25 patients no CPR was attempted: 20 were pronounced dead by the arriving emergency physician, though only in 7 patients obvious clinical signs of death were present. Five patients suffered from a continuous deterioration of their health status and the ACLS team arrived after the process of dying had already started. No CPR attempt was initiated. The ACLS team performed CPR on 46 nursing home residents. In 33 patients (72 % of CPR attempts) no return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved. In three patients (6%) palpable pulse returned only transiently. Ten patients (22 %) who showed ROSC were transported to the hospital. Six patients died within 24 hours after having been admitted to the hospital, two patients within the next 8 days. Two patients survived to hospital discharge. The first was a 79-year old woman who returned to the nursing home after three weeks and survived severely mentally disabled another five days. The second was an 83-year-old man who was hospitalised for 20 days, returned in a persistent vegetative state to the nursing home and died 10 months later. A comparison of the arrest characteristics demonstrated that in patients with successful CPR there was a higher incidence of a witnessed collapse, bystander CPR, ventricular fibrillation and cardiac aetiology of arrest. In a high rate (35 %) the ACLS team with the emergency physician at the scene withheld CPR efforts in nursing home residents. Even if CPR was initiated, the benefits were very limited with only two patients (4,3 %) surviving severely disabled to hospital discharge. ","2012":"AIM OF THE INVESTIGATION: To evaluate the performance of different types of humidifying systems (heat and moisture exchanger, HME, and heated humidifier, HH) in the tracheo bronchial airway system of intubated mechanically ventilated patients. A heated and fast responding capacitive sensor with a time constant of 0,23 s was used to measure the water vapor pressure at different locations in the tracheo bronchial airway system of 12 patients after therapeutic bronchoscopy. The sensor was immersed in an airstream of app. 1 ml\/s continuously sampled with a bronchoscope in which the working pipe and the handle have been equipped with a heating system to prevent condensation. The sampling positions were 3 cm distal of the bifurcation in the right main bronchus, 2 cm proximal of the bifurcation and at the tube connector respectively. Without any humidifying system there was a dramatic reduction of the climatisation index respectively increase of the pulmonary water loss index, most prominently visible at the tube connector. There were significant differences between different types of HME (Pall BB 100 vs. Medisize Hygrovent S) but no significant differences between the Hygrovent S and the HH Fisher &amp; Paykel 630 set at 34 degrees C. In consideration of applied tidalvolumens between 550 and 950 ml, isothermic saturation has not been reached in close vicinity to the bifurcation. HME may differ substantially from one type to the other and should not be used as climatisation system without careful consideration of their performance data. Effective HME are equivalent to HH at 34 degrees C and may therefore also be used for long term ventilation. ","2013":"Changes in the Cytokine Network Through Escalating SIRS After Heart Surgery. Cardiopulmonary bypass is associated with an injury that may cause pathophysiological changes in form of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). There is a lot of information about the immunologic alterations in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass, but only little is known about the expression of cytokines in patients with severe SIRS or MODS following cardiovascular surgery. In the present study, we investigated the inflammatory response of patients with an escalating SIRS following open heart surgery. Plasma levels of cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, GM-CSF and TGF-beta) were measured at the first four postoperative days in 12 adult male patients with severe SIRS (SIRS-group), and 15 patients with uncomplicated course (control-group) following myocardial revascularization. All cytokines (except IL-1beta) were significantly elevated in SIRS-patients, the analysis of differences between the survivors and non-survivors within the SIRS-group showed dramatically elevated levels of IL-8 and IL-18 in non-survivors. From the results of our investigation we can conclude that monitoring of immunologic parameters, e.g. IL-8 and\/or IL-18 may be helpful for the early detection and prognosis of high-risk patients with severe SIRS and MODS following cardiac surgery.","2014":"","2015":"","2016":"Suprascapular nerve block may provide sufficient analgesia in painful immobilisation of the shoulder joint.

The location of the catheter has been verified using MRI examination. Pain relief was quantified by using visual analog scale (VAS 1 - 10) and showed decretion from VAS 8 - 10 pre treatment to VAS 1 - 2 after insertion of the catheter and throughout five days of intensive physiotherapy, respectively. The technique of catheterization using a nerve stimulator and alternative peripheral nerve blocks are discussed. In summary, continuous suprascapular nerve block offers an advantageous alternative for pain relief in patients with frozen shoulder.

In this study, we analysed how preoxygenation is used by anaesthesiologists in clinical routine and how this method is tolerated by the patients. One hundred and twenty-one anaesthesiologists of 4 hospitals were interviewed anonymously about training level, rank, indication for preoxygenation and techniques of preoxygenation, as well as their estimation of the patients' discomfort during preoxygenation. Data on 100 patients about oxygen-mask-tolerance were acquired by an anonymous questionnaire from a standard quality control inquiry. We received back 76 of the 121 questionnaires of anaesthesiologists (63 %). Fifty-nine percent of the anaesthesiologists (45\/76) preoxygenated in clinical routine. With increasing training time and higher ranks, less anaesthesiologists preoxygenated routinely: junior residents: 80 %; senior residents: 68 %; consultants: 60 %; assistant medical directors: 48 %.80 % of the anaesthesiologists (61\/76) used imperfect techniques for preoxygenation (e. g. oxygen-flow &lt; 8 l\/min). At the time of preoperative evaluation, the patients estimated the discomfort during preoxygenation on a continuous scale (1 to 10) as 2 (median; 1 - 7: 95 % confidence interval). Postoperatively, the patients mentioned no discomfort: 1 (1 - 1). The anaesthesiologists overestimated their patients' discomfort significantly with 5 (3 - 7) (p &lt; 0.001).In conclusion, preoxygenation, a simple safety procedure, is not routinely used by many anaesthesiologists and imperfect methods are often employed. A possible reason for the anaesthesiologists' reluctance to preoxygenate is an overestimation of the patients' discomfort, though the patients tolerate preoxygenation very well.","2019":"We tested the hypothesis that blood saving techniques are more effective in patients with a low baseline haemoglobin. We analysed retrospectively 1665 total hip replacements and 848 total knee replacements. Patients were divided in three groups according to the baseline haemoglobin (Hb): Group A were patients with a Hb of more than 15 g\/dl, group B between 15 g\/dl and 13 g\/dl and group C with a Hb of less than 13 g\/dl. The blood saving techniques applied (Preoperative blood donation, isovolemic haemodilution, and mechanical autotransfusion) aimed to a high patient population which underwent surgery without transfusion of homologous blood. The higher the baseline value of haemoglobin the higher was the patient population without homologous blood transfusion. The lower the Hb the higher was the effectiveness of blood saving techniques. In case of total hip replacement preoperative blood donation increased the patient population without homologous blood transfusion in all three groups significantly. However, in case of total knee replacement preoperative blood donation increased the patient population without homologous blood transfusion only in group B and C significantly. In both surgical procedures the combination of preoperative blood donation with other blood saving techniques did not further increase the patient population without homologous blood transfusion. In total hip replacement mechanical autotransfusion as well as isovolemic haemodilution reduced homologous transfusion in patients with low baseline haemoglobin. However, the increase was more pronounced when both techniques were combined. From our data is derived that the likelihood of homologous blood transfusion is greater in patients with a low baseline haemoglobin. However, in case of hip arthroplasty patients with a high baseline haemoglobin also profit from blood saving techniques while in case of knee arthroplasty the efficiency of blood saving techniques in a patient population with a high baseline haemoglobin is negligible. It seems to make sense to evaluate for the different kinds of surgery those patients who profit most from the different blood saving techniques. ","2020":"Perioperative arrhythmias are common.

An expression vector with the gene encoding for the protein of interest is introduced into an appropriate microorganism or cell line. The biochemical machinery of the host cell then translates the genetic information into the corresponding protein. Large scale production of the recombinant drugs uses biotechnological processes.

ENT surgery was performed without complications under general anaesthesia using propofol, fentanyl, and ventilation with nitrous oxide and oxygen. Routine intraoperative monitoring (ECG, noninvasive blood pressure, oxymetry and capnometry) was supplemented by frequent body temperature measurements and repeated laboratory analysis of venous blood gases, lactate, and glucose. Clinically, the postoperative course was uneventful and the boy was discharged from hospital on the first postoperative day. Signs or symptoms of malignant hyperthermia never occurred. Laboratory analysis only showed a remarkable serum lactate elevation postoperatively (6 mmol\/l) which decreased on the first postoperative day (3.7 mmol\/l). The present anaesthesiologic experiences with MELAS-syndrome are limited, and recommendations are mainly based on case reports. Careful preoperative physical examination with special regard to all available medical records, and anaesthetic management comparable with that in malignant hyperthermia susceptible resulted in an uneventful course in our patient.

General anaesthesia and preoperative management of the patients were standardised: premedication with chloracepate-dipotassium, induction with thiopentone, sufentanil and rocuronium, maintenance with N2O\/O2, sevoflurane and repetitive doses of sufentanil and rocuronium, postoperative analgesia with metamizol and piritramide, antiemetic rescue-treatment with dimenhydrinate, metoclopramide and triflupromazine. Number of emetic episodes, the need for additional antiemetics and adverse events were recorded for 24 hours. Efficacy was measured by \"complete-response\" (CR = 0 emetic episodes or 1 emetic episode after 4 hours and no rescue-treatment) and \"total-response\" (TR = complete response plus no nausea, i.e., &lt; 5 mm VAS rating of patients maximum nausea). Men: Only Dolasetron given intravenously reduced nausea and vomiting significantly, Dolasetron given orally reduced nausea, but not vomiting, DHB had no significant effects: CR 72.7% (group I), 100% (group II), 80% (group III), 63.6% (group IV); TR 72.7% (group I), 81.8% (group II), 50% (group III), 36.4% (group IV).

There were no adverse events in any group. Our results confirm the expected high incidence of PONV after thyroid surgery, especially in female patients. Single doses of oral and intravenous dolasetron and intravenous droperidol reduced PONV effectively in female patients undergoing thyroid surgery. Dolasetron seems to be the more effective substance in male patients. Both substances can be administered safely and are well tolerated. ","2027":"The study was undertaken to investigate the influence of two different regimens of analgosedation on control and quality of sedation, stress response and haemodynamic parameters.

Analgosedation was titrated until tolerance of respirator treatment was achieved and the patient was asleep, but able to respond to simple commands. At least 12 h after beginning of analgosedation, a simple neurological examination (\"diagnostic window\") was undertaken. In both groups, biometric data and diseases were altogether comparable, and tolerance of respirator treatment was excellent. About 16 h after start of analgosedation, 13 of 14 patients (93%) in the SK\/P-group were immediately cooperative. In 2 of 16 patients of the SK\/M-group, self extubation occurred, and 9 of 14 remaining patients (64%) were immediately cooperative (p = 0.065). Assessment of control and quality of analgosedation indicated slight advantages in SK\/P-patients. SEF90 showed predominant beta-activity in both collectives, which increased in the course of time. Adrenaline, noradrenaline, ADH, ACTH and cortisol were measured at 7 time points. All endocrine stress parameters were consistently above normal range, but decreased during the observation period (p &lt; 0.05). In the SK\/M-group, ADH was significantly and noradrenaline initially higher than in controls. Systolic arterial pressure was comparable, whereas heart rate was significantly lower in the SK\/P-group (p = 0.001). No relevant changes of endocrine or haemodynamic parameters were observed at neurological examination. In surgical intensive care patients, analgosedation with SK\/P showed some advantages over SK\/M with respect to control and quality. The endocrine stress response was reduced by both regimens in course of time. Altogether higher levels of ADH and noradrenaline during SK\/M-analgosedation let expect higher cardiocirculatory stability and possible reduction of catecholamine demand.

This observation then led to the discovery of a family of related peptides with slightly different amino acid compositions working in concert to achieve the maintenance of sodium and volume homeostasis. The natriuretic peptide family consists of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), and Urodilatin (URO) with their tissue-specific distribution including the heart (ANP, BNP), brain (ANP, BNP, CNP), endothelial cells (CNP), and kidney (URO). These peptides were thought to be primarily involved in cardiovascular and renal functions but have now proven to play a role in other physiological systems. In view of their known biological effects, therapeutic efficacy from administration of ANP, BNP or URO might be anticipated, for example in acute renal failure or congestive heart failure. A number of clinical trials suggest that application of these peptides may represent a new pharmacological tool in the treatment or prevention of these diseases, but the clinical benefit still needs to be shown in large controlled studies. In addition to therapeutic options it is possible that plasma concentrations of ANP and BNP could play a role as diagnostic and prognostic markers of cardiac dysfunction.","2029":"","2030":"","2031":"Cerebral ischemia with consecutive neurological damage is a typical complication in aortic arch surgery. Therefore, intraoperative neuromonitoring is of increasing interest. This paper describes the role of bilateral near-infrared-spectroscopy (NIRS) in detecting cerebral ischemia. In the case of a patient with acute aortic dissection (Daily, type A), an unexpected sudden reduction of perfusion of the right carotid artery could easily be detected with the help of two instruments INVOS 3100A. The decrease in the saturation values from 74% to 54% correlated well with the drop of blood pressure in the right radial artery. Clamping of the aorta with interruption of the blood flow into the innominate artery through the false lumen was the reason for the low cerebral perfusion. After repositioning the aortic clamp NIRS in combination with invasive blood pressure monitoring sufficiently allowed to control the further course of cerebral perfusion. The NIRS is a non-invasive, easy to handle, and easy to interpret method for intraoperative monitoring of the neurological status. Therefore in our opinion it has got some relevant advantages in contrast to other neuromonitoring methods in aortic arch surgery.","2032":"Nowadays spinal cord anesthesia is, when indicated, a standardized and acknowledged medical procedure with a low complication rate. This is also true of neurological after-effects, like spinal paralysis, which are greatly feared, especially by medical laymen. In the following case report we describe a charge against anesthesiologists, who were accused of causing a conus-cauda syndrome after spinal cord anesthesia. Neurological examinations led to the diagnosis of an anesthesia-independent Tethered-Cord-Syndrome (TCS). In most cases the patients' fear can be alleviated by clear explanations about the method. The indication for the method of anesthesia is also based on a thorough body examination. If the documentation of the treatment is faulty or incomplete it can be used against the physician facing a lawsuit more easily.

Because these tests are not always suitable for routine use in a busy preadmission test center we evaluated an observer-based rating set for the diagnosis of depression and anxiety. 70 patients of a university hospital preadmission test center were tested with the HADS-D-Test and the observer-based rating set after approval of the institutional review board and written informed consent. Test-data were compared using a logistic regression model and demographic variables were analyzed using t-Test. ANOVA and Pearson correlation. The prevalence of depression in our study population was 11.11% (14.75% in male, 9.76% in female) and the prevalence of anxiety was 7.14% (6.9% in male and 7.32% in female). The correlation between the observer-based rating items and the HADS-D-diagnosis was statistically highly significant. The observer based items \"unsteady eye movements\" and \"general worrisome mood\" proved to be especially sensitive for anxiety and the items \"sorrowful mood\" and \"impression of resignation\" were sensitive for depression without any influence of the experience of the anesthesiologist. A higher prevalence of depression and anxiety was found in patients with ASA-class III compared to those with ASA-classes I and II while age and type of surgery had no significant influence. Based on our observations depression and anxiety are a relevant factor of preoperative morbidity assessment. Observer-based items are a reliable tool to detect those patients which might need special assistance and therapy in the perioperative period to reduce stress associated with high preexisting levels of depression and anxiety. ","2043":"\"Patient safety\" and \"errors in medicine\" are issues gaining more and more prominence in the eyes of the public. According to newer studies, errors in medicine are among the ten major causes of death in association with the whole area of health care. A new era has begun incorporating attention to a \"systems\" approach to deal with errors and their causes in the health system. In other high-risk domains with a high demand for safety (such as the nuclear power industry and aviation) many strategies to enhance safety have been established. It is time to study these strategies, to adapt them if necessary and apply them to the field of medicine. These strategies include: to teach people how errors evolve in complex working domains and how types of errors are classified; the introduction of critical incident reporting systems that are free of negative consequences for the reporters; the promotion of continuous medical education; and the development of generic problem-solving skills incorporating the extensive use of realistic simulators wherever possible. Interestingly, the field of anesthesiology--within which realistic simulators were developed--is referred to as a model for the new patient safety movement. Despite this proud track record in recent times though, there is still much to be done even in the field of anesthesiology. Overall though, the most important strategy towards a long-term improvement in patient safety will be a change of \"culture\" throughout the entire health care system. The \"culture of blame\" focused on individuals should be replaced by a \"safety culture\", that sees errors and critical incidents as a problem of the whole organization. The acceptance of human fallability and an open-minded non-punitive analysis of errors in the sense of a \"preventive and proactive safety culture\" should lead to solutions at the systemic level. This change in culture can only be achieved with a strong commitment from the highest levels of an organization. Patient safety must have the highest priority in the goals of the institution: \"Primum nihil nocere\"--\"First, do not harm\".","2044":"","2045":"","2046":"Complex regional pain syndromes (formerly sympathetically maintained pain syndromes or reflex sympathetic dystrophy) encompass symptoms of pain, dysfunction and sympathetic disorder. They occur spontaneously or after peripheral or internal lesions (e.g. stroke or myocardial infarction) and predominantly affect the limbs, rarely the face or the trunk. This case report describes a 64-year old man who after a stroke suffered from heavy burning pain in the penis and perineum, which did not ameliorate after established conservative therapy. Sympathetic blockade, however, provided pain relief. The diagnosis of a complex regional pain syndrome, type I, was proposed according to the clinical symptoms in this patient, e.g. causalgia-like burning pain, allodynia, and the temporal association of an internal lesion to the onset of the pain. Other diagnoses such as neuropathic pain of unknown or diabetic etiology or a central post-stroke pain were considered.","2047":"The fulminant pulmonary embolism is one of the most feared complications of hospitalized patients. A high percentage of those patients need resuscitation within a short period of time. In such cases, the thrombolysis is a quickly attained therapeutical alternative to pulmonary embolectomy. A 77-year-old man with a surgically managed femoral fracture who suffered a massive pulmonary embolism, had to be resuscitated on the 11th postoperative day. Because of the fast confirmation of the diagnosis with the ECG and transthoracical echocardiography, it was possible to initiate thrombolysis with a bolus of 100 mg rt-PA immediately after the beginning of cardiac arrest and resuscitation. After 20 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), the patient could be stabilized under high dosage of catecholamines. The patient survived after prolonged intensive care treatment without severe bleeding complications, neither did he present any neurological deficit. We conclude that in the case of massive pulmonary embolism with small chance of resuscitation, the high-dose bolus injection of rt-PA could enrich the therapeutical possibilities.","2048":"","2049":"","2050":"","2051":"","2052":"Droperidol and dimenhydrinate are inexpensive antiemetic drugs. Droperidol, especially, has been studied extensively in the past, but there are no studies that used the combination of both drugs for prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Thus, the aim of this randomised controlled and double-blinded study was to evaluate the antiemetic efficacy and the side effects of such a combination therapy. 240 inpatients undergoing ENT surgery under general anaesthesia were randomised to receive one of four antiemetic regimes: placebo, dimenhydrinate (1 mg x kg-1), droperidol (15 micrograms x kg-1), or the combination of both drugs (droperidol 15 micrograms x kg-1 + dimenhydrinate 1 mg x kg-1) was administered after induction of anaesthesia and repeated 6 hours after the first administration. For general anaesthesia a standardised technique including benzodiazepine premedication, propofol, desflurane in N2O\/O2, vecuronium, and a continuous infusion of remifentanil was used. Postoperative analgesia and antiemetic rescue medication were standardised. Episodes of vomiting, retching, nausea, and the need for additional antiemetics were recorded for 24 hours. The main goal of the study was to increase the number of patients who were completely free from PONV (chi 2-test with Fisher-Yates' correction). Furthermore, the severity of PONV was analysed using a standardised scoring algorithm. Data of 227 patients could be analysed. The incidence of patients who suffered from PONV was 41.3% (95%-confidence interval: 29-55%) in the placebo-group. Dimenhydrinate alone reduced PONV to 34.5% (95%-CI: 22-48%). This marginal effect and the effect of droperidol (PONV: 26.4% (95%-CI: 15-40%)) could not be proven statistically, since the power of the study was too small. The combination of both drugs decreased PONV to 19.6% (95%-CI: 10-32%) and also reduced the severity of the symptoms to a clinically acceptable level. Dimenhydrinate failed to reduce the incidence and severity of PONV. The efficiency of droperidol given alone was within the ranges previously known from metaanalytic data. The combination of both drugs showed a moderate synergistic effect. ","2053":"The question whether to resuscitate or not belongs to the most controversial issues of medical ethics.

The central point of the paper is the question of futile treatment and the question of the normative structures which are present in German discussion.","2054":"Nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to be involved in the generation and processing of pain signals. Most experimental studies on animals and also the few observations in humans point to an involvement of the NO-system in inflammatory pain, whereas acute pain and chronic pain without inflammatory component seem to be independent of NO. It is yet unknown whether specific inhibition of the NO pathway is useful for treatment or prevention of inflammatory pain in humans.","2055":"For more than 100 years scientists have studied the sympathetic nervous system and its cardiovascular control mechanisms. Muscle sympathetic activity is the most important direct and rapidly responding variable for evaluation of sympathetic neural outflow. Therefore, anesthesiologists have been interested in the effects of anesthetics on muscle sympathetic activity at rest and during cardiovascular challenges. This review summarizes effects of positive pressure ventilation, intravenous and inhalational anesthetics as well as nitrous oxide on sympathetic muscle outflow. The least depression of both resting sympathetic outflow and its response to challenges is observed following administration of etomidate, ketamine, or a combination of low dose isoflurane\/nitrous oxide and opioids. Thus, these anesthetics can be recommended for anesthesia in patients with already activated sympathetic outflow to maintain arterial blood pressure.","2056":"","2057":"","2058":"Amnotic fluid embolism is an incompletely understood obstetric emergency presenting with the acute onset of hypoxia, hypotension and severe coagulopathy.

We have compared in a prospective, randomized, double-blind study, the analgesic effects and side effects of ropivacaine 0.2% (Group 1) with bupivacaine 0.125% plus 0.5 microgram ml-1 sufentanil (Group 2) via a thoracic epidural catheter during the first 24 hours after major abdominal surgery in 28 gynaecological tumour patients. Assessments were performed 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 hours after surgery. No differences were seen in duration of surgery, intraoperative opioid and supplemental analgesic requirements. As a main result VAS values for pain during mobilisation were higher in Group 1 when compared with Group 2 (p &lt; 0.01) after 20 and 24 hours of continuous epidural infusion (10 ml h-1) whereas VAS values at rest were comparable (p &lt; 0.1) at all measurepoints. Intensity of motor block and side effects did not differ between groups. The present study shows that continuous epidural infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine alone provides comparable analgesia at rest, but less profound pain relief during mobilisation within the first 24 hours after major abdominal surgery than bupivacaine 0.125% with sufentanil. ","2062":"The ProSeal-LMA is a modification of the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) invented by AIJ Brain. It differs from the known models in three major respects: An additional lumen extending into the tip of the cuff allows insertion of a gastric tube. A pocket immediately behind the cuff accommodates a finger or a siliconated metal introducer and thus facilitates insertion. An additional cuff at the dorsal aspect of the mask pushes the mask into a ventral direction and thus improves the seal around the glottic opening. Our experience after 8 months of clinical use and first data from an international multi-center-study (24 ProSeal-LMA\/24 Standard-LMA) are reported. With a ProSeal-LMA insertion of a gastric tube is much easier and more reliable than with a Standard-LMA (24\/24 patients vs. 2\/24 patients). Judged from visibility of the oesophagus during fibre-endoscopy the position of the ProSeal-LMA is superior to that of the Standard-LMA. Both are equally well tolerated and handled. Most remarkable is a better seal for the ProSeal-LMA (pressure for a leak of 3 L\/min: 31 mbar compared to 20 mbar (mean) for the Standard-LMA). Therefore the ProSeal-LMA seems suitable for anaesthesia procedures with IPPV, which up to now are a domain of endotracheal intubation.","2063":"Several studies have addressed the cardiovascular effects of intraperitoneal carbon dioxide insufflation and increased intraabdominal pressure. The pathophysiology of this intervention is complex. Reported results apparently differ depending on which patients are studied and are affected by blood volume and\/or positioning. With the Starling resistor concept of abdominal venous return in which, analogous to pulmonary vascular zones, flow through the inferior vena cava is considered a function of the pressure difference between upstream venous and either abdominal pressure or downstream intrathoracic caval vein pressure, different results reported in literature can be reconciled.","2064":"Therapy of prolonged acute renal failure regularly requires a renal replacement therapy. This can be achieved by different extracorporal renal replacement therapies (ERRT) or by peritoneal dialysis. ERRT are classified according to the physical principle underlying toxin elimination as hemodialysis (diffusion) and hemofiltration (convection). Another classification refers to intermittent or continuous application modes. Biocompatibility of membranes is judged according to their activation of the complement system. Prospective randomized studies did not consolidate the assumptions about the benefit of particular modalities proposed on theoretical foundations. Mortality, duration and complication rates of acute renal failure are not significantly decreased by use of biocompatible membranes. Continuous modalities are not generally preferable but optimize treatment in hemodynamically unstable patients, in whom they endorse fluid balancing and maintenance of sufficient arterial blood pressure. The use of demanding hemofiltration techniques for cytokine removal should be limited to clinical studies. The effects of ERRT-\"intensity\" and the best timing for initiation of ERRT have not been evaluated sufficiently. The choice of the ERRT modality is subject to clinical judgement (criterion: hemodynamic situation), practical aspects (criteria: availability of equipment and handling experience), and costs. Prior to their general use new and expensive technical modalities and membrane types should be thoroughly evaluated in studies with regard to outcome-related aspects such as patient survival and preservation of renal function.","2065":"","2066":"","2067":"We report on a 62 year old female patient treated with paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, because of an anxiety neurosis undergoing a vaginal hysterectomy in general anesthesia.

At the end of the anesthesia an A-V nodal tachycardia appeared which spontaneously changed to a sinus rhythm ten hours after the end of the operation. No clinical or laboratory findings indicated a cardiac ischemia and an additional Holter ECG-Recording showed no further cardiac arrhythmias. No other complications occurred afterwards and the patient was discharged after two weeks.

This could lead to serious complications in patients suffering from heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia type II (HIT II). Lepirudin is an approved anticoagulant in HIT II-patients. We studied to what extent lepirudin is washed out during the preparation of retransfusion blood, when it is used as anticoagulant for the autotransfusion device cell saver 5. We investigated four different concentrations of lepirudin solutions, 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg and 30 mg per litre normal saline. In order to imitate a clinical situation, each lepirudin solution was mixed with human blood in a 1:5-ratio and put into the reservoir of the cell saver. The device was started in the automatic mode using 1000 ml saline as washing solution. Several runs were carried out (five times using the 5 mg\/l solution, ten times the 10 mg\/l, eleven times the 20 mg\/l and eleven times the 30 mg\/l solution). The lepirudin concentration in the prepared retransfusion blood was measured. The median percentage reduction of the lepirudin content from the reservoir blood to the retransfusion blood was 100% for the 5 mg\/l, 90.4% for the 10 mg\/l, 94.3% for the 20 mg\/l and 86.3% for the 30 mg\/l solution. The differences of percentage reduction are not significant. But the different lepirudin concentrations in the anticoagulant solution have a significant influence on the lepirudin concentration in the retransfusion blood. The lepirudin concentration (median) in the retransfusion blood was 0.00 microgram\/ml for the 5 mg\/l, 0.16 microgram\/ml for the 10 mg\/l, 0.19 microgram\/ml for the 20 mg\/l and 0.66 microgram\/l for the 30 mg\/l lepirudin solution. Lepirudin as an anticoagulant for intraoperative autotransfusion is effectively eliminated using the cell saver 5 device in the automatic mode with 1000 ml saline as washing solution. A clinically relevant disturbance of coagulation is not to be expected, even if the highest concentration of lepirudin anticoagulant solution investigated in this study is used.

They are not allowed in all federal states of Germany and only a few bases provide this service. The advantage of short transportation times by air cannot be achieved at night due to a flight preparation phase of at least 30 minutes until lift-off.

The most important changes compared to previous recommendations from either the European Resuscitation Council or the American Heart Association are presented and commented upon.","2077":"The serine-protease-inhibitor antithrombin III (AT III) has often been recommended for the therapy of septic patients as it provides anticoagulant and antiinflammatory actions. In animal studies the prophylactic treatment with AT III in a dose &gt; 250 U\/kg prevented the development of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and vital organ dysfunction during sepsis and lowered the mortality rate. In clinical studies with septic patients therapy usually was started several hours after the start of the disease in dosages much lower than those used in animal studies. In these patients AT III-therapy improved laboratory changes of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy but was unable to lower the mortality rate. Hereditary AT III deficiency, lack of heparin effect due to low AT III levels, disseminated intravascular coagulation disorders are indications for the use of AT III while beneficial effects of AT III in patients suffering from SIRS, sepsis or septic shock have not yet been demonstrated.","2078":"Acute renal failure is the common result of various damaging mechanisms. Prophylaxis and differentiated therapy of acute renal failure are of outmost importance in anaesthesiology and intensive care medicine. The efficiency of pharmacotherapy is narrowly limited. Diuretics increase the urine output, but they do neither ameliorate the clinical course of the patient nor the prognosis of established acute renal failure. Dopamine and natriuretic peptides have no use in prevention and treatment of acute renal failure. Calcium-channel-blockers are valuable in cadaveric kidney transplantation. Osmodiuretics prevent intratubular precipitation of hemoglobin and myoglobin crystals; they also have some value in cadaveric kidney transplantation. Experimental studies investigated the possibility to enhance the regeneration of the tubular epithelial cell. Whereas in vitro studies and studies in animal models using various growth factors yielded promising results, these could not be reproduced in patients with acute renal failure. The physiology of NO in the kidney is incompletely understood. Actual progress is made in the understanding of lipid peroxidation and potential pharmacological implications.

Therefore, it is of particular interest for the choice of a catecholamine as to what extent CO is increased in relation to oxygen demand (VO2), because the tissue's oxygen balance is improved only if CO and thus oxygen delivery increases more than oxygen demand. For this purpose we reviewed the literature and analysed the relation between CO and VO2 during physiological as well as during pathological conditions. In particular, we compared the slopes of the regression lines of the individual CO\/VO2-relation for each catecholamine. Dependent on study conditions, the extent of the increases in CO and VO2 varies substantially already for one and the same agent. During physiological conditions, the synthetic agents dobutamine and dopexamine primarily increase CO, whereas the endogenous ones epinephrine and particularly norepinephrine increase both CO and VO2 to about the same extent. During pathological conditions the literature is inconsistent, but it appears that the CO\/VO2-relations do not differ substantially from those observed under physiological conditions. With due caution the current information implies that the synthetic catecholamines dobutamine and in particular dopexamine might be preferred in the treatment of low cardiac output states because they increase CO and thus oxygen delivery above the increase in metabolic demand.","2094":"The transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) are known to affect humans and various animals. The bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and the human Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD) are among the most notable degenerative disorders caused by prions. Considering the BSE epidemic and the description of a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (nvCJD), which is probably related to bovine spongiform encephalopathy, TSE have recently gained a lot of public attention. Although the causative factors (prions, viruses) are still under discussion, none of the present concepts are explanatory for all aspects of the human CJD. CJD may present as a sporadic, genetic, or infectious illness and there is now considerable concern that bovine prions may have been passed to humans. To exclude transmission of CJD via medical products and instruments, the effectiveness of cleaning, disinfection and sterilization procedures must be firmly established.

Preconditions for this method are cardiopulmonary bypass-techniques which allow a cardioplegic cardiac arrest with closed chest and extensive hemodynamic monitoring which enables the anesthesiologist to make exact diagnoses without having a direct view on the heart.

A characteristic sign for this disease are multiple cobblestone-like protrusions in the trachea and bronchus which are caused by calcifications, chondrifications and ossifications of the upper layer of the mucous membrane. We report on a 81-year old patient who was diagnosed with the disease while undergoing a fiberoptic bronchoscopy during a prolonged weaning phase. In the beginning we discussed the possibility of a neoplasia or a chronic inflammatory process as differential diagnosis and based on that we considered a dilatative tracheotomy for the weaning period. After histological confirmation of a TO we refrained from the measure, the reason being that in our opinion the patient would not profit from it. To reach a correct diagnosis a good interdisciplinarian cooperation is essential. The patient was successfully extubated on the 11th post-operative day after a patient conventional weaning which was supported by accompanying symptomatic measures.

Although measures for assuring the quality of care are established, there are up to now no investigations about the effectiveness of the psychiatric programs which are used in the German Emergency Physicians' Basic Training Program (EPTP-B, \"Fachkundenachweis Rettungsdienst\"). Herewith a first evaluation of a training program for psychiatric emergencies is presented. Participants of the EPTP-B in Hamburg were imparted defined contents to achieve the educational objective. Before and afterwards two semi-structured questionnaires had to be answered asking for previous knowledge, attitudes, educational success and necessity for further training. At the beginning of the course 42 medical doctors (m\/f: 22\/20, mean age: 32.2 +\/- 4.6 years) estimated their knowledge as poor and the necessity for training as high. At the end, the majority rated the program as educative, informative (69%) and practical (81%). However, the training was judged to be too short (81%) and the participants still felt too distant from the educational objective. There are necessity, demand and interest for an intensified psychiatric education of emergency physicians who are confronted with a high number and variety of psychic disturbances. On-the-job training of the theoretical matters is essential. ","2101":"It is a matter of dispute whether etomidate exhibits an epileptogenic action. It is also disputed whether frequently observed myocloni induced by etomidate are related to seizure-like activity in the EEG. The clinical effects of anaesthetic agents reflect their molecular action. A possible epileptogenic action of etomidate should, therefore, result from action on a molecular target that has yet to be identified. Suppression of Kv1.1 channels may be associated with epilepsy in men. Inhibition of Kv1.1 channels by etomidate at clinically relevant concentrations would, thus, argue in favour of an epileptogenic action of etomidate. Patch-clamp recordings of the pharmacological action of etomidate on cloned and functionally expressed human Kv1.1 channels. Etomidate inhibits human Kv1.1 channels in a concentration-dependent and reversible manner. The IC50-value is 400 microM, the Hill-coefficient is 2. The ratio of free clinical plasma concentrations and the IC50-value is 0.006. At plasma concentrations determined in a clinical setting Kv1.1 channels would be suppressed by less than 0.01%. The small effect of etomidate on human Kv1.1 channels at these concentrations questions an epileptogenic action of etomidate caused by inhibition of Kv1.1 channels.

After the operation the patient was submitted to the ICU. She developed a severe multiple organ failure within 12 hours. Recovery took 54 days.

On the other hand withholding a drug that is otherwise indicated may carry as many risks as giving an overdose or failure to treat at the appropriate time. In addition drug therapy may affect the child indirectly, for example by reducing placental function. During general anaesthesia, the interval between induction and cutting the umbilical cord determines the degree of drug load for the child. The interval should ideally be between 3-15 minutes. In addition the effect of drugs on the fetus depends on many additional factors such as gestational age, plasma binding of the drug and amount of fat.","2105":"In the community hospital of Konstanz, spinal block is the standard method of anaesthesia for caesarean section.

For particular discussion is the use of epidural catheter in delivery, with respect to availability, optimal timing and obtaining informed consent and it's documentation, as well as teamwork and clear interdisciplinary decisions concerning frequency and parameters of monitoring for epidural catheter anaesthesia following the motto: \"how much is necessary, how little is possible?\"","2108":"The anaesthetist would ideally like the following to be observed in a timely order in the antenatal phase: 1. early provision of information to the patient regarding epidural catheter for pain relief in labour, 2. informing the anaesthetist about relevant points in the patient history and examination findings, 3. knowledge of the contraindications to lumbar regional anaesthesia, 4. clear information as to the urgency of a caesarian section, 5. provision of aspiration prophylaxis. In the intrapartum phase it is necessary through clear communication to agree early on: 1. monitoring instructions for epidurals in the delivery room, 2. instructions for epidural top ups, 3. whether the presence of relatives in theatre in the case of a caesarian section is appropriate.

This includes working in close proximity, regular joint consultations and early preinterventional contact with the pregnant patient in order to inform them of the anaesthetic options and their inherent risks.

The survival rate was 55% in ECMO patients and 61% in non-ECMO patients. ECMO resulted in very few complications, one of them was fatal. No parameter before or during ECMO could be used to predict the individual prognosis. ECMO is a therapeutic option for patients with severe ARDS, likely to increase survival.

A repeated daily infusion of 835 ml of 6% HES solution (50 g HES 70\/0.5; Rheohes) during four hours on five consecutive days was performed. The analysis of the distribution of the molecular masses in serum and urine was performed by SEC-HPLC with MALLS\/RI detection. The in vivo average molecular weight (Mw) of HES was found to be 58,000 Da at the end of the infusion. This was lower than the Mw of 66,000 Da as measured initially in the HES solution. In the time following the infusion Mw increased steadily up to 64,000 Da because of renal elimination of low molecular HES. However, in the morning before the start of the next infusion of HES, the average molecular weight Mw of HES was even higher up to 71,000 Da. In the first collected portion of urine (i.e. up to 8 h after beginning the infusion) the average molecular weight of HES was as low as 17,000 Da. During the next hours (i.e. in the second collection period lasting from 8 up to 24 h after start of the HES infusion) Mw of HES increased up to 28,000 Da. The top fraction of the first period showed molecular masses of 27,000 Da, in the second collection period top fraction of molecular masses measured 40,000 Da. According to the presented data it is concluded that the renal threshold for medium substituted HES is independent of the initial Mw and related primarily to the molar substitution of the HES used. This renal threshold for medium substituted HES is determined to be at 40,000 Da. The in vivo Mw of HES is variable and related to the sampling time and predicted predominantly by the molar substitution of the HES used.

The highest contamination was found in the hand-washing area and on insufflation equipment (up to &gt; or = 100,000 cfu\/ml), where proof of the potential pathogens Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Alcaligenes spp. was found. The second highest contamination level was found on the sphygmomanometer cuffs, stethoscopes, and respirator masks (e.g., Enterococci and S. aureus were identified).

The predominant hygienic deficiensies were found in the equipment of the handwashing areas, and in the storage of resuscitation equipment and sterile materials. Based on the results of hygienic microbiological analysis, the main focus of hygienic measures--besides hand disinfection--should be on spray disinfection of the sphygmomanometer cuffs and stethoscopes as well as disinfection of ambulance equipment and storage areas for sterile devices, supplemented by dust protection of ready-to-use materials and devices. Stationary dispensers for hand disinfection possessing at least midlength levers must become the standard in ambulances, and conventional handwashing basins with plastic drinking-water containers and pump must be eliminated entirely.

The clinical characteristics, pathophysiological changes, diagnostics and management of anaesthesia for patients with hereditary angioedema will be discussed. Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder, which is caused by congenital deficiency of functional C1-inhibitor (C1-INH). Patients are suffering from episodic and painless edema of the skin (face and limbs) and mucous membranes of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts (the latter causing abdominal cramps due to edema of the intestine). Life-threatening airway obstruction may occur when patients develop laryngeal edema. It is important to differentiate HAE from the more frequent allergic angioedema because of differences in the pharmacological treatment of acute attacks of HAE. C1-INH-concentrate is effective in both treatment of acute attacks and prevention of edema, especially in children, juveniles and young women.","2118":"We report the successful use of the intubating laryngeal mask airway for rescue and intubation in an anaesthetised patient with an unexpectedly large epiglottic cyst.

During the period of 1996-1999, 8 cases of invasive candidosis were observed on a surgical intensive care unit. Patient records were evaluated with respect to diagnostic criteria and response to antimycotic therapy. Patients included 3 women and 5 men with a mean age of 62.7 (37-85) years. Candida peritonitis (n = 6) occurred after surgery or perforation of the intestinal tract, and Candida pneumonia was due to artificial ventilation (n = 3). C. albicans was isolated in all 8 cases, but mixed infections with other Candida spp. occurred in 3 cases. The Candida serum antigen test yielded a positive result in only 2\/8 cases. I.v. therapy with fluconazole was successful in 7 cases, one patient with severe initial disease died with ongoing infection. With the exception of the lethal case, all patients showed a diagnostic serum antibody test, proving systemic candida infection. Based on the case descriptions, we propose the following definition of invasive candidosis: (1) Clinical signs of infection after surgery, (2) absence of bacterial pathogens and\/or failure to respond to systemic antibiotics, (3) cultivation of Candida spp. from normally sterile sites or abundant growth in tracheal aspirate, (4) response to antimycotic therapy and (5) diagnostic serum antibody test. This definition proved to be valid for our patients and could be used as an inclusion criterion for future clinical studies of serodiagnosis of Candida infection or antimycotic chemotherapy. ","2127":"Positron emission tomography studies on volunteers showed that, at concentrations inducing the loss of consciousness, propofol, halothane and isoflurane reduce glucose metabolism of neocortical neurones by 20-50%. To find out whether these effects are caused by direct anaesthetic actions on cortical structures, experiments were carried out on isolated neocortical brain slices. In these investigations an excellent correlation was observed between anaesthetic concentrations causing a half-maximal depression of action potential firing in neocortical brain slices and anaesthetic blood concentrations monitored during awaking from anaesthesia in humans. Furthermore, it could be shown that, at concentrations approximately one half the MAC-value, isoflurane decreases the frequency of auditory evoked 30-40 Hz oscillations in the neocortex by 50%. Similar quantitative effects were observed on spontaneously occurring high frequency rhythms in neocortical brain slices. However, not all aspects of cerebral anaesthetic actions can be explained by direct effects on cortical neurones. The EEG synchronisation and the amplitude reduction of mid latency auditory evoked potentials are probably related to the inhibition of thalamic neurones. Halothane, isoflurane, enflurane and propofol reduced action potential firing of cortical neurones by enhancing GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic inhibition. This molecular mechanism seems also to be involved in depressing painful stimuli-induced motor responses. Nevertheless, there must be a difference between relevant anaesthetic mechanisms on the cerebral and spinal level. This follows from the observation that the relation between the concentration causing the loss of consciousness and the concentration that depresses movements considerably varies among different anaesthetic agents.","2128":"","2129":"","2130":"Pulmonary edema following acute or chronic upper airway obstruction is a threatening complication. A case is presented in which a 15 year old boy developed a massive pulmonary edema after a acute endotracheal tube obstruction during emergence from anesthesia. Leading pathophysiologic cause for the formation of the edema is a markedly negative intrapleural pressure due to the forceful inspiration against the obstructed airway. Treatment modalities include the instantaneous solution of the obstruction, a rapid reoxigenation and the ventilation with PEEP or CPAP. Sound knowledge of the disease increases the vigilance of the caring anaesthesiologist and helps to identify patients at risk. Preventing measures may further reduce the risk of occurrence of the postobstructive pulmonary edema.","2131":"In the literature the incidence of cardiac involvement in blunt chest trauma varies considerably.

Two observers blinded to each others findings scored the fibreoptic position as follows: 4, only vocal cords visible; 3, vocal cords plus posterior epiglottis visible; 2, vocal cords plus anterior epiglottis visible; 1, vocal cords not seen. Interobserver reliability was examined using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Interobserver reliability was graded as excellent for the LMA (ICC = 0.89), FLMA (ICC = 0.87) and ILM (ICC = 0.79). Fibreoptic scores were higher for the LMA and FLMA compared with the ILM (both p &lt; 0.001).

We compared remifentanil and sufentanil as part of a TIVA for retinal surgery with respect to the endocrine stress responses and haemodynamic reactions. After ethics committee approval and informed consent, 22 patients (ASA I-III) scheduled for retinal surgery were included in this patient-blind, randomized, prospective parallel-group study and allocated to one of the two groups receiving TIVA with propofol (4 mg\/kg\/h) and remifentanil (R-group) 0.25 microgram\/kg\/min, or sufentanil (S-group) 1 microgram\/kg before surgery with dosage adjustments according to haemodynamic parameters. Prolactin, growth hormone, cortisol, epinephrine and norepinephrine were measured 60 min before anaesthesia, 30 min after start of surgery and 30 min after extubation. (Significance level: P &lt; 0.05) Only prolactin increased significantly in both groups during the surgical procedure, the S-group showing a greater increase than the R-group. Cortisol and norepinephrine concentrations decreased during surgery in both groups significantly. Growth hormone and epinephrine concentrations only decreased in the S-group during operation while there was no significant change in the R-group. The blood pressure dropped by about 30% in both groups intraoperatively while there was a tendency towards lower heart rates in the R-group with 58\/min vs. 64\/min in the S-group (mean). The increase of prolactin concentrations could be interpreted as a result of the stimulation of mu 1-receptors.

","2141":"Sufficient therapy of pain is essential for the treatment of tumor patients. World Health Organisation (WHO)-guidelines recommend a combination of opioids with non-opioid-analgesics (NOA) for patients with medium to strong pain. Cancer pain is often a combination of pain caused by the tumor itself, tumor associated and pain caused by therapy. Various substances act by different mechanisms and therefore combinations may demonstrate superior effects. Opioids (\"central analgesics\") inhibit neuronal transduction within the spinal cord, enhance inhibiting function of midbrain nuclei on ascending pain transduction and influence pain perception via modulation of the limbic system. NOAs (\"peripheral analgesics\") inhibit cyclooxygenase hindering activation of the peripheral nociceptor-system. There are 2 different classes of NOAs: 1) non-acidic, antipyretic analgesics like pyrazolones (metamizol) and anilin-derivates (paracetamol) and 2) non-steroidal antirheumatics (NSAR) like salicylates (acetylsalicylic acid), derivates of propionic acid (ibuprofen, naproxen), acetate acid (indomethacin, diclofenac), enolic acid (piroxicam, meloxicam) and anthranil acid (mefenamin). Adjuvant therapy is necessary to control common NSAR-side-effects like dyspepsia, ulcer and gastrointestinal bleeding. Due to its exceptional analgesic, antipyretic and spasmolytic properties, metamizol is an essential substance in tumor therapy. As agranulocytosis-incidence of 1:1,000,000 is low, good gastrointestinal and renal tolerance makes metamizol an excellent alternative to NSAR. There is scientific evidence that adequate combinations of non-opioids, opioids and adjuvant drugs, considering adverse side effects, were effective and safe in the treatment of cancer pain.","2142":"","2143":"","2144":"","2145":"We report on a patient who underwent dilatational tracheostomy (Ciaglia technique) because of ARDS. 29 days after the procedure she died of hemorrhage from an arrosion of the bracheocephalic trunk, caused by the cuff of the tracheal cannula.

On 203 days within the 19-month study period, 2488 patients were followed up for at least 24 hours postoperatively to determine the occurrence of PONV. For each day the actual incidence of PONV was compared with the mean predicted risk of PONV calculated with two risk scores for prediction of PONV (Koivuranta, 1997; Apfel, 1998). 32 days with the most significant difference between actual and predicted incidence of PONV were analysed retrospectively by two biometeorological experts, who were blind to the information whether each day was associated with a high or low incidence of PONV, evaluated the possible impact of the weather of these days. To analyse the influence of the cycle of the moon it was prospectively classified into four different phases. The two biometeorologists rated 22 out of the presented 32 days correctly. The likelihood p that this rating happened by chance is 0.0251, assuming that the likelihood for predicting each day correctly is 0.5 (independent Bernoulli-experiments, e.g. throwing a coin). However, days with a high or low incidence of PONV were equally distributed within the four phases of the moon (p = 0.97; chi 2-test with Yates' correction).

The patient inhales oxygen via a nose mask and exhales via mouthpiece. Nose mask and mouthpiece have built-in one-way valves, resulting in an unidirectional gas flow (nasal-oral). With approval of the local ethic committee, pre-oxygenation with both the NOS and a face mask (Laerdal) was studied in 50 adult patients. Midazolam 3.75-7.5 mg p.os was given for premedication. The NOS was studied in two different ways: the nose mask fastened by rubberband and with the nose mask held by hand. Prior to induction every patient received every system in a randomised manner. Semi-closed-anaesthetic circle-systems with a fresh-gas-flow of 10 litres\/min were used. The FEO2 over 5 min of pre-oxygenation were recorded (AS-3, Datex). Speed and degree of the denitrogenization was documented by an external digital data-acquisition system. Practicability of the systems regarding the anaesthesists (n = 27) and patient comfort were evaluated by means of a standardized postoperative questionnaire. The hand-held NOS is definitely more effective and reliable than both the NOS fastened by rubber-band and the classical face mask: 80% of the hand-held NOS were able to achieve a FEO2 of &gt; or = 0.8 compared to only 36% of the NOS fixed by rubber-band, face mask: 48%. FEO2 of &gt; or = 0.8 was achieved with 52% of the hand-held NOS in 90 s, a time we consider practical for daily routine, whereas only 10% of the NOS fixed by rubberband and 14% of the face masks accomplished this threshold. A cooperative patient is an important condition when using the NOS: a strong premedication effect, absence of dentures, and patients who can not inspire via nose and expire via mouth involve impairment of the positive effects of the NOS. 21% of the anaesthesists felt disturbed by the NOS. 72% do not believe, that induction of anaesthesia will become more safe with the NOS. For 8 patients, breathing with the NOS was disagreeable (face-mask: 3 patients), 15 were disturbed by the nose part\/mouth piece (face-mask: no patient). An acceptable FEO2 of &gt; or = 0.8 can be achieved only without leakage of both the NOS and the face-mask. Therefore, routine FEO2-monitoring seems highly desirable. Efficiency of the hand-held NOS is much better than with the NOS fastened by rubberband or the face mask. However, even the hand-held NOS cannot guarantee for optimal denitrogenization. Practicability in daily use was poor, because a test of airway patency by manual ventilation prior to relaxation\/intubation is not possible with the NOS.

One hundred male and one hundred female paralysed, anaesthetised patients were studied. The number of insertion attempts and time to placement were recorded. OLP and fibreoptic score (FOS) were measured during inflation of the cuff from 0-40 ml in 10 ml increments. There were no failed insertions. Insertion times were similar for males and females. There were no differences in OLP or FOS between males and females at any cuff volume.

Characteristic clinical symptoms of asthma are bronchial hyperreactivity, reversible airway obstruction, wheezing and dyspnea. Asthma presents a major public health problem with increasing prevalence rates and severity worldwide. Despite major advances in our understanding of the clinical management of asthmatic patients, it remains a challenging population for anesthesiologists in clinical practice. The anesthesiologist's responsibility starts with the preoperative assessment and evaluation of the pulmonary function. For patients with asthma who currently have no symptoms, the risk of perioperative respiratory complications is extremely low. Therefore, pulmonary function should be optimized preoperatively and airway obstruction should be controlled by using steroids and bronchodilators. Preoperative spirometry is a simple means of assessing presence and severity of airway obstruction as well as the degree of reversibility in response to bronchodilator therapy. An increase of 15% in FEV1 is considered clinically significant. Most asymptomatic persons with asthma can safely undergo general anesthesia with and without endotracheal intubation. Volatile anesthetics are still recommended for general anesthetic techniques. As compared to barbiturates and even ketamine, propofol is considered to be the agent of choice for induction of anesthesia in asthmatics. The use of regional anesthesia does not reduce perioperative respiratory complications in asymptomatic asthmatics, whereas it is advantageous in symptomatic patients. Pregnant asthmatic and parturients undergoing anesthesia are at increased risk, especially if regional anesthetic techniques are not suitable and prostaglandin and its derivates are administered for abortion or operative delivery. Bronchial hyperreactivity associated with asthma is an important risk factor of perioperative bronchospasm. The occurrence of this potentially life-threatening condition in anesthesia practice varies from 0.17 to 4.2%. The anesthesiologists' goal should be to minimize the risk of inciting bronchospasm and to avoid triggering stimuli. As increases in airway resistance are noticed, therapy should be directed towards optimizing oxygenation and proper diagnosis needs to be established. With deepening anesthesia level and aggressive pharmacological management utilizing both, beta-agonists and steroids, respiratory failure may be properly controlled.","2171":"","2172":"","2173":"This is a case report involving a 71 year old man with generalized tetanus.

The most common causes of elevated intraabdominal pressure are abdominal operations, abdominal trauma, diffuse peritonitis, ascites and peritoneal edema following resuscitation. Excessively increased intraabdominal pressure may result in a total loss of function and may lead to death. Such a condition is called an abdominal compartment syndrome. It usually requires operative decompression. According to animal experiments and clinical experiences suggestions for treatment are given. Diagnostic suspicion of elevated intraabdominal pressure may be confirmed with objective measurements. Since bedside manometry using a Foley catheter provides a valuable estimate of intraabdominal pressure and is easy to perform, intraabdominal pressure values may contribute to medical decision making.

At some measuring points preload was higher in the mivazerol group, but there were no differences between the groups for measured (SaO2, SvO2, CO) and calculated (CI, SVR, PVR, VO2) cardiorespiratory parameters. The incidence of shivering, nausea and vomiting were similar in both groups. Continuous, perioperative administration of mivazerol decreased the heart rate and the plasma catecholamines in the early postoperative period, but did not affect blood pressure, body temperature and the incidence of shivering.

The revised German edition was based both on the guidelines issued by the American Heart Association (AHA) in 1992 and on those of the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) of 1998, as well as on those released by the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) in 1997. Due to the diverging instructions for action the emergency physicians felt considerably unsafe as to what they should really do to achieve maximum results. Only 10.3 per cent of the german emergency physicians followed the recommendations given by the German Federal Chamber of Physicians. Innovations in respect of the basic checkup concern the time for controlling the respiration and circulation (ten seconds). Contrary to the international recommendations the \"diagnostic block\" is performed in Germany without interspersing basic reanimation. In artificial respiration the tidal volume has been reduced to 600 ml in accordance to the ERC and ILCOR guidelines. The search for the pressure point for cardiac pressure massage has also been adapted to the international recommendations. Also in accordance with the international recommendations defibrillation in case of ventricular fibrillation is now being performed only thrice in series without interspersed basic reanimation. There is some uncertainty with regard to choosing the requisite energy: 16.6% of the emergency physicians opt for less than 200 joule in primary defibrillation whereas 13% are in favour of more than 200 joule. Contrary to the international recommendations which prescribe peripheral venous access as application site for reanimation by drugs, the german guidelines favour the endobronchial path, which is already being practised by 57.4% of the emergency physicians. Hence, emergency medication can be effected in Germany 4 minutes earlier than in other countries. After three unsuccessful applications of 1 mg each of adrenalin the dosage is increased to 5 mg, and in agreement with the AHA guidelines escalating doses are also possible. Sodium bicarbonate is recommended only after more than 20 minutes of reanimation and if so, only in a reduced dose of 0.5 mval\/kg body weight. In accordance with the international recommendations there is now a universal algorithm that decides on application only between ventricular fibrillation and nonfibrillation. The new german recommendations have adapted the reanimation procedure in agreement with ERC to national usage without abandoning any principles of the international guidelines.","2179":"For more than thirty years hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) has been an important and ultimate therapeutic tool in special indications. Hyperbaric oxygen improves tissue oxygenation, stimulates important mechanisms in wound healing and exerts beneficial effects on other biochemical and cellular processes. The properties of hyperbaric oxygen have built the rationale for its use as therapy of choice in patients with severe carbon monoxide poisoning, decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism, and as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of osteoradionecrosis, necrotizing fasciitis and compromised skin grafts and flaps. The efficacy of adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen in the treatment of lower extremity problem wounds in diabetic patients seems to be proven. There is little scientific support for other uses of hyperbaric oxygen and its therapeutical benefit should be further investigated. When used according to standard protocols hyperbaric oxygen treatment is a safe therapy with little adverse effects.","2180":"","2181":"The past few decades have seen a profound development in biological sciences. The great progress in molecular biology has provided an enormous potential of new instruments for highly specific and sensitive insights into the etiology and therapy of human disease. Among these first the prototype technique \"polymerase chain reaction\" (PCR) results in improved diagnostic procedures. The contributions of recombinant DNA technology in defining the molecular pathology of common disorders and of diagnostic molecular techniques for risk stratification are used as examples to reveal the clinical relevance of this innovative tool and its modifications. In addition, the potential use of modified nucleic acid fragments as a therapeutic drug (gene therapy) is mentioned.","2182":"Even when the guidelines for cancer pain management are followed, acute severe pain requiring immediate treatment will occur in some patients. Titration with intravenous morphine may provide fast and efficient pain relief and give an indication of the amount of opioid necessary for continuous treatment. In cooperation with a general practitioner we performed an intravenous morphine titration in a patient with severe cancer pain at home. Adequate analgesia was reached with 20 mg intravenous morphine. Blood pressure, cardiac frequency and oxygen saturation did not change. No side effects were reported during the titration, and the previous regimen with tramadol 150 mg per day was switched to slow release morphine 300 mg per day. This medication was prescribed by the general practitioner and provided good pain relief until the patient died two weeks later. We conclude that intravenous morphine titration may be performed even in cancer patients at home, adequate monitoring, however, should be available.","2183":"","2184":"","2185":"An alternative way to the usual mode of nasotracheal intubation is described. 50 patients had to be intubated nasotracheally for surgical procedures. After induction of anaesthesia and insertion of the laryngeal mask a fiberoptic bronchoscope was nasally inserted during sufficient breathing. After view of the laryngeal mask, it was taken out and a tube via fiberoptic bronchoscope was placed endotracheally. Way and avoidance of complications by this method are described.","2186":"This study investigates whether the site of abdominal surgery or the urine flow rate affects the accuracy of urinary bladder temperature monitoring. After approval by the local ethics committee we studied 7 patients during upper abdominal and 10 patients during lower abdominal surgery. Temperatures were recorded with a Hi-Lo Temp Esophageal-Stethoscope (Mallinckrodt Medical) and a Foley Catheter Temperature Sensor FC400-18 (Respiratory Support Products, Mallinckrodt Medical). Each probe and its recording unit were calibrated over a range of 30-40 degrees C against a reference quartz thermometer (Hewlett Packard Model 2801 A) in a water bath before the investigation. Urine flow rate was measured using a urometer. Temperatures and urine flow rate were recorded every 30 min. Agreement between the methods of measurement was assessed as described by Bland and Altman. 124 measuring points could be analyzed. Bladder temperature had a bias (B) of -0.06 degree C compared to oesophageal temperature. Limits of agreement (LOA; +\/- 2 s) were +\/- 0.68 degree C. In upper abdominal surgery (B: 0.02 degree C; LOA: +\/- 0.42 degree C) a higher precision of oesophageal temperature estimation could be demonstrated compared to lower abdominal surgery (B: -0.14 degree C; LOA: +\/- 0.82 degree C). Lower urine flow rates generally increased the limits of agreement. Regarding lower abdominal surgery the bias additionally increased to -0.22 degree C. Urinary bladder temperature recording is a clinically acceptable method to measure core temperature during abdominal surgery. The accuracy during lower abdominal surgery is decreased compared to upper abdominal surgery, especially in case of a urine flow rate below 250 ml\/h. ","2187":"The effects of the currently favoured preanaesthetic drugs (benzodiazepines, alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists) on the perioperative course are inadequately investigated for new ways of performing anaesthesia with recently introduced drugs (e.g. remifentanil). Therefore clonidine and midazolam were used for premedication in maxillo-facial surgery under total intravenous anesthesia, and the perioperative courses were analyzed. Thirty patients (ASA 1-2) were included in the present doubleblinded, prospective study. 60-90 minutes preoperatively these patients got an oral premedication with 5 micrograms kg-1 clonidine or 100 micrograms kg-1 midazolam. For anaesthesia a standardized procedure with propofol, remifentanil and rocuronium was performed. After induction of anaesthesia the infusion of remifentanil was regulated by using spectral edge frequency (target-SEF90, 10-13 Hz). The efficiency of the premedication as well as the emergence and recovery were assessed by using established standardized tests. The perioperative stress response was assessed by recording the effects on haemodynamic parameters (NIBP. heart rate. Holter-ECG). Referring to the effects of premedication (sedation, anxiety) there were no differences between the groups. The clonidine group required a lower remifentanil rate in keeping a steady-target-SEF90 (-24%). The time until emergence and recovery was not significantly different. Even the occurrence of PONV, VAS or the postoperative analgetic requirement did not differ between the two groups. However, the incidence of postoperative shivering was significantly higher in the midazolam group. Intraoperatively the values of MAP were quite equal between the groups. However, heart rate was significantly lower in the clonidine group. Postoperatively both MAP as well as heart rate were lower in the clonidine group. Furthermore, in the midazolam group there was a significantly higher cumulative duration of tachycardia (heart rate &gt; 100 min-1; following descripted as medium with 25% and 75%-percentage; clonidine: 29\/0\/563 sec.: midazolam: 1058\/232\/3171 sec.). After remifentanil supplemented anesthesia there is, especially in the postoperative period, a benefit in using clonidine compared to the premedication with midazolam.

Thus it is likely that anesthetists will see this patients with increasing frequency. This study describes our experiences in the anesthetic management of CF patients. We descriptively and retrospectively reviewed the records of all CF patients from 1981 until 1997 who underwent elective surgery in our department of ear, nose and throat and in whom general anesthesia was required. 199 anesthetics in 53 patients were reviewed. Premedication with midazolam (0.4 +\/- 0.07 mg\/kg) were given orally in 163 of the 199 anesthetics (82%). In 45 anesthetics the induction was performed by Inhalation with halothane (23%). Atropine (0.21 +\/- 0.11 mg\/kg) was used in 69 cases for induction. 57 pulmonary function tests were performed preoperatively mostly showing no severe abnormalities. We documented 10 perioperative respiratory complications (5%) in 199 procedures. No patient died at hospital.

However, clonidine has several useful effects that make the drug an interesting alternative to conventional premedicants. Thus, in this randomised, double-blind, and controlled study the anxiolytic effect of midazolam was compared to that of clonidine. Furthermore, effects on postoperative complaints and minor complications, and readiness for discharge were investigated. 100 ASA-1 patients undergoing wisdom teeth extraction on a day-case basis were included into the analysis. A further 50 patients who received no premedication served as a control group. General anaesthesia was standardised (propofol-fentanyl-isoflurane in N2O\/O2). The anxiolytic effect of the premedication was assessed using the Erlanger anxiety- and tension scale (EAS). The test was applied before and after intravenous premedication with 1.5 micrograms\/kg clonidine or 50 micrograms\/kg midazolam and repeated once postoperatively. During recovery the incidence and severity of pain, nausea and vomiting, and shivering were recorded. The readiness for discharge was assessed using standardised discharge criteria. The recording of data was completed by a telephone interview on the day after surgery. The demographic data of the groups did not differ. In the two treatment groups there was a time-dependent decrease of anxiety and tension. However, postoperatively there was no difference between the levels of anxiety and inner tension between the premedicated patients and the untreated control group. Furthermore there was no difference in the incidence and severity of any postoperative complications. Time until the patients were ready for discharge did not differ between the three groups. The effects of an intravenous premedication with 1.5 micrograms\/kg clonidine or 50 micrograms\/kg midazolam, respectively in young ASA-1 patients undergoing minor surgical procedures on a day-case basis are restricted to decrease of anxiety and inner tension before surgery. No beneficial effects were found during the postoperative period compared with untreated control patients. ","2196":"The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence of side-effects in patients bearing a high risk of post dural puncture headache (PDPH) when a spinal anaesthesia was performed. This included outpatients, patients for sectio caesarea and patients younger than 40 years who were mobilized as soon as the surgeon agreed. Quality control without randomization. Spinal anaesthesia for sectio caesarea was applied with a G27 Whitacre needle with the patient in the right lateral decubitus position. Hyperbaric Bupivacain 2-2.2 ml (10-12 mg) was injected when spontaneous flow of spinal fluid occurred through the needle. The preparations for the surgery then started immediately with the patient in a left lateral position. Intravenous Ephedrin (10-20 mg) was given simultaneously. All the other spinal anaesthesias were performed in a similar manner with the patient lying on the side of the scheduled surgery. For outpatients Articain was used instead of Bupivacain. In those outpatients older than 60 years a 26 G Quincke needle was used for spinal anaesthesia. Interviews: All in-hospital patients were visited once or more during the first 48 hours and asked about side-effects e.g. PDPH. Outpatients older than 60 years were interviewed by a telephone call on the third day after surgery. The younger ones were asked to send back a questionnaire free of charge. None of the 206 patients (mean age 30.7 years) who underwent caesarian sectio suffered from headache. Lower back pain was seldom [8] and moderate. They all had the bladder drained as a routine measure of the obstetrician. 547 of 600 in hospital patients were mobilized as soon as the block disappeared. 11 complained of headache. (1.8%) 2 females needed oral non-opioid analgesics, one 17-year-old woman an epidural blood patch (0.17%). 150 of the outpatients younger than 60 years sent back the questionnaire spontaneously. 75 had to be reminded by a telephone call. 10 of these 225 had PDPH but only 2 females needed oral non-opioids for one day. One 34-year-old woman needed conservative treatment with oral fluid intake more than 3 liters a day, analgesics and bed rest. None of the outpatients older than 60 years complained of headache. Two suffered from vomiting on the way home. Three males had disturbed bladder function, but did not need catheterism. The use of a thin pencil point needle (Whitacre G27) enables the application of a spinal anaesthesia to young people with a low risk of moderate PDPH. Pregnancy is not a contraindication. Early mobilisation does not increase the risk of PDPH even in young patients nor is this the case in outpatients. In outpatients older than 60 years a G26 Quinke needle, which is easier to handle and cheaper, is suitable for spinal anaesthesia without a risk of PDPH. Better post-operative vigilance may be a further benefit of the method. Young people especially appreciated the option to pursue their own video-endoscopic surgery. In a comparable group where an epidural was performed we found more side-effects. ","2197":"The aim of this investigation was to compare routine balanced anaesthesia with different inhalation agents to intravenous anaesthesia (IVA) using an Anaesthesia-Information-Management-System (AIMS) with regard to time of recovery from anaesthesia, the time of discharge from the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU) and postoperative nausea as well as postoperative therapy with analgesics. In 1997 and 1998 all relevant data of each anaesthesia procedure have been recorded using the online documentation Software NarkoData. These data sets have been stored into a relational database during each anaesthesia procedure. For evaluation the information has been exported from the database to a statistics program via 'Structured Query Langvage' (SOL). Balanced anaesthesia has been performed using isoflurane, halothane, and sevoflurane, respectively, supplemented with or without nitrous Oxide (N2O). The intravenous based anaesthesia-groups included propofol-fentanyl or propofol-remifentanil. The fastest recovery was seen in patients of the isoflurane group (11.2 +\/- 7.7 minutes), and the longest time for extubation was observed in patients wich halothane anaesthesia (12.8 +\/- 9.3 minutes); the overall mean difference was 1.7 minutes. The earliest patient admitted to the PACU had received sevoflurane (7.0 +\/- 6.3 minutes) and propofol-remifentanil (7.0 +\/- 7.4 minutes) whereas patients of the halothane group (9.5 +\/- 7.5 minutes) took more. The shortest stay in PACU was seen in patients of the sevoflurane and isoflurane groups (105.13 +\/- 35.7 and 108.4 +\/- 60.5 minutes), whereas propofol-remifentanil (126.2 +\/- 89.1 minutes) and halothan (120.0 +\/- 86.1 minutes) anaesthetised patients had the longest stay in PACU. No difference was noted in the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting nor in the amount of postoperatively given analgesics. Results achieved in routine correspond only in part to results from studies. In our investigation balanced anaesthesia with isoflurane and sevoflurane correspond with the shortest stay in PACU compared to balanced anaesthesia with halothane and IVAs with propofol-fentanyl or propofol-remifentanil. One reason for this could be the intraoperatively administered opioide piritramide in IVAs. Furthermore we conclude that an AIMS may provide additional information about overall costs-effectiveness. However this information depends largely on local factors, e.g. patient case mix, staffing, policy of discharge from the PACU etc. ","2198":"In the last years knowledge of the excretion of drugs into breast milk has increased significantly. But information concerning anesthetic and analgesic drugs seems to be dispersed and limited.

The necessity of anesthesia should never be a sufficient reason to quit breast-feeding. With the information given in this article the individual duration of breast-milk-free interval can be discussed. Thus it will be possible to anesthetize a breast-feeding mother with minimal risks for the child without giving up the advantages of mother milk. Through careful selection of appropriate drugs even elective operations don't need to be postponed and breastfeeding can be continued as soon as in the immediate postoperative period.","2199":"","2200":"The first surface hypothermia with cessation of the circulation in Europe has been performed in Duesseldorf on February 9, 1955 for the direct suture of an atrial septal defect. Risks and insufficient basic knowledge are mentioned and the procedure is described with a protocol of anesthesia, cooling in ice water and rewarming in a water mattress. Eighth weeks later, the first series of 7 patients with closure of an atrial septal defect were presented at the congress of the German Society of Surgery. One patient died on the 13th postoperative day due to a cerebral thrombosis, unrelated to hypothermia. After 4 years a pump oxygenator became available and hypothermia was reduced to about half of the open heart procedures for 5 years and decreased further. Until 1978 with more than 1800 hypothermias for open heart surgery and some aneurysms of the aorta and cerebral arteries without the aid of a pump oxygenator the largest series in the world could be attained. As most important success was regarded that in none of our patients with cessation of circulation, which was repeated up to three times, a lasting cerebral damage occurred.","2201":"Evaluation of hemodynamic effects of S-(+)-ketamine versus ketamine-racemic mixture during induction of anesthesia, during steady-state of a fentanyl-midazolam-anesthesia and in the period of aortic cross-clamping during extracorporeal circulation.  80 patients scheduled for coronary revascularization. double-blind, randomized.

STUDY 2: There were no significant hemodynamic changes with time or between the groups. STUDY 3: Significant arterial vasodilation was observed in the racemic mixture group, venous parameters remained unchanged. There were no major differences in the hemodynamic profiles of S-(+)-ketamine and the racemic mixture. S(+)-ketamine did not provide hemodynamic advantages.

","2202":"Investigation of various laboratory parameters in stored whole blood, with respect to duration of storage and kind of product. Whole blood was donated by 12 healthy volunteers using CPDA1 stabilisator. Six units were filtered with the Leukotrap A1-System (PALL Comp., Dreieich, Germany) for leukocyte depletion. The twelve units were stored for 49 days. Several hematological, biochemical and coagulatory parameters were analysed during storage. There was an adequate reduction of lycocytes by filtration (&lt; 3 x 10(6) white cells per unit). ATP decreased during storage to 45% of initial value at the 49th day, without any influence of the kind of preparation. The course of other parameters such as lactate and free haemoglobin (increase), PH-value (decrease), antithrombin III (decrease), prothrombin, protein C, thrombin-antithrombin-complex, alpha-2-Anti-plasmin (decrease or indifferent) did not show any influence of the kind of preparation. Coagulation factors V and VIII decreased in both preparations, which was significantly less pronounced in whole blood with leukocyte depletion. In contrast parameters of activated coagulation such as D-Dimere and fibrinmonomeric did not change during storage after leukocyte reduction but increased at the end of storage time in CPDA1-blood. Several parameters indicating quality of stored blood were constant in whole blood independent of the kind of preparation during a storage of 49 days. This is in contrast to the main part of specific scientific communications. A beneficial influence of leukocyte depletion was observed for some coagulation parameters whereas increasing characteristics of activated coagulation in CPDA1-stored whole blood at the end of storage time had to be observed. The preparation of whole CPDA1-blood is recommended for autologous predonation, if storage time does not exceed 30 days. Storage time of &gt; 40 days seems to be possible for autologous whole blood after filtration for leucocyte depletion. ","2203":"Emergency medicine is a symbol of the fight against sudden death.

It is known that some anaesthetics are able to disturb PMNL functions. We examined the influence of midazolam and flunitrazepam on the activity of the bactericidal enzymes lysozyme and beta-glucuronidase released from PMNL in vitro. As described before [4], PMNL were isolated from venous blood samples obtained from 10 healthy male volunteers. PMNL stimulation and measurement of lysozyme and beta-glucuronidase activities were conducted according to the description by Metcalf et al. [5]. The BIOMED-system [8] was used for statistical evaluation. Neither midazolam nor flunitrazepam caused any statistically important alteration of lysozyme activity. However, clinically relevant concentrations of both benzodiazepines significantly enhanced beta-glucuronidase activity. The additives of flunitrazepam did not play any role. Surprisingly enough, midazolam and flunitrazepam increased the activity of beta-glucuronidase released from PMNL in vitro. At present, this result can neither be explained nor can its importance be estimated. On the other hand, the benzodiazepines did not relevantly influence lysozyme activity. ","2205":"The ventilation mode clearly influences the course of patients with multiple trauma on the ICU. Ventilation according the \"open lung\" approach rapidly opens up atelectatic lung regions. Generation of an adequate intrinsic PEEP enables to keep the lung open. We studied the consequences of the \"open lung\" approach on the lung function and monitored its side effects on patients with multiple trauma. 18 consecutive patients with multiple trauma and additional thoracic trauma were routinely ventilated according the \"open lung\" approach between May and November 1999. We were mainly interested in data of lung mechanics, oxygenation and ventilation. Side effects on other organ systems and consequence for the infection rate were monitored. Ventilation according the \"open lung\" approach enables early sufficient oxygenation and ventilation of patients with severe multiple trauma and accompanying thoracic trauma. The ventilation mode helps to prevent baro-, volu- and atelectrauma and thus fulfils the requirements for a present-day ventilation mode. An immediate complete healing of the lung damages was not found. Nevertheless, as a trend the length of ventilation support seems short. Even extensive osteosynthesis at multiple fractures was possible without delay. Side effects of the high opening pressure on the lung or other organs as well as sequels of the high intrinsic PEEP on liver, kidney or intestine were not found. The infection rate was low, therapeutic doses of antibiotics were necessary only in less than half of the ICU-stay. Ventilation according the \"open lung\" approach is a very effective and safe way to ventilate patients after severe multiple trauma with accompanying thoracic trauma. ","2206":"At a time of cost reduction in medical care efforts to manage the ever-increasing costs of new pharmaceutical drugs become increasingly important. Costs of four different muscle relaxant regimens including the new intermediate-acting neuromuscular blocking drugs (NMBD) cisatracurium and rocuronium will be analyzed. Eighty patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were prospectively studied. All patients received standardized general anaesthesia with desflurane\/fentanyl. Muscle relaxation was achieved with atracurium, cisatracurium, vecuronium, or rocuronium with 20 patients in each group. Intraoperatively muscle relaxants were added to maintain two twitches of the train-of-four (TOF) assessment. There were no differences among the four groups regarding biometric data, duration of surgery and anesthesia, number of patients with reversal of neuromuscular blockade, and time of extubation. Length of stay in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and the incidence of side effects were similar in all groups. Total costs of used drugs were significantly lowest in the atracurium-treated patients (per patient: 18.27 Euro) and significantly highest in the cisatracurium group (26.71 Euro) compared with the other groups (vecuronium: 22.61 Euro; rocuronium: 22.63 Euro). It is summarized that the use of cisatracurium was associated with higher costs compared to a standard muscle relaxant regimen using atracurium, whereas patient outcome was the same in all study groups. The routine use of the newer NMBDs can only be justified economically, if considerable improvements to clinical practice can be demonstrated. ","2207":"This study was undertaken to investigate simultaneously the influence of coinduction with propofol and midazolam on sympathoadrenergic and hemodynamic reactions and stress response during the extended induction period of TIVA. 2 x 20 patients over the 60th year of life with major visceral surgery were investigated in a prospective randomized design. All patients received about 0.1 mg\/kg BW midazolam for oral premedication. In the midazolam-group, induction of TIVA was undertaken with 0.05 mg\/kg BW midazolam, 2.5 micrograms\/kg BW fentanyl and 1.0 mg\/kg BW propofol (1 min later). Controls received 2.5 micrograms\/kg BW fentanyl and 2.0 mg\/kg BW propofol. After muscle relaxation with 0.1 mg\/kg BW vecuronium, TIVA was conducted in both groups with 8-5 mg\/kg BW\/h propofol and bolus injections of fentanyl with respect to clinical demands. Beyond consumption of anesthetics and recovery, sympathoadrenergic and hemodynamic reactions and SEF90 were investigated at 6 time points before induction of anesthesia and at skin incision. Plasma levels of ADH, ACTH and cortisol were measured twice before induction and at skin incision. Biometric data of both groups were comparable, and mean age was over 65 years. In the midazolam-group, co-induction with a mean dosage of 3.8 mg midazolam halved the induction dose of propofol and reduced the propofol demand during the following course of anesthesia as well, achieving a significant over all reduction of 200 mg propofol (p = 0.04). With respect to recovery from anesthesia more than 90 min later, no significant differences were found. Plasma concentrations of noradrenaline and adrenaline dropped significantly in both groups (p &lt; 0.0001), as well as mean arterial pressure and heart rate (Fig. 1 and 2). For ADH, ACTH, cortisol and SEF90, no statistical differences were observed. Plasma-concentrations of midazolam were significantly higher in the midazolam-group. In elderly patients, co-induction with 0.05 mg\/kg BW midazolam halved the induction dose of propofol and led to a further dose reduction with maintained hypnotic potency. However, the halvage of propofol induction dose had no effect on the reduction of the sympathoadrenergic tone with decrease of blood pressure and heart rate. The overall moderation of the stress response was comparable as well. Thus, both induction regimens investigated in this study cannot be recommended in patients with severe hemodynamic disorders like hemorrhagic or cardiac shock. The propofol reduction should be primarily considered under economic aspects. ","2208":"The use of chemical substances to prevent or treat local pain had its origin in South America. It was known that central nervous system stimulation occurred among the natives of Peru who chewed the leaves of an indigenous plant (Erythroxylon coca). Circumoral numbness was believed to have occurred as a by-product of this custom. Attempts to isolate the active principle from these leaves finally resulted in the isolation of the alkaloid, cocaine, by Niemann in 1860. The clinical usefulness of cocaine was not appreciated until 1884, when Koller reported upon topical anesthesia of the eye. The chemical identification of cocaine as a benzoic acid ester led to the synthesis of numerous compounds which were basically benzoic ester derivates. In 1905, Einhorn reported the synthesis of procaine. Tetracaine, the most potent ester of the benzoic acid series appeared in 1930. A major breakthrough in the chemistry of local anesthetic agents occurred in 1943 when Loefgren synthesized lidocaine, since it was not an ester but an amide derivate of diethylamino acetic acid. Concerning structure-activity relationships, local anesthetic agents, in general, possess the chemical arrangement of: aromatic portion--intermediate chain--amine portion. Changes in the aromatic or amine portion of a local anesthetic substance will alter its lipid\/water distribution coefficient and its protein-binding characteristics which, in turn, will markedly alter the anesthetic profile. The toxic effects of long-acting local anesthetics on brain and heart, firstly reported by Albright, provided the initial stimulus to develop new amide-type local anesthetics. The first of these drugs, which has come into clinical practice was ropivacaine, the S-enantiomer of two possible optical isomers. It is structurally related to bupivacaine and mepivacaine, exerting a different pharmacodynamic profile, specifically on cardiac electrophysiology (less arrhythmogenic than bupivacaine). Studies on the anesthetic activities and toxicity of the individual enantiomers of bupivacaine and mepivacaine generally indicate, that the S-enantiomers are longer-acting and less toxic than the R-enantiomers.","2209":"In the seventies and eighties spinal mechanisms inhibiting pain processing were discovered in animal studies leading to new therapeutic regimens such the use of spinal opioids. During the last decade additional studies revealed an increased sensibility of the spinal cord upon severe, long lasting pain perception, a mechanism called wind-up. Hyperalgesia is accompanied by persisting genetic changes of spinal cord cells, which may contribute to the chronification of pain. The severity and duration of acute pain apparently contributes to the possibility of chronic pain development. Although not all the consequences of these findings are clear, they may influence our way of performing anaesthesia and treating postoperative or acute pain situations, e.g. pain during herpes zoster or pain after trauma and amputation. In general, analgetic measures should be potent enough to prevent spinal sensiblisation, which can be best achieved with spinal blockade by local anesthetics. Another way of counteracting pain-induced spinal plasticity is by blocking or antagonizing its pathways with specific transmitters or their equivalents. All these spinally mediated regimens should be performed prior to later predominating mechanisms of supraspinal plasticity involving psychic changes due to persisting pain, which seem to evolve with delay to spinal processes.","2210":"A 41-year-old man suffered severe polytrauma and developed a traumatic myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock. Thrombolysis as well as coronary bypass grafting was contraindicated due to accompanying injuries. An attempted early coronary revascularization by percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) failed due to dissection of the left interventricular coronary artery. Treatment of cardiac insufficiency was complicated by intraabdominal haemorrhage enforcing emergency laparotomy. Intraaortic balloon counterpulsation proved to be efficient in supporting circulation in these circumstances. The case report documents the practicability and importance of treating both myocardial ischaemia and attending injuries in an equivalent and coordinated manner in traumatic myocardial infarction.","2211":"","2212":"","2213":"","2214":"The aim of this study was to estimate the frequency and nature of self-reported and drug-related emergencies. 47 patients of a ward for opiate detoxification were interviewed about their experiences with drug-related emergencies. Typical categories had to be found like overdoses, seizures, accidents and suicide attempts respectively. 68% had own experience with drug-related emergency. A majority suffered opiate overdose with different extensions as unconsciousness or breath-depression. Alcohol and polydrug use was associated with overdose. Drug-related accidents were only reported by men. Half the number of drug-related emergencies were treated in hospital. Most emergencies occurred alone either in a home environment or outside. Harm reduction interventions like observed user rooms should be established. Furthermore other strategies to reduce the number of emergencies as sharing naloxon or resuscitation programs in wards for detoxification could also be an effective method to prevent near fatal or fatal overdoses in dependent subjects. ","2215":"Desflurane 2.5% was compared to Isoflurane 0.5% in a randomized study in terms of maternal and newborn effect on both groups with epidural anesthesia. Fifty patients under general anesthesia were randomly designated to receive either desflurane 2.5% or isoflurane 0.5% maintained in a 50-50% nitrous oxide and oxygen mixture. Twenty-five patients were assigned to receive epidural anesthesia using 15 ml ropivacaine 7.5 mg\/ml with fentanyl 100 micrograms. Intraoperative hemodynamic changes, blood loss and maternal awareness were recorded. Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min., neurologic adaptive capacity scores (NACS) at 2 and 24 hours and umbilical vein blood gas analysis were done to assess the neonatal outcome. Intraoperatively, heart rate and blood pressure changes were similar in both desflurane and Isoflurane group at 0.4% MAC (minimal alveolar concentration). Blood loss and arterial blood gas analysis were not problematic and did not differ significantly between the three groups. In the desflurane group, the patients were more easily awake and cooperative compared to the isoflurane group. The patients were interviewed about intraoperative awareness 24 and 48 h after the operation. None of them reported awareness during the operation. Similarly, the level of postoperative comfort was the same in both groups. Comparing the general and epidural anesthetic groups, no differences could be detected in neonatal outcomes. Conclusion is that there is one significant difference between desflurane 2.5% and isoflurane 0.5% anesthesia for cesarean section and it is the rapid recovery characteristic with desflurane which makes it an attractive alternative to TIVA (total intravenous anesthesia) and to other inhalational anesthetics available to obstetric anesthesiologists.","2216":"This article presents an overview of the current situation of euthanasia in Europe. Emphasis is given to the positions discussed in the Netherlands and in Germany. The current situation, the development of the legal positions, and the resulting debate are established by analysing English and German anesthesiological and medical-ethical journals. It has to be noted that many physicians are not satisfied with the terminology of euthanasia. The traditional concepts of euthanasia do not cover the aspect of accompanying terminally ill persons until they have died. The differentiation of active, passive, and indirect euthanasia does not correspond to the practical handling of the problem. Many physicians are in need of an open discussion of euthanasia-related issues. The way euthanasia is practiced in the Netherlands has strongly influenced the further development of the debate in Europe. Even though the Dutch model is rejected by the jurisdications of virtually all other countries, and official statements of medical corporations stick to the disapproval of active euthanasia, studies examining the attitudes towards euthanasia and the treatment of it in daily routine show that active interventions to shorten life are performed to different degrees outside of the Netherlands as well.","2217":"The metabolic regulation of tissue blood flow manifests itself in a linear relation between blood flow and oxygen consumption (VO2). It is unknown, however, if this fundamental physiological principle operates also during inhalation anaesthesia and catecholamine therapy, both known to be associated with changes of cardiac output (Q) and VO2 in opposite directions. On different days, 17 trained, healthy dogs (26-33 kg) with chronically implanted flow probes around the pulmonary artery were either anaesthetized with halothane, enflurane, isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane at increasing minimum alveolar concentrations (1-3 MAC) or treated with one of the endogenous catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine or the synthetic ones dobutamine and dopexamine (a total of 186 experiments). Cardiac Output (ultrasound transit-time flowmeter) and VO2 (indirect calorimetry) were measured continuously and the relations between both variables (Q\/VO2 relations) analyzed. In awake dogs under basal metabolic conditions, VO2 was 4.6 +\/- 0.1 ml x kg-1 x min-1 and Q 105 +\/- 3 ml x kg-1 x min-1 (mean +\/- SEM). During inhalation anaesthesia, VO2 and Q decreased in parallel, yielding a uniform Q\/VO2 relation, which was nearly linear. Above 2 MAC, O2 extraction increased by 50%, indicating compromised oxygen delivery (DO2). Imposed increases in Q and thus DO2 during anaesthesia to rates comparable to that in the awake state did not restore VO2 to baseline. Catecholamines increased both VO2 and Q in a dose-dependent manner, albeit to a different extent. The resulting Q\/VO2 relations were linear up to the maximum effects, but their slopes increased about threefold in the order norepinephrine (34), epinephrine (54), dobutamine (86), and dopexamine (105). Despite these differences, VO2 and Q correlated linearly over the whole range studied, which covered a doubling of VO2 and an up to fourfold increase in Q. The metabolic regulation of blood flow apparently also operates during inhalation anaesthesia, regardless of the anaesthetic. Catecholamines (except norepinephrine) preferentially stimulated Q rather than VO2 (excess perfusion), so that agents like dopexamine might be preferred in the treatment of low cardiac output states because of its low metabolic costs. Our observations imply that cardiac output alone provides little information on the function of the circulation during inhalation anaesthesia and catecholamine therapy unless related to metabolic demands, i.e. to VO2. ","2218":"The complement system is a multifactorial protein cascade system which is essentially involved in the early unspecific immune response. Its major function is the activation of cellular defense mechanisms, opsonisation of foreign particles and the destruction of target cells. While the impact of the different complement components for bacterial elimination still remains controversial, overwhelming activation of the complement cascade, however, can induce life threatening tissue damage due to the effective cytotoxic properties. In the last years a variety of studies demonstrated beneficial, organ protective effects of complement modulation in models of severe inflammation. Attempts to control the complement system include the application of endogenous complement inhibitors e.g. C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) or the administration of recombinant complement receptors such as the soluble complement receptor 1 (rsCR1). Moreover antibodies against key proteins (C3, C5), against their activation products (C5a) or against complement receptor 3 (CR3, CD18\/11b) mediated adhesion of leukocytes to the vascular endothelium, represent effective options of complement modulation. Besides this, insertion of membrane bound human complement regulators (DAF- CD55, MCP- CD46 or CD59) into xenogenic donor organs has proven effectiveness to prevent xenograft rejection. The described interventions protected from severe organ damage in various animal models of sepsis, myocardial and intestinal ischaemia-reperfusion injury, ARDS, nephritis, and xenograft rejection. With respect to recent clinical data, complement inhibition could represent a useful therapeutic strategy to control overwhelming inflammation. Own experiments demonstrated protective effects of complement modulation with C1 INH and rsCR1 in a model of complement induced pulmonary injury. With respect to sufficient host defense, however, the use of complement inhibitors must be considered carefully.","2219":"","2220":"","2221":"After uneventful ENT surgery, two male patients developed acute upper airway obstruction following extubation which progressed into negative pressure pulmonary edema (NPPE).

One approach to this problem could be repetitive intracranial volume provocations to evaluate a trend of the intracranial elastance. Several previously published methods use invasive volume challenge through access to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This pilot study describes changes in intracranial pressure due to variations of airway pressure with BIPAP ventilation maneuvers. Ten patients with severe TBI were enrolled and completed the study. The inclusion was based on radiologic signs due to TBI in the first CT-scan and the clinical indication for insertion of an ICP monitoring device. Patients with elevated ICP above 20 mm Hg were excluded. The epidural ICP response together with haemodynamic parameters in relation to defined airway pressure changes (delta PAW) was detected. The influence of the duration of delta PAW was evaluated additionally. Data of central venous pressure (CVP), ICP, mean arterial pressure (MAP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), airway pressure (PAW) and blood flow velocity of the middle cerebral artery (VMCA) were analyzed on the basis of differences between the maximum (inspiration) and minimum PAW values (expiration). Elevations of PAW in the range of 20 to 35 cm H2O resulted in changes of the ICPmean from 4.1 to 6.0 mm Hg (r = 0.9, p &lt; 0.05). A correlation was estimated for the changes of systolic arterial pressure (Part) and CPPmean due to PAW variations which ranged between 4.5 and 11.6 mm Hg (r = 0.99, p &lt; 0.05). Concerning the transcranial doppler measurements the data of changes of the blood flow velocity of the middle cerebral artery (VMCA) revealed a positive correlation to PAW with a r = 0.99, p &lt; 0.05. Elevation of the venous outflow resistance and a transient increase in cardiac output have to be considered as mechanisms for transduction of transthoracic pressure changes to intracranial pressure variations. We conclude, that trends of changes in elastance can be derived from intermittent airway pressure variations. This can be useful in easy and on line dynamic monitoring of ICP in traumatic brain injury. ","2225":"An embolism caused by catheters or puncture devices is generally a rare complication during the use of central venous catheters. Possible reasons are either mistakes on the part of the user (e.g. shearing off or tearing of catheters or Seldinger wires) or other accidental causes (e.g. faulty products, material fatigue). As patients are at risk of suffering serious injuries following an embolism, foreign bodies should be removed from the patient's cardio circulatory system as quickly and as completely as possible. Two-dimensional echo-cardiography has proved to be very helpful for diagnostics, while interventional radiology is most effective for the removal of intravascular foreign bodies.","2226":"Myocardial function is determined by preload, afterload, contractility and heart rate. Pathologic changes of these variables may result in decrease of blood pressure, acute heart failure or cardiogenic shock. Hyperdynamic septic shock is associated with systemic hypotension despite increased cardiac output. Mediators of sepsis induce both myocardial depression and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Moreover, sepsis is characterized by microcirculatory disturbances and dysbalance in regional oxygen delivery and consumption. Severe systemic hypotension is a symptom often requiring catecholamine therapy to restore systemic circulation and to avoid organ damage. As the use of catecholamines is not a causal therapy administration should be limited to an initial measure until correction of the underlying abnormalities can be achieved. Different etiologies of shock as well as diseases requiring specific interventions as pulmonary embolectomy, systemic lysis or coronary angioplasty have to be considered. First line intervention consists of optimizing preload by fluid resuscitation as appropriate and use of dopamine (4-12 micrograms\/kg.min) as primary catecholamine to increase contractility and blood pressure. In acute left heart failure inotropic support with dobutamine (4-12 micrograms\/kg.min) or epinephrine (0.05-1 microgram\/kg.min) may be necessary, frequently combined with a vasodilator (sodium nitroprusside 0.2-5 micrograms\/kg.min or nitroglycerine 0.5-2.5 micrograms\/kg.min) or phosphodiesterase-III-inhibitor (milrinone 0.3-0.8 microgram\/kg.min). In right heart failure norepinephrine is preferred to increase coronary perfusion pressure. Hyperdynamic septic shock with decreased vascular resistance is treated with norepinephrine to restore mean arterial pressure and to improve right ventricular dysfunction induced by pulmonary hypertension.","2227":"","2228":"","2229":"","2230":"The symptoms, diagnosis, and therapy for a septic patient with acute renal failure on continuous hemofiltration and heparin-anticoagulation who developed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II are described.

The outcome was measured with the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) post intensive care (median 9, min-max 2-77 days) and 6 months after trauma by a questionnaire. The GOS was related to age, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS on the scene), prehospital hypotension and hypoxia (HH), intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), intensive therapy including Tromethamine and\/or Thiopentone. The rate of infections was determined. Increasing age influences outcome negatively. Prehospital GCS and HH were significantly correlated with outcome.

","2242":"All involuntary innervated structures of the body are controlled by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. Adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopamine are endogenous catecholamines binding to adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors, respectively, to mediate their clinical effects. Adrenoceptors are classified as alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1 and beta 2 subtypes which were even further subcharacterized the recent years. Adrenoceptors are membrane proteins interacting with the agonist and, thus, inducing G-protein mediated intracellular effects. Adrenaline induces an extensive increase of heart rate and stroke volume mediated by beta-adrenoceptors and significantly enhances peripheral vascular resistance by alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation, when administered beyond 0.1 microgram\/kg.min. In contrast, the clinical effects of noradrenaline are predominantly characterized by alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation resulting in a less pronounced increase of heart rate. Dopamine, less potent on adrenoceptors, shows additional effects on renal as well as on splanchnic circulation mediated by dopaminergic receptors. Dobutamine, primarily acting on beta-adrenoceptors, results in positive inotropic effects without an increase in vascular resistance. Dopexamine, a synthetic catecholamine, induces vasodilation via beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation and potentially increases splanchnic blood flow by additional effects on dopaminergic receptors. Isoproterenol, the classical beta-adrenoceptor agonist, mediates positive inotropic effects and causes a major increase in heart rate and a significant decrease of systemic vascular resistance. Independent on adrenoceptors, phosphodiesterase-III-inhibitors exert positive inotropic and vasodilating activity by an increase in intracellular cAMP concentration induced by inhibition of cAMP hydrolysis.","2243":"","2244":"A main basis of this habilitation thesis is the development of a portable, mains-free measurement device for determining breath ethanol concentrations (BrEC) both during spontaneous breathing and in mechanically ventilated patinets undergoing inhalation anaesthesia, for detecting and quantifying irrigation fluid absorbed during endourological surgical interventions. Here a respired gas has to be measured which compared to other usually measured gases 1) is present in substatially smaller concentrations, 2) is subject to significant influences by temperature and humidity in the expired air, and 3) can only be measured discontinuously in the alveolar air due to technical limitations of the sensor. The basis for investigating accuracy of measurement was not just evaluation of the device using different lung models, but also a comparison with the target parameter \"absorbed irrigation fluid\" using another further-developed reference procedure, i.e. direct measurement of sorbitol and mannitol concentrations in serum. This has the added advantage that even when ethanol monitoring is not available, another laboratory procedure is indeed available for directly evaluating the absorption of irrigation fluid. In the clinical aspects of this thesis, ethanol monitoring helped show that during transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) in spontaneously breathing patients undergoing regional anaesthesia, irrigation fluid was intravascularly absorbed not more often, but more rapidly and in larger quantities than it was in mechanically ventilated patients undergoing inhalation anaesthesia. A possible reason for this was the significantly reduced central venous pressure observed in the group of patients undergoing regional anaesthesia. The diagnosis of a delayed extravascular absorption of irrigation fluid during percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PNL), made with the assistance of the ethanol monitoring, was associated with a significantly prolonged period of hospitalization in the clinic and an increase in opioid requirements. This finding can be explained pathophysiologically by an increased trauma to the kidney with injury to bordering organ structures. As a result of close co-operation with several departments of the Medical University of Lubeck, we now have at our disposal an excellent BrEC-measuring device for detecting and quantifying absorbed irrigation fluid during urosurgical procedures.

Because transfers are invariably associated with a reduction or interruption in the monitoring and treatment chain, an endangerment to critically-ill patients, as well as a significant increase in the mortality rates, can result. In the new construction of the Cardiac Clinic, the previous concept of immobile anesthesia and intensive care workstations has been completely abandoned. The complete treatment workstation, including monitoring and fluid management, is set up on a bedside cart which accompanies the patients uninterruptedly--from anesthesia administration, to the operating room, to the ICU or recovery room, as well as during elective or emergency interventions outside the ICU. Transport times and complications from 995 transports (ASA III and IV) were analysed and compared with 880 transports with the conventional system. During all intrahospital transfers with the mobile workplace, there were no complications resulting from faulty operation or accidental adjustment of the perfusors, or from disconnecting the monitoring,-, respiration-, or infusion lines. On the whole, there were fewer cases of circulatory instability during transport, since infusion treatment and medication could be administered without interruption. All hemodynamic parameters were recorded during transport, as were cardiac minute output and right- and left-atrial filling pressures. The mobile workplace system allows for the shortest possible transport and exchange times--13.5 min, as compared to 42.5 min with the conventional system. The reconnection of monitoring equipment with zeroing, adjustment of the alarm limits, as well as exchanging perfusors and infusomats before and after transport is eliminated entirely. This mobile workplace, in which all components of the anesthesiological and intensive care workstations are integrated, guarantees the highest possible level of patient safety, since nothing has to be disconnected until the patient is transferred to a normal-care ward.

Reduction of anxiety and sedation in the preoperative preparation as well as stress reduction and the process of recovery are a challenge for anaesthetists as perioperative physicians. As emotions have different dimensions of manifestation like experience, expression, behaviour and somatic indicators, all these are needed to describe emotions sufficiently. In a multidimensional approach for the measure of emotional states, the different dimensions, their relationships and interactions are taken into account. The methodological approaches to registration of emotions in the anaesthesiological context are heterogeneous. In this summary the possibilities are differentiated by the source of information. Self-rating by the patient, rating by the observer, expression and behaviour and somatic indicators are taken into consideration. Analysis of the methods for the assessment of emotional states in anaesthesiological setting leads to the following recommendations: The most sensitive source of information is the patient. The rating scale used should be multidimensional and it should take specific as well as unspecific emotional aspects into account. As there are enough rating scales thoroughly developed and up to the demands of the classical test-theory, no ad hoc developed scales should be used. The rating of the emotional state should be supplemented by a rating of the physical state. The rating by the observer can be a valuable addition. The agreement between observers and the reliability of the method must be guaranteed. At presence there is no alternative in clinical practice to simple autonomic parameters such as blood pressure and heart rate as somatic indicators of emotion. Still it is important to consider the normal values for the individual patient. It is necessary to develop and to evaluate simple methods to register characteristics of expression in clinical context.","2254":"","2255":"","2256":"We are reporting the case of a female patient who had to undergo splenectomy after she suffered splenic rupture as a result from \"kinetic therapy\" during the treatment for pulmonary failure secondary to sepsis.

","2266":"Due to immature cognitive functions, infants are unable to communicate their pain perception verbally. To assess postoperative analgesic demand, the anaesthetist has to rely on observational techniques. Generally, pain expression is considered to be a multidimensional phenomenon consisting of physiological, motor-reflex and behavioural patterns. The majority of observational approaches to pain assessment in infants use the behavioural dimension only, regardless of the fact that pain perception might contribute substantially to the stress response. The aim of this study is to evaluate, whether sensitivity and specificity of a behavioural pain scale (CHIPPS [1]) can be improved by adding physiological measures, especially those representing the stress response. 30 infants aged 0-12 months and scheduled for unilateral herniorrhaphy were studied prospectively. In addition to 9 behavioural items (crying, facial expression, wrinkling of the forehead, motoric restlessness; posture of fingers, arms, legs, toes and torso) the ratio of actual physiological measurements (heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure) and their respective preoperative baseline values were recorded by a single observer in 5 minutes intervals during the first hour after recovery from anaesthesia. Maximal efforts were made to achieve valid measures. Factor analysis was performed to determine the dimensionality of the complete item pool. For additional validity testing, receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) were calculated using the independent opinion of an experienced clinician as an external criterion. Discriminant analysis was performed to assess the accuracy of a combined behavioural and physiological scale. The factor analysis resulted in two independent dimensions: behaviour and cardiocirculatory measurements. The strong intercorrelations of all behavioural items and the fact, that the affective pain experience is expressed by a specific mimic behaviour, suggest the behavioural dimension to be regarded as pain expression. Because of the strictly orthogonal structure of the factor system, the circulatory and the respiratory dimension lack any relationship to pain experience. In addition to these statistical reasons, considerations on practicability disprove blood pressure and respiratory rate as useful pain indicators: Whereas the observer never failed to obtain a behavioural score, only 60% of the blood pressure measures and 80% of the respiratory rates were valid. In contrast, heart rate counts were obtained in over 99% and thus have to be considered as the only practicable physiological measurement in the early postoperative period. Corresponding to the results of the factor analysis, ROC curves suggest that the ability of the heart rate alone to assess pain is not substantially better than a random process, whereas the behavioural scale performs well. In addition the heart rate failed to improve the accuracy of the behavioural scale as shown by the results of a discriminant analysis. Despite the multidimensional approach and the corresponding multivariate analyses, a unidimensional scale consisting of behavioural items was found to be a valid indicator of an postoperative analgesic demand. Due to the lack of diagnostic properties and difficulties to obtain sound values even under research conditions, physiological measurements like blood pressure, respiratory rate and heart rate are not suitable for the assessment of a postoperative analgesic demand in infants, neither for clinical nor for research purposes. ","2267":"For the first time an evaluation of standard anesthetic monitoring was performed according to the guidelines of the Austrian Society for Anesthesiology, Resuscitation und Intensive Care Medicine (OGARI). A questionnaire was delivered to all medical institutions performing anesthesia in Austria. A descriptive statistical evaluation was performed on all returned and completed questionnaires. Generally, there is a high standard in compulsory monitoring and in PACU (actual compliance &gt; 99%\/85.8%). Supplemental equipment is required for disconnection alarm and measurement of inspired oxygen concentration (actual compliance: 98.3%\/98.9%). Furthermore, measurement for inspired concentration of volatile anesthetics and relaxometry (actual compliance 68.7%\/47.3%) has yet to be completed. University departments and regional hospitals have comparable standards (82.2% vs. 79.6%). For the first time an Austrian-wide evaluation of anesthetic monitoring investigated the compliance with the 1992 recommendations of the Austrian Society of Anesthesiology, Resuscitation and Intensive Care Medicine. The data demonstrate that these recommendations including the anesthetic monitoring equipment have already been implemented to a high degree. ","2268":"Tachyphylaxis to local anesthetics is defined as a decrease in duration, segmental spread or intensity of a regional block despite repeated constant dosages. However, there is disagreement about the incidence of tachyphylaxis. In contrast to tachyphylaxis, pseudotachyphylaxis denotes time dependent variations in pain or circadian changes in the duration of local anesthetic action. Tachyphylaxis appears neither to be linked to structural or pharmacological properties of the local anesthetics nor to the technique or mode of their administration. The mechanisms underlying tachyphylaxis are open to debate and include changes in pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. Considering pharmacokinetics, local edema, an increased epidural protein concentration, changes in local anesthetic distribution in the epidural space or a decrease of perineural pH could result in decreased diffusion of the local anesthetics from the epidural space to their binding sites at the sodium channel. Increased clearance of local anesthetics from the epidural space may be caused both by increased epidural blood flow or increased local metabolism. Considering pharmacodynamics, antagonistic effects of nucleotides or increased sodium concentration, increased afferent input from nociceptors or receptor down regulation of the sodium channels have been implicated. However, none of these theoretical considerations is supported strongly enough by data to explain tachyphylaxis. A new possibility to maintain for a longer time neural blockade is the design of new ultralong-acting local anesthetics. Liposomal formulations of local anesthetics also appear suitable to provide longer lasting regional anesthesia. The recent observation that NMDA-antagonists as well as NO-synthase-inhibitors prevent the development of tachyphylaxis suggests involvement of the nitric oxide pathway in the development of tachyphylaxis. Accordingly, NMDA-antagonists or NO-synthase-inhibitors may prevent tachyphylaxis.","2269":"","2270":"","2271":"","2272":"","2273":"","2274":"","2275":"","2276":"","2277":"To evaluate whether routine pre-intubation positive pressure mask ventilation (PPMV) influences the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).

Approval by the local ethical committee and informed written consent was obtained. After preoxygenation (3 min) and induction of anesthesia with fentanyl (1-2 micrograms.kg-1 b.w.) and thiopental (5 mg.kg-1 b.w) patients were divided into two groups: group 1 patients (without PPMV, n = 333) received succinylcholine 30s after thiopental followed by tracheal intubation. Group 2 patients (with PPMV, n = 336) were ventilated by mask for at least 30s after thiopental injection, followed by succinylcholine and, after another 120s of PPMV, tracheal intubation.

Both early diagnosis by fibreoptic bronchoscopy and immediate surgical treatment are essential. There is no uniform recommendation for airway-management concerning the tube. Standard tracheal- and double-lumen tubes position the cuff at the site of the injury and tracheostomy tubes are too short to protect the lesion from positive airway pressure. We discuss the causes, diagnosis, and treatment of tracheal ruptures, reviewing the recent literature. We analysed data from three female patients who sustained carina near tracheal ruptures. They underwent selective endobronchial intubation with two tubes, both under fibreoptic control. Following the surgical repair the tubes were then introduced via tracheostomy. Because of severe respiratory failure (aspiration pneumonia, mediastinitis, status asthmaicus, ARDS) independent lung ventilation was performed for 9-14 days. Obviously the fixation of the tubes is most essential and their correct position was confirmed by daily fibreoptic or radiologic control. Then a single tracheostomy tube was inserted. The patients respiratory functions improved and they were discharged from ICU after 21-36 days, breathing spontaneously with closed tracheostoma. No long-term complications were noted.

Between 1993 and 1998 data of 7476 deliveries were collected by the perinatal documentation system of the Obstetric Department and by computerized anaesthesia protocols of the Department of Anesthesiology. Since combined spinal-epidural anaesthesia with sufentanil was introduced in 1997, all patients with subarachnoid techniques were prospectively examined between 1997 and 1998. While the total number of deliveries decreased over the years, the number of patients undergoing anaesthetic treatment increased continuously. In parallel, the number of patients with regional anaesthesia increased between 1993 and 1998 from 14.3% to 34.8%. The cesarean delivery rate increased from 23.7% to 28.7% with an increasing number of patients receiving regional anaesthesia for cesarean section (1993: 25.3% vs. 1998: 62.1%). The number of emergency cesarean deliveries performed in regional anaesthesia increased to 19.3% in 1998. The number of neonates with an umbilical artery pH below 7.2 decreased from 18% in 1993 to 11% in 1998. The success rate of regional anaesthesia increased from 88.2% in 1993 to 97.5% in 1998. Combined spinal-epidural anaesthesia provided greater pain reduction when compared with epidural anesthesia (VAS -81 +\/- 12 vs. -68 +\/- 18). Early vasopressor administration resulted in a decrease of hypotension from 40% to 14% in spinal and from 21% to 13% in combined spinal-epidural anaesthesia. The incidence of postdural puncture headache after subarachnoid anaesthesia was 2.4%. Epidural and subarachnoid application of sufentanil appears to enhance the success rate of obstetric regional anaesthesia. Subarachnoid techniques such as spinal or combined spinal-epidural anaesthesia showed a high effectiveness, low incidence of side effects and high degree of patients' satisfaction. ","2285":"Up to date the exact mechanisms of action of anaesthetics on structures of the central nervous system have not been elucidated. Agents acting on central alpha 2-adrenoceptors have been demonstrated to possess potent sedative properties. Beside the classical agonists, general anaesthetics that are currently in clinical use e.g. etomidate have also been shown to act on alpha 2-adrenoceptors. Thus, the aim of this study was to study the effect of the intravenous anaesthetic agents propofol and ketamine on the binding of the specific alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist paraiodoclonidine at cerebral alpha 2 adrenoceptors. After approval of the local animal care committee brain tissue of six Wistar rats was removed and frozen at -80 degrees C. The tissue was sectioned in 15-20 microns thick slices. After washing in TRIS-buffer (pH = 7.5) the slices were incubated with 2.5 nM 125I-paraiodoclonidine (PIC) for determination of specific binding. Unspecific binding was determined in presence of 200 microM unlabeled clonidine. Displacement experiments were performed in presence of propofol (11-530 microM) and ketamine (52-1100 microM) and evaluated autoradiographically. Average exposure time was three days. All films were then analysed by densitometry. Statistical significance calculated by Student's t-test was assumed at a level of p &lt; 0.05. Only at the highest concentration of propofol and ketamine an effect on PIC binding was noticeable. Neither propofol nor ketamine was able to displace PIC completely from cerebral alpha 2-adrenoceptors. In contrast to other anaesthetics such as etomidate which was demonstrated to displace PIC completely from alpha 2-adrenoceptors, propofol and ketamine exerted only minor effects on the binding of PIC even at concentrations that exceeded clinical concentrations. These data suggest that an additional site of action of these anaesthetics at cerebral alpha 2-adrenoceptors beside the known actions on GABA receptors or NMDA receptors is unlikely. ","2286":"Fast recovery from mivacurium-induced neuromuscular blockade is impaired in patients with decreased plasma cholinesterase activity which is often associated with dysfunction of different organs. Nevertheless, predictability of neuromuscular recovery may be given. Thus, this study evaluates parameters to predict individual neuromuscular recovery in patients with uncommon diseases. 84 male or female patients (18-70 years of age) were allocated to one of two groups according to their ASA risk profile (without severe systemic diseases: ASA 1 and 2; with severe systemic diseases: ASA 3 and 4). Plasma cholinesterase activity (PChE) had been determined preoperatively. Anaesthesia was performed with propofol and fentanyl. Neuromuscular transmission was monitored by electromyography. The ulnar nerve was stimulated by train-of four stimuli and neuromuscular transmission was measured at the hypothenar. After mivacurium 0.1 mu mg\/kg, an infusion of mivacurium was adjusted to maintain T1\/T0 at approximately 5% for at least 60 min. Duration from application of the initial bolus until recovery to T1\/T0 = 5% (dur 5), the mean mivacurium infusion rate (IR), infusion time, the early recovery time from cessation of infusion to T1\/T0 = 25% (rec 25) and the final recovery time from T1\/T0 = 25% to T4\/T1 = 75% (final rec) was measured. Statistical analysis of data was performed using t-tests. (alpha = 0.05). Predictability of the recovery times (rec 25 and final rec) was tested by multiple linear least-squares regressions. Dependent variables were PChE, dur 5, IR, infusion time, and rec 25, respectively. To test for predictability of neuromuscular blockade by mivacurium with respect to severe systemic diseases, the ASA risk score was defined to be the second independent variable at each regression, the respective interaction was defined to be the third independent variable (variable 1 x group). Variables entered multiple regression analysis in a forward stepwise manner (F &gt; 4.0). PChE was significantly lower in patients with severe systemic diseases (3.7 +\/- 1.2 kU\/l vs. 4.5 +\/- 0.9 kU\/l), dur 5 significantly prolonged (17.3 +\/- 7.3 min vs. 11.0 +\/- 3.0 min), IR significantly lower (4.6 +\/- 2.6 micrograms\/kg\/min vs. 6.5 +\/- 2.8 micrograms\/kg\/min), and rec 25 (8.7 +\/- 4.0 min vs. 6.0 +\/- 1.7 min) as well as final rec (23.0 +\/- 16.3 min vs. 13.0 +\/- 3.7 min) significantly prolonged compared to patients without severe systemic diseases. Both recovery intervals correlated significantly with PChE, dur 5, or IR, but not with the ASA risk score. Multiple regression analysis revealed a close correlation between rec 25 and final rec very closely (R2 = 0.875). Prolonged mivacurium infusion time and additionally high ASA risk score were correlated with a prolonged neuromuscular recovery (R2 = 0.130). Prolonged neuromuscular recovery could be predicted from a reduced PChE, a prolonged duration of action of the initial mivacurium bolus and a decreased mivacurium-infusion rate required to maintain a 95% neuromuscular blockade. Measurement of plasma cholinesterase and monitoring of mivacurium induced neuromuscular blockade can avoid resting neuromuscular blockade postoperatively despite of prolonged neuromuscular recovery. ","2287":"Especially for medical disciplines like anesthesiology, which represent only a small economic market, drug development is a cost intensive and with respect to financial aspects a high risk task. This situation requires methods, which in the early stages of the drug development process of an interesting compound allow the establishment of a reliable and valid data set, in order to make decisions on the continuation or discontinuation of a project. Given a compound out of the group of benzodiazepines as an example this paper represents todays methods of integrated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling as well as the special computer aided strategies of drug dosing as powerful tools in the anaesthetic drug development process. It is shown that one can generate data concerning differences in drug requirement and drug duration in the therapeutic dose range between different groups of possible patients, e.g. young and elderly, as early as the early phase II. It is concluded that these clinical pharmacological tools and the high resolution data generated by them facilitate the Go\/No-Go decision to proceed to phase III and enhance the likelihood of passing phase III successfully.","2288":"Malignant Hyperthermia (MH) represents a functional myopathy triggered by volatile anesthetics and depolarizing muscle relaxants, and leading to metabolic disturbances of intracellular Calcium homeostasis.

We studied the correlation of a MH-predisposition with specific myopathological signs. Skeletal muscles of suspected MH-individuals were histochemically stained by SDH-, NADH-, COX-, Gomori-Trichrome-, ATPase-, Acid Phosphatase-, Oil-red O- und PAS-stain und evaluated without knowing MH-diagnosis by the in-vitro-contracture test. Out of 118 patients (30% MHS [\"susceptible\"], 63% MHN [normal], 7% MHE [\"equivocal\"]) 19% revealed pathological findings corresponding to CCLS. 45% of these findings were associated with MHS\/MHE. With HE-staining internal nuclei were not specific, but increased with the probability of MHS\/MHE from 24% to 80%. Central Cores were correlated in 100% with MHS\/MHE (4 out of 118 patients). CCLS were found with about similar frequency in skeletal muscle of MHS\/MHE and MHN individuals. Internal nuclei were, however, not specifically, associated with MHS. In contrast, Central Cores correlated significantly with MHS\/MHE diagnosis. In conclusion, histopathological findings in skeletal muscle seem to be a reliable marker for MH-predisposition only with Central Cores.","2289":"Physiologic changes influence the pharmacokinetics of drugs relevant to anesthesia in neonates and infants. The neonatal phase is the phase of life with the most rapid and dramatic changes of organ-functions responsible for pharmacokinetics of most anesthetics. Changes in body composition and the content of plasma proteins influence volume of distribution, the drug distribution to different compartments and the amount of free fraction in plasma. Due to the immaturity of hepatic microsomal enzyme systems there is a decreased metabolism particular of agents which undergo low hepatic extraction like Diazepam, Morphine or some local anesthetics. In the first year of life capacity of the enzymatic systems increases and also clearance increases. Until puberty the clearance of some drugs is greater than the adult level. There are also pharmacodynamic changes like modified sensitivity to some drugs like volatile anesthetics or neuromuscular blocking agents. In summary neonates and infants are a highly heterogenous group with large interindividual differences. Therefore the dosage of anesthetic agents must be individualized to achieve optimal pharmacodynamic effects without toxicity in this age group.","2290":null,"2291":"","2292":"","2293":"","2294":"","2295":"","2296":"","2297":"","2298":"","2299":"","2300":"","2301":"","2302":"","2303":"","2304":"","2305":"","2306":"","2307":"","2308":"Rett's syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder which is caused by a mutation on the x-chromosome; thus, it only affects the female sex.

Healthy volunteers received 500 ml 6% HES 200\/0.62 (30 g) or 500 ml 10% HES 200\/0.5 per day over a period of five consecutive days. Blood samples were taken in the morning before infusions were started (7.A.M.) and at each hour during the infusion period of 4 hours post infusionem until 4 hours after the infusions. During the first 10 days and on the 20th and on the 30th day after the last infusion blood samples were taken. Both HES solutions were subjectively and objectively well tolerated by healthy volunteers. No side effects were observed. However, pharmacokinetics of the investigated HES-formulations were significantly different. The model-independent calculated elimination half life time (T1\/2) increased from day to day. During the five days T1\/2 was prolonged for 20 h by high substituted HES (200\/0.62) and for 2.5 h for medium substituted HES (200\/0.5). The half life times related to the three compartment model calculation were with 0.6 h, 11.6 h and 211 h for HES 200\/0.62 two fold higher than the times for HES 200\/0.5 with 0.39 h, 6.98 h and 113 h. Plasma clearance for HES 200\/0.5 (4.86 ml\/min) was five fold higher than that from HES 200\/0.62 with 0.98 ml\/min. With the exception of the first day of infusion serum concentrations of HES 200\/0.5 although only 30 g HES 200\/0.6 versus 50 g HES 200\/0.5 were infused.

Studies were systematically extracted from Medline, the manufacturer's database, and a supplemental search of references lists and current issues of locally available anaesthesia journals. Complete prevention of PONV defined as absence of nausea, retching, and vomiting within 6 hours (early PONV) and within 48 hours (late PONV) was chosen as the main end point. Additional information such as dose of droperidol, time and way of administration, and biometric data of the patients were extracted from each study. The pooled relative risk and the number-needed-to treat (NNT) were calculated. A total of 72 studies with 107 comparative subgroups were accepted for analysis according to the prospectively defined criteria. Of these sixty-nine trials reported a lower incidence of PONV with droperidol. The incidence of early and late PONV among the 5370 patients receiving droperidol was 23.4% and 38.2%, respectively. The corresponding incidence among the 3954 control patients was 40.7% and 53.9%. The relative risk for patients receiving prophylactic droperidol of suffering from early PONV was 0.58 and 0.71 for late PONV. The NNT for preventing one patient from PONV was 5.8 and 6.4 for early and late PONV, respectively. Treatment with droperidol was more effective when the baseline risk for PONV was higher than 25% for early PONV and 35% for late PONV. Under these circumstances the NNT was between 2.6 and 5.6. There was no dose response relationship for droperidol when the drug was applied in doses ranging from 0.5 to 300 micrograms.kg-1 body weight. It was not possible to derive reliable information about the incidence of side-effects of the droperidol administration. Droperidol is an effective antiemetic drug. The drug can be administered to patients with an increased risk of suffering from PONV without antiemetic prophylaxis. Since a positive dose response is lacking, droperidol should only be administered in doses of 1 mg or less. ","2314":"Delirium is a serious postoperative complication after general anaesthesia. The incidence is estimated to be about 10-15%. In the case of additional risk factors, such as old age, previously existing cerebral-vasculous and psychic deficiencies, and anaesthesia of long duration the incidence is much higher. Delirium impairs postoperative mobilisation and convalescence of the patient, can lead to a longer hospital stay and is associated with higher mortality rates. In a series of clinical studies it could be shown that the perioperative administration of the nootropic piracetam led to a shorter recovery period after anaesthesia and had a favourable influence on the delirious symptoms. Especially patients with risk factors for postoperative delirium profited from prophylactic application of piracetam. The success of this medication can be explained by a protective influence of the substance on central neurons against hypoxia, ischemia and intoxication, all of which are discussed as possible causes for postoperative delirium. Next to the pathogenetic mechanisms of postoperative delirium, the mode of action of piracetam is shown in a review and a summary of references on the clinical use in anaesthesia is given.","2315":"","2316":"A 28 year old primipara (37th gestational week) was scheduled to undergo delivery by caesarean section under epidural anaesthesia.

For general anaesthesia a standardised technique including benzodiazepine premedication, propofol, desflurane in N2O\/O2 vecuronium and a continuous infusion of remifentanil was used. Postoperative analgesia (diclofenac or metamizole supplemented with piritramide) and antiemetic rescue medication (dolasetron and droperidol) were standardised. Episodes of vomiting, retching, nausea, and the need for additional antiemetics were recorded in the recovery room and 2, 5, 8, and 24 hours after surgery. The main goal of the study was to increase the number of females staying completely free from PONV (Chi 2-test). Furthermore, the severity of PONV was analysed, using a standardised scoring algorithm. There were no differences between the two groups with regard to biometric data and distribution of risk factors for developing PONV. In all four groups nearly the similar number of patients stayed completely free from PONV: Placebo: 60.7%, metoclopramide: 66.7%, dimenhydrinate: 64.3%, combination: 64.4% (differences not significant).

Core temperature remained constant in all actively heated patients, regardless of upper or lower body heating. Hypothermia of the unwarmed patients was detected by both, tympanic membrane measurement and--with a short delay--the urinary bladder temperature probe.

Thirteen anaesthetised dogs were instrumented for measurement of left ventricular pressure (tip-manometer), cardiac output (ultrasonic flow probe) and regional myocardial function (sonomicrometry) in two left ventricular regions, innervated by the left or right sympathetic system, respectively. Electrical stimulations of the left and right stellate ganglia, and left and right sided stellate ganglion blocks were performed. In eight patients with no cardiac disease, the effects of left stellate ganglion blocks on echocardiographic variables of ventricular function were investigated. In dogs, the unilateral ganglion stimulations led to an increase in regional and global contractility. However, left ventricular wall motion became asynchronous and, despite an increase in contractility, relaxation was impaired. After the ganglion blocks, there was a decrease in regional contractility within the denervated area, also leading to an asynchronous wall motion. As a consequence, relaxation was impaired, but cardiac output was maintained. In the patients, there was an increase in isovolumic relaxation time. This change was also within the compensatory range and cardiac output increased slightly as a consequence of a simultaneous afterload reduction by the ganglion block. The studies show a disturbance of diastolic function after stellate ganglion blocks, resulting from an asynchronous wall motion pattern after the regional denervation. However, the changes were within the compensatory range of a healthy ventricle and cardiac output was not reduced.

We checked Medline 1966-1998, Quarterly Cumulative Index 1916-1926, Quarterly Cumulative Index Medicus 1927-1950 for publications of Eisenmenger and the secondary literature thereof. Rudolf Eisenmenger (1871-1946) published in 1903 a \"Device for Artificial Respiration\" consisting of an air-tight thoraco-abdominal shield and a foot-operated bellows for generation of alternating pressure and vacuum on the abdomen and lower thorax. He proposed use of the device for patients in cardiopulmonary arrest caused by drowning or intoxication. The device was patented and in 1904 made commercially available. In 1911 he published a successful resuscitation with his device after one hour of \"Vacuum and Pressure Massage of the Abdomen\" in a case of attempted suicide by hanging. The foot-operated bellows was replaced by an electromotor (hence \"Biomotor\") in 1924. Experiments on dogs in cardiac arrest were published in 1929. With the methods available not only \"normal\" tidal volumes and blood pressure, but also carbon dioxide exhalation and transport of intravenous dye to all parts of the body were shown. In 1939 an eight part series was published, describing use of the device as a respirator in several hospitals. Eisenmenger was the first to propose ACD-CPR, to build a device to perform ACD-CPR and to use it successfully in a patient. Furthermore, he was the first to propose the \"cardiac pump theory\" and the first to recognize the connection of carbon dioxide exhalation, cardiac output and prognosis of cardiac arrest.","2331":"Informed consent is one of the most discussed topics of bioethics. This new emphasis on seeking patient's consent is due to the fact that since the 1960s there has been a considerable change in the ideal of patient-physician relationship. There has been an important shift from a physician-based commitment of promoting well-being to a patient-based right of information arising from individual autonomy instead of a Hippocratic paternalism. Consent requirement is ethically derived from the duty to treat persons as ends, not merely as means.

Although some European countries already have an incidence as high as 30% of MRSA infection in ICU-patients, there is no additional financial support for the treatment of MRSA infected patients. We investigated all MRSA infected patients of the operative ICU ward of the department of anaesthesia at the university Ulm within the last three years. We calculated all costs for decontamination and special treatment of the MRSA infection as well as the costs for closing beds, because of MRSA precaution and isolation reasons. The average monthly costs for MRSA infected patients is about 3848 EURO for decontamination and treatment, and another 5560 EURO fix costs. The average monthly ICU duration for MRSA patients was 5.8 days, which means a financial loss of 1622 EURO per \"MRSA-patient day\". This loss is more than two times the price the social security system pays for an ICU-patient. These extra costs should be calculated and additionally paid for patients with MRSA-infection in order to obtain a certain quality standard.

Relations between the chemical composition of human exhaled air and inflammatory processes, states of high oxidative activity, inhalation or ingestion of various noxious substances as well as diseases like ARDS, pneumonia or sleep apnea have been described. Clinical interpretation of these findings, however, remains difficult because definite marker substances for certain diseases could not yet be identified, substance concentrations in the exhaled air change under various conditions, and results vary in a wide range. Because of very low substance concentrations in the exhaled air sophisticated analytical techniques are necessary. Analyses are hampered by high water content and numerous contaminants in the samples. A clear distinction has to be made between substances originating from within the patient and those coming from outside of the body. Despite all these limitations there is no doubt that relations exist between the chemical composition of human exhaled air and clinical parameters. Upcoming new analytical techniques will allow more efficient extraction and preconcentration of substances in minute concentrations.

This study is based on data from 5,017 patients undergoing major bone and joint surgery in 1993 and participating preoperatively in autologous blood donation (ABD) (with hemoseparation (HS) into autologous packed red blood cells (APRBC) and autologous fresh-frozen-plasma (AFFP)), autologous plasmapheresis (APPH) for harvesting AFFP as well as intra-\/postoperative blood salvage with mechanically processed autologous transfusion (MAT). Total costs for 3,110 ABD with HS amount to DM 517,586.00 resulting in about DM 167.00 per U of APRBC plus AFFP. Comparatively, costs per U of HPRBC is about DM 202.00. Break-even-point (BEP) is calculated with 2,258 U of APRBC (without considering AFFP additionally obtained by HS). Taking into account this AFFP due to coagulation in 20% lowers BEP to 1,819 U of APRBC. However, this analysis compares the \"mere\" cost figures only, but does not consider the extent of ABD-induced increase in rbc mass compared to that of HPRBC. Under these circumstances calculated cost per unit of APRBC is up to 90 per cent higher than for 1 U of HPRBC. Total cost for PPH with 15,570 U of AFFP amounts to about DM 1,824,162.00, resulting in about DM 115.00 per U of AFFP. Comparatively, cost per U of HFFP is about DM 136.00. BEP is calculated with 11,595 U of AFFP. However, when considering AFFP on coagulatory reasons' with 20% only, no BEP can be calculated and AFFP is not proven to be cost-efficient. Under these conditions it is about 2.8-times more expensive than HFFP; and if considering AFFP a volume substitute it is even more than twelve times more expensive than artificial colloids (e.g. HES 6%, 200\/0.5). MAT--2,690 sets and patients with a total of 5,326 processing cycles--causes a total cost of about DM 1,356,161.00, resulting in about DM 504.00 per set and patient. Under our conditions MAT is not cost-efficient compared to HPRBC as it is about two times more expensive than HPRBC. For reaching cost efficiency the number of processing cycles is either to be increased from about 2 to about 4 cycles per set and patient or hematocrit of the rbc-product obtained by MAT is clearly to be increased. The \"mere\" figures of this cost analysis of APRBC versus HPRBC as well as of AFFP versus HFFP and HES appear in favour of the autologous products. However, such an analysis should consider--besides the costs--both the increase in rbc-mass obtained by ABD or MAT, versus homologous rbc, and the indication for administering AFFP. This study does not prove our autologous blood conservation measures to be cost efficient compared to homologous blood products. Therefore, these data may cause a critically reflection on established concepts of autologous transfusion measures and may initiate promoting new and more cost efficient constellations\/alternatives of blood conservation measures.

It was the aim of this prospective double blind placebo controlled study to determine the efficacy of low-dose droperidol, dolasetron, and a combination of both drugs in the prevention of PONV after extracapsular cataract extraction. 148 inpatients undergoing cataract surgery were stratified according to gender and then randomised to receive one of four antiemetic regimens: placebo, droperiodol (10 micrograms x kg-1), dolasetron (12.5 mg), or the combination of both drugs (10 micrograms x kg-1 + 12.5 mg). The drugs were administered intravenously 5-10 minutes before the end of anaesthesia. General anaesthesia and the perioperative management of the patients were standardised: benzodiazepine premedication, induction with etomidate, alfentanil and mivacurium. Maintenance using desflurane in N2O\/O2, and a continuous infusion of mivacurium was used. Postoperative analgesia (diclofenac or paracetamol) and antiemetic rescue medication (dimenhydrinate and metoclopramide) was standardised. Nausea, episodes of vomiting, retching and the need for additional antiemetics were recorded for 24-hours. The severity of PONV was categorised using a standardised scoring algorithm. The main aim of the study was the number of patients who stayed completely free from PONV. There were no differences between the two groups with regard to biometric data, type of surgery, and distribution of risk factors for developing PONV. In all three treatment groups significantly less patients suffered from PONV (placebo: 66%; droperidol: 89%, dolasetron: 92%, combination: 89%; p = 0.011). Furthermore, the severity of PONV was reduced (p = 0.012). Low-dose droperidol and dolasetron are equally effective to reduce the incidence of PONV after cataract surgery under general anaesthesia.

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of oral dolasetron in comparison to intravenous droperidol (DHB) and to a combination of both drugs for prophylaxis of PONV. 80 patients (ASA I-III) were randomly allocated to one of four groups and received the following medication: group A: 50 mg dolasetron was given orally 45-60 minutes before anaesthesia was induced, group B: 2.5 mg i.v. DHB + placebo p.o. was administered while inducing anaesthesia (positive control group), group C: 50 mg dolasetron was given 45-60 minutes before anaesthesia was induced and 2.5 mg i.v. DHB was given while inducing anaesthesia, group D: placebo tablet was administered 45-60 minutes before anaesthesia was induced (negative control group). PONV was assessed using a 5-point score: 0 = no symptoms, 1 = nausea, 2 = retching, 3 = vomiting, 4 = multiple vomiting. Metoclopramid was given as antiemetic if a patient reached two or more score points. PONV scores were significantly lower in group A and C (p &lt; 0.001) compared to the control group. Patients treated with DHB showed a significantly lower PONV score in comparison to the placebo treated patients (p &lt; 0.05).

Postoperative consumption of metoclopramid was significantly lower in the groups A (2.4 +\/- 5.2 mg) and C (1.0 +\/- 3.1 mg) than in the placebo group (6.0 +\/- 6.8 mg), whereas between group B (3.0 +\/- 5.7 mg) and D we found no significant differences. Single dose of oral dolasetron and single dose of intravenous DHB reduced PONV effectively, in patients undergoing gynaecologic surgery. A combination of dolasetron and DHB has no better effect than a single dose of oral dolasetron. Contrary to DHB the application of dolasetron decreased the postoperative antiemetic requirement significantly.

Clinical manifestations include delayed weaning from the respirator and prolongation of the rehabilitation phase.

For differential diagnosis prolonged neuromuscular blockade and several myopathies have to be taken into consideration. The pathogenesis of critical illness polyneuropathy is unknown. It has been suggested that the factors mediating the systemic inflammatory response are also responsible for axonal damage in critical illness polyneuropathy. We recently described a neurotoxic activity present in the sera of affected patients, which can be reversed completely by NMDA antagonists. The critical illness per se is unrelated to the development of neuropathy. By contrast, occurrence of myopathies may be triggered by exogenous factors such as high-dose glucosteroids and non-depolarizing muscle blocking agents.

Dose recommendations were given daily, taking into consideration serum levels, dose predictions (Bayesian method, ABBOTTBASE), creatinine clearance and clinical findings. Creatinine clearance was estimated according to the Cockcroft-Gault-formula as well as directly by the urine collection method.

After obtaining informed consent, 32 patients undergoing endoscopic sinus procedures were anesthetized with N2O, propofol, and fentanyl or sufentanil (dosage ratio fentanyl:sufentanil = 7:1). Arterial blood pressure was measured via an arterial line, blood samples for ACTH, AVP, and cortisol were obtained pre-, intra-, and post-operatively, and a psychomotor function test was conducted pre- and postoperatively. The ENT-surgeon estimated the dryness of the surgical field on a numeric scale ranging from 1 to 5, and intraoperative blood loss was measured. Hemodynamic reactions to surgical simulation were blunted more sufficiently in the sufentanil group. Surgical conditions were satisfactory in all patients, but significantly better in the sufentanil group; differences in blood loss did not prove statistically significant. The endocrine stress response was efficiently blunted without significant differences between the groups. Post-operative psychomotor testing showed better recovery in the sufentanil group.

They compared two withdrawal regimens: The short Opiate withdrawal using a staggered naloxone regimen and the rapid opiate detoxification during general anesthesia by means of high doses of naloxone. Based on the latter concept, various modifications have been developed world-wide using either naloxone or as an alternative, naltrexone, an antagonist available for oral administration only. However, there are considerable objections to opioid detoxification during general anasthesia. The main criticism is based an the supposedly unacceptable high risk:benefit-ratio, the higher costs, the lack of psycho-social support, and the lack of prospective studies. However, first results suggest that rapid detoxification procedures are more successful in decreasing relapse than methods which are based on psychiatric treatment alone. As sympathetic hyperfunction is common in rapid detoxification procedures using high doses of opioid receptor antagonists, it is essential to avoid severe autonomic imbalance with possible subsequent impairment of organ functions. To prevent those disturbances, general anesthesia plays an important role. So far, there is almost no information about such methods in the anesthesiological literature. In this article the clinical relevance of such methods is discussed summarizing both the available literature and our own experience and we conclude that rapid opioid detoxification under general anesthesia is a safe and efficient method to suppress withdrawal symptoms.

A fiberoptic catheter placed in a liver vein facilitates continuous recording of the hepatic-venous oxygen saturation (ShvO2). We present a case where such a catheter was placed perioperatively in a patient undergoing hemihepatectomy. The liver venous catheter was positioned by guidance of the saturation curve and X-ray. The preoperative oxygen saturation in this liver vein was 80%. During the whole operation, the ShvO2 was continuously monitored. Blood for blood gas analyses was drawn before, during and after the occlusion of the ligamentum hepatoduodenale. Hemodynamic parameters were documented at the same time. The ShvO2 already decreased in the preparation period before the actual occlusion of the ligamentum hepatoduodenale. During the occlusion the ShvO2 dropped to an average of 30% with the lowest value being 13%. After reopening of the hepatic hilus the ShvO2 increased rapidly but did not reach preoperative values which were recorded not earlier than at the end of the operation. Duration and intensity of the decreased ShvO2 were recognized early by the liver venous catheter. It was demonstrated that desaturation of the hepatico-splanchnic region already occurred during the period of liver preparation before the ligamentum hepatoduodenale was occluded. Interventions to protect the liver from ischemia should therefore be applied some time before occlusion of the liver hilus.

The development of this computer program consists of two steps: first, the entry criteria for the ECLA therapy were established within a framework of an international evaluation of clinical data from 3 centres (Berlin, Marburg, Vienna). Here, inherent vagueness, uncertainty of the occurrence and limited availability of medical data are to be considered to establish a useful tool. Secondly, this was done by grouping and weighting of parameters by the system and the status of each patient or patient group was assigned by the percentage of fulfillment of the criterion.

The reduction in EC50 of etomidate in presence of L-NAME is comparable to that observed for thiopental or halothane, and thus may indicate an additional mechanism of action of etomidate. ","2390":"Impaired mental function, from clouding of consciousness to deep coma is often seen in patients with systemic inflammation. Diagnosis of this syndrome which is called \"septic encephalopathy\" is dependent on exclusion of other causes. The underlying mechanisms have only been defined in parts. The appearance of cerebral symptoms during an infection increases mortality. Primary symptoms of septic encephalopathy appear early, before other septic organ manifestations become apparent. The most sensible parameter for diagnosis of septic encephalopathy in comatose patients or under sedation is the EEG. It shows general alterations which increase parallelly to the severity of septic encephalopathy. Septic encephalopathy has to be considered a multifactorial event. In an early stage of the development of septic encephalopathy, bacteremia induces overproduction of cytokines and other mediators. This causes metabolic dysregulation with effects on the cerebral protein-, glucose and neurotransmitter metabolism. In addition, cytokines damage the blood-brain-barrier and exert direct cytotoxic effects. This results in histologic detectable neuronal damage. Further effects of the cytokine expression are perivascular edema and hemorrhage. The loss of metabolic regulation of the brain perfusion and local cerebral ischemia additionally contribute to the etiology of septic encephalopathy. A specific therapy is not yet known.","2391":"","2392":"","2393":"Thrombolytic therapy and \"stroke units\" are the main new concepts of stroke therapy that have been recently introduced into clinical practice. Although thrombolysis decreases the likelihood of disability by about 12% with regard to increased mortality and a tenfold increase of bleeding complications, debate over the value of thrombolytic therapy in acute ischaemic stroke continues. Local intra-arterial application of thrombolytic substances, however, is recommended for embolic occlusion of the basilar artery, since thrombolytic therapy reduces mortality in these patients from about 90% to less than 50%. \"Stroke units\" have been developed to enable rapid evaluation of stroke patients and to improve medical care of the patients. Several studies have shown that stroke unit care of the patients indeed improves outcome with decreased mortality, a better chance of the patient being discharged to home after hospital stay, shorter length of hospital stay, as well as fewer medical complications.","2394":"Treatment of severe haemorrhage caused by multiple trauma is a serious challenge to preclinical as well as clinical management. This is a case report of a motorcycle accident in which a patient sustained total amputation of both legs. Following adequate preclinical care, vital indication led to the patient's immediate surgical treatment. After initially successful haemodynamic stabilisation, the patient developed a horizontal deceleration trauma which resulted in an extended decollement of the muscles of the back and buttock. During the further clinical course, soft tissue bleeding occurred that affected the whole torso. Due to its extent, the bleeding could not be treated surgically, nor did it allow of haemodynamic stabilisation despite continuous massive transfusion. Retrospectively, the impressing amputation injury was treated successfully. In spite of all available surgical and intensive care efforts, however, the slowly demasking monstrous decollement with diffuse tissue bleeding proved to be an injury pattern leading to the patient's death.","2395":"","2396":"","2397":null,"2398":"Managers of industrial enterprises strive continually to improve the efficiency of production, distribution and service for their customers in order to be able to compete on the market.

A variety of tissues including neuronal tissue is able to synthesize NO catalysed by the enzyme NO-synthase. Three isoforms of this enzyme have been described: the endothelial NO-synthase, the immunologic NO-synthase, and the neuronal NO-synthase. Within the cell NO binds to a haeme-moiety of the enzyme guanylyl cyclase thus increasing concentrations of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). The NO metabolism is influenced by volatile as well as intravenous anaesthetics. The action of inhalational and intravenous anesthetics as well as other substances with hypnotic properties such as alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists has been demonstrated to be increased after disruption of NO-synthase activity by NO-synthase inhibitors. Different mechanisms of interaction of anaesthetics with the NO\/cGMP signal transduction pathway are conceivable: at the receptor level, at the NO-synthase, or at the guanylyl cyclase. Common denominator of the NO\/cGMP pathway is the control of cGMP. This second messenger regulates the activity of protein kinases, phosphodiesterases, and ion channels. However, the relevance of these structures for the hypnotic-anaesthetic action of general anaesthetics is currently unclear. Recent findings in mice deficient of neuronal NO-synthase activity and in animals chronically treated with NO-synthase inhibitors suggest that in addition to the NO\/cGMP-metabolism other signal transduction pathways exist that are necessary for the action of general anaesthetics.","2400":"","2401":"","2402":"Bronchial rupture is a rare but severe complication of intubation with a double-lumen tube. Cardinal symptoms are mediastinal and subcutaneous emphysema as well as pneumothorax. Larger injuries result in an air leak and the endtidal carbon dioxide decreases. The gas exchange may worsen drastically when mucosal prolapse or bronchial haemorrhagia lead to bronchial occlusion. Mediastinitis or sepsis can be the sequel of the opened mediastinum. If bronchial injury is suspected probably fibreoptic bronchoscopy is indicated. We report on a case of bronchial rupture due to overinflation of the endobronchial cuff or movement of the inflated cuff when repositioning the patient. The conservative therapy was successful in spite of the fact that surgical intervention is recommended in the literature following bronchial rupture. To avoid tracheobronchial injuries an adequate tubus size must be selected. The more flexible polyvinylchloride (PVC) tubes without a carinal hook should be preferred to the Carlens tube. An atraumatic intubation is promoted by leaving the stylet inside after the tip of the tube has passed the vocal cords. To identify the minimum occlusive pressure of the endobronchial cuff for lung isolation different methods are described and should be used. The cuff has to be deflated when the patient is repositioned and when one-lung-ventilation is not required.

The processing of this data by means of SQL queries was restricted to a few persons with special knowledge only. It was the objective of the project to create an evaluation tool which enables each member of the department to enter queries concerning topics such as efficiency records, quality management, training and research at any time. The tool was also intended to present results in an adequate form. Since 1997, the data of the performed anaesthesia procedures have been recorded using the online anaesthesia documentation software NarkoData Version 4 (ProLogic GmbH, Erkrath) within the AIMS. The recorded data sets have been imported into a relational Oracle data bank (Oracle Corporation). The commercial programme Voyant (Brossco Systems, Espoo, Finland) enables for the user to formulate SQL-requests (Structured Query Language) with the help of a graphic user interface and to present the results in a variety of graphics and tables. Repetition of the evaluation using the current data is possible at any time. During 1997 and the first quarter of 1998, the data of 26,030 anaesthesia procedures have been registered and stored in the anaesthesiological data base. 235 queries could be formulated with the SQL-capable graphic tool Voyant. They are available to each member of the department by the application of NarkoStatistik (IMS GmbH, Giessen) within the AIMS, together with the corresponding documentation (HTML pages).

Individual aspects and results from routine operation are presented, demonstrating the quality of the documentation and the value of information at the anaesthesiological workstation. The paper discusses which adaptations are necessary according to the experience gathered. For the installation of the system Apple Macintosh Clients (Apple Computer, Inc., Cupertino, California) and a File Server were integrated into the partially existing hospital network. The hospital network had to be enlarged during the project according to the Anaesthesiological requirements. The software of the Hospital Information System (HIS) and an HTML browser were installed at individual workstation computers in addition to the Anaesthesia documentation software NarkoData (ProLogic GmbH, Erkrath). The remote control software Timbuktu (Farallon, Alameda, USA) has been added to facilitate remote administration. The file administration programme FileWave (Wave Research, Berkeley, USA) is used for file distribution. Since 1995, all anaesthesia procedures have been documented with the system, either by online or postoperative recording. Since 1997, the recorded information has been stored in a relational Oracle 7 data bank (Oracle Corporation). From 1995 to 1997, 60,405 anaesthesiological procedures have been recorded with the help of this AIMS at 111 decentralised workstations. In 1997, 87.8% of the 21,130 performed anaesthesia procedures have been recorded online with the system and 12.2% postoperatively. From 1995 to 1997, the number of recorded procedures increased by 6.4% from 19,854 to 21,130.

Among other problems, focus is also on the problem whether a particular emergency care measure can be expected from the emergency physician. Much attention is devoted to a discussion on treating a patient against his will, this constituting a differentiated borderline case in emergency medicine. Another equally differentiated problem concerns the economic aspects--for example, whether an emergency treatment pays returns in terms of economy. This is no limitation in individual cases where emergency treatment is medically indicated, but it does exercise an influence on pre-planning the security level of emergency care services. There are no limitations for emergency services from a legal point of view imposed by the patient's age or his or her domicile in a home for the aged or infirm.","2412":"","2413":"","2414":"We report about a 30-year-old female patient with terminal renal failure, undergoing allogenic renal-transplantation after two and a half years on hemodialysis.

Its definite reason is unknown. Patients with cardiovascular or pulmonary diseases are endangered by postanaesthetic shivering. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of nefopam in prophylaxis of shivering. Additionally we investigated the influence of nefopam on haemodynamic parameters and on the time until extubation. 30 patients (ASA I-II) were randomly allocated in a double-blind fashion to one of two groups to receive directly after the end of isoflurane application either nefopam (0.15 mg\/kg) or placebo (0.9% saline). The period of anaesthesia had to be longer than 60 minutes. All patients received a premedication with lorazepam (0.02 mg\/kg) 30-45 minutes prior to surgery. Induction of anaesthesia was standardised: fentanyl (3 micrograms\/kg), thiopentone (5 mg\/kg), atracurium (0.4 mg\/kg). Intraoperatively a mixture of isoflurane, nitrous oxide (60%) and oxygen was used to maintain anaesthesia. The following parameters were evaluated: Age, sex, duration of operation and anaesthesia and the time between the end of application of volatiles and extubation. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), rectal temperature and O2-saturation were measured at predefined data points. Postoperatively the consumption of analgesic was documented. The severity of shivering was classified in five grades. In the control-group nine patients shivered (60%), whereas in the nefopam group only one patient (6.6%) shivered (p &lt; 0.05). In comparison to the placebo group we observed in the nefopam group a significantly decreased HR 30 and 60 minutes postoperatively (p &lt; or = 0.007 and p &lt; or = 0.002).

All patients underwent two propofol-based anaesthesias for leg vein surgery on both legs within 2-4 days. The patients were randomised in two treatment groups where Group A (n = 15) received the investigational drug for the 2nd anaesthesia and the control drug for the 1st anaesthesia. The order of drug application was reversed for Group B (n = 15). The propofol induction doses, the maintenance doses, and the side effect profiles were evaluated for the purpose of comparing the two propofol emulsions. The study showed no differences in the efficacy of the two propofol emulsions. Furthermore, the side effect profiles were almost identical and did not reveal any unknown side effects of propofol. The results clearly demonstrate that both propofol emulsions are comparably well suited for vascular surgery anaesthesia.

","2424":"The conventional laryngeal mask airway (\"Standard\" laryngeal mask airway SLMA is of outstanding importance in the management of the difficult airway. The intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA, commercial name Fastrach) has become available recently. First results indicate that the excellent ventilation characteristics of SLMA are maintained, but in addition blind intubation is successful in more than 90% of patients with normal anatomy as well as with difficult intubation. We present the use of ILMA, compare the potential of the two laryngeal mask types in difficult intubation by own results, present the results of a first symposium on the ILMA held at Jersey in December 1996, the role of the SLMA in difficult intubation as proposed by the American and the French Societies of Anaesthesiology, as well as an outlook on possible uses of the ILMA in the light of the available results. The SLMA was prospectively used between 1992 and 1997 for 66 operations in 55 patients with difficult intubation (laryngoscopic view Cormack grade IV, n = 24; grade III, n = 35; grade &lt; III, n = 7). 48 operations were performed after resection of a facial carcinoma, 14 on patients without carcinoma who could not be intubated conventionally, 5 on patients with periglottic pathology, and on 50 normals. The ILMA was used on 150 patients between 11\/1996 and 11\/1997, 106 had normal anatomy, 33 were difficult to intubate (Cormack grade IV, n = 12; grade III, n = 21), 24 had a reduced mouth opening of &lt; or = 2.5 cm awake, 14 of these also were difficult to intubate. Ventilation was superior to a face mask (FM): (SLMA: ventilation not sufficient (SaO2 &lt; 90% &gt; 30 sec) with a FM in 22 operations compared to 5 with a SLMA; ILMA: ventilation not sufficient with a FM in 7 operations compared to 3 with an ILMA). Blind intubation through a SLMA had a success rate of 50% and 34% in 50 normals and in 32 operations with difficult intubation after a mean of 2.6 intubation attempts each. The success rate per intubation attempt for the SLMA was 22% in normals and 13% in difficult intubation. Through an ILMA, blind intubation was successful in 92% of normals, 5 of them with immobile spine, in 91% in patients with difficult intubation, and in 83% in patients with reduced mouth opening. The success rate per intubation attempt was 60% in normals, 46% in difficult intubation, and 46% in reduced mouth opening, with a success rate for the first intubation attempt of 57%. This compares favourably with results presented at the Jersey symposium in 554 patients. The ILMA maintains the superb ventilation potential of a SLMA in difficult intubation but doubles the success rate of blind intubation irrespective of anatomical difficulties, with a 50% success rate during the first intubation attempt. Possible uses of the ILMA may be in difficult intubation situations including immobile spine, in cannot ventilate--cannot intubate situations comparable to a SLMA with an improved chance of successful intubation, and perhaps as a device for ventilation and intubation for untrained people. The use of the ILMA can be trained during everyday practice. Expert assessment of successful endotracheal tube position is mandatory. ","2425":"The intravenous anaesthetic ketamine is a racemic mixture of two equimolar doses of enantiomers. After stereoselective separation, the right-handed S(+)-isomer is now clinically available. Since anaesthetic and analgesic pharmacological studies have shown that S(+)-ketamine is approximately two times as potent as racemic ketamine, the clinical effects of S(+)-ketamine were evaluated in comparison to ketamine-racemate at dose relation of 1:2 in several therapeutic investigations. The studies disclosed that both drugs caused a similar activation of the endocrine stress response and a comparable stimulation of the sympathoadrenergic system. However, application of S(+)-ketamine was associated with a remarkably smoother emergence period, a profound postoperative analgesia, a more rapid recovery of cerebral functions, and a greater preference by the study persons. The incidence of psychotomimetic phenomena appeared to be negligibly less after S(+)-ketamine in comparison to racemic ketamine, but their quality was described as far less unpleasant. Clinical use of S(+)-ketamine administered at one-half of the usual dose is thus not only associated with a reduction of undesirable adverse effects without altering ketamine's anaesthetic and analgesic potency, but also offers distinctive improvements due to the reduced drug load. Moreover, increasing experimental evidence supports a remarkable neuroprotective effect of S(+)-ketamine, which may become a promising drug for new therapeutic approaches to neuroprotection.","2426":"","2427":"","2428":"Two cases are described in which a dissociative stupor originating from conversion neurosis simulated a coma following a sustained trauma.

Thus the parallel description of the risk level of a patient both with the ASA classification and with particular risk parameters was examined critically. The hypothesis was tested that the documentation of both parameter groups in the running quality benchmarking projects does not lead to relevant information gain. As a pragmatic consequence we see the possibility to reduce the core dataset with significant reduction of the documentation workload. With machine readable protocols or online computer documentation nearly all anaesthesias in hospitals in Hamburg were documented with the DGAI core data set and transferred to the project office of EQS Hamburg since 1992. We compared the predictory power of single and combined risk assessments for the incidence of particular AVBs (grade 3 to 5) in elective anaesthesias with that of ASA-classification. In 257,878 elective anaesthesias AVBs were documented in 14.5% of cases. Besides one exception no superior prediction power for AVB incidence could be demonstrated for any special risk assessment as compared with the ASA-classification. This is also true for the AVBs decompensated cardiac insufficiency, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism and cardiac arrest which are associated with high lethality. We assume that the documentation of risk factors in the core data set as predictors can be abandoned without major loss of information. This would be a first step towards reduction of the amount of data in quality assurance to get a core of especially meaningful parameters. It would lead to an increase in acceptance of the method and thus to an increase in the validity of its results.

Animal studies have shown that modern highly purified and chemically modified haemoglobin preparations are free of toxic side effects, provide adequate volume replacement and have vasoconstrictive effects that enhance systemic vascular resistance and mean arterial pressures after haemorrhage and in models of nearly complete blood replacement. Microcirculatory effects of haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers are dependent on the respective organ and species in which they are applied and on their degree of purification and chemical modification. Because of different physico-chemical properties in comparison with red cells, haemoglobin solutions provide sufficient tissue oxygenation in areas with critically restricted perfusion even when applied in small doses. First studies in volunteers and patients showed efficacy and tolerability of different newly developed haemoglobin solutions during acute normovolaemic haemodilution and in perioperative blood replacement. However, only little information exists to date in terms of metabolism of haemoglobin preparations and their potential immunogenicity and immunosuppressive side effects. Technical problems with the clinical use of haemoglobin solutions arise because of interference of plasma haemoglobin with routine laboratory tests and oximetry. Future indications for haemoglobin solutions as an oxygen therapeutic allow for application of small doses of such preparations and may help to avoid major technical problems.

The percentage of patients with delayed onset ranging from after six months up to six years was as follows: 1992: 8.9% (of a total of n = 56), 1996: 28% (of a total of n = 79), and 1998: 54% (of a total of n = 46). Eleven cases of patients of the latter group were classified as life-threatening. 2. Recurrence of Angio-oedema. Furthermore, many patients experienced multiple episodes of angio-oedema because even clinicians in emergency departments are not familiar with the association between angio-oedema and ACE inhibitors. In our series from 1992 until early 1998 17% of 125 patients exhibiting angio-oedema had relapses with a maximum of seven events over a period of three years. 3. Widespread Use of ACE Inhibitors, Tactical Approach to Diagnosing Angio-oedema and Prevention of Relapses. Hence, from a practical point of view, it seems very useful to suggest that nowadays every angio-oedema is caused by ACE inhibitor treatment until it is definitely excluded by a thorough review of all medications. Thirteen ACE inhibitors gained more widespread application worldwide. Unfortunately, a large number of drug combinations (&gt; 93) are meanwhile on the market. Therefore, much effort is needed to improve the knowledge and awareness of this insidious adverse effect by well-documented case reports. Moreover, each case of ACE inhibitor-associated angio-oedema should be immediately brought to the attention of the practitioner\/cardiologist to emphasise that this class of antihypertensive agents is contraindicated in the affected person to prevent the occurrence of another potentially life-threatening event.","2451":"","2452":"","2453":"","2454":"","2455":"","2456":"","2457":"","2458":"","2459":"","2460":"","2461":"","2462":"Inhibition of phosphodiesterase III (PDE-III) by enoximone elevates cyclic AMP (cAMP) content and intracellular calcium in human cardiac muscle. An involvement of cAMP in the pathogenesis of malignant hyperthermia (MH) has been suggested, because a higher basal content of cAMP was found in skeletal muscles from MH susceptible (MHS) than in normal (MHN) individuals and swine. In this study the in vitro effects of enoximone on skeletal muscles and the possibility to distinguish MHS from MHN patients were investigated. Muscle biopsies from 37 patients with clinical suspicion for MH were obtained. The patients were first classified as MHS, MHE (equivocal result) or MHN by the caffeine halothane contracture tests according to the procedure of the European MH Group (EMHG). MHE-patients and patients with neuromuscular diseases were excluded from the study. Enoximone was added cumulatively every five minutes to surplus muscle specimens to obtain organ bath concentrations of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.2 and 1.6 mmol\/l. The in vitro effects of enoximone on muscle contractures and twitch were measured. Twelve patients were classified as MHS and 21 as MHN by the EMHG criteria. Enoximone induced contractures in skeletal muscles from all patients. MHS muscles developed contractures at significantly lower bath concentrations of enoximone than MHN muscles. Contractures of MHS compared to MHN muscles were significantly larger at bath concentrations of 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.2 mmol\/l enoximone. No overlap in maximum contractures was seen between MHS and MHN muscles at bath concentrations of 0.6 and 0.8 mmol\/l enoximone. Muscle twitch increased in both groups after administration of enoximone. The PDE-III-inhibitor enoximone induces contracture development in skeletal muscles. These contractures were attained at lower concentrations and were larger in MHS compared to MHN muscles. In vitro diagnosis of MH by a contracture test with enoximone appears to be possible. Furthermore, regarding these results a trigger potency for MH by enoximone could not be proved, but the use of enoximone in MHS patients might be dangerous. ","2463":"Rapid post-anaesthetic awakening and low hypnotic potency are two characteristic properties of the new opioid remifentanil. For clinical use remifentanil must be combined with another anaesthetic agent. Propofol is well-established for ambulatory anaesthesia, however, the properties of desflurane (low blood-gas solubility, rapid elimination) suggest this volatile anaesthetic to be a comparable alternative, particularly if rapid awakening is desired. The present study was designed to compare emergence times and haemodynamics for a combination of remifentanil wich hypnotic concentrations of either propofol or desflurane. Gynaecological patients, scheduled for elective laparoscopy, were studied at random. After oral premedication with diazepam 0.08-0.12 mg\/kg, anaesthesia was induced identically in both groups: remifentanil bolus (1 microgram\/kg), start of remifentanil infusion (0.5 microgram\/kg\/min), followed by propofol (approx. 2 mg\/kg) and cisatracurium (0.1 mg\/kg). For maintenance of anaesthesia remifentanil (0.25 microgram\/kg\/min) was combined with either desflurane (0.5 MAC = 3.0 vol%) or propofol (6 mg\/kg\/h). With termination of surgery anaesthetic delivery was discontinued simultaneously and recovery times were recorded. Heart rate and non-invasive blood pressure were recorded at defined points of interest. In total, 40 patients (desflurane n = 20, propofol n = 20) were studied in comparable groups. For both regimens, emergence after remifentanil-based anaesthesia was remarkably rapid between unconsciousness and complete recovery: In mean only 60 s elapsed from the onset of spontaneous breathing to the moment when patients could clearly state their name. In comparison, recovery times were significantly shorter after remifentanil-desflurane than after remifentanil-propofol: time to spontaneous ventilation 6.4 +\/- 2.8 vs. 9.6 +\/- 3.9 min (mean +\/- SD, p = 0.01); extubation 6.7 +\/- 2.8 vs. 9.8 +\/- 4.0 min (p = 0.02) and arrival at PACU 11.1 +\/- 3.4 vs. 14.7 +\/- 4.2 min (p = 0.005). The courses of heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were mostly similar in both groups with only minimal or moderate cardiocirculatory reactions during intubation or start of surgery. Remifentanil in combination with either desflurane or propofol, used for general anaesthesia during gynaecological laparoscopy, will facilitate a smooth haemodynamic course as well as a rapid emergence thereafter. Recovery times after remifentanil-based anaesthesia are significantly shorter with 3.0 vol% of desflurane than with 6 mg\/kg\/h propofol. Thus, desflurane appears to be a well-suited adjunct to remifentanil and an ideal alternative to propofol, if rapid recovery is required. Differences are best explained by the pharmacological properties of both coanaesthetics and their applied dosages. ","2464":"Although an increasing number of studies concerning postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) have been performed, we do not know, what anaesthesiologists think about this problem and how they handle it in their daily routine. A survey was performed involving anesthesiologists at 30 institutions of different size. 474 out of 1000 questionnaires were returned. When asked what kind of general anaesthesia they prefere in a woman at a very high risk to suffer PONV, the following answers were obtained: anaesthesia induction with propofol (78%), thiopentone (17%), etomidate (5%). Maintenance of anaesthesia with an inhalation anesthetic (44%) or with propofol (44%). The remaining 14% would use a combination of these techniques (6%) or neuroleptanaesthesia with droperidol (5%) or midazolam (1%). Only 10% of the respondants would omit nitrous oxide. There is no consensus about the optimal amount of intraoperative opioids. Fentanyl, alfentanil, and sufentanil are rated to contribute equally to the occurence of PONV, whereas opioids used for postoperative analgesia are thought to have substantial differences: piritramid is rated to be much less emetogenic than tramadol and morphine. 70% advocate routine antiemetic prophylaxis for high-risk patients (most often mentioned risk factors were: female sex: 85%, obesity: 81%, high doses of intraoperative opioids: 72%) and 23% administrate antiemetics even for all patients. Ondansetron and droperidol are suggested to be superior to metoclopramide, triflupromazine, dimenhydrinate, and transdermal scopolamine. However, metoclopramide is the drug of first choice for more than 50% of the respondants followed by droperidol, whereas only 29% use ondansetron as a first line drug. An unexpected high number of anaesthesiologists (13%) have experience with non-pharmacological methods for prophylaxis and treatment of PONV. Acupuncture\/acupressure (10%) was most often mentioned. A great majority (93%) stated, that PONV is a relevant problem, that still remains unsolved. This proofs the need for further controlled studies. ","2465":"The incidence of postoperative emetic symptoms in patients varies between 3 and 91%. Nausea and emesis remain the most common as well as unpleasant side-effects experienced by patients following general anaesthesia, both in the ambulatory and non-ambulatory care setting. Furthermore, emesis carries the risk of severe postoperative complications and is associated with additional costs. Multiple factors are associated with an increased risk of developing postoperative nausea and emesis including age, gender, weight, preexisting disease, as well as anaesthetic and surgical procedures. Routine antiemetic prophylaxis is not currently advisable in patients with a low Emesis Risk, due to undesirable side-effects of antiemetics and additional costs. However, anti-emetic prophylaxis is recommended for patients with an increased risk. Besides administration of antiemetics, other factors that may provoke postoperative emesis need to be considered such as gastric distension, early mobilisation, insufficient analgesia, choice of anaesthetic drugs. High-risk patients may be anaesthetized with propofol, if possible. If symptoms do develop in the recovery room, tight fitting oxygen masks should be avoided and adequate hydration and analgesia ensured. To avoid side effects, antiemetics should be administered in minimally effective dosages. If emesis persists, combination of antiemetic drugs with different profiles of receptor action may be particularly useful.","2466":"","2467":"","2468":"","2469":"","2470":"This case report deals with the very rare complication of an intraspinal haematoma: a 70 year old male underwent anticoagulation because of supraventricular dysrhythmias followed by two transient ischaemic attacks.

No primary complication was noted. Heparin therapy was started perioperatively, on the day of the operation. Sixteen days postoperatively, the patient resumed oral anticoagulation; 3 months later he developed a progressive cauda-equina-syndrome due to an epidural haematoma at the level of L2 to L4. This could be diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging, but not by computed tomography. Acute surgical decompression was performed.

MRSA was detected in 1.6% of patients and three members of staff (3.3%). Typing of these 31 MRSA-strains (first isolates) by macrorestriction analysis of chromosomal DNA revealed nine different genotypes. More than 60% of all isolates belonged to one type that was confirmed to be closely related to the \"South Germany\" epidemic strain. A strong correlation between severity of underlying disease and length of hospitalisation on the one hand and detection of MRSA on the other could be demonstrated. Detection of MRSA was significantly more common in patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, kidney failure, prolong respiratory treatment and in patients with prolonged phases of haemodynamic instability. It appeared that the mortality rate of MRSA-infected patients was higher (28.6%) than the mortality rate of all patients (6.5%).

We also examined acceptability to the surgeon. In a prospective study, a total of 105 patients (ASA I-III) was included. Provided with flexible LMs, patients were operated upon the third molars (n = 64), around the dentoalveolar area (n = 32) and extraorally (n = 9). The number of placing efforts, preoperative leakage pressure, cuff pressure and complications occurring during the course of anesthesia were recorded. After the operation, the procedure was compared to endotracheal anesthesia (ETA) by the surgeon. A retrospective study comparing LM with ETA was performed on 1395 patients examining the time in between two operations, the period from the end of operation to the beginning of control of vital signs in the recovery room, and the time spent in the recovery room. The number of patients necessitating a change of anesthesia from LM to ETA was recorded. In 33 patients (31%), intraoperative leakage due to dislocation was observed. 33 patients (31%) had obstruction of the airway. Only when leakage occurred together with obstruction of the airway, SaO2 fell below 94% (n = 11). This was seen in particular during exposure of the wisdom teeth. In 2 of these cases, SaO2 decreased below 70 or 34% respectively. Aspiration of blood, gastric juice or dental and bone fragments was not observed. In one case, ETA became necessary. 19 patients complained of local pains (cough, sore throat, dysphagia). Operative conditions for the surgeon were comparable to oral ETA in 79% of the cases. The time in between two operations decreased about 35%, the period from the end of operation until first control of vital signs in the recovery room was reduced of about 41%, and the time spent in the recovery room decreased by 37% when compared to ETA. Out of 1111 anesthesias performed with the LM, 17 had to be exchanged for ETA. Leakage due to dislocation of the LM and airway obstruction only leads to a relevant risk of SaO2 to drop if both components occur simultaneously. With increasing experience and close cooperation between surgeon and anesthesiologist, they may be almost completely avoided so that even exposure of the lower, wisdorri teeth will seldom iiecessiiate the LM to be replaced by ETA. In relation to the tongue depressor, cuff pressure should be kept at low levels in order to obtain better flexibility of the LM. The LM provides sufficient protection against aspiration of intraoperative fluid in the pharynx. Acceptability to the surgeon is high because of good operative conditions and shortened periods in between two operations when compared to ETA. Improved protective reflex responses after the operation and its advantages when used in patients with tightness of the jaw make the LM a suitable instrument for anesthesia in oral and dental surgery. ","2479":"The treatment of patients suffering from chronic neuropathic pain remains a clinical challenge, particularly in cases where opioid therapy fails to provide sufficient pain relief. Spinal sensitization might be one cause for induction and maintenance of such states of pain, frequently accompainied by symptoms like allodynia, hyperalgesia and temporal summation of second pain. Experimental data concerning the role of NMDA-mediated processes in central sensitization and the effects of NMDA receptor antagonists in different models of neuropathic pain are reviewed. In clinical trials ketamine and other NMDA receptor blocking agents caused a significant reduction of hypersensitive states of pain, but nearly all authors described psychomimetic and other side effects. Aminoadamantanes like memantine and amantadine also have NMDA blocking properties and are widely used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Further clinical studies may reveal whether these substances will play a role as adjuncts in future pain treatment. Improving the efficacy of opioids by blocking NMDA receptor-mediated activity constitutes another clinically relevant concept for pain management. Numerous experiments have shown synergistic effects of NMDA antagonists and opioids in analgesia, while the development of opioid tolerance was prevented.","2480":"","2481":"","2482":"","2483":"Excessive body building may be dangerous.

The abuse of insulin as an anabolic medication in this athletic community was followed by a case of severe hypoglycaemia in a body builder. A 30-year old male presented with cerebral symptoms of hypoglycaemia. Directly before an international competition he tried to stimulate muscle growth by using the hypoglycaemic stimulus to the growth hormone. To achieve this he injected 70 IE of a short-acting insulin subcutaneously, resulting in severe hypoglycaemia. After the initial administration of intravenous glucose by the paramedics, he lost consciousness and showed signs of convulsions. After orotracheal intubation by an emergency physician, despite of ongoing infusion of glucose the blood glucose concentration remained low as measured in the out-of-hospital setting. Finally administration of additional glucose and glucagon in the intensive care unit was able to stabilize the metabolic system.

We focussed on the evoked potentials, the results having prognostic relevance and being useful in the anatomical localisation of the pathological process. The Glasgow coma scale, neuroradiological findings and the data of the outcome status after hospital or rehabilitation discharge were therefore obtained. We could show in distinct cases how evoked potentials could make a contribution to localise a pathogenic process. Failures in peripheral nerves, brachial plexus, myelin, brainstem and cerebrum were detected, respectively excluded. In the vast majority of cases, suspected, symptoms were very precisely predicted. This was especially evident in patients suffering from head injury, hypoxia and spinal cord injury. We found that a good outcome can be expected even with high intracranial pressures if the repeatedly registered central conduction time stays normal. We conclude that non-invasive evoked potentials do enrich the bedside diagnostic pattern in sedated intensive-care unit patients. While neuroradiological methods only allow statements on morphological changing, evoked potentials demonstrate the functional status of the peripheral and central nervous system. This method is easy to learn and the cost involved is justified both financially and from the viewpoint of personnel expenditure. ","2488":"Comparison of the influence of desflurane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane on the parameters of cortical somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP). A total of 41 patients were randomly allocated to either the isoflurane, desflurane or sevoflurane group. Following induction with propofol and intubation, concentration of the volatile anaesthetic was kept constant at 1.3, 1.0, and 0.7 MAC for 15 minutes each in randomised sequences. No opioids or N2O were used. Cortical somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded following median nerve stimulation at the wrist with 1.5 times motor threshold current. SEP were evaluated for latencies of peak N20 and P25 as well as peak-to-peak amplitude N20P25. Measurements at the end of the 15 minute equilibration intervals were compared by analysis of variance for repeated measurements. Latencies and the logarithm of the amplitudes were assumed to be normally distributed. SEP could be recorded in all patients and at all concentrations. Latency of cortical SEP increased with anaesthetic concentration in a linear manner. No differences in latency increase were found between the three anaesthetics (ANOVA). In contrast, the decrease in amplitude with increasing anaesthetic concentration was non-linear. It was large from control to 0.7 MAC, but small in the range between 0.7 and 1.3 MAC. Amplitude reduction was larger with isoflurane than with sevoflurane or desflurane. 1) Sevoflurane and desflurane are better suited for anaesthetic management during intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring than isoflurane, because SEP amplitudes are better preserved. 2) SEP amplitude is less altered by changing anaesthetic concentrations in the concentration range from 0.7 to 1.3 MAC than SEP latency.

HIT type I is mild thrombocytopenia probably caused by a direct proaggregating effect of heparin and occurs during the first few days of heparin treatment. No specific treatment is necessary. HIT type II is a severe thrombocytopenia mediated by an immunologic mechanism where antibodies against heparin\/platelet factor 4 (PF4) complexes play a major role. Thrombocytopenia usually commences 4-14 days after the onset of heparin administration. The incidence of HIT type II is below 3% and even lower when low-molecular weight heparin is used. The possible occurrence of life-threatening thrombembolic events may complicate the course of HIT type II. Diagnosis of HIT type II by clinical features alone is often difficult. A few laboratory tests are pertinent for diagnosing HIT type II including the 14C-serotonin assay, the heparin-induced platelet activation test and the heparin\/PF4 ELISA. Immediate cessation of heparin administration is essential in the treatment of patients with HIT type II, if need be even without waiting for the result of the antibody search test.

Furthermore it is possible to place an intramyocardial probe into the myocardium to observe the intramyocardial partial oxygen tension for several days.

In these three patients pathological intragastral CO2 values are accompanied with those in pathological intramyocardial PTIO2. The efficiency of therapeutical measures--such as volume and catecholamine substitution--can be documented by monitoring intragastral CO2 and intramyocardial PTIO2. It needs to be established whether intragastral CO2 is a parameter responding earlier than intramyocardial PTIO2 as is suggested by the findings in these three patients.","2493":"Several studies documented higher complication rates after cardiac surgery in patients with splanchnic hypoperfusion. Although it is prone to errors, gastric tonometry probably is the method of choice for detecting splanchnic hypoperfusion. While there are many reasons for splanchnic hypoperfusion, low cardiac output because of hypovolemia is one of the important ones in cardiac surgery. Thereby endogenous vasoactive substances, such as angiotensin II and the kinins, might be of special interest. Following approval from the local ethics committee, 40 patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery were studied. Every patient received a TRIP NGS Catheter (Tonometrics Division Instrumentarium Corp., Helsinki, Finland). Using radioimmunoassays and chromatography angiotensin II and bradykinin was measured before, during and immediately after cardiopulmonary bypass. Using saline tonometry gastric mucosal CO2 was measured ten times perioperatively. Patients were shifted into two groups by dichotomization at the median of gastric mucosal pH (pHi) and the pCO2 gap (gastric mucosal pCO2-arterial pCO2) before surgery. Volume substitution, use of vasoactive drugs, haemodynamic instability and time of extubation were documented. During cardiopulmonary bypass group I (pHi &lt; 7.32 and CO2 gap &gt; 3.85 mmHg) showed higher expression of angiotensin II and lower expression of bradykinin then group II (pHi &gt; 7.32 and CO2 gap &lt; 3.85 mmHg). The most significant difference was found on bypass. Immediately post bypass there was still a difference in the bradykinin expression. Before bypass no differences was found. In group I significantly more volume had to be substituted for haemodynamic stabilisation. These patients needed more often vasoactive drugs and in tendency were extubated later. At the time of extubation no group-difference was found as in the pHi as in the CO2 gap as in the amount of substituted volume. Patients with previous high pHi and low CO2 gap had lowest respectively highest values at the time, when fluid-balance was most negative. Splanchnic hypoperfusion in cardiac surgery probably correlates with hypovolemia and therefore leads to vasoconstriction, wich is shown in higher expression of angiotensin II and lower of bradykinin. Gastric mucosal tonometry in cardiac surgery probably detects hypovolemia and therefore predicts haemodynamic instability. Therefore gastric mucosal tonometry could probably be used as a therapeutical sign for a sufficient cardiac output and therefore for tissue oxygenation in general.

All patients were admitted to the SICU post-operatively. The variation of prCO2-values was greater in multiple injured patients. Their prCO2-values began in a lower range compared to patients with scheduled operation, became higher at the end of the first SICU-day and remained higher thereafter. They had a higher fluid turnover and needed more catecholamines.

Since this region with its unique both parallel and serial blood supply net comprises several organs with different metabolic performance, among which moreover the synthetic activity of the liver has to be taken into account, tonometric data have to be interpreted independently from blood flow and oxygen transport and uptake in this region. In fact, tonometry is an integrative parameter for perfusion, oxygenation and cellular energy balance. Therefore, it more completely reflects the complex anatomical and physiological conditions.","2496":"Gastrointestinal tonometry is a minimally-invasive method of assessing splanchnic perfusion.

Thus, in the treatment of septic shock the specific effects of ino-tropic drugs on the splanchnic perfusion are of particular interest. To give strict recommendations for monitoring and for therapeutic strategies in the treatment of gastrointestinal failure in patients with sepsis is difficult not only due to the lack of data on clinical outcome and organ dysfunction, but also due to some limitations in the methods applied to assess splanchnic perfusion and oxygenation. A reasonable approach in the management of splanchnic underperfusion in septic patients includes: Measurement of gastric mucosal pH or CO2-gap because it is the only method for the assessment of splanchnic perfusion which can be useful in the clinical routine. Adequate volume loading likely is the most important step in the supportive treatment of patients with septic shock. Unfortunately, what kind of fluids, endpoints, and monitoring techniques should be used is still controversial. Nevertheless, techniques allowing us to achieve and tightly control volume loading and regional perfusion, e.g. the measurement of pHi or CO2-gap, may be helpful. Patients with high DO2 have had better outcome. However, measurement of parameters assessing global and regional oxygenation may be superior than to guide therapy by DO2. To maximize DO2 by the use of very high dosages of catecholamines can be harmful. The recommendation to use dobutamine as catecholamine of first choice seems to be justified. In critically ill patients, no negative effects of norepinephrine on regional perfusion have been demonstrated provided the patient is adequately volume resuscitated and the DO2 is normal or slightly elevated. Therefore, after volume resuscitation and treatment with dobutamine, norepinephrine should be used for achieving an adequate perfusion pressure. Epinephrine and dopamine should be avoided because they seem to restribute blood flow away from the splanchnic region. There are no convincing data yet to support the routine use of low dose dopamine or dopexamine in patients with sepsis. These recommendations are limited by the lack of outcome studies and optimal methods for the assessment of splanchnic perfusion\/oxygenation.","2501":"Continuous oxygen supply to the tissues is one of the many important factors in intensive care. However, as a basic requirement for the structure and function of higher developed organisms energy production by oxydative metabolism is of outstanding importance, because there is no significant storage of energy and anaerobic metabolism is insufficient. The determinants of oxygen supply--blood flow and oxygen content--are well known. The system stands out for its extensive ability to compensate imbalances. Nevertheless one has to bear in mind also rather trivial disturbances like insufficient respiration and hypovolemia. Absolute values of global parameters, however, provide no information on the oxygen supply of individual organs that are variably susceptible to hypoxia. Regional perfusion and tissue respiration are influenced by various factors. Together with systemic components the physiologic oxygen transport along the oxygen cascade follows demand. Regardless of their position on the oxygen cascade malfunctions of oxygenation impair first the function and eventually the structure of the tissues. An utilisation block on the cellular level can prevent sufficient energy production despite optimized oxygen supply, the damage of reperfusion can intensify the effects of hypoxia. Typical haemodynamic patterns follow the tissue hypoxia. For maintaining an equilibrium between oxygen demand and supply it is important that oxygen consumption is also influenced by numerous factors. Only when an imbalance between oxygen supply and demand--an oxygen debt--is realized at an early stage, the critically ill patient can be saved from irreversible damage. In the field of intensive care the frequently latent tissue hypoxia is often a result of the chronic oxygen debt of individual, particularly vulnerable organs. Considering those aspects the intestinal mucosa is particularly suited for the monitoring of tissue oxygenation in the critically ill patient.","2502":"","2503":"","2504":"","2505":"","2506":"We report on a case of combined sciatic nerve block and 3-in-1 block for amputation of lower limb in an ASA IV-V patient 6 days after intraoperative cardiopulmonary resuscitation following induction of general anaesthesia. A 54-year old male patient was admitted for necrosectomy of a crural ulcer due to end-stage peripheral vascular disease and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. The patient also suffered from toxic cardiomyopathy. After induction for general anaesthesia the haemodynamic situation deteriorated progressively and ended up in cardiac arrest with consequent successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The operation was cancelled and the patient was admitted to the intensive-care unit, where he was extubated after 2 days of further haemodynamic stabilisation. Following development of a septic situation of the lower limb the patient was again admitted for amputation six days after the cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Regional anaesthesia was conducted with a combination of a sciatic nerve block via the posterior approach and a 3-in-1 block facilitated by ultrasonographic guidance. For each of the blocks we used 20 mL mepivacaine 1%. Sensory blockade was sufficient and the patient remained haemodynamic and respiratorily stable. The combined sciatic and 3-in-1 block is a rarely used technique, but for haemodynamically unstable patients it is a safe method for surgery of the lower limb.

However, whereas central core disease (CCD) and MH susceptibility (MHS) are closely associated, the relationship between MH and other NMD is still uncertain. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the MH status of individuals with specific NMD with the in vitro contracture test (IVCT) and to ascertain the risk for MH in individuals with NMD. After institutional approval and informed consent, 29 patients of 3-59 years of age (27.2 +\/- 17.3) with clinical suspicion for NMD and MH were enrolled in this prospective study. After excision of a skeletal muscle sample from M. vastus lateralis, patients were first classified as MHS, MH-equivocal (MHE) and MH-normal (MHN) by the IVCT according to the European MH protocol. Additionally, small muscle samples were excised from each patient for histological, histochemical and morphometric examination. Fourteen patients were diagnosed by the IVCT as MHS and 9 as MHN. In 6 patients MH status was equivocal. In six patients CCD was diagnosed, in 14 individuals muscular dystrophies and in 5 patients myotonias. Two patients had unspecific myopathies and one patient a carnitine deficiency syndrome. One patient with Friedreich's ataxia was investigated because of a MH crisis and classified as MHE. All CCD patients and two of three individuals with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy were tested as MHS. In this study 69% of the NMD patients were diagnosed as susceptible to MH with the IVCT. These results suggest, that NMD patients bear a high risk for MH. On the other hand, it has been discussed that in vitro contracture testing is not specific in NMD patients because skeletal muscle specimens from these patients have an elevated in vitro sensitivity. However, regarding our results and from a clinical point of view, patients with NMD should be treated like MHS individuals, unless they have undergone IVCT and were classified as MH-normal.

Alveolar PCO2 is a determinant of regional ventilation, whereas increased mixed-venous and arterial PCO2 may affect systemic and pulmonary haemodynamics. The aim of this study was to analyse the ventilation-perfusion (VA\/Q) distribution during controlled ventilation with permissive hypercapnia. The study was approved by the ethical committee of the Ernst-Moritz-Arndt University of Greifswald. Eleven patients with severe ARDS (lung injury severity score 2.77 +\/- 0.47) were studied. Intrapulmonary shunt (QS\/QT, % of QT), lung areas with 0.005 &lt; or = VA\/Q &lt; or = 0.1 (\"low\" VA\/Q, % of QT), lung areas with 10 &lt; or = VA\/Q &lt; or = 100 (\"high\" VA\/Q, % of VE), dead space ventilation (VD\/VT = VA\/Q &gt; 100, % of VE) and the mean distribution of ventilation (Vmean VA\/Q) and perfusion (Qmean VA\/Q) were determined by the multiple inert gas elimination technique during normocapnic (NC) and hypercapnic (HC) mechanical ventilation. In addition, systemic mean arterial and pulmonary arterial pressure, cardiac output (CO) and arterial and mixed venous partial pressures for oxygen (PaO2, PvO2) and carbondioxide (PaCO2, PvCO2) were assessed. Low-volume pressure-limited ventilation was associated with moderate hypercapnia (PaCO2 = 61 +\/- 12 mmHg vs. 39 +\/- 6 mmHg, p &lt; 0.01). QS\/QT increased (28 +\/- 16% [NC] vs. 36 +\/- 17% [HC], p &lt; 0.05), whereas Qmean VA\/Q decreased from 1.01 +\/- 0.37 (NC) to 0.65 +\/- 0.49 (HC), (p &lt; 0.01) and Vmean VA\/Q decreased from 1.54 +\/- 0.58 (NC) to 1.12 +\/- 0.93 (HC) (p &lt; 0.05).

PaO2 was almost unchanged, but PvO2 increased significantly from 40 +\/- 4 mmHg (NC) to 49 +\/- 7 mmHg (HC) (p &lt; 0.01). The mechanical ventilation with permissive hypercapnia may increase shunt due to alveolar derecruitement and an impaired hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.

After premedication with Flunitrazepam (2 mg p.o.) on the evening before and 1 hour prior to surgery anaesthesia was induced with Flunitrazepam (4-6 micrograms kg-1). Fentanyl (3 micrograms kg-1) und Etomidate (150 micrograms kg-1) and the patients were ventilated via face mask with 50% N2O in oxygen. Patients were randomly allocated to one of four groups, and, 15 min after induction of anaesthesia, received equipotent doses of either Pancuronium (0.09 mg kg-1, n = 10). Pipecuronium (0.08 mg kg-1, n = 10), Atracurium (0.6 mg kg-1, n = 10), or Vecuronium (0.1 mg kg-1, n = 10) injected over 20 seconds via a central venous catheter. Cardiovascular variables were determined in the awake patient, 15 min after induction of anaesthesia and following administration of the respective muscle relaxant. In addition, plasma histamine concentrations were assessed before and after relaxation. Evoked muscular response to TOF simulation of the ulnar nerve (plethysmo-mechanogram) was continuously recorded to determine the onset of neuromuscular blockade. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure and cardiac index significantly decreased in all patients following induction of anaesthesia while systemic vascular resistance remained unchanged. Only Pancuronium caused a significant increase in heart rate (53 +\/- 11 to 61 +\/- 15 min-1) whereas cardiac index and mean arterial pressure did not change significantly. No other neuromuscular blocking agent caused any changes in the cardiovascular variables measured and histamine plasma concentrations remained within the reference range in all of the four groups with no differences detectable between groups. All investigated neuromuscular blocking agents exhibited marked cardiovascular stability which permits their use, being based exclusively on pharmacodynamic and pharmakokinetic considerations even in patients with coronary heart disease. If an increase in heart rate appears beneficial Pancuronium may be advantageous. ","2516":"In a prospective trial in 139 infants ASA classification I-II 13 observational items were scaled during the first postoperative hour (13 assessments). The items were drawn from the literature and chosen for economic purpose. Factor analyses (Principal component, Kaiser Criterion, Scree-test) were used for the elimination of useless items and for the identification of suitable ones. The discriminative properties of single items and different subsets of items to detect an analgetic demand were tested in discriminant analyses and variance analyses with repeated measurements. Due to insufficient variance four items had to be eliminated: \"nasolabial folding\", \"colour of the face\", \"sweating of the head\", and \"muscle tone\". The factor analysis if the remaining 9 items resulted in a one factorial solution. Neither the corrected item-scale-correlations nor the inter-item-correlations showed advantageous properties of single items compared with the others. For economic reasons two 5-item scales were chosen for further evaluation in regard to sensitivity, specify and validity. The items \"crying\", \"facial expression\", \"positioning of the legs\", \"positioning of the trunc\" and \"motoric restlessness\" built the Children's and Infants Postoperative Pain Scale (CHIPPS) whereas an Infants Postoperative Pain Scale (IPPS) contained the items \"crying\", \"facial expression\", \"positioning of the arms\", \"positioning of the trunc\" and \"motoric restlessness\". The latter five items had shown the highest factor loadings. The two systems had a high intern consistency with alpha &gt; 0.90 (p &lt; 0.01) with at least 73% explained variance. Inter-item-correlations and corrected item-scale-correlations showed no differences between the two scales. The discriminant analyses resulted in almost identic data for specify, sensitivity and predictive values of the IPPS compared with the CHIPPS. There was a significant interaction between repeated measurements and the supply of Piritramide and Ketamine, but not of Midazolam. Concurrent and constructive validation were positive for both systems, using administration of Piritramide as a criterion. For clinical purpose the CHIPPS should be preferred, because it has been proven to be valid in children up to 4 years of age and because controlled data on its sensitivity, specify, reliability and validity could already be presented.","2517":"","2518":"","2519":"","2520":"","2521":"The new volatile anaesthetic agent desflurane has a significantly lower blood-gas partition coefficient (0.42) than isoflurane (1.4), suggesting excellent intraoperative control of anaesthesia and rapid emergence and recovery from anaesthesia. However, only limited experience is available in geriatric patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. After approval by the local ethics committee and with written informed consent, 52 patients (&gt; or = 65 years old, ASA class II or III) scheduled for major abdominal surgery were randomised to receive either desflurane (DES) or isoflurane (ISO) for maintenance of anaesthesia. After oral premedication with midazolam 3.75-7.5 mg, anaesthesia was induced with etomidate 0.2-0.3 mg\/kg and fentanyl 3 micrograms\/kg. Vecuronium 0.1 mg\/kg provided muscle relaxation for endotracheal intubation. All patients were mechanically ventilated to maintain normocapnia. For maintenance of anaesthesia, DES or ISO was administered in 60% N2O and additional boluses of fentanyl and vecuronium were given as required. At the end of surgery, the neuromuscular blockade was reversed with neostigmine 0.02 mg\/kg and DES or ISO was discontinued at the end of skin closure. Episodes of bradycardia and tachycardia and hypo- and hypertension, the time from the end of anaesthesia to extubation, opening eyes, squeezing hand, stating name and birthdate and to discharge from the recovery room were recorded. Until 360 minutes after the end of anaesthesia, the recovery of psychomotor functions was measured by means of simple reaction time tests, critical flicker fusion test, labyrinth test, ball bearing test, short and long-term memory test and digit symbol substitution test. The patient's well-being was documented with scores for pain, sedation and postoperative nausea and vomiting. Demographic data in both groups was similar (Tab. 1). Anaesthesia was significantly prolonged in the ISO group. No significant differences between groups were found for MAC hours and the total dose of fentanyl and vecuronium administered (Tab. 3). Intraoperative haemodynamics were comparable between both groups (Tab. 4). No episodes of increases in heart rate or blood pressure associated with rapid increases in DES concentration were seen. Early emergence parameters were faster in the DES group (Tab. 5). When compared to ISO, the overall test performance and testing ability was superior following DES. Psychomotor tests showed significantly better results up to 240 minutes after the end of DES anaesthesia (Tab. 7, Fig. 4). Comparing the postoperative well-being, there were mild advantages for DES (Tab. 6, Fig. 1, 2, 3). However, time to discharge of geriatric patients from the recovery room was significantly shorter in the DES group (median 171 vs. 215 min., p &lt; 0.05). Using a balanced anaesthesia technique, we found desflurane as suitable as isoflurane for geriatric patients. Additionally, due to the fast emergence from anaesthesia, an improved cooperativity was found. In the DES group overall better postoperative psychomotor performance resulted in a shortening of discharge times from the recovery room. Hence, desflurane anaesthesia may be advantageous in geriatric patients.

Tracheostomy may facilitate airway suctioning and improve patient comfort in the process of weaning. The purpose of the study was to assess our experience with PDT and to evaluate the complications in comparison with open surgical tracheostomy which is associated with complication rates ranging up to 50%. PDT was performed using the serial dilational technique described by Ciaglia (percutaneous tracheostomy introducer set, Cook Critical Care) by careful fibreoptic monitoring of the tracheal puncture and the tracheostomy tube insertion. Complications related to the procedure and late effects were recorded. 195 PDT were performed in adult intensive-care patients on prolonged mechanical ventilation. In 182 cases (93.4%) placement of the tube was successful without complications. Intraoperative complications occurred in 13 patients (6.6%) including bleeding (5), superficial lesion of the tracheal mucosa (3), pneumothorax (1) and others (4). After decannulation in 132 patients the tracheostoma closed spontaneously and the cosmetic and functional results were good. In 131 cases there was no clinical, radiographic and endoscopic evidence of symptomatic tracheal stenosis. Only in one patient 6 weeks after decannulation a relevant stenosis was seen. In 72 patients after median sternotomy no stomal wound infection and no mediastinitis was observed. PDT is a safe and practicable alternative technique which can be performed in the intensive-care unit with a lower risk of complications than open surgical tracheostomy. Endoscopic guidance prevents serious complications and apparently increases the safety of this procedure.

We performed this study to examine the properties of heat and moisture exchangers in comparison with hot water humidifiers and dry artificial ventilation. We measured inspired humidity with a special sensor in 41 patients after coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass. Three Heat and Moisture Exchangers (HME) and a hot water humidifier were used to humidity the inspired gas of artificially ventilated patients. Humidity measurements were compared. Hot water humidifiers produced the highest humidification (average of 38.4 mg\/l, 37-43 mg\/l); lowest humidification was produced by dry artificial ventilation (average of 8.7 mg\/l, 6-11 mg\/l). Heat and moisture exchangers (HME) produced humidity between 24 and 36 mg\/l. Highest humidification was produced by HME hygrobac s (average of 32.2 mg\/l, 31-36 mg\/l) and hygrovent s (average of 31.4 mg\/l, 29-35 mg\/l); lowest humidification was produced by HME hygroster (average of 28.6 mg\/l, 24-31 mg\/l). Multifactorial analysis shows a significant impact of the humidification method on the humidity of inspired gas. The multiple comparison procedure (Tukey) shows significant differences (alpha = 0.05) between all humidification techniques on inspired gas except the heat and moisture exchangers hygrobac s and hygrovent s. Hygrobac s and hygrovent s may be an alternative to hot water humidifiers. Further clinical studies of HMEs and hot water humidifiers will be necessary to evaluate the influence of inspired gas humidity on the outcome of artificially ventilated patients. ","2524":"Chronic hypertension is associated with structural as well as functional changes of the vasculature, in particular of the coronary, cerebral and renal circulation. It is important to realise that [1] functional changes are often the result of structural changes, [2] the longer lasting the hypertension, the slower and less complete the regression of structural changes, and [3] acute \"normalisation\" of arterial pressure in long-standing hypertension may initially induce functionally subnormal smooth muscle and\/or cardiac activity because the structure of the cardiovascular system is adapted to function at elevated pressures. Despite a multitude of studies, the impact of hypertension on peri-operative morbidity and mortality remains controversial. There are as many studies seeming to suggest that preoperative hypertension correlates with adverse outcome as there are studies that fail to establish such a relationship. When looking at the combined evidence, one is inclined to conclude that hypertension is a predictor of \"soft\" outcomes (e.g. peri-operative myocardial ischaemia and transient post-operative neurologic deficit) rather than an independent predictor of \"hard\" outcomes (e.g. unstable angina, myocardial infarction and cardiac death). In view of lack of convincing outcome data, it is impossible to recommend a generally acceptable management strategy for the hypertensive patient. Although, in general, a gradual reduction of blood pressure over a period of weeks to months is the optimal therapeutic approach, we will be hard-pressed delaying surgery for the sole purpose of \"better blood pressure control\". With full appreciation and detailed knowledge of the pathophysiology of hypertension, combined with sophisticated haemodynamic monitoring and interventions in the peri-operative period, acutely anaesthetising an inadequately treated hypertensive patient will probably not adversely affect his outcome. Delaying surgery for additional work-up may possibly improve outcome in patients with target organ disease, evidence of secondary hypertension, in the most severe forms of hypertension or sudden-onset hypertension.","2525":"","2526":"","2527":"","2528":"","2529":"","2530":"","2531":"","2532":"","2533":"","2534":"","2535":"","2536":"","2537":"The Clinical Grading Scale (CGS) was introduced to predict malignant hyperthermia (MH) susceptibility in adverse anaesthetic events. Because many of the clinical symptoms that occur during MH episodes are nonspecific, the CGS was designed as a tool to estimate the qualitative likelihood of MH. The purpose of this study was to compare the results of the CGS with the established in vitro contracture test (IVCT). 92 patients with a personal history for MH were tested for MH susceptibility with the IVCT according to the protocol of the European MH Group. All patients were also evaluated with the CGS. Clinical indicators for the CGS are rigidity, muscle breakdown, respiratory acidosis, temperature increase and cardiac involvement. There are additional indicators in case of a family history for MH. For each indicator 3-15 points are added to build a raw score; this raw score corresponds to a MH rank in the CGS that describes the likelihood of MH in the suspected event. The higher the raw score rank, the higher the likelihood of MH and vice versa. From 92 patients, 32 (35%) were diagnosed as MH-susceptible (MHS) with the IVCT, 47 (51%) were MH-normal (MHN), and 13 (14%) were MH-equivocal (MHE). One patient with MH-rank 1 (MH almost never) in the CGS was diagnosed as MHS; on the other hand no patient with MH-rank 6 (MH almost certain) in the CGS was diagnosed as MHN. However, the majority of patients (72%) were assigned to ranks 3 and 4 (MH somewhat less than likely\/MH somewhat greater than likely). The qualitative likelihood of MH could therefore not be clearly estimated. Our study shows that the MH-rank of the CGS corresponds poorly with the results of the IVCT. In any case the evaluation of an MH suspicious event depends on the availability of data of that event. It is often difficult to obtain sufficient data, especially if the event occurred a long while ago. In these cases the MH rank may underestimate the likelihood of MH susceptibility. On the other hand, overestimation is also possible because some of the scoring indicators depend on the anaesthesiologist's judgement only. At present, the use of the CGS is neither validated nor clinically feasible. The CGS cannot replace IVCT. ","2538":"Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a rare autosomally dominantly hereditary and potentially life-threatening disease. The prevalence of the genetic MH predisposition is estimated as 1:10,000 to 1:20,000. In Germany no data on the regional distribution are available. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation is to summarise and present the epidemiological data of all German MH laboratories. Nine German hospitals offer the specific in vitro contracture test to diagnose the MH predisposition. All German MH laboratories carry out the examination in accordance with the standardised protocol of the European Malignant Hyperthermia Group. The laboratories were asked to provide the number of all patients investigated, excluding those suffering from other neuromuscular diseases, separated according to diagnostic groups and their places of residence, the number of the identified MH-families as well as the number of the clinically suspected and investigated MH cases with their places of residence. Eight MH laboratories provided the requested data. Until September 1997 a total of 2620 patients were investigated. In 865 patients (34%) MH suspicion was confirmed (diagnosis: MHS). 1494 patients (56%) were released by investigation from MH-suspicion (diagnosis: MHN). In 261 patients (10%) the MH-predisposition remained unsolved (diagnosis: MHE). 580 MH families were identified. Among 2620 patients 757 were clinically suspected MH cases. 35% of these suspected MH cases were classified as MHS, 10% as MHE and 55% as MHN. The documentation of the patients places of residence classified as MHS and MHE into a map of Germany demonstrates an exhaustive distribution with an increased regional prevalence in the areas of the MH laboratories. This concentration in the area of the MH laboratories becomes even more evident, when the places of residence of the MH suspected cases are demonstrated. In conclusion, the distribution of the MH predisposition is uniform and exhaustive in Germany. The presented regional concentration of clinically suspected MH cases among the MH laboratories is mainly interpreted as an expression of effective regional education and information. Considering the overall incidence of the MH predisposition as described above only 15-20% of the MH patients have so far been identified. The MH laboratories have already released about 10,000 patients from the suspicion of MH predisposition. A preliminary prevalence of at least 1:60,000 to 1:80,000 in Germany can be estimated according to the presented data.","2539":null,"2540":"The primary scope of economic analyses is the quantification of the costs (input) in relation to the results (outcome, output). According to whether a similar or different dimension of outcome parameters is chosen, it is possible to differentiate between cost minimisation, cost effectiveness, cost benefit and cost utility analyses. Decision trees and sensitivity analyses serve to develop or examine cost outcome studies. The principal perspective of economic analysis is of crucial significance. In the present overview of cost control programmes in clinical anaesthesia, the perspective chosen throughout is that of budget responsibility in a department of anaesthesiology. With regard to economic factors in clinical anaesthesiology, the cost of medical and nursing staff represents the largest cost block. It is, therefore, essential that personnel is efficiently employed, i.e. how the perioperative procedure is organised. In the area of material costs, blood products--including coagulation factors and plasma substitutes--are particularly cost intensive, followed by medical products and drugs, especially muscle relaxants and inhalational anaesthetics. In the perioperative context, the costs of anaesthesia personnel account for 5-15% of the total costs of patient care, while material costs account for 2-10%. In view of this small portion of the total costs, cost control programmes in anaesthesia can only make a relatively small contribution to reducing overall cost. However, it must be realised that anaesthesia care is vitally important for the perioperative process which means that in this context cost-effectiveness interventions have consequences that also affect other fields, e.g. postoperative pain service besides anaesthesia. In conducting economic analyses, cost considerations or reductions cannot be targeted alone, but must always also integrate outcome aspects so that costs and quality are regarded in relation to one another.","2541":"","2542":"","2543":"An infusion system that is insufficiently equipped with an alarm device in case the syringe pumps are obstructed, may gravely endanger patient safety.

A sensitive alarming system of syringe pumps may help to eliminate inappropriate drug delivery.

In the present prospective study the effect of total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol, alfentanil, vecuronium, and oxygen-air ventilation on bronchial mucus transport velocity (BTV) was investigated. 10 patients undergoing major abdominal surgery were included in the study. In all patients anaesthesia was induced and maintained with propofol, alfentanil, and vecuronium. Ventilation was assisted with a mixture of air and oxygen (FiO2:0.35). The BTV was measured preoperatively in the conscious patients one day before surgery while they received local anaesthesia with 10 ml of 1 percent lidocaine and after the end of the operation during intubation anaesthesia. BTV was determined with a small volume of albumin microspheres labelled with technetium -99m, which was deposited on the dorsal surface at the lower ends of the right and left main bronches via a catheter placed in the inner channel of a fibre-optic bronchoscope [7]. The study was approved by the ethics committee of our hospital.

TIVA produced a decrease of BTV in the right (9.7 vs 4.9 mm\/min) and left main bronchus (11.3 mm\/min vs 5.3 mm\/min). Total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol, alfentanil, and vecuronium depressed mucociliary flow in patients with healthy lungs. The period for recovery of mucociliary clearance and the possible disadvantage in patients with increased pulmonary risk (e.g. patients with chronic bronchitis and abdominal surgery) should be clarified in further studies. ","2546":"The interaction of activated granulocytes and endothelial cells influences not only capillary permeability but also increases pulmonary vascular resistance. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of endothelin-1 (ET-1) during the granulocyte-mediated increase in pulmonary pressure. The experiments were performed on isolated and ventilated rabbit lungs perfused with a blood-free buffer solution. Isolated, washed human granulocytes were injected into the pulmonary artery and stimulated by 10(-6) M N-formyl-L-leucin-methionyl-L-phenylalanine (FMLP). Pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) was continuously registered, and perfusate samples were taken to determine ET-1 and eicosanoid levels. To analyse the role of ET-1, six lung preparations were pretreated with the ETA receptor antagonist BQ123 (10(-6) M) prior to FMLP injection. To analyse the role of thromboxane A2, six additional lung preparations were pretreated with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor diclofenac (10 micrograms\/ml). Additionally, granulocytes were stimulated in vitro with FMLP for 15 min, and ET-1 concentration was measured in the supernatant. Immediately after FMLP injection, PAP increased to 18.5 +\/- 1.6 mmHg, descending to values 4.8 +\/- 0.8 mmHg above the baseline after 15 min. At this time, ET-1 could be detected in the perfusate. The concentrations of the cyclooxygenase products thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin remained nearly unchanged during the observation period. Pretreatment with the ETA receptor antagonist BQ123 significantly reduced the pressure response after FMLP injection (p &lt; 0.01 at 5 and 10 min; p &lt; 0.05 at 15 and 30 min). Pretreatment with the cycloocygenase inhibitor diclofenac failed to inhibit the pressure reaction evoked by activated granulocytes. In contrast to this, ET-1 was not detected after in vitro stimulation of granulocytes. ET-1 is involved as a mediator of pulmonary vasoconstriction due to granulocyte activation. Since in vitro FMLP-stimulation of human granulocytes did not induce ET-1 production, it seems likely that isolated activated granulocytes would not produce ET-1, but provoke the endothelial cells to release ET-1 in the pulmonary circulation.

BHR is an important feature of clinical asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), allergic rhinitis, atopy, upper respiratory tract infections and smoking. This review will outline some important aspects of the pathophysiological basis of BHR, i.e., neural and inflammatory mechanisms. Furthermore, it should assist in identifying patients at risk and update perioperative anaesthetic considerations. Prophylaxis of airway reflex activation and an appropriate anaesthetic plan should prevent airway constriction. Since tracheal intubation is the major risk factor to induce bronchospasm intubation should be avoided whenever possible and regional anaesthesia preferred. If tracheal intubation is unavoidable, propofol and ketamine can be recommended as induction agents. Prophylaxis of intraoperative bronchospasm and initial therapy, such as deepening of anaesthesia, inhalational administration of sympathomimetics and anticholinergics, and i.v. use of local anaesthetics and corticosteroids are outlined. Despite its popularity theophylline offers little benefit during anaesthesia.

This article outlines the new German health care laws and their impact on the statutory health care system, hospitals and anaesthesia departments. The German health care system provides coverage for all citizens, although financial support from the public sector is on the downgrade. Hence, pressure to reduce public sector health care spending is likely to continue in the near future. Hospital costs account for one-third of total health care spending in Germany, and hospitals are facing increasing economic constraints: the volume and the charges for specific medical treatments are negotiated between the hospitals and the insurance agencies (or sickness funds) in advance. Only part of hospital care is still reimbursed on the basis of a per diem rate, and an increasing number of services are based on fixed payments per case or treatment. Reducing the costs for this treatment is therefore of utmost importance for hospitals and hospital departments. The prospective payment system and the pressure to contain costs demand a controlling system that allows for cost accounting per case. However, an economic evaluation must include comparative analysis of alternative therapeutic options in terms of both costs and outcome. Economic aspects challenge the traditional relationship between physicians and patients: doctors are still the advocates of their patients, but also act as agents for their institutions. Nevertheless, not only economic issues, but also ethical priorities and the value of an anaesthetic practice must be considered in the era of cost containment. Anaesthetists must be actively involved in providing high-quality care with its obvious benefits for the patient and be able to resist efforts to cut out expensive treatment modalities regardless of their benefits.","2550":"","2551":"We report on a 30-year old female patient with suspected fulminant pulmonary embolism and cardiac arrest following ambulatory arthroscopy nine days before the event. After 15 minutes of unsuccessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on the ambulance the patient was transferred to the emergency unit of a hospital and was treated with bolus injection of 50 mg t-PA initially and 50 mg over the next two hours. Five minutes after the initial bolus the circulation could be stabilised and the patient could be extubated the next morning. The patient did not present any neurological deficit on the day of discharge nor did she show any bleeding complications. The time elapsing from notice to emergency service to arrival at hospital was about 35 minutes. In patients with massive and life-threatening pulmonary embolism thrombolysis offers an opportunity to manage this critical situation. Due to the serious prognosis of these patients the potential benefit of thrombolysis outweighs the lack of preceding diagnostic procedures and the risk of potential side-effects. In the light of an excellent outcome of this patient thrombolytic therapy with t-PA appears to be justified under continued CPR if fulminant pulmonary embolism is suspected.

The first informations concerning this topic reached England in late fall of 1846 and after that came to France and especially Paris. The German physician Aloys Martin from Munich who was living in Paris at that time was largely responsible for conveying the news about these new findings in medical science to the German-speaking nations. Controversial discussions concerning the anaesthetic properties of ether developed among the members of various scientific circles right after the news from America had reached the city--and many members of the \"Verein Deutscher Aerzte in Paris\" (Association of German Physicians in Paris) took part in them, Martin then was one of the club's most active members and repeatedly reported on the new method as a correspondent for the widely read \"Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung\": Documents discovered recently at the archives of the \"Leopoldinisch-Carolinischen Akademie\" of Halle provide an interesting insight into this association, whose members tried to find out more about the anaesthetic properties and side effects of ether carrying out a series of well appreciated self-experiments in the spring of 1847. The following text reports on the history of the \"Verein Deutscher Aerzte in Paris\" which has largely fallen into oblivion and emphasizes the importance of Aloys Martin whose name is strongly attached to the spread of the use of ether throughout the German-speaking countries.","2560":"There is controversy about relevant EEG signal changes indicating adequate or inadequate anaesthesia. Differences of drug-induced and nociceptive mediated signal changes have not been studied in detail. The present study investigates whether signal changes during decreases of depth of anaesthesia due to surgical stimulation depend on different isoflurane concentrations during sufentanil anaesthesia. Following IRB approval and written informed consent 28 patients (ASA: I; age 43 +\/- 11 y) scheduled for elective abdominal surgery were included in the study. Anaesthesia: propofol (2.0 mg\/kg) and sufentanil (1.0 micrograms\/kg). Following endotracheal intubation (vecuronium 0.1 mg\/kg) patients were normoventilated (P(ET)CO2: 36-38 mmHg). Randomly assigned to steady-state anaesthesia (group 1: P(ET)Isoflurane 0.2%, (14n); group 2: P(ET)Isoflurane 0.6%, (14n) during the start of surgery. Monitoring: heart rate (HF), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), P(ET)CO2, arterial oxygen saturation and rectal temperature. EEG (16 channels referenced to Cz; CATEEM, Medisyst, Linden) recorded 5 min before until 10 min after the start of surgery. EEG-analysis (FFT: 4s, 256\/s, 0.45-35.0 Hz): topographical distribution of power spectral densities (delta, theta, alpha 1, and alpha 2). Artifact control: ECG and EOG. Surgical stimulation resulted in increases of MAP in both groups (p &lt; 0.05 vs BL), whereas HR was only slightly affected in group 2 when compared with BL. Other variables except of EEG data did not change over time. In group 1 (0.2% isoflurane) surgical stimulation resulted in decreases of delta over the whole cortex (F2, C3, P3, O1) and in marked increases of alpha predominantly at central leads (C3)(p &lt; 0.05 vs BL). In group 2 (0.6% isoflurane) nociceptive stimulation was associated with decreases of faster waves (alpha: F3)(p &lt; 0.05 vs BL) and increases in delta at fronto-central areas (F3, C3)(p &lt; 0.05 vs BL). EEG recordings are useful in assessing pharmacodynamic drug effects. In contrast, intraoperative EEG recordings have a low correlation to clinical signs of changes in the anaesthetic state. Previous studies demonstrate paradoxical EEG-arousal reactions during isoflurane anaesthesia. The present data suggest that classical or even paradoxical EEG arousal due to nociceptive stimulation may depend on the isoflurane concentration. It seems reasonable that the ascending reticular formation is functionally blocked by isoflurane in a dose-dependent manner. ","2561":"Despite immense progress in intensive-care medicine, mortality rates of 30-70% in sepsis and SIRS are still an unresolved problem. Particularly the failure of respiratory and other vital functions is a major cause of death. Besides infectious stimuli (viruses, bacteria, fungi) a variety of non-infectious triggers (tissue damage, immune complexes, complement activation, etc.) can initiate the development of organ failure. These inflammatory reactions aim physiologically towards inactivation and removal of the stimulating agents as well as the induction of reparative processes. In states of prolonged activation of humoral and cellular mediator systems the natural host defence mechanisms react in an uncontrolled manner causing tissue damage and organ failure. So far there are no efficient therapeutic strategies to influence these complex inflammatory reactions. In the development of SIRS and sepsis, pro-inflammatory lipid mediators play a crucial role. Omega-3-fatty acids (omega-3-PUFAs) have shown anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic properties in a great number of experimental and clinical studies. These effects seem to be related to the uptake of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) into cellular membrane lipid pools and its subsequent metabolisation. After inflammatory activation EPA is released besides arachidonic acid (AA) and competes with AA for metabolisation via the cyclo- and lipoxygenase pathway. Compared to AA the derivatives of EPA have less pro-inflammatory and chemotactic characteristics. With regard to prophylactic and therapeutic consequences it appears reasonable to supplement omega-3-PUFAs to attenuate the inflammatory response by modulating the generation of lipid mediators during inflammation.","2562":"","2563":"","2564":"","2565":"","2566":"","2567":"","2568":"","2569":"","2570":"","2571":"","2572":"Due to the growing number of diagnostic and therapeutical procedures intensive-care patients must be transported intra- and interhospitally more often. These transports are among the most critical events during intensive-care therapy, with a high incidence of potentially life-threatening mishaps [23]. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible benefit of the combined application of pulse oximetry and capnometry for patient safety during transport. In a prospective clinical study 48 mechanically ventilated patients were allocated at random in 2 main study groups, 24 patients were investigated during interhospital transportation with an ambulance car, the other 24 patients during intrahospital transports. They were classified according to APACHE II and TISS. Blood pressure, heart rate and arterial blood gases were measured at eleven selected times. Twelve randomly chosen patients out of each main study group were monitored additionally with pulse oximetry and capnometry. The results were compared using the Mann-Whitney-U test. P &lt; or = 0.05 was considered significant. Thirty-four patients had a TISS more than 40. The mean APACHE II-Score was 14 +\/- 5. The overall incidence of potentially life-threatening mishaps was 9. Six out of these 9 occurred in the 24 patients with additional monitoring and were immediately detected by pulse oximetry or capnometry. The combination of pulse oximetry and capnometry offers the possibility to detect potentially life-threatening problems in ventilated patients during transport. This allows for early therapeutical consequences and may help to reduce the risk of transports. ","2573":"In the Federal Republic of Germany limits for the chronic exposure to nitrous oxide and volatile anaesthetics have been prescribed by legislation. According to the technical rules for the handling of hazardous substances TRGS 402 it is legal to measure a single substance in a mixture of hazards, unless the behaviour of all substances is known. Studies about corresponding concentrations of nitrous oxide and volatile anaesthetics in anaesthetic working areas have not yet been carried out. During one working week each the concentrations of nitrous oxide, enflurane and desflurane were measured by infrared spectrometry in a working area equipped with air condition and in a non-ventilated operating theatre. Corresponding concentrations of nitrous oxide were measured from the same gas samples. Statistical calculations showed linear correlations of the enflurane and nitrous oxide concentrations in all anaesthetic areas. No linear regression was found between the desflurane and nitrous oxide concentrations. In the working area where desflurane anaesthesias were carried out, significantly higher concentrations of nitrous oxide were observed. Nevertheless the Chi2-test showed no significant differences in the distribution of categorised measurement values. Although it is not possible to calculate desflurane concentrations from the nitrous oxide concentrations, measurement of nitrous oxide as leading substance is a valid procedure to assess the exposure of the anaesthesiology workplace to nitrous oxide and volatile anaesthetics. Significant higher nitrous oxide concentrations during desflurane anaesthesia result from early extubation of patients expiring higher concentrations of nitrous oxide. ","2574":"The efficacy of a 3-level regimen of analgesia and sedation was investigated in a clinical setting. Level 1 consisted of continuous administration of sufentanil, in level 2 continuous administration of midazolam and level 3 continuous administration of midazolam and clonidine was added according to patients' needs. Sufentanil at 1 microgram\/kg\/h was given initially. Later it was adjusted to patients' requirements in accordance with the Ramsay score (group 1). Long-term intubated patients received in addition midazolam 0.05 mg\/kg\/h (group 2). If needed, clonidine 1 microgram\/kg\/h was added (group 3). Mean drug requirements were investigated during controlled ventilation and during assisted ventilation with spontaneous breathing &gt; 25% of total minute ventilation. In group 1 arterial paCO2 was measured to estimate drug-induced respiratory depression. Values given are median and ranges. With the 3-level-regimen of analgesia and sedation a Ramsay score of 2-3 was achieved in all intensive-care patients. In group 1 (n = 109; 36.7%) paCO2 values were similar at all times. Patients on controlled ventilation needed sufentanil 0.6 (0.075-2.5) microgram\/kg\/h, on assisted ventilation 0.4 (0.05-2.5) microgram\/kg\/h. Patients of group 2 (n = 113; 38.1%) had on controlled ventilation a higher requirement of sufentanil 1.2 (0.09-2.7) micrograms\/kg\/h, in addition Midazolam 0.05 (0.002-0.56) mg\/kg\/h was given. On assisted ventilation with spontaneous breathing &gt; 25% sufentanil 0.9 (0.05-2.6) microgram\/kg\/h plus midazolam 0.04 (0.002-0.38) mg\/kg\/h was sufficient. Group 3 (n = 75; 25.2%) had on controlled ventilation a higher requirement of sufentanil with 1.5 (0.09-4.0) micrograms\/kg\/h and midazolam 0.05 (0.005-0.52) mg\/kg\/h, in addition clonidine 1.1 (0.12-2.88) micrograms\/kg\/h was given.

Continuous infusion of sufentanil only for analgesia and sedation is suitable for intensive-care patients with a short stay in the ICU. Respiratory depression during spontaneous breathing is not significant.

","2575":"PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY: Total body water represents 60% of body weight (BW), consisting of 40% BW intra- and 20% BW extracellular fluid. Extracellular fluid is divided into 16% BW interstitial fluid and 4% BW plasma volume (Fig. 1). The colloid oncotic pressure (COP) of the plasma proteins, which is about 25 mmHg (Fig. 2), is the main factor for the retention of intravascular volume and the prevention of interstitial edema. Within a defined range, oxygen transport capacity can be improved by normovolaemic haemodilution. Under strictly normovolaemic conditions (\"controlled haemodilution\"), the critical haemoglobin concentration for intensive care patients is about 10.0 g\/dl, and 8-6 g\/dl in patients with satisfactory compensatory mechanisms under stable clinical conditions. Larger blood volume deficits are replaced step by step with volume replacement solutions (crystalloids and synthetic colloids), packed red cells, fresh-frozen plasma, and platelets (Fig. 3). VOLUME REPLACEMENT WITH CRYSTALLOID AND COLLOID SOLUTIONS: Crystalloid solutions do not contain any macromolecules. Due to their lack of intrinsic COP, they spread rapidly over the intravascular and interstitial space. To achieve a comparable volume effect like colloid solutions, a fourfold infusion volume is necessary. Thus, crystalloids should be used in addition to colloid solutions to compensate the interstitial fluid deficit. Hyperosmotic-hyperoncotic solutions have not yet been established, and their benefit seems doubtful. Synthetic colloid solutions contain gelatin, dextran, or hydroxyethyl starch (HES) molecules. Due to their intrinsic COP, fluid is fixated in the intravascular space (Fig. 4). Solutions with high COP increase the intravascular volume due to resorption of interstitial fluid (plasma expanders). Pharmacological characterisation of synthetic colloids includes concentration [%], mean molecular weight [x1,000 Dalton] and degree and position of substitution (HES only). Main clinical features are the maximal volume effect and the duration of a 100% and a 50% volume effect (Fig. 5). For economic reasons, 5% albumin should not be used for volume replacement. The use of 20% albumin in intensive care patients is also limited and recommended only if a capillary leck is unlikely and the dose limits of synthetic colloids are reached. Gelatin is a polypeptide of bovine origin and achieves a shortlasting isovolaemic volume effect. When compared with dextran or HES, negative effects on haemostatis are less, and the renal function is not impaired. Thus, gelatin is first of all indicated in patients with limited volume demand, and secondly in situations with massive blood losses, when the dose limits of HES are reached. Dextran has no specific benefits. HES is a polysaccharide of maize or potato origin. By substitution of glucose molecules with hydroxyethyl groups, starch molecules are protected against fast amylase degradation. Metabolism depends on the degree and position of substitution and mean molecular weight. Smaller molecules are eliminated via the kidneys, but a certain amount of larger molecules is stored in the reticulo-endothelial system. HES is available in very different preparations (concentration 3-10%, mean molecular weight 70,000-450,000 Dalton, substitution 50-70%). Special indications of 10% HES 200\/0.5 are rapid hypervolaemic replacement of massive blood losses and increase of COP in intensive care patients without capillary leak. Synthetic colloids as well as albumin may lead to adverse reactions, which are generally very rare. In large-scala studies, no significant differences have been found with regard to incidence and severity.","2576":"","2577":"","2578":"","2579":"","2580":"","2581":"","2582":"","2583":"","2584":"","2585":"A 21-year-old female who had developed ileus underwent abdominal surgery for adhesiolysis.

Subsequently, the patient developed abdominal sepsis (Enterobacter cloacae) and, on day 11 of mechanical ventilation, severe adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Lung injury score 3.5, paO2\/FiO2 55 mmHg). Despite clearing the abdominal situation, chest films showed persisting and new pulmonary infiltrates, leucocytosis, fever and purulent bronchial secretion occurring over a period of five weeks. Despite aggressive antibiotic treatment the patient deteriorated further and disease progressed to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. At the beginning of week six all bacteriological specimens (blood, bronchoalveolar lavage, urine, catheter tips) were negative for potential pathogens. Possible extrapulmonary infection sites were cleared by computed tomography and Tc 99 labeled antigranulocyte antibody scan. Open lung biopsy was performed on day 33 of ARDS and revealed severe diffuse alveolar damage in the fibroproliferative phase of ARDS. On day 37 after ARDS onset, antibiotic treatment was discontinued and methyl-prednisolone (32 mg every 6 hours, 2.5 mg\/kg.day) was started. After five days a significant improvement of pulmonary function (lung injury score decreased from 3.5 to 2.5, paO2\/FiO2 increased from 82 to &gt; 200 mmHg) and of cardiovascular performance occurred. Corticosteroid treatment was continued for 29 days and was complicated by an episode of pneumonia (Klebsiella pneumoniae) requiring antibiotic therapy. The patient's trachea was successfully extubated on day 80. She was discharged from intensive care unit on day 93 and left hospital three weeks later. We conclude that late ARDS may cause systemic inflammatory response and persisting organ dysfunction without an identifiable source of infection.

The medication was given in a double-blind fashion 60 min before induction of general anaesthesia for various surgical procedures. At 3 definite stages (before premedication, 30 and 60 min after premedication), blood pressure, heart rate, transcutaneous oxygen saturation and respiratory rate were measured. Sedation and well-being were graded according to a 5-point scale, and the subjective anxiety level was assessed according a visual analogue scale (range 0-100 mm). Anterograde and retrograde amnesia were measured by recall of auditive and visual stimuli. Finally, patients were asked whether in case of future surgery they would prefer the same or a different medication. Demographic data were similar in all groups. There was no significant difference in respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, blood pressure or heart rate. Alertness declined only after 60 min in the groups treated with 7.5 mg and more midazolam. During the entire measurement period, anxiolysis was not different from placebo in any of the midazolam groups. In comparison to placebo, all midazolam groups showed a statistically significant and dose dependent anterograde amnesia for visual stimuli. Subjective well-being scores showed no differences between the groups. Only few side effects were seen following doses of 7.5 mg and higher, including ptosis, strabismus, diplopia, speech disorders, disorientation and vertigo. The majority of patients in all groups indicated a wish for the same medication in case of future anaesthesia for surgical interventions. Midazolam administered orally prior to surgical procedures showed marked interindividual variability. Sedation and amnesia were dose-dependent and were evaluated by the patients as acceptable. Anxiolysis was not significantly different from placebo. A dose of 7.5 mg midazolam showed the best relation between desirable and undesirable effects. Adequate attention given to the patient by the anaesthesiologist prior to surgery seems to be as important and beneficial as oral medication with midazolam. ","2589":"In anaesthesia and critical care propofol is often used as a hypnotic or sedative. There are some reports showing propofol as a mood-altering drug. The use of propofol in subanaesthetic doses, for example in antineoplastic chemotherapy, led to similar results. In previous studies it was hypothesised that these mood effects could also reduce chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. The present prospective randomised double-blind study evaluated mood effects of different subanaesthetic doses of propofol in oncology patients who received antineoplastic chemotherapy. Propofol was applied in a double-blind and randomised manner as follows (N = 8 per group): Initial bolus of 0.1 mg\/kg followed by a continuous infusion of 1.0 mg\/kgxh (group 1), 1.5 mg\/kgxh (group 2) or 2.0 mg\/kgxh (group 3). Dependent variables were as behavioural (i.e. nausea and vomiting) as aspects of mood as somatic aspects. Subanaesthetic doses of propofol showed different effects. In respect of somatic variables some well-known results were replicated, showing highest reduction of blood pressure under highest dose of propofol. With regard to psychic variables no deterioration of mood or feeling tone was seen. Rather, a reduction of anxiety and especially under 2.0 mg\/kgxh an induction of well-being occurred. However, even propofol was used as the only \"anti-emetic\" drug, patients reported no induction of nausea and vomiting during antineoplastic chemotherapy. Further studies are needed to specify the \"anti-emetic\" effects of subhypnotic propofol in antineoplastic chemotherapy. Especially a comparison with a standard drug for the prevention of nausea and vomiting, such as ondansetron, will have to be conducted. The results of this study showed that a dose of propofol of 1.0 mg\/kgxh after an initial bolus of 0.1 mg\/kg is a useful reference dose.

Immediately postoperatively the patients of group A received a continuous infusion of the study solution (5-8 ml\/h), the patients of group B received a baseline continuous epidural infusion (3 ml\/h), additionally they could self-administer 5 ml boli via a PCEA device. Measurements included the total dose of infused drug solution, pain at rest and on exercise by a visual analogue scale, cardiorespiratory data and side effects within the first 24 hours postoperatively. A standardised interview on analgesia and side effects was held 2 days after surgery. The PCEA group demanded less epidural analgesics (gr. B: 112 +\/- 33 ml vs. gr. A: 135 +\/- 20 ml) p &lt; 0.01). Both continuous epidural infusion and patient-controlled administration provided very good analgesia at rest (gr. A: VAS 0.4 +\/- 0.4 and gr. B: VAS 0.4 +\/- 0.5) (n.s.). On exercise continuous epidural infusion of analgesics resulted in significantly lower pain scores (gr. A: 1.9 +\/- 1.1) than patient-controlled application (gr. B: 3.4 +\/- 1.1) (p &lt; 0.01). We did not notice severe side effects such as respiratory depression or drop of heart rate or blood pressure. In patients at rest both continuous and patient-controlled epidural administration of analgesics provides excellent analgesia after major abdominal surgery. Contrariwise, patients on exercise who could use a PCA-device experienced more pain compared to those with a continuous epidural infusion technique. On the other hand the patients of the PCA-group consumed less epidural analgesics.

The participating hospitals range in size from 20 to 2600 beds (mean = 364; s = 334,97), totalling together more than 1.7 million surgical operations per year. The surveyed hospitals used one or more of the following procedures for pre-operative preparation: 573 (98.6%) of the replying hospitals used medical anxiolysis, 415 (71.3%) applied preoperative respiratory therapy. Furthermore, 222 (38.5%) of the studied hospitals trained their patients in postoperative relevant behaviour (respiratory therapy n = 167; physiotherapy n = 63 and patient-controlled analgesia n = 41). 74 (13%) offered psychological counselling, 29 (5%) made use of other psychological techniques (muscle relaxation; autogenic training, biofeedback) and 26 (4%) used other preparatory methods like video tapes (n = 13), music (n = 5), acupuncture (n = 4). Nearly all hospitals prepared their patients for surgery with a pre-op visit and anxiolytic medications. Further preparatory methods in most surveyed hospitals are only used on a case-by-case basis. At present psychological methods of preoperative preparation are not routinely used in clinical practice in Germany. Existing possibilities for optimising preoperative preparation in patients undergoing elective surgery are not used regularly. Preoperative preparation needs to be improved, especially in patients undergoing major surgery.

Avoiding possible complications of cardiopulmonary bypass can minimise morbidity and lethality of aortocoronary bypass grafting procedure and can help to lower costs.

In somatic aspects there was a greater amount of cholinergic effects under promethazine, which was mainly expressed by a higher intensity of a dry mouth and weakness in general. Compared with placebo all of the tested drugs led to a better quality of sleep. Using multidimensional rating scales and considering emotions as a multifactorial construct, the study shows no different effects of benzodiazepines or benzodiazepin-like drugs on preoperative mood. No differences were also found on comparing these drugs with placebo. However, a better quality of sleep was seen under zolpidem and dipotassium clorazepate compared with placebo. The study shows that a combination with promethazine is recommended, because promethazine has a selective deactivating effect. The study stresses the significance of multidimensional rating scales for the measurement of emotions before anaesthesia. ","2607":"Characterization and operationalization of anxiety point to the problem of the homogenity of the construct \"anxiety\". Results of experimental studies show that one and the same increase in subjective anxiety can be related to systematically different autonomic-physiological processes. Accordingly, (1) an unspecific increase in ANS-arousal is not, as usually assumed, a basic characteristic of anxiety and (2) indicators of experienced anxiety, which often have a key-role in inferring a state of anxiety, do not allow a sufficient differentiation of this state. The integration of the results in experimentally based biopsychological theories of emotion and the application to the preoperative situation underline the necessity of a more differentiated characterization of anxiety, also and especially with regard to possibilities of a pharmacological anxiolysis.","2608":"In recent times preoperative anxiety is again discussed as an important influential factor for perioperative complications. The anaesthesiologist may be important to identify and control the patients' anxiety although his time while on premedication visit is rather limited. The present article deals with the different aspects of preoperative anxiety, argues about possible psychological and physiological characteristics of anxiety and describes conventionally used psychophysiological testing for the identification of anxiety. Referring to the literature, different therapeutical options are given. Psychological techniques for reducing and controlling preoperative anxiety might be an important topic for further research, especially as far as their influence on perioperative morbidity and mortality is concerned.","2609":"To understand the biological basis of anxiety, the following psychological aspects are discussed: The difference between \"trait\" and \"state\" anxiety, types of anxiety as related to knowledge about causes and consequences, anxiety as a chronological process involving coping strategies and different levels of responses. The lack of specificity is physiological indicators of anxiety is demonstrated by experiments based on electrodermal and cardiovascular responses. Among hormones, special emphasis is placed on the constellation between catecholamines and cortisol as being relevant for anxiety research. It is emphasized that configurations of hormone parameters may be more relevant predictors for anxiety than single response values, and the study of postoperative catecholamine and cortisol responses is used for demonstrating differences between patients in a high and low preoperative state of anxiety. Differences are observed only on the emotional and pain response levels, but not in physiological parameters. The neurophysiological model representing central nervous system substrates for anxiety is the behavioural inhibitory system described in the theory by Gray [17], and the most relevant transmitters noradrenaline, serotonin, and the GABA-system are discussed with regard to their relevance for anxiety in animal studies, in studies using provocation tests with pharmacological substances, and in clinical studies with anti-anxiety drugs. Experimental anxiety research in psychology is frequently characterised by significant interactions between many mediators of responses, in particular the type of stressor, the level of trait anxiety and other personality variables, and the type of substances used. It is concluded that stressors as well as drugs frequently do not specifically induce anxiety but may nonspecifically affect general arousal and may only be operating in certain groups and certain levels of stress intensity.","2610":"The scientific approach to preoperative stress includes the identification of stressors and the measurement of stress responses. The stress responses include physiological (sympathetic nervous system, hypothalamic--hypophyseal and adrenocortical system), psychological (anxiety, depression etc.) and behavioural ones. The choice of variables to be measured should allow answers for our questions, i.e., they must be adequate and economic, without or only minimal disturbance of the preoperative situation. The value of physiological and biochemical parameters is often overestimated. Their assessment is indicated in special scientific settings. For simple questions such as premedication studies, the measurement of blood pressure and heart rate is sufficient. Anxiety should be self-estimated by the patient, using visual analogue scales, questionnaires or adjective check lists. Depression and other emotional stress responses can be assessed if necessary. For physicians and nurses, an observation of the patient's behavioural stress responses is a useful criterion for assessing patient stress. One important stress-reducing approach is prevention: identification and avoidance of stressors. This includes organisation and a high degree of self-control by the medical personnel. Premedication with benzodiazepines is the most successful pharmacological approach.","2611":"At present time we have to face a new quality of fear and anxiety rooted in a social change of fundamental values. Disease and death are being increasingly ruled out from the pattern of everyday life. Therefore, disease and death represent an extreme emotional stress for today's human beings, who find it difficult to assess their significance. Against this background we must view human fear and anxiety before surgery. Nowadays, people have lost the ability of dealing with themselves and their own problems. There is no place for disease in a world dominated by materialism. Accordingly, it is an extreme challenge for any human remain psychologically stable, whereas, anxiety appears increasingly irrational. Both anaesthesiologists and surgeons are responsible for removing anxiety and affording assistance to patients expecting surgery. Consequently, contemporary strategies of therapy include both surgical and psychosocial aspects. Therefore, confidence concerning the relationship between surgeon and patient, consideration of psychosocial factors, and an interdisciplinary approach are essentially necessary to cure the patients from their disease. However, to alleviate and even remove the patients' preoperative anxiety, we must approach and meet the patient on an equal level: from human being to human being.","2612":"","2613":"","2614":"","2615":"","2616":"We report on anaphylactoid reactions (urticae at the injection site and along the injection vein) after intravenous injections of pethidine in two patients. Skin tests with pethidine were negative, but intravenous challenge showed urticae. These results indicate that the reactions were due to a non-immunological mechanism resembling pharmacological intolerance. Retrospective analysis revealed a 5.6% incidence of pharmacological intolerance reactions to intravenous pethidine in 519 patients.","2617":"The authors report on a course of malignant hyperthermia (MH) in an almost 5-years old boy. In the past, he had been anaesthetized two times with halothane without complications. The causative triggering agent was sevoflurane, a new user-friendly substance for paediatric anaesthesia. Forty five minutes after induction of anaesthesia he developed symptoms of a MH-crisis with increase in endexspiratory CO2 up 87 mmHg and followed by an increase in heart rate up to 160 beats\/minute. The blood gas analysis showed a respiratory and metabolic acidosis. The timely administration of dantrolene rapidly reversed the life-threatening signs and prevent progression of the disease. It is apparent that monitoring of endtidal carbon dioxide by means of capnometry is of crucial importance in detecting MH at an early stage, and appropriate treatment is being instituted more promptly. By such early recognition, and treatment with dantrolene, we can reasonably except a further decrease in mortality and morbidity of this enigmatic disorder.","2618":"We present a patient who developed a high central neural block after stellate-ganglion-blockade. The underlying pathophysiology was assessed via sonographic imaging. Stellate ganglion block was performed in a 19-year old patient according to the standard technique. Multiple aspiration tests were negative and a test dose of 3 ml bupivacaine 0.25% was injected. After a 3 min interval another 5 ml were injected. Two minutes after the local anaesthetic administration the patient reported nausea and sensations in the upper extremity. Spontaneous respiration efforts stopped, and the patient became unconscious. Tracheal intubation was performed, and the patient was ventilated in a controlled mode for two hours. Heart rate as well as blood pressure remained within the normal range. Neurologic recovery occurred rapidly and extubation was performed about two and a half hours after the event. Our sonographic studies demonstrated a local anaesthetic depot directly at the root of C 6, with a mean diameter of 10 mm and a length of 5 to 6 cm (about a third smaller than expected). Sonographic studies and clinical symptoms of our patient are most likely to occur with a subdural extra-arachnoidal block. Ultrasonographic guided puncture enhances the patient's safety by the opportunity to directly visualise transverse process, nerval root as well as local anaesthetic depot. In case of depot formation directly at the nerval root, injection may be stopped and the needle repositioned. Furthermore, direct visualisation of the great vessels (A. vertebralis) prevents intravascular injection and haematoma formation.","2619":"","2620":"","2621":"","2622":"","2623":"","2624":"","2625":"","2626":"","2627":"A major complication of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is the excessive absorption of irrigation solution resulting in hypervolemia and dilutional hyponatremia. Marking the irrigation fluid with ethanol is a method for the early detection of fluid absorption. Currently this method is being used in spontaneously breathing patients undergoing regional anaesthesia. The goal of this study was to determine whether this method is also reliable for patients undergoing general anaesthesia. Fifty-nine patients underwent TURP in either spinal anaesthesia (SPA), or general anaesthesia with semi-open (ITNO) and semi-closed (ITNC) systems. Plasma alcohol concentrations ([Eth]p), exhaled ethanol ([Eth]e), plasma sodium concentration ([Na+]), and central venous pressure (CVP) were measured. The irrigation fluid contained ethanol in an concentration of approx. 1%. We assumed that significant fluid absorption took place when [Eth]p exceeded 0.1\/1000. Measurements were performed immediately prior to and during surgery at 10-minute intervals. [Eth]p correlated directly with [Eth]e for both forms of anaesthesia. [Eth]p and [Na+] correlated inversely both for SPA and ITNC. Changes in [Eth]p did not parallel changes in CVP. Clinically relevant episodes of fluid absorption were accompanied by the detection of exhaled ethanol in all groups. We conclude that measuring exhaled ethanol is a minimal invasive monitoring technique that allows the detection of significant fluid absorption in both spontaneously breathing as well as ventilated patients with sufficient sensitivity. The ethanol levels are not predictive of the sodium concentration both in SPA and general anaesthesia. Thus, additional determinations of [Na+] is recommended whenever [Eth]e exceeds 0.2\/1000.","2628":"Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) utilises the electrical induction of a generalised seizure for treating severe mental disorders. The treatment, developed in 1938, is neglected especially in Germany. This is partly due to the original application in non-anaesthetised patients resulting in many atraumatic side effects. Since the beginning of the sixties, \"modified\" ECT under anaesthesia with neuromuscular blockade has become worldwide standard. Controlled studies showed that in major depression ECT is at least equal to pharmacotherapy with relatively few adverse side effects. ECT is an effective alternative in patients resistant to pharmacotherapy. The development of modern ECT devices with improved kinds of impulses has reduced the incidence of cognitive side effects in recent years. Due to a variety of centrally acting co-medications and circulatory effects during ECT, these patients are quite a challenge to the anaesthesiologist. Common hypnotic agents obstruct the generation of convulsions. Therefore, therapeutic outcome is directly influenced by the quality of the anaesthetic management. This review is intended to familiarise with the ECT and to provide hints for an optimised selection, setup and practice of anaesthetic treatment.","2629":"","2630":"This is the case presentation of a forty-year old female patient, who had incurred a tetanus infection as a result of intravenous drug abuse. Clostridium tetani could be detected repeatedly in abscesses caused by injections. The patient had to be put on continuous relaxation, sedation and artificial respiration for 42 days. Besides the usual intensive care regimen, a high-dose antitoxin therapy was initiated. The areas of abscesses had to be eradicated surgically several times. With the exception of a thrombus of the vena cava superior (without haemodynamic consequences) and a pneumonia, the further course was without any other serious complications. After seven months of hospitalisation the patient could be dismissed at \"restitutio ad integrum\". The known immunosuppressive effect of a high dosed tetanus antitoxin therapy could be confirmed by the patient's antitoxin titre course. Repeated active immunisation attempts to produce a sufficient endogenous antitoxin titre failed. The existing therapeutic uncertainties regarding the dosage of the tetanus antitoxin therapy, the titre control and the proper antibiotic treatment are described.","2631":"The authors report on a profound increase in creatine kinase isoenzyme MB (CK-MB) activity in three patients following uneventful cryoablation of the prostate under general anaesthesia: Just after the arrival at the recovery room CK-MB levels were 321 U\/l, 245 U\/l and 433 U\/l, respectively. Other clinical investigations as well as additional laboratory tests ruled out myocardial infarction in all three patients. Electrophoresis of the CK-isoenzymes revealed an increase in CK-BB activity and an increase in atypical CK-BB as a cause of these findings. The presence of these isoenzymes leading to interferences with the antibody commonly used in CK-MB assays could explain the determination of a false positive CK-MB elevation in the three patients. Moreover, it is shown that this method of CK-MB activity determination may result in CK-MB levels higher than 100% of the whole CK activity. In addition, it is discussed that in patients suffering from prostatic carcinoma or other malignoma, \"non-CK-M elevations\" may occur. Therefore, the authors conclude that after cryoablation of the prostate additional tests like troponin T test and 12 channel ECG are required to rule out suspected myocardial infarction.","2632":"","2633":"For decision-making in the ICU, rapid and accurate analysis of vital laboratory parameters is essential. The industry provides devices which analyse these parameters on a decentralised setting and which are designed for use by non-laboratory personnel. We investigated whether accuracy and handling of a new analyser (Ciba-Corning 865, Chiron Diagnostics, Medfield, USA) are good enough for basing clinical decisions on the measured parameters. The Ciba-Corning 865 allows measurement of blood gases, electrolytes, haemoglobin, glucose and lactate by use of photometric, ion-selective, enzymatic and electrochemical sensors in less than 18 microliters of whole blood. In a cardiac surgical intensive-care unit the accuracy of the device was tested by comparison to 61 measurements of quality control reagents, 48 tonometered blood samples and 536 parallel measurements in the clinical laboratory. Besides a 10-minute instruction, the participating personnel had no formal training with the device. The differences between measurements in quality control reagents and tonometered blood and the expected value were lower than 5%. The comparison with clinical laboratory measurements showed correlation coefficients from 0.94 (sodium) to 0.99 (glucose, lactate). The biases in Bland-Altman analyses were below 5%, the limits of agreement were found to be in a clinically acceptable range for all parameters. During the test period no technical problems occurred with the analyser and good acceptance by the personnel was found. The measured parameters were accurate enough to be used for therapeutic decisions in acute care medicine. Although it should not be a complete alternative to the clinical laboratory, because of rapid analyses, small sample volumes and easy handling the use of the Ciba-Corning 865 is advantageous for patients and users. ","2634":"4-chloro-m-cresol (4-CmC), commonly used as preservative, has been shown to induce contractures in skeletal muscle specimens from individuals susceptible to malignant hyperthermia (MH). It has been suggested that a defect of the calcium release channel of the skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (ryanodine receptor) in MH susceptible (MHS) patients could be responsible for this phenomenon. 4-CmC was found to be a potent activator of ryanodine receptor-mediated Ca2+ release. The aim of this study was to determine the in vitro effects of 4-CmC on muscle specimens from MHS and normal (MHN) patients, and whether contracture testing with different concentrations of 4-CmC could result in a more precise discrimination between MHS and MHN. In this prospective study muscle biopsies were obtained from 40 patients with clinical suspicion of MH. The patients were first classified by the in vitro contracture test (IVCT) according to the European MH protocol. After MH classification, surplus muscle specimens were subjected to the 4-CmC study. Cumulative administration of 4-CmC (25, 50, 75, 100, 150, and 200 mumol\/l) produced contractures in a concentration-dependent manner. However, contractures developed significantly earlier and were greater in MHS (n = 17) than in MHN specimens (n = 23). After bolus administration of 50, 75, and 100 mumol\/l 14-CmC MHS specimens developed distinct muscle contractures. In contrast, in MHN specimens only 100 mumol\/l 4-CmC produced contractures. All contracture levels following bolus administration of 100 mumol\/l 4-CmC were attained significantly earlier in MHS than in MHN. There was no overlapping in the range of times between both groups. In vitro contracture testing with 4-CmC seems to be a specific method to distinguish between MHS and MHN patients. However, the question whether 4-CmC is an MH-triggering agent is not completely solved. 4-CmC is a preservative within a large number of commercially available preparations (e.g. insulin, hormones, etc.). Regarding the results of contracture testing with 4-CmC it has been suggested that 4-CmC possibly represents a high-risk agent for MHS individuals. To reduce the risk of MH in susceptible patients due to administration of chlorocresols, we recommend avoiding preparations containing the preservative 4-CmC. ","2635":"Anaesthetic personnel is exposed to different workload conditions. The individual impact is influenced by external factors and human stress stability. Different symptoms reported to be present in anaesthetic personnel are comparable to symptoms of the sick building syndrome, defined by the WHO in the 90's. They are caused by work-induced distress and the exposure to chemical hazards. In anaesthesia, health defects by anaesthetic vapours and gases have been deplored for many years. After the Russian anaesthesiologist Vaisman published a report in 1967, controlled studies concerning cancerogenicity and teratogenicity of volatile anaesthetics under workspace conditions were carried out. In 1989, time-weighted average exposure threshold limit values of 5 ppm were released in the Federal Republic of Germany for halothane. In 1993 thresholds for enflurane (20 ppm) and nitrous oxide (100 ppm) were released. TLV concentrations for the new anaesthetic agents desflurane and sevoflurane have not yet been defined by authorities. Factors influencing workplace concentrations of anaesthetic gases are the anaesthetic procedures, apparatus leakage, air conditioning, fresh gas flow and the function of the scavenging system. Although cancerogenicity, mutagenicity, teratogenicity and reduction of fertility are discussed as effects of chronic exposure to anaesthetic gases, several review articles doubted the results of studies, finding positive correlations of incidence of occupational disease and the exposure to the volatile and gaseous substances. Mainly coexisting factors like smoke-induced exposure to polybromated biphenyls, disturbance in circadian rhythm, stress and enclosure in narrow exposure systems, increasing teratogenicity and cancerogenicity in animal experiments, are considered to promote unreliability of the studies. All reviewers do not discuss the fact, that all of these co-factors are present in the reality of the anaesthetic workplace. Thus, the studies by Corbett, enthusiastically criticized by different reviewers, simulate the all-day reality of the anaesthetic workplace more precisely than controlled experiments conducted, for example, by Eger and co-workers. The results of animal experiments and retrospective studies therefore do not justify realization of large controlled prospective studies but require the overall revision of the anaesthesiological workplace and the reduction of occupational waste gas exposure to the lowest possible levels below all chronic exposure threshold values.","2636":"","2637":"","2638":"","2639":"","2640":"","2641":"","2642":"","2643":"","2644":"","2645":"","2646":"","2647":"","2648":"","2649":"","2650":"","2651":"","2652":"","2653":"","2654":"","2655":"","2656":"","2657":"","2658":"","2659":"","2660":"Evoked potentials are used for intraoperative monitoring to assess changes of cerebral function.

Anaesthesia was induced with 1.5 micrograms\/kg fentanyl, 0.3 mg\/kg etomidate and 0.1 mg\/kg vecuronium. The lungs were intubated and patients normoventilated in steady state anaesthesia with isoflurane (end-tidal 0.6%) and 66% nitrous oxide. 18 patients (group 1) were assigned to the SEP group: median nerve stimulation, recording at Erb, C 6 and the contralateral somatosensory cortex (N20, P25, N35) vs Fz. AEPs were recorded in group 2 (n = 18): binaural stimulation, recording at Cz versus linked mastoid (V, Na, Pa, Nb). Recordings were performed during 30 min before the start of surgery (baseline: BL), at skin incision (SURG1) and at the preparation of the periost (SURG2).

Seventy four patients, scheduled for minor orthopaedic surgery, participated in this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study. The setting was comparable to our previous study. Before induction of spinal anaesthesia, verum-treated patients received a diclofenac suppository (100 mg), and metamizol (1 g\/100 ml NaCl 0.9% intravenously over 15 min).

The aim of the present study was to compare a handwritten record system with a pen-computing assisted documentation system. 52 consecutive jobs of the local mobile intensive care unit (MICU) were recorded both by means of a handwritten record and by use of a pen-computer-assisted documentation system (NAPROT, based on DIVI-documentation system version 2.5). The paramedic performing pen-computing was obliged to restrict data inputs to those moments during which emergency physician was able to fill in his record. NAPROT routinely checked the records derived from the pen-computer for completeness of data before print-out. Neither hardware nor software problems occurred. Compared to the handwritten records the electronic documentation system resulted in a significant increase in recorded data. The following parameters were recorded more frequently by means of the new method of documentation: Glasgow Coma Score (47 vs 36 patients), positioning manoeuvres (36 vs 19 patients), blood glucose level (25 vs 17 patients), and complications (13 vs. 4 events). Pen-computing assisted documentation resulted in superior quality of data recorded in emergency medical files. This increase in information may be ascribed to the integrated check for completeness of data. The described new documentation system, therefore, enhances the processing quality in prehospital emergency medicine. Further developments of the documentation system should concentrate on tools while reducing the workload of the emergency physician. ","2671":"The improvement of tissue perfusion by alterations in global parameters has led to the concept of supranormal oxygen delivery. However, this approach did not cause a significant reduction in the mortality of critical illness. As a consequence, recent research activity concentrates on regional monitoring and on the therapy of especially vulnerable, injury-prone organ systems. Gastric tonometry, a monitoring device of the gastrointestinal region that has produced promising results, can be considered as an area of special attention. The intramucosal pCO2 (piCO2) and the calculated intramucosal pH (pHi) of gastric tonometry can indicate an impairment of the gastrointestinal perfusion and thus point to an immanent injury of the barrier function of the gut mucosa. In clinical practice, however, apart from several technical problems with conventional, discontinuous gastric tonometry, some misconceptions exist in respect of the interpretation of derived pHi data. The technical problems can be overcome by a new fibreoptic piCO2 measurement, an automatic and continuous technique. The analysis of the obtained data must take the physiology of the CO2- and HCO3(-)-metabolism into account. Coupling of the locally derived piCO2 with systemic arterial HCO3- concentration that results in the pHi as the sensitive parameter of the gastrointestinal malperfusion as suggested by Fiddian Green, is not correct. Taking respiratory pCO2 changes into consideration, only the PiCO2 can detect gastrointestinal malperfusion. Therefore, the rather confusing terms \"gastric tonometry\" and \"pHi measurement\" should be avoided and the new monitoring technique be defined as \"intramucosal pCO2 measurement\". Continuous piCO2-measurement is a monitoring technique with high sensitivity in detecting gastrointestinal hypoperfusion based on an intramucosal CO2 accumulation. The clinical significance of the primary parameter piCO2 as well as the suitability of this technique as a monitoring tool for the daily routine must be re-assessed.","2672":"","2673":"","2674":"","2675":"","2676":"Cardiac dysrhythmias in septic patients often reflect hypovolaemia, hypokalaemia or endocarditis as cardiac manifestation of the infection, but may be indicative for underlying cardiac pathology previously undiagnosed.

For this purpose, it was investigated whether ivIG improves blood clearance and organ colonisation as well as PMN functions after experimentally induced bacteraemia in rabbits. The experiments were performed in 30 anaesthetised rabbits. To determine quantification of bacterial killing in vivo, defined numbers of exogenous Escherichia (E.) coli 1.3 x 10(8) CFU) were injected intravenously in untreated animals (n = 10) or 60 min after infusion of endotoxin (LPS: 40 micrograms\/kg\/h) in groups without (n = 10), and after pretreatment with ivIG (Sandoglobulin, 0.5 g\/kg body weight, n = 10), respectively. Parameters monitored were rates of bacterial elimination from the blood, LPS clearance, arterial pressure, blood gases and white blood cell counts, PMN burst activity was determined using a flow cytometry assay. Samples of liver, kidney, spleen and lung were collected for bacterial counts 180 min following E. coli injection. Compared to controls, endotoxinaemia resulted in a prolonged elimination of the injected E. coli out of the blood associated with a significantly (p &lt; 0.01) higher colonisation of all organs. Pretreatment with ivIG improved LPS clearance and significantly reduced bacterial colonisation of lung and kidney (p &lt; 0.01). This was paralleled by an enhanced PMN respiratory burst activity compared to untreated animals (p &lt; 0.05). The reduced bacterial colonisation of lung and kidney in correlation with an increased PMN bactericidal activity in endotoxinaemia suggest an improved granulocyte-dependent bacterial killing due to ivIG application.

Ability to ambulate, pruritus, PONV, haemodynamics, paO2 and paCO2 were comparable. Postoperative pain treatment with PCEA was more time-consuming (407 vs 299 min) and expensive (71 vs 40 S\/day) than PCA. PCEA in comparison to PCA after major abdominal surgery provides superior analgesia with comparable side effects at approximately 80% higher costs. ","2683":"We compared the readings of the GENIUS 3000A FirstTemp infrared thermometer with a conventional temperature probe (MON-A-THERM tympanic) placed in contact with the tympanic membrane. We also systematically evaluated user-dependent factors influencing the infrared readings. In 100 postoperative patients we investigated the repeatability of the infrared measurements and the agreement with tympanic thermocouple probes in the contralateral ear regarding the degree of auditory canal contamination. In 20 volunteers we evaluated the influence of three factors: interval between consecutive measurements, dwell time in the auditory canal before reading the temperature, and positioning of the grip. Finally, we compared the infrared readings in the same ear of 20 different users who were not familiar with this new method. Comparison with the tympanic contact probes revealed a mean difference of -0.67 degree C (+\/-0.65 degree C 2 SD). The infrared thermometer significantly underestimated the temperature of the thermocouple probes. Repeatability was +\/-0.3 degree C. The presence of cerumen in the auditory canal had no influence on the infrared readings. Shortening of the interval between two consecutive readings (30 and 60 s.) led to increasing differences between the two measurements with the second reading decreasing. After positioning the infrared thermometer in the auditory canal 5 seconds before taking temperatures, the recorded temperatures were significantly lower compared to the immediate temperature recordings. Rotation of the device out of the telephone handle position led to an increasing lack of agreement between infrared thermometry and thermistor probes. In 20 inexperienced operators agreement with the thermocouple probe was -0.80 degree C (+\/-0.60 degree C 2 SD) and repeatability was +\/-0.6 degree C. Although easy to use, infrared thermometry requires careful handling and experienced users. To get optimal recordings, the time between consecutive measurements should not be less than 90 seconds. Recordings should be taken immediately after positioning the device in the auditory canal. Best results are obtained when the grip of the device follows the ramus mandibulae like a telephone handle. The lower readings of the infrared thermometer compared to tympanic contact-probes indicate that the obtained readings represent the temperature of the auditory canal rather than of the tympanic membrane itself.

ETs have a wide range of action including vasoconstriction, vasodilatation, bronchoconstriction, and mitogenesis. Two types of ET receptors, classified as ETA and ETB receptors, have been identified in gene technology. Endothelins are produced by endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and bronchial epithelial cells. Their vasoactive effects contribute not only to homoeostasis but ETs seem also to be involved in several pulmonary diseases. Elevated ET plasma levels have been found in patients suffering from asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, and acute lung injury. This review gives a short summary of the actual facts in endothelin research, focussing on the effects of ET-1 in pulmonary circulation.","2685":"","2686":"","2687":"","2688":"","2689":"Patients with severe head injury run a high risk of developing secondary cerebral defects.

A CT scan revealed subarachnoid haemorrhage. The causal aneurysm of the right A. pericallosa was clipped subsequently. Eclampsia is the leading cause of epileptic seizures during pregnancy.

The continuous measurement of blood flow velocities in two different vessel segments, either ipsilateral or contralateral, is limited by intricate probe fixation and positioning for optimal insonation of the vessel on the one hand. On the other hand probes are displaced frequently during anaesthesiological measures, so that continuous registration during induction of anaesthesia is not always guaranteed. In view of these limitations, a new probe-positioning and holding device has been developed and tested in a clinical study of patients undergoing cardiac surgery (n = 22). The newly designed probe-positioning and holding device allowed the unilateral adjustment and continuous measurement of the blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (Vmca) from anaesthesia induction to endotracheal intubation in all patients (n = 9). This was possible in only 61.5% (n = 8) of the patients who were monitored via conventional mode of probe fixation (n = 13). The new method rendered possible the positioning, insonation and measurement in two vessel segments in 77.8% of the patients, in contrast to 53.8% of the patients where the conventional technique was used. The newly designed probe holding device meets all standard requirements from the anaesthesiological viewpoint, and facilitates the perioperative application of transcranial Doppler sonography for non-invasive monitoring.","2698":"Hydroxyethyl starch is commonly used in resuscitation, anaesthesia and intensive care medicine. Increasing creatinine values in patients treated with hydroxyethyl starch have been described in some case reports. These have also been some clinical signs such as pain in the renal region, and swelling of kidney parenchyma, but no differential and sensitive parameters of renal function have supported these possible side effects of hydroxyethyl starch. Twenty-five patients were randomly allocated to a control and a treatment group. In the treatment group, patients received 12 ml per kg body-weight hydroxyethyl starch 10% (200\/0.5) daily. A non-invasive diagnostic spectrum of renal function was performed. Specific tubular proteins (alpha 1-microglobulin, Tamm-Horsfall protein), glomerular parameters (immunoglobulin G, albumin), and the brush border enzyme acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase, were examined. Additionally, renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, Apache-II-score, breathing therapy, infusions, transfusion, and all medical interventions were documented. Both groups were comparable with regard to drug therapy. Apache-II-score, and fluid management. There were differences in tubular function between the two groups. Patients undergoing HES therapy showed increased excretion of alpha 1-microglobulin. Tamm-Horsfall-protein and of brush border enzyme acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase. No significant differences were detectable in glomerular functions (glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow), albumin, and IgG. Correlates of tubular damage after hydroxyethyl starch therapy were seen in intensive care patients. Many influences of intensive therapy act on renal function, and further studies with larger cohorts are necessary. With regard to the documented localisation of the tubular damage in the HES group, colloid therapy with hydroxyethyl starch in renal dysfunction should be monitored carefully by means of sensitive markers.","2699":"The purpose of our study was to show the effects of laparoscopic procedures on the ventilation of children.

Laparoscopic procedures as seen here for appendectomy or diagnostic exploration in children of 13.5 kg body weight or more caused no problems that were clinically evident. The increase of ventilation pressure could be attenuated by choosing the parameters of ventilation (e.g. flow, I:E ratio) in such a way that Pmax does not exceed 20 mbar. Alternatively, pressure-controlled ventilation may be used, adjusting petCO2 by ventilation frequency. In any case there must be a strict control of all possible side effects of laparoscopy, such as cutaneous emphysema or pneumothorax.","2700":"The ability of low dose dopamine (1-3 micrograms x kg-1 x min-1) to cause selective renal vasodilation, to increase glomerular filtration rate, urine output, and natriuresis, is intuitively considered favourable. Dopamine, therefore, continues to be used in critically ill patients to preserve or improve renal function. Despite its application in a wide variety of disease states and in patients at risk of acute renal failure or with already decreased renal function, there is no conclusive evidence that \"renal doses\" of dopamine prevented acute renal failure or had any positive effect on patient outcome although it increased urine output and natriuresis consistently. Data from many clinical studies, however, are difficult to interpret due to small numbers of patients, the absence of control groups, the inability to exclude changes in cardiac output or to separate a diuretic effect of dopamine in the tubulus system from specific increases of glomerular filtration rate, and because of the variability of methods to determine renal performance (i.e. creatinine clearance, urine output, natriuresis, fractional excretion of sodium). Moreover, the routine use of dopamine is not innovous, since it may worsen gut ischaemia and suppress certain hormonal systems. Those who believe in the clinical benefits of \"renal dose\" dopamine argue that, even in the absence of an improvement in renal function, the maintenance of urine output could be useful in patients unresponsive to diuretics. Again, the clinical benefit of this diuretic action still needs to be shown. In conclusion, there is little justification for the routine administration of low-dose dopamine in patients at risk of renal failure. Large controlled clinical studies are urgently needed to determine whether dopamine improves renal function or prevents acute renal failure in patients at risk.","2701":"","2702":"Case report of a five year-old boy who was admitted for elective squint surgery. The medical history revealed some delay in his behavioural and mental development as well as an unspecific dysmorphic syndrome with suspected muscular weakness. Tonsillectomy and adenotomy have been performed six months prior to admission. During examination on the day before surgery, the child presented only mild symptoms of a subsiding upper respiratory infection. Because of the uncooperativeness of the child the pharyngeal inspection was not performed. On the day of surgery total intravenous anaesthesia was induced by injection of sufentanil, propofol and atracurium. Ventilation with 100% oxygen via facemask was uneventful. However, laryngoscopy for endotracheal intubation was impossible due to a massive lingual tonsillar hyperplasia. A size 2 laryngeal mask with flexible spiral-tubing was inserted and anaesthesia was maintained using continuous propofol infusion. The surgical procedure was finished after 30 min and the laryngeal mask was removed. The following postoperative course was uneventful and the child was discharged from the hospital two days later. The present case report demonstrates the importance of preoperative pharyngeal inspection prior to elective endotracheal intubation and the possibility of unexpected difficult airway management by the laryngeal mask.","2703":"In a 32 years old patient with advanced gastric cancer epidural analgesia with local anaesthetic and morphine via a thoracic epidural catheter was required because of intractable pain and intolerable side effects of intravenous morphine.

The difficulties in correctly diagnosing catheter-related infections and the necessity to remove the device in case of suspected infection require preventive procedures in the first place. Therefore, several studies have dealt with surface treatment by coating with antibiotics, antiseptics and silver. Some of them remain in clinical trials or are already sold in the USA. Clinical failure of silver-sulfadiazine coated CVCs has been reported recently. Recently a rifampicinminocyclin-catheter has been shown to reduce efficiently material-associated infection in preclinical and clinical studies. Most of the substances retained on catheter surfaces are released only in small quantities resulting in ineffective suppression of bacterial growth. If substantial amounts of antimicrobials are incorporated into the biomaterial, release pattern and killing efficacy of each substance group has to be determined in order to reach bactericidal concentrations in the environment of adherent bacteria. Killing kinetics of antibiotics, antiseptics and silver to bacteria are strongly different. On the one hand killing kinetics of microorganism due to substantial quantities of antiseptics are fast, on the other hand antiseptics destroy structures of both, bacteria and blood cells. Bactericidal concentrations of Ag-ions show fibroblast inhibition. Antibiotics, however, show lowest toxicity due to the specific action to microorganisms. However, sustained release over time is needed to reach bactericidal concentrations, considering the slower bactericidal action of typical antibiotics. Development of allergic reaction is possible for all substances, whereas development of bacterial resistance can be prevented by use of antimicrobial combinations.","2706":"This study was performed to evaluate whether autologous blood donation prior to coronary artery bypass graft surgery (cabg) reduces homologous blood requirements and the risk of homologous blood transfusion. Within a period of 18 months, 633 patients undergoing cabg surgery were retrospectively included into the study. Non-donors were included if preoperative haemoglobin concentration exceeded 12.5 g%. According to demographic data, risk scores of patients who donated blood (n = 201) were lower. More patients of this group received left internal mammary bypass grafts (63% vs. 51%; p = 0.047). Nevertheless, blood loss did not differ between donors and non-donors.

In our study, autologous blood donation significantly decreased the risk of homologous transfusion and homologous blood requirements in male cabg patients. We were not able to prove the efficacy of autologous blood donation in female cabg patients.

A period of 4 years was evaluated retrospectively, and the last half year was evaluated prospectively. Among a collective of 710 patients, 55 (8%) non-donors and 655 (92%) donors with a total number of 1592 ABD were found. Mean age of non-donors with hip surgery was significantly higher than that of donors (72 vs. 64 years), the same was observed in patients with knee surgery (71 vs. 68 years). In the hip surgery group, 11 of 338 patients were non-donors (3%), compared with 44 of 372 patients with knee surgery (12%). In the prospective part of the study, 7% of 121 patients were non-donors. Reasons for exclusion from donation were 5 times of medical and 4 times of organisational nature. In donors for hip surgery, a mean of 3.0 units was collected, compared with 1.9 units in donors for knee surgery. On the day before operation, mean haemoglobin concentrations were similar in donors and non-donors. During ABD, 11 incidents were observed, representing 0.69% of all ABD, 83.5% of 327 donors with hip surgery left the hospital without any transfusion of homologous blood, 16.5 of donors with hip surgery received one or more homologous transfusions, compared with 100% of non-donors (p &lt; 0.001).

CT-scan confirmed the diagnosis of mediastinal emphysema, tracheal rupture and, in addition, left-sided pulmonary contusion. A repair of the tracheal tear was performed by right-sided thoracotomy using a double-lumen tube. The left-sided double-lumen tube was used postoperatively to achieve respirator ventilation with low pressure on the tracheal lumen and on the suture of the tracheal tear.

No significant differences between the groups were seen by CD3+HLA-DR(+)-cells, T-suppressor-cells (CD8+), B-cells (CD19+) and natural killer-cells (CD56). Early enteral nutrition seems to stabilise the immunosuppression of polytraumatised patients in an earlier phase. There is a consolidation of the lymphocyte counts, and of T(CD3+)- and T-helper-cells (CD4+). This could be the immunological correlate for the number of septic complications in the enteral fed groups. Therefore polytraumatised patients should be fed rather early enteral than parenteral when possible. In the initial phase after the trauma the way of nutritional support has more importance on the immune system as nutritional contents.

Various methods to measure the cardiac output have been developed within a period of a few years. We compared the bolus thermodilution method (COI), which has been internationally adopted as \"gold standard\" method, with the continuous thermodilution method (CCO) for measuring the cardiac output by means of the CCO Vigilance Monitor. Our aim was to find out whether cardiac output can be determined with valid results during coronary artery bypass surgery when using CCO. A flow-directed catheter was used (8 Fr. Intelli-Cath CCO PA) in 98 patients during coronary artery bypass surgery after initiation of anaesthesia, introducing the catheter via the right V.jugularis interna, for continuous measurement of the cardiac output via the CCO Vigilance Monitor. The same equipment was also used to measure the cardiac output via the bolus thermodilution method (COI mode) at the following stages: after abandoning the CCO mode 10 minutes subsequent to beginning the operation before sternotomy; 10 minutes after sternotomy before connecting to the heart-lung machine; 15 minutes after disconnecting the heart-lung machine before closing the thorax; and 10 minutes after closing the thorax. As a corresponding comparative value of the CCO method, we used the average cardiac output value calculated for each of the four times of measurement for the last three minutes before applying the boli. In regression analysis we chose the linear model CCO = b x COI with gradient b = 1 and zero point ordinate a = 0. The identity measures, Spearman's rank correlation coefficients, and linear regression coefficients calculated for the four times of measurement, showed good agreement. Scatter of the paired differences between both methods (CCO-CCI) did not have any deterministic structure at all times of measurement. The average bias at the 4 times of measurement was 0.10 l\/min, -0.12 l\/min, -0.1 l\/min, and -0.03 l\/min, respectively, with a precision = 2 x s of 1.17 l\/min, 1.36 l\/min, 1.69 l\/min and 1.50 l\/min, respectively. The average relative error (100 x [CCO-COI]\/COI) with standard deviation was calculated for the 4 times of measurement as 3.2% (s = 15.4%), -1.6% (s = 15.3%), -0.9% (s = 13.9%) and -0.3% (s = 12.0%), respectively. Literature references show that the continuous thermodilution method is not only valid for intensive-care long-term measurement of cardiac output with approximately stationary haemodynamics, but also-as our results prove-valid if haemodynamics are not usually stationary, such as during coronary artery bypass surgery. The pros of the continuous thermodilution method are that no additional equipment is required apart from the standard equipment used in intensive-care medicine and cardio-anaesthesiology: that there is no stress caused by volume; and that manipulation is safe because no calibration routine is needed and also because measurement and analysis techniques are fully automated. Hence, we are of the opinion that the intraoperative use of this cardiac output measurement technique during open heart surgery is clinically indicated.

We differentiate between mild (36-34 degrees C), moderate (33-29 degrees C), deep (28-17 degrees C) and profund (16-4 degrees C) hypothermia. During hypothermia, cerebral metabolic rate and cerebral blood flow decrease dependent on temperature. The relation between temperature and cerebral metabolism is expressed by the temperature coeffizient Q10, which is the ratio between two metabolic rates separated by 10 degrees C. The following factors contribute to decreases in cerebral blood flow seen during hypothermia: cerebral metabolic depression, decreases in cardiac output, and decreases in arterial blood pressure with pH-stat management, increases in hematocrit and in blood viscosity. Mild or moderate hypothermia reduces histopathological damage and neurological deficits if started before and during cerebral ischaemia. Hypothermia may also improve neurologic outcome if initiated following focal cerebral ischaemia, but is less effective after global ischaemic insults. Mild hypothermia appears to be safer and more effective compared to moderate hypothermia. In most instances, deep hypothermia renders neurologic outcome worse, which is most likely related to the generation of toxic metabolites and inadequate myocardial function during rewarming. The neuroprotective effects of hypothermia are related to several mechanisms along the ischaemic cascade: prevention of postischaemic hypoperfusion, reduction of functional and basal metabolism, decreased accumulation of lactic acid and oedema formation, inhibition of excitatory neurotransmitter release, prevention of Ca(++)- and Na(+)-influx, inhibition of lipid peroxidase activity, and free radical formation, stimulation of regenerative immediate early genes.

We used a laryngeal mask airway split lengthwise on its convex site, the incision going from a point corresponding to the teeth down to the base of the cuff. The cuff remains uncut. By this modification it is possible to ventilate an anaesthetised patient and to pass down a fibreoptic bronchoscope via splitting of the laryngeal mask airway into the trachea at the same time. An endotracheal tube of any diameter already mounted over the bronchoscope is then guided into the trachea. The feasibility of this technique was tested and haemodynamic reactions and changes of the parameters of respiration were recorded. This technique was used in 105 patients, 68 male and 37 female, mean age 34 years, when difficult intubation was expected or occurred. Blood pressure, pulse rate and peripheral oxygen saturation was recorded on arrival in the anaesthetic room, after induction of anaesthesia, during and after fibreoptic endotracheal intubation. The respiratory minute volume was measured after insertion of the laryngeal mask airway and during the course of fibreoptic intubation. The time needed was recorded. In all cases endotracheal intubation was successful using this technique. The time needed was between 4 and 16 minutes. There was a statistically significant increase in peripheral oxygen saturation and decrease of the pulse rate after induction of anaesthesia. There were no further significant changes of the recorded haemodynamic parameters and the oxygen saturation during and after fibreoptic intubation compared to the results after induction of anaesthesia. It could be demonstrated that a fibreoptic intubation is possible in cases of a difficult airway using the technique described here. There is no haemodynamic strain on the patient. This method can be carried out without pressure of time and without to endanger the patient by hypoxia as the patient can be ventilated during the fibreoptic intubation. In cases of impossible intubation and insufficient mask ventilation it can be tried to establish ventilation and to avoid a emergency surgical airway or transtracheal jet ventilation by using this technique.

One possibility is intubation with vecuronium bromide, whereas another possibility is the use of the laryngeal mask (LMN). The conditions for intubation as well as further details during anaesthesia are listed and compared. 200 children are divided into 4 groups. Group A: intubation with thiopental and vecuronium bromide. Group B: LMN with thiopental, Group C and D: as A and B but the thiopental replaced by propofol. The following aspects are compared: the conditions of intubation; circulation conditions; oxygen saturation; the behaviour when coming out of anaesthesia; complications; the assessment by the surgeons. A further control of 100 routine LMN covers the complications which arose. Adenoidectomy can be carried out successfully with both kinds of anaesthesia. Tracheal intubation attained a better assessment by most surgeons and is easier to administer. Brief declines in the saturation of oxygen occur more frequently when using LMN. LMN has its advantages in the low irritation of the respiratory mucous membranes and results in improved behaviour on coming out of the anaesthesia, especially if used with propofol. Problems arise mainly through the use of the mouth clamp which can result in obstructions of the respiratory tract and re-intubation. These problems arise less frequently when the use of this method has become routine. LMN takes time to get used to, and places greater demands on the anaesthetist. Success of LMN depends on the cooperation and collaboration to the surgeon to lower the risk of complications. Once specific improvements in the LMN have been made, it may become the standard method for adenoidectomy in future. It is already used by us and in some outpatient departments, as well as in England and America. Our suggestions are as follows: Aims at convincing the surgeons and improving their co-operation; No routine fixation of the laryngeal mask. The laryngeal mask should be kept slightly taut before opening--preferably slowly--the mouth clamp; possible technical modifications of the mouth clamp itself, which produce a wider gap, could be adapted to the new conditions of the wider LM; reaching the necessary depth of anaesthesia through higher doses of propofol or possibly by total intravenous anaesthesia; routine wearing of the LM in the recovery room until it is no longer tolerated by the child. ","2732":"This is a report on experiences regarding the use of the reinforced laryngeal mask airway for 121 minor operations in paediatric otolaryngology. By far the most interventions were adeno-tonsillectomies (104), which until now were performed under general anaesthesia with tracheal intubation. The rate of observed complications was surprisingly low. 117 children were able to undergo their operation using the laryngeal mask airway. Tracheal intubation became necessary four times (failure to bring laryngeal mask into position occurred twice, laryngospasm occurred once, cough\/pressing caused by lack of adequate depth of anaesthesia in two cases). In five cases there were problems of ventilation (4.1%), provoked by the Boyle-Davis gag. Seven children complained of postoperative sore throat, a complication that could be avoided later by measuring the cuff pressure (25-70 cm H2O). Aspiration was not observed in any of the cases. The complete absence of choking or pressing was regarded as particularly favourable by both the anesthetist and the surgeon. The use of the reinforced laryngeal mask airway during paediatric otolaryngological operations in the hand of an experienced anaesthetist appears to be a promising alternative to tracheal intubation and merits more widespread use. ","2733":"Premature osteosynthesis of one or more cranial bones, either intrauterine or within the first postnatal months, is defined as craniosynostosis. The resulting limitation of intracranial space can cause retardation of cranial growth which, in turn, leads to craniostenosis with increasing intracerebral pressure. Complex forms of craniosynostosis with concomitant malformations (i.e. Apert-, Crouzon-, and Pfeiffer syndromes) must be principally distinguished from simple craniosynostosis. This complex cranio-facial dysostosis is a premature osteosynthesis of cranial and facial bones. In general, as far as Germany is concerned, the incidence of cranio-synostosis amounts to 1\/1000 births. If they remain untreated, many of these children will suffer from cortex-associated retardation of intelligence. Surgical management, therefore, is initiated at a very early stage, and should be performed in specialised centres. Recommendations for operation vary from an age of 4 to 36 months. However, an age of 6 months or more is the most frequently preferred age for surgical intervention. Severe respiratory disorders, as well as impossibility of enteral intake of nourishment, are considered absolute indications for surgery, independent of the age; elimination of the stigmatisation regarding environmental contacts of the child is another mandatory indication for operation. The goal of early surgery is reconstruction of physiological, cranial, and facial bone structures (\"fronto-orbital\" or \"fronto-facial advancement\"). Correction of craniofacial malformation may be associated with--in part--severe complications for the child. From the anaesthesiologist's point of view, this disease demands highly qualified perioperative management, since a variety of idiosyncrasies and risks must be taken into account: These are, for example, venous air embolism, hypothermia, disorders of water and electrolyte equilibrium, and, extremely vital, difficult intubation and substantial blood loss.","2734":"","2735":"","2736":"Pain is a well known complication of propofol injection. Many methods are described to reduce it but often empirical ways are used. In this study we attempt to determine the effects of premixing propofol with lidocaine or to preinjecting lidocaine in a hand vein in combination with using a tourniquet before we applicated propofol. Our study shows that both ways are able to reduce the injection pain but premixing with lidocaine 0.05% is less effective than giving a bolus of lidocaine before the propofol injection.","2737":"Treatment of a patient with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is very challenging, and makes great demands on the anaesthesiologist. Any of an AIDS patient's vital organ systems may be compromised, either by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) itself, opportunistic infections, by tumours, or as a result of AIDS-related drug therapies. Infections of the lungs (e.g., Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia) are prevalent, and cardiac impairment can be found in as many as 50% of AIDS patients. In addition, disorders of the central and peripheral nervous system and water and electrolyte imbalances are often seen. Perioperatively, the AIDS patient is especially prone to infections as a result of a compromised immune system. The choice of anaesthetic procedure for the AIDS patient-aside from the type of operation-depends on the severity of the illness and progression of organ impairment. All anaesthesia personnel must be careful to avoid infection, as they frequently come in contact with the blood or body fluids of their patients. However, the risk of being infected by an AIDS patient is very low, provided hygiene regulations are followed strictly. The rate of seroconversion after accidental needle-stick injury is below 1%. If exposure does occur, regular serologic controls should be continued for one year. Prophylactic treatment with azidothymidine after exposition to HIV is recommended.","2738":"Specific modes of positioning are essential for successful surgery. These are again critically assessed in this final part of our review. Technically correct execution can minimize the risk of damage caused by positioning, although the possibility of damage still exists. First of all, the position on the fracture table is discussed. Great care must be taken concerning the perineal post and leg holder. In the lateral decubitus position, the correct positioning of head and spine as well as that of the lower arm are of great importance. When using the Trendelenburg and reverse Trendelenburg position, the effect on the cardiopulmonary system and the intracranial pressure must to be taken into consideration. Prone position and its modifications (i.e. tuck position) demand diligent care concerning the positioning of the head. There must be absolutely no bulbus compression and the abdominal wall should not be under pressure. While employing the sitting position, the patient should be adequately monitored so that venous air embolism can be recognized and treated as soon as possible. Because of the increased occurrence of grave complications, the sitting position should be used only if this is absolutely necessary.","2739":"","2740":"","2741":"We report on the case of a pneumonia caused by Bacillus cereus in a patient who sustained severe thoracic trauma, fractures of ribs 3-12, left lung contusion and haematopneumothorax. Bronchoscopic alveolar lavage (BAL) performed on ICU day four helped identifying the underlying cause of pneumonia. Inspite of early diagnosis and antibiotic treatment with clindamycin, cefotaxim and tobramycin, which rapidly eliminated the bacteria from the patient's lungs, the patient eventually died from the severe underlying injuries. However, this case emphasises that early performed BAL and rapid microbiological staining techniques can help diagnose pneumonia in critically ill patients. We also review the literature on pulmonary infections caused by Bacillus cereus.","2742":"Inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme may rarely cause an angioneurotic oedema of the upper aerodigestive tract. The pathomechanism of this side effect depends on an interaction of the drug with hormones regulating the vascular resistance such as the kallikrein kinin system and the prostaglandin system. Anglo-oedema is characterised by subcutaneous or submucosal swelling, which preferably affects the lips, the soft palate, the tongue and the larynx. Pathomechanisms, differential diagnosis and treatment of ACE-inhibitor induced oedema of the upper aerodigestive tract are described by means of 3 case reports.","2743":"To avoid alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) a pre-operative withdrawal, post-operative drug therapy or continued substitution of ethanol may be tried. However, substitution of ethanol needs an exact dosage and has to be controlled very carefully. The dose calculation is based on an assumed breakdown rate of 0.15 g%\/1000\/h, as evaluated in forensic studies. We report on a patient who throws the basis for these calculations into question. The breakdown rate of this 43-year-old man was extraordinary higher than the average turnover. This high level of the turnover rate occurred with no detectable impairment of the liver or other organs. This case demonstrates the importance of a close control of the blood alcohol level during the post-operative administration of ethanol. The individual doses of ethanol to avoid AWS has to be found individually for each patient.","2744":"","2745":"","2746":"The significance of the recumbent chest x-ray using digital luminescence radiography was to be assessed in respect of diagnosis of pleural effusions. Three experienced radiologists evaluated 32 digital recumbent chest x-rays of 32 intensive-care patients. The radiologists were asked to estimate the effusion volume and to assess whether typical x-ray signs of pleural effusions were seen. These evaluations were compared with one another and with the simultaneously produced CTs. Diagnostic accuracy of the digital recumbent chest x-ray is of medium quality in respect of diagnosis of pleural effusions (sensitivity: 69%, specificity: 54%, positive predictive value: 81%, negative predictive value: 34%, rate of accuracy: 65%). Diagnostic safety is the same for right-sided or left-sided pleural effusions, and increases with increasing effusion volume. The ratings by the radiologists are statistically not significantly different, but are significantly different from the CT measurements (Wilcoxon test, p &lt; 0.05). Correlations of the assessments and the measurements were weakly positive (r = 0.24, r = 0.36, r = 0.47). The pleural effusions were on the average underestimated by the radiologists. The median predictive error was 203 ml. Recumbent chest x-ray with digital luminescence radiography is an imaging method of limited accuracy in respect of diagnosis of pleural effusions. Supplementary diagnostic methods are recommended, as the present results show, especially in such cases where the recumbent chest x-ray does not reveal an effusion or if the volume must be determined accurately. Digital recumbent chest x-ray ranks equal with conventional x-ray in the diagnosis of pleural effusions. ","2747":"Since frontobasal fractures after severe head trauma may cause serious late-term complications such as meningitis, their recognition and operative treatment are essential. Therefore, we analysed the importance of rhinoliquorrhoea as an early symptom of such fractures by comparison with neuroradiological methods. In all patients undergoing operative revision of frontobasal fractures during a 7-year period, the clinical symptoms, results of neuroradiological examinations, concomitant injuries, as well as operative results, were studied retrospectively. 45 patients out of 688 with severe head injury showed frontobasal fractures (6.5%). The most common cause of these injuries were traffic accidents (55%) and precipitated falls or plunges (35%). Posttraumatic rhinoliquorrhoea was seen in 41 of 45 patients (91%), and 30 showed external periorbital injuries (66%). In 8 patients (18%) the frontobasal fractures could not be visualised by facultatively performed neuroradiological methods (coronary CT-scan, CT-cisternography, subarachnoid space scintigraphy). 15 patients (33%) were secondarily transferred to our institution, two of them more than two years after the causative injury. All patients were operated on successfully within 14 days after admission. Traffic accidents and precipitated falls or plunges are the main causes of head injuries with frontobasal fractures and about 2\/3 of these patients show external periorbital injuries. Rhinoliquorrhoea as an early symptom allows diagnosis of frontobasal fractures in 90% of all cases rather than neuroradiological methods which failed to demonstrate frontobasal fractures in about 20% of our patients. Therefore, recognition of rhinoliquorrhoea in patients with severe head injury is essential. ","2748":null,"2749":"The ambulance was called to a known asthmatic patient. On arrival, the team found a massively dyspnoeic, diaphoretic, non-cyanotic and somnolent patient. His medication consisted of oral theophylline (unknown dosage), fenoterol (metered-dose inhaler), as well as 8 mg oral prednisolone. On the day of emergency, the patient had been treated by two physicians who applied two doses of i.v. theophylline and one dose of s.c. terbutaline because of bronchoconstriction (dosage not documented). The patient's pulse was frequent with 200 beats\/min, the blood pressure not measurable. Careful i.v. titration of metoprolol was started to decrease the patient's heart rate and increase diastolic filling and stroke volume. However, the patient showed a progressive circulatory collapse. Following diagnostic thoracocentesis to rule out a left-side pneumothorax, the patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation because of increasing cardiovascular instability. A tension pneumothorax developed immediately after mechanical ventilation and required rapid treatment with a chest tube. Nevertheless, CPR and intravenous infusion of catecholamines were necessary before the patient was referred to a medical intensive care unit where he died the same day in cardiogenic shock. Clinical signs and symptoms associated with an elevated theophylline plasma level make theophylline toxicity the probable causative event for the patient's emergency condition of acute theophylline intoxication.","2750":"Inhalation of inorganic, inert dusts, like concrete dust, has generally not been considered dangerous. Very rarely alterations following chronic exposures can be observed, such as airflow obstruction and increased mucous secretion. Acute reactions in terms of acute respiratory failure have not been described so far. The present case report introduces a 54-year old male patient who developed acute respiratory failure after sawing a concrete block for several hours without wearing a face mask. Save for a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease he was unremarkable for his past medical history. When the emergency physician arrived, oxyhaemoglobin saturation was only 54%. Severely obstructed breathing sounds and coarse bubbling rales over both lungs were audible. After endotracheal intubation, a great deal of white viscous mucus could be aspirated via the tubus. The chest radiograph after admission demonstrated cloudy, shadowed areas with emphasis on both lower lung fields. As pulmonary function did not improve inspite of drug therapy with prednisolone, theophylline, fenoterol, n-acetylcysteine and respiration therapy with 100% oxygen concentration, the patient was treated daily with bronchoscopic aspiration of the mucus. Only on the fourth day, after an additional ten hours in prone position, the lung function improved. The patient could be extubated on the fifth day. The final chest radiograph indicated no residuum apart from a very small shadowed area on the right angle between heart and diaphragm. The inhalation of dusts, which have long been considered inert, can cause acute pulmonary reactions. We suggest that the massive, mechanical covering on the alveolar layer with still alkaline concrete dust in conjunction with a history of chronic bronchitis was responsible for the acute inflammation and oedematous swelling of the bronchial mucosa, bronchospasm, secretion of a highly viscid mucus, atelectasis, and thus for the ARDS. ","2751":"","2752":"","2753":"","2754":"","2755":"","2756":"Positioning a patient for surgery requires great care and caution. Correct positioning provides the surgeon with good access to the site, minimizes blood loss and reduces the risk of damage to nerves, soft tissue, compartments and the cardio-pulmonary system. Each position has its specific risks. These have to be evalued against the benefits. Extreme positions of the joints should be avoided whenever possible. The ulnar nerve or the plexus brachialis are at highest risk in the positioning of extremities. Good anatomical comprehension makes it possible to take effective counter-measures. In the case of damage to the ulnar nerve in spite of optimal positioning, some authors found pre-existent non-symptomatic dysfunction in up to 30% of the cases. Patients suffering from peripheral vascular disease are usually at higher risk to suffer acute ischaemia, or, in the extreme, rhabdomyolysis with compartment syndrome, when positioned with elevated extremities (as in lithotomy position) or when a tourniquet is applied. Next to other factors, the duration of surgery seems to be of some importance. Operation sites above the heart carry a higher risk of venous air embolism unrelated to the positioning. In these cases adequate monitoring should be generously applied. Loss of visus is a rare but very severe complication most often seen in connection with the prone position. Still, postoperative blindness has occurred in all positions. It is absolutely imperative to avoid all pressure to the bulbus. The same law applies to surgery and positioning: indicated and correctly executed positioning, to which the patient has effectively consented, is legal, even if damage should occur. If the plaintiff demands compensation for damage, the distribution of onus of proof depends essentially on the accuracy of documentation. If documentation is faulty, the plaintiff may be granted relief or even shift of the onus of proof. This does not apply to a criminal lawsuit; in that case, culpable medical fallibility must be proven, since otherwise, the principle of \"in dubio pro reo\" applies. The interdisciplinary responsibilities concerning the positioning must be clearly defined and it is essential that the documentation of positioning as well as the documentation of positioning control is carried out as accurately as possible. Correct positioning can effectively aid surgery. Slovenly positioning should not be accepted, as there is a high probability of ill effects, possibly of permanent damage.","2757":"Patients with ischaemic heart disease and cardiac failure are endangered by an increase in oxygen consumption caused by postoperative shivering. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if pethidine and clonidine, which are well known for their effectiveness in the treatment of this undesirable side effect, can also prevent postoperative shivering if administered at the end of surgery. In addition it was investigated whether their intraoperative application influences the time of extubation and analgesics demand in the early postoperative period. 60 patients (ASA I-II) scheduled for elective microsurgical vertebral disc resection were included in the study. After standardised induction of anaesthesia (5 mg x kg-1 thiopental, 2 micrograms x kg-1 fentanyl, 0.1 mg x kg-1 vecuronium) lungs were ventilated with isoflurane vaporized in 66% N2O and 33% O2. The concentration of the inhalation anaesthetic was adjusted to maintain a surgical plane of anaesthesia without supplementary doses of opioids. Patients were randomly allocated in a double-blind fashion to one of three groups (each n = 20) to receive either pethidine (0.3 mg x kg-1) or clonidine (2 micrograms x kg-1) or 0.9% saline (control) 5 minutes prior to the end of surgery. Heart rate, arterial blood pressure and rectal temperature were measured at defined times, as well as the recovery time between the end of anaesthesia and extubation, incidence of postoperative shivering, and the pain level of the patients with a visual analog scale. The frequency and total demand of analgesics were determined using patient controlled analgesia and recorded for two hours postoperatively. The incidence of postoperative shivering in the clonidine group (5%) was less than in the pethidine group (25%) and significantly less than in the saline group (55%). Heart rate and blood pressure values after the administration of clonidine were lower than after pethidine and significantly lower than after saline. The time between end of surgery and extubation was similar in all groups with an average of 18 minutes. No significant differences among the pain scores and the analgesics demand were noted among any of the groups, including the saline control-group. Intraoperative administration of clonidine (2 micrograms x kg-1) is suitable for prevention of postoperative shivering. Despite its sedative effects the recovery time until extubation was not prolonged. 0.3 mg x kg-1 pethidine proved to be less beneficial. ","2758":"In 35 ASA group I and II patients we investigated the influence of haemodynamic changes induced by increasing concentrations of halothane (from 0.0 to 0.6% halothane in 70% N20) on parameters of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Measurements by TEE were taken in manual and automatic boundary detection mode. In manual mode the left ventricular endsystolic area (ESA) increased significantly (+16.3%) and the fractional area change (FAC) decreased significantly (-14.9%). There was no significant change of left ventricular end diastolic area (EDA). In the automatic mode there was a significant increase of ESA and EDA (+13.8%; +6.0%) and a significant decrease of FAC (-10.9%). Peak ejection rate (PER) and peak filling rate (PFR) which were also assessed in automated mode decreased significantly (-10.0%; -5.7%) under halothane. No change occurred with manually determined left ventricular endsystolic wall stress (LVEWS). The endsystolic quotient decreased significantly both in manual and automated mode during halothane (-28.3%; -29.9%). No significant difference existed between TEE measurements under apnoea versus under controlled ventilation (except for EDA in automated mode). We conclude that there is no need for apnoea conditions for TEE measurements. In conclusion, TEE proves a useful monitoring system in anesthesia which enables the investigator to assess the negative inotropic effect of halothane. Problems in its practical usage are due to the wide variation of TEE measurements.","2759":"The analgetic effect of EMLA-Creme (Lidocaine-Prilocaine-Cream) was studied in 52 patients undergoing preoperative autologous blood and\/or plasma donation. 95 venous punctures were performed with a 18 G or 16 G cannula. Puncture pain was estimated by the patients using a visual analog painscore (VAS 0-100). The data were evaluated regarding reaction time, puncture spot and cannula diameter. Within 15 minutes we find a clear reduction of puncture pain. The diameter of the cannula does not correlate with the painscore. Puncture of hand-back veins seems to be more painful than cubital vein puncture. The application of EMLA-Creme results in an effective analgesia for venous puncture. 37% of our patients were punctured without any pain and 67% felt a tolerable pain (VAS: 0-10). ","2760":"Between 1986 and 1996, 16 infants and children less than 11 years of age (m = 11, f = 5) underwent resections for acquired or congenital tracheobronchial stenoses. During this period, various techniques of total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) were employed (midazolam, fentanyl, pancuronium; propofol, fentanyl, pancuronium). During the phase of dividing the airways, high-frequency-jet ventilation (HFJV) into the trachea or the main bronchi by 8-12Fr catheter(s) was applied for 10-75 min with driving pressures between 0.3-1.8 bar, frequencies between 100-200\/min, I:E ratio between 1:4-1:1, and FjetO2 1.0. Catheter position was controlled visually, gas exchange was monitored by pulse oximetry and blood gas analysis. There were two incidents of transient hypoxaemia (paO2 less than 60 mmHg), and 4 cases of hypercapnia (paCO2 more than 45 mmHg). No complications due to the HFJV-catheter technique, such as barotrauma or aspiration were seen. All children were kept postoperatively on a ventilator due to swelling of the airway anastomosis. In 5 children ventilator treatment exceeded 7 days, 3 children were discharged tracheostomised. These observations serve to confirm that HFJV is capable of maintaining gas exchange during tracheal resection in infants and children, if the following prerequisites are met: 1. Tracheobronchial pathology suitable for poststenotic placement of jet catheter. 2. No respiratory impairment by parenchymal pathology. 3. Monitoring by continuous visual control of respiratory mechanics, pulse oximetry and blood gas analysis. Cardiopulmonary bypass should be applied if airway pathology precludes safe placement of jet catheters, or in the presence of parenchymal respiratory failure.","2761":"","2762":"A 47-year old man was operated for a malignant tumour of the bladder.

Inspite of all intensive-care efforts the patient died with a multiorgan failure caused by endotoxin shock 66 hours after having received the first transfusions. In the blood cultures of the patient and in the cultures of the first transfused unit of packed red cells Yersinia enterocolitica was isolated.","2763":"We report on a case of an unexpected gas embolism during an arthroscopy of a newly injured shoulder joint.

The title of his monograph was \"Merits of nitrous oxide anaesthesia--a comparative study seeking reintroduction and increase of the use of nitrous oxide in Germany\". With this paper, Schmidt qualified himself as the first lecturer for anaesthesiology in Germany. He had been eager since the mid-twenties on establishing our special medical discipline separate from surgery. Schmidt's merits also include introducing students and doctors to the practice of anaesthesiology, teaching both a practical approach towards anaesthesia at the operating room, and theory during lectures on general surgery. This method was absolutely new at that time. Due to the resistance by conservative surgeons, he failed to establish a \"German Society of Anaesthesia\" during the 90th meeting of the \"German Society of Natural Scientists and Physicians\" held in Hamburg in 1928. In fact, this was accomplished only as late as 1953.

The study contributes to the quality assurance project of the German Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care (DGAI). We adjusted and tabulated our data for preoperative risk and for different methods of anaesthesia. This nation-wide DGAI project was launched to compare clinical institutions in accordance with German social legislation. DGAI recommends standardised documentation of parameters representing quality of process (QP) defined by a 63-items list, during every anaesthesia course. Additionally, quality of outcome parameters (QO) defined by a 64-items list should be assessed by an anaesthetist during a standardised postoperative ward round by means of spot checks. A questionnaire covering subjective complaints (SC) and patient satisfaction, is optional. The combination of these tools was evaluated during a 5-month period in every patient (n = 282) on a traumatological surgery ward. QP and QO showed a significant association (p &lt; 0.0001). The incidence of both parameters increases according to risk factors like age and ASA physical status. This was not significant in respect of the type of anaesthesia (p = 0.20). Whereas perioperative QP parameters were less frequent in regional versus general anaesthesia (p &lt; 0.0001), there was no postoperative difference in QO as seen by the anaesthetist (p = 0.20). However, postoperative SC were less frequent with regional anaesthesia (p &lt; 0.0001). The association of QO and SC was mot significant (p = 0.24). There was comparable preoperative morbidity (p = 0.74) for both anaesthetic procedures. 96.5% of all patients expressed overall satisfaction. Despite this fact, nausea (25%), vomiting (29%), thurst (29%) and particularly wound pain (33%) were frequent. Quality parameters assessed by anaesthetists and patients are independent in respect to their frequency. For this purpose, anaesthesiological quality assurance must focus on both the anaesthetist and the patient. As clinical consequence, we suggest establishing an interdisciplinary post-anaesthesia service. Acceptance by, and collaboration between, the surgical disciplines are indispensable especially for a successful application of effective pain and antiemetic therapy. ","2768":"Current trends toward outpatient surgery and closed loop computer controlled drug administration have created a demand for short acting anaesthetic agents. Such agents not only provide the anaesthetist with rapid patient recovery after completion of the procedure, but also with almost immediate intra-operative control over the anaesthetic state of the patient. Shorter acting anaesthetic agents are being developed in several therapeutic areas including volatile anaesthetics, neuromuscular blockers as well as injectable anaesthetics. In the injectable anaesthetic area, propofol has been introduced and offers some significant advantages over the previously existing induction agents. Remifentanil is a novel member in the family of the 4-anilidopiperidine opioid analgesics which also include the traditional agents fentanyl, alfentanil, and sufentanil. Remifentanil undergoes widespread extrahepatic metabolism by blood and tissue nonspecific esterases, resulting in an extremely rapid clearance. Because of its unique metabolic pathway among this group of drugs, remifentanil represents a new pharmacokinetic class of opioids which is named esterase metabolised opioid (EMO). Rapid biotransformation to minimally active metabolites results in short and predictable duration of action with no accumulation of effect on repeated dosing or with continuous infusion. Clinical experiences presented so far indicate that remifentanil can be safely administered in different anaesthetic regimens as well as in the great variety of patients including children and patients with renal, hepatic or cardiovascular diseases. However, its use also presents the anaesthetist with a significant challenge. If remifentanil is the only opioid analgesic administered during anaesthesia, it must be remembered that shortly after the end of the surgical procedure, the patient will not benefit from opioid-based analgesia. This problem must be addressed if remifentanil is to be used for procedures associated with significant postoperative pain. Reducing the infusion rate of remifentanil to analgesic doses suitable for the postoperative pain management or immediate administration of longer acting opioids at the end of anaesthesia might solve this problem. At present it is difficult to predict precisely the future ranking of remifentanil. However, the unique pharmacokinetic profile of remifentanil should make it useful in the various surgical settings and in all circumstances where precise control over the analgesic state are desirable.","2769":"","2770":"","2771":"We describe the case of an extremely overweight woman in her 35 th week of pregnancy with a manifest Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT), on whom a tibial fracture was operated under general anaesthesia. Anaesthesia was induced with thiopental, droperidol, fentanyl and maintained with nitrous oxide and isoflurane. Atracurium was administered as a muscle relaxant agent. Depolarizing muscle relaxants have not been used because of a significantly increased risk of hyperkalemia. The immediate intubation using the principle of a so-called \"priming dose\" was within normal limits. CMT syndrome is a very rare hereditary autosomal dominant degenerative disease of the peripheral nervous system. The main site of manifestation is the peroneus muscle. In case of affection of the respiratory muscular system, which acutely can occur postoperatively even without any suspicious findings in the preoperatively performed lung function tests, an insufficiency of the respiratory tract is predominant and may require a postoperative intensive care with a prolonged artificial respiration. With the application of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants significant prolongations of the half-life period have occasionally been observed. Therefore we recommend the monitoring of the neuromuscular blockade perioperatively using the train-of-four ratio.

This study deals with the mechanically induced haemolysis due to blood pumping by infusion pumps (type INCA; Fresenius AG) in dependence on device related as well as blood preserve related (donor, storage time) factors. RBC count, MCV, MCHC, hematocrit, total and extracellular haemoglobin were obtained before and after pumping the blood sample. At a pump rate of 1000 ml\/h, 0.06% of RBC (storage duration of 1-3 days) and 0.3% (storage duration of 34-36 days) were destroyed, respectively. Furthermore, it was shown that only gravity induced perfusion of the Intra-Air-system and the tubing system without any pumping lead to a minor, but significant elevation of extracellular haemoglobin concentration. In contrast, a volume flow rate of 2000 ml\/h or the 10 times repeated pump process (1000 ml\/h) increases haemolysis by only 27% or 520% respectively. It was concluded that any extrapolation from given experimental conditions to other ones must be performed with great caution due to the complex nature of the haemolysis process. Infusion pumps of the INCA-type stress RBC only slightly and may therefore be used for controlled blood transfusion.

Patients were anaesthetized with fentanyl, midazolam, continuous infusion of etomidate and pancuronium. Ventilation was performed with oxygen in air. CPB was managed according to alpha-stat conditions under moderate hypothermia (27 degrees C). SjO2 (%) and jugular bulb temperature (degree C) were measured by a fiberoptic thermodilution catheter (Opticath F 5.5, Abbott Critical Care Systems) placed in the jugular bulb via the internal jugular vein. Appropriate catheter position was x-ray controlled prior to the measurements. The fiberoptic data were compared to co-oximetric data of blood samples after induction of anaesthesia, 2 min following start of CPB, during cooling, stable hypothermia and rewarming of CPB. Assessing of agreement (Bland\/Altman and Bartko). Jugular venous oximetry correlated closely with the co-oximeter determinations after induction of anaesthesia. However, following start of CPB accuracy was decreased. During cooling, stable hypothermia and rewarming oximetric data correlated well with co-oximetry, however, over-estimating the SjO2 by 1.4 to 2%. The present data show that continuous jugular bulb venous oximetry is accurate and reliable for continuous SjO2 monitoring during hypothermic CPB for cardiac surgery. Induction of CPB and hemodilution affect accuracy slightly, but changes are well detected. Before clinical intervention SjO2 should be confirmed by laboratory co-oximetry.

Prior to surgery all patients received an epidural catheter before induction of general anaesthesia. After 90 minutes a 10 ml bolus of the study solution was given via the epidural catheter followed by a continuous infusion of 5 ml\/h until the end of surgery and further on 5-8 ml\/h for 24 hours postoperatively. The solutions consisted of 50 micrograms sufentanil in 50 ml 0.125% bupivacaine (group 1), 150 micrograms clonidine in 50 ml 0.125% bupivacaine (group 2) and 50 micrograms sufentanil + 150 micrograms clonidine in 50 ml 0.125% bupivacaine (group 3). Measurements included the total dose of infused drug solution, pain at rest and on exercise by a visual analogue scale, cardiorespiratory data and side-effects within the first 24 hours postoperatively. A standardised interview on analgesia and side-effects was held two days after surgery. At rest excellent analgesia could be provided by all of the tested drug solutions. On exercise we evaluated lower pain scores in group 3 (1.9 +\/- 1.1) compared to group 1 (2.8 +\/- 1.6) or group 2 (3.8 +\/- 2.1) (2 vs 3 p &lt; 0.05). Severe side effects such as respiratory depression or drop of heart rate or blood pressure did not occur. Epidural administration of drug solutions containing a low dose local anaesthetic, opioid and alpha 2-agonist, provides excellent analgesia after major abdominal surgery. Patients at rest can be treated very effectively with both a combination of only two or with all of the tested drugs. On exercise the mixture containing all analgesics was more efficient than the solutions with only two of the tested drugs. Severe side effects such as respiratory depression or cardiovascular instability were not seen.

Many mechanisms of cell function have been elucidated by the application of the patch clamp method because it was now possible to demonstrate and investigate directly single ion channels in excitable cell membranes. An important discovery, as far as medicine was concerned, was that various clinically used substances interact directly with ion channels. Local anaesthetics, antiarrhythmics, antidiabetics, muscle relaxants are a few examples. For these reasons, more and more clinical physicians use the patch clamp method for their specific investigations. Collaboration between a clinical institute and a basic research department can often be found, which gives clinical research more background and basic science more practical aspects.","2781":"","2782":"Following repeated metamizole applications a 41-year old intensive-care patient suffering from severe craniocerebral trauma and sepsis developed a drug-induced agranulocytosis.

In 1967 Parbrook described leukopenic effects during long-term exposure to N2O. It was only in 1978 that further studies were conducted on myeloneuropathies and myelodepression under the influence of N2O. The basic cause is vitamin B12 deficiency and the irreversible oxidation of coenzyme B12 by N2O. Between 1986 and 1995 eight cases of acute funicular myelosis associated with latent vitamin B12 deficiency subsequent to nitrous oxide anaesthesia were reported. In our hospital, two further patients now have this disease. Two observations must be emphasised when assessing the 10 patients mentioned above: 1. There was no long-term exposure to N2O (&gt; 6 hrs); the periods of anaesthesia were between 1.5 and 3.5 hrs. 2. Vitamin B12 deficiency was not known preoperatively, and there was no marked pernicious anaemia, so that the only pointers to the risk patients were supplied by the mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) and the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of the blood picture.","2784":"","2785":"","2786":"","2787":"","2788":"","2789":"","2790":"","2791":"","2792":"","2793":"","2794":"In a prospective randomised controlled trial the effect of preoperative normovolaemic haemodilution on coagulation, plasma viscosity and plasma protein levels was examined. 50 patients undergoing gastrectomies were investigated (haemodilution group, n = 30; control group, n = 20). In the haemodilution group a haematocrit of 30% was aimed at. Blood was replaced by normovolaemic infusion of 6% hydroxyethyl starch 200\/0.5. Haematocrit, colloid osmotic pressure, total serum protein, serum albumin and platelet count were significantly decreased intra- and postoperatively in the haemodilution group compared with control group (p &lt; 0.01). All of these showed no differences between the two groups on the 7th postoperative day. Global coagulation parameters showed dilutional influences without significant differences between the two groups. Measurements of rheological parameters showed a statistically significant decrease in plasma viscosity in the haemodilution group compared with control group (p &lt; 0.01). Haemodilution led to a marked reduction in the use of homologous blood (1 unit\/haemodilution group; 10 units\/ control group).

Haemodilution induced decreases in plasma coagulation, platelet count and plasma proteins did not cause any functional impairement and may just reflect dilution of these parameters.

With the approval of the local ethics committee, 34 patients without neurological deficits scheduled for an operation in supine position (n = 15) and in the so-called \"rabbit-position\" (RP, n = 19) were chosen for a prospective randomised investigation. Prior to induction of anaesthesia, during the study and after extubation, the systolic (Vs), diastolic (Vd) and mean (Vm) of blood flow velocities as well as pulsatility (Vs - Vd)\/Vm of the middle cerebral artery were determined by TCD. In addition mean arterial pressure and heart rate were monitored. Pulmonary airway pressures were observed during anaesthesia and CO2-partial pressure and central venous pressure (CVP) were determined by central venous line and blood samples. Anaesthesia was initiated with 5 mg\/kg thiopental and continued with 0.8-1.2 vol% isoflurane in N2O\/O2 = 2:1. After positioning all variables were recorded at 10-minute intervals with an inspiratory:exspiratory (I:E) ratio of 1:2, positive endexspiratory pressures (PEEP) of 0 and 10 cm H2O and an I:E ratio of 1:1 with 0 and 10 cm H2O PEEP. The respirator was adjusted to maintain an endtidal pCO2 of 40 mmHg. Neither different positioning of the patients, nor the alteration of respiratory parameters affected TCD variables in a significant way. No significant alterations were detected between the two groups of patients. Rising PEEP resulted in a minor but significant increase in CVP by an average of 3 cm H2O in both groups. The respective positions produced different respiratory pressures. These were in the \"RP-group\", with and without PEEP, at an approximately 5 cm H2O higher level. All other parameters did not vary significantly. The findings of this study show that a positioning of patients in a so-called \"rabbit position\" during anaesthesia does not alter the rate of blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery. Moreover, the modification of important respiratory parameters, especially a rise of PEEP to 10 cm H2O, had no significant influence on TCD values.

The present study was undertaken to compare intubating conditions as well as onset and clinical duration of a single dose of 0.6 mg\/kg (2 x ED95) with a single dose of 1 mg\/kg suxamethonium (3 x ED95). After obtaining informed consent and approval of the Ethics Committee, 40 adult patients (ASA I-III) participated in this study. After premedication with oxazepam, anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl and propofol and maintained with propofol, N2O and supplements of fentanyl as needed. Muscular relaxation was assessed by EMG recording of adductor pollicis muscle after supramaximal single twitch stimulation of the ulnar nerve every 10 s. Patients were allocated randomly to receive either rocuronium 0.6 mg\/kg or suxamethonium 1 mg\/kg. The following parameters were measured: intubating conditions 60 s after injection, onset time and clinical duration of neuromuscular block, % block at intubation, heart rate, blood pressure and arterial oxygen saturation. (mean +\/- SD). Intubating conditions after rocuronium and suxamethonium were found to be clinically acceptable (excellent or good) in 90% of patients, though there was only a partial blockade of the adductor pollicis muscle with rocuronium (71 +\/- 23%) compared to suxamethonium (95 +\/- 14%) (p &lt; 0.05).

At a dosage of 0.6 mg\/kg, rocuronium has an onset time of about 3 min and a clinical duration of relaxation of nearly half an hour. These data are supported by various studies, while others show shorter times, probably due to different monitoring techniques.

","2797":"Clark and Gollan demonstrated impressively in 1966 the ability of perfluorchemicals (PFCs) to transport oxygen and to provide gas exchange across the alveolar capillary membrane. PFCs are used for two major medical indications: as artificial blood substitutes and as a medium for liquid ventilation. The PFC perflubron is additionally used as a contrast medium for diagnostic radiologic procedures. For the intravenous application perfluorocarbons have to be emulgated in phospholipids for the intrapulmonary application the sterile pure solution is used. Liquid ventilation can either be performed by a method known as total liquid ventilation (TLV), in which a device is utilised to ventilate with perfluorocarbon the previously perfluorocarbon-filled lung, or as partial liquid ventilation (PLV) in which a conventional mechanical gas ventilator is used to gas ventilate the partially perfluorocarbon-filled lung. A number of studies have demonstrated the efficacy of perfluorocarbon liquid ventilation in improving gas exchange and pulmonary function in a number of animal species in the setting of acute respiratory failure. In 1989 Greenspan reported on the first human liquid ventilation experience in a neonate. More recently human experiences for neonatal, paediatric and adult patients with acute lung injury have been reported. Since 1995 an FDA-approved study to examine the efficacy of PLV in severe respiratory failure in patients of all ages has been undertaken in the United States. The number of PLV-treated patients is still small; if PLV demonstrates its efficacy even in the ongoing human studies, it might be a very effective additional tool for treating severe acute lung injury.","2798":"","2799":"","2800":"A patient in acute respiratory failure (Murray score 2.0) caused by pneumonia in the remaining lung 4 days after left-sided pneumonectomy was successfully treated with non-invasive pressure support by face mask.

Inspiratory pressure support was added to reduce increased work of breathing, improve ventilatory mechanics and gas exchange. Also, intrinsic PEEP was counterbalanced by external PEEP of 5 cmH2O to reduce work of breathing. Inspiratory pressure support of 15 cmH2O reduced respiratory rate to less than 30 breaths\/min, improved paO2 and reduced elevated paCO2 towards normal within 3 hours.

Measurements included pulse oximetry and side stream spirometry with continuous collection of the following data: airway pressure, inspired and expired tidal volume, dynamic compliance, expired volume in one second, inspiratory and expiratory oxygen and carbon dioxide concentration. Pressure-volume and flow-volume loops were displayed continuously. Ventilation via facial mask or via pharyngeal tube with and without relaxation showed normal endtidal FECO2. The mean values were 4.5 +\/- 0.7%, 4.8 +\/- 0.4% and 4.6 +\/- 0.7%, respectively. Mean oxygen saturation exceeded 98% in each period. Leakage during mask ventilation was 59.3 +\/- 65.5 mL and decreased to 40.5 +\/- 62.1 mL with the pharyngeal tube, whereas relaxation resulted in a significant increase to 92.3 75.0 mL.

The incidence of pain and involuntary movements during injection, oculocardiac reflex (OCR), laryngospasm and postoperative shivering were as well registered as the duration of the operation and the time of extubation. Episodes of nausea and vomiting were documented during 24 hours postoperatively. TIVA with Propofol resulted in a decreased heart rate (p = 0.002) and a higher frequency of OCR (p = 0.01) than thiopentone\/isoflurane anaesthesia with a higher sensitivity of children younger than 6 years (p = 0.007) in all groups. There were no differences in extubation time between groups. The overall incidence of nausea (p = 0.002) and vomiting (p = 0.007) was lower in group 1 and 2 when compared to group 3 and 4. Propofol as an induction agent of balanced anaesthesia fails to show advantages over thiopentone. During total intravenous anaesthesia propofol increases the risk of bradycardia especially in younger children.

It has been known for a long time that intubation and mechanical ventilation can impair mucous transport and lead to morphological damage to the tracheobronchial mucosa. Recent studies made it clear, however, that mechanical ventilation during anaesthesia using an appropriate anaesthesiological technique has no deleterious effect on mucus transport in patients with healthy lungs. Ventilated patients in the intensive-care unit frequently have impaired mucus transport, which is associated with the development of retention of secretion and nosocomial pneumonia. In these patients a number of factors combine to form a formidable potential insult to the mucociliary transport mechanism. Numerous drugs can affect mucociliary transport.

The ryanodine receptor gene encoding the human skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor has been localised to the chromosome 19q13.1-13.2 region. The ryanodine receptor, which is an intracellular calcium release channel, has been proposed to be one of the candidate structures for the MH defect. At present, eight different single point mutations have been identified in the human skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor gene in families with disposition to MH. The incidence of the various mutations has been reported as 2-10% each. A combination of different mutations within one pedigree has not been demonstrated. A few years ago, linkage of the MHS-phenotype to DNA markers from the chromosome 17q11.2-24 region was published by an American group. However, this observation has not been confirmed in any of the several European families susceptible to MH. Genes encoding for subunits of the dihydropyridine receptor and the sodium channel of the human skeletal muscle have been found to be located in the chromosome 17q11.2-24 region which, in fact, could be additional candidates for the MH defect. The dihydropyridine receptor is linked to the ryanodine receptor and involved in the calcium regulation of skeletal muscle.

Due to a double-rupture phenomenon with bleeding into the bursa omentalis and subsequent intraabdominal haemorrhage, the shock symptoms showed a biphasic time course that was moderate in the beginning but deteriorated dramatically within a few minutes. Intraabdominal bleeding was verified by transabdominal echography only at the time of circulatory decompensation. Ruptured splenic artery aneurysm was diagnosed after emergency laparotomy for suspected intraabdominal haemorrhage. The aetiology and pathophysiology, time course, differential diagnosis of the disease and patient outcome are discussed in this case report. Early consideration of a diagnosis of a ruptured splenic artery aneurysm as opposed to other critical postpartal conditions might increase the likelihood of survival of the affected women.","2829":"The case of a 16-year old female is presented who underwent laparoscopy under general anaesthesia and uncomplicated endotracheal intubation. Four hours after uneventful anaesthesia and extubation the patient started vomiting and coughing. Subcutaneous tissue emphysema developed and pneumomediastinum was diagnosed on a chest roentgenogram. A small lesion in the posterior wall of the trachea and consequent upon intubation by indirect tracheoscopy was identified as the possible source of air entry on the third postoperative day. Air accumulation and tracheal lesion protractedly responded to antitussive and antibiotic medication. A tracheal lesion during intubation is the most frequent and thus the most probable cause of air accumulation presenting as pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax or subcutaneous emphysema. As in the present case, increased airway pressure from vomiting or coughing even after a latent period may induce the phenomenon. Very occasional reports on spontaneous pneumomediastinum in young individuals must not detract the circumstances of endotracheal intubation from suspecting an iatrogenic lesion, confirming it by immediate endoscopy and thereupon deciding on conservative or surgical treatment.","2830":"","2831":"Decision-making on therapy in acute cases involves clinical examination and monitoring of vital parameters and fluid balance; especially, however, laboratory parameters. The present study compared the results of a new bedside laboratory analysis system (PortLab, i-STAT Corp., Princeton NJ) with the analytical results obtained in our central laboratory. In a second phase personnel costs and turnover times of the two methods were evaluated comparatively. The PortLab system consists of a basic unit (539 g) with an integrated display and disposable silicon cartridges with thin-film electrodes. Up to 8 parameters can be determined simultaneously in 60 microliters of whole blood. Fifty results obtained with the PortLab system of the parameters sodium, potassium, chlorid, glucose, BUN, hematocrit, the calculated haemoglobin and blood gas analysis were correlated with the results obtained by central laboratory analysis. In a second phase, all procedural steps, the time needed and the turnover times for laboratory analysis were compared with the expenditure for the same analyses performed with the PortLab system. The results obtained using PortLab analysis correlated very well with those of the central laboratory (between 0.966 for the hematocrit and 0.994 for pO2). Three steps were required to perform bedside analysis with the PortLap system. The staff was occupied for 1 min. and 15 sec. and the results were ready within 4 min. and 45 sec. (pure analysis time &lt; 2 min.). Analysis in the central laboratory required 8 steps, the intensive care staff was occupied for 6 min. and 15 sec., 5 min. and 15 sec. of which they were away from the patients' side. Analysis of blood gases required 4 steps, the result was ready in 4 min. 15 sec. The personnel was occupied for an equally long time. The use of PortLab saved personnel resources of 5 minutes per laboratory analysis and 3 minutes per blood gas analysis. The PortLab system proved easy to handle and reliable. Valuable personnel resources can be saved. This method cannot replace conventional laboratory analyses, but enables more extensive monitoring of patients and their laboratory parameters. The industry should develop analogous monitoring systems for modular solutions. ","2832":"The depolarizing muscle relaxant succinylcholine (SCh) may cause several side effects including muscle fasciculations and postoperative myalgia. These can be attenuated or even prevented by prior administration of a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant. A study was conducted to detect any difference between clinically established approaches concerning the successful prevention of muscular side effects and the influence on the time profile of SCh action. The study included 64 patients (ASA status I or II) who underwent elective surgery under general anesthesia. The patients were divided into four groups; the demographic data did not differ significantly between the groups (see table 1). Before the injection of SCh (1 mg\/kg) for intubation, the control group received saline (K), the other groups 5 mg Atracurium (A), 1 mg Vecuronium (V), or 1 mg Pancuronium (P), respectively. Neuromuscular block was quantified after train-of-four (TOF) stimulation of the tibial nerve by accelerometry at the toe. The first response was used to determine the onset time, duration of effect, and recovery index. It was noted whether SCh led to muscular activity. Postoperatively, patients were asked whether they experienced any muscular sequelae. Statistical significance was assessed at the 5% probability level by the Mann-Whitney-U test and the CHi2 test (Fisher's exact test, if appropriate). SCh caused a complete neuromuscular block in all patients. Most patients in the control group exhibited muscular contractions than in the other groups (see table 2), but only two patients reported light myalgia. There was no statistically significant difference between the four groups in the onset time and the recovery index of SCh. The duration of the effect was significantly reduced by atracurium (7.5 min) or vecuronium (8.2 min) as compared to the placebo (11.8 min) and pancuronium (13.5 min) (see figure). The prolonged duration of the SCh effect after pancuronium is probably due to the known inhibition of cholinesterase by pancuronium. The short duration of action after Atracurium and Vecuronium can be explained by the competitive antagonism at the receptor causing an increased amount of unbound SCh. The duration of the SCh effect may be influenced according to clinical needs by the choice of the non-depolarizing muscle relaxant. The significantly reduced duration of complete neuromuscular block after Atracurium or Vecuronium as precurarizing agents may be advantageous in cases where a fast recovery of spontaneous breathing is essential. If a reduction of the SCh blockade has to be avoided, Pancuronium should be selected for prior administration. ","2833":"This study concerns the effects of elevated mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) on decreases in jugular bulb oxygen saturation (SjO2) using fiberoptic jugular bulb oximetry and on cerebral blood flow velocity measured by transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). 27 ASA III patients undergoing CABG were studied. Anaesthesia was maintained with fentanyl, midazolam and continuous infusion of etomidate. CPB was managed according to alpha-stat conditions under moderate hypothermia (27 degrees C). SjO2 (%) and jugular bulb temperature were measured using a fiberoptic catheter placed in the right jugular bulb via the right internal jugular vein. TCD recordings of middle cerebral artery mean blood flow velocity (Vmean, cm\/s) were taken during the investigation period. Data were recorded continuously before and for 40 min following start of rewarming. In group 1 (n = 17) MAP was kept between 55 and 65 mmHg, in group 2 (n = 10) MAP was maintained above 70 mmHg using norepinephrine infusion during rewarming of CPB. Following rewarming MAP was statistically significant elevated in group 2 compared to group 1. In groups 1 and 2, Vmean was increased and SjO2 was decreased to a similar extent during rewarming of CPB. Decreases in SjO2 below 50% were seen in both groups. The present data show decreases in Sjo2 during rewarming regardless to the level of arterial blood pressure (range 55-80 mmHg). This suggests that desaturation during rewarming of CPB is not a function of decreases in MAP since CBF autoregulation appears to be maintained within this pressure range. ","2834":"Mivacurium is a new non-depolarising muscle relaxant with a relatively rapid onset and short duration of action. In children, intravenous injection of 0.2 mg\/kg produces satisfactory relaxation. Because inhalational anaesthetics have been found to enhance the potency of muscle relaxants we determined if onset or recovery times following mivacurium are influenced by inhalation of halothane (HAL), enflurane (ENF) or isoflurane (ISO). After intramuscular induction, 36 surgical children (2-6 years, ASA I) were randomly assigned to inhale either HAL (n = 12); ENF (n = 12) or ISO (n = 12). The train-of four (TOF) response was determined electromyographically (Relaxograph, Datex) at 20-second time intervals. Following ten minutes of inhalation of either HAL, ENF or ISO (0,8; 1,2; 1,0 vol% respectively) in N2 O\/O2 (2:1), 0.2 mg\/kg of mivacurium was injected intravenously. Patients were intubated at maximal T1-suppression and the intubating conditions were judged according to a graded score. Upon recovery of T1 = 25%, six patients in each group were antagonised with 30 micrograms\/kg of neostigmine and 15 micrograms\/kg of atropine; the recovery indices were compared with those from non-antagonised patients. Differences between groups were tested with multifactorial analysis of variance (p &lt; 0.05). Intubating conditions were graded as \"excellent\" or \"good\" in all patients but one who showed moderate breath holding following the tube passage. Onset times of mivacurium were not different between patients receiving HAL: 2.4 min +\/- 0.52 (+\/ SD); ENF: 2.4 min +\/- 0.55 or ISO: 2.6 min +\/- 0.68. Time to T1 = 25% was 7.6 min +\/- 2.91 (HAL); 7.9 min +\/- 1.55 (ENF) and 8.6 min +\/- 2.30 (ISO). Recovery indices were not significantly different between groups. Total duration of action in non-antagonised patients was 13.0 min +\/- 3.32 (HAL); 14.3 min +\/- 4.01 (ENF) and 19.6 min +\/- 5.17 (ISO), whereas antagonised duration of action was 13.4 min +\/- 5.11 (HAL); 13.3 min +\/- 1.97 (ENF) and 15.6 min +\/- 4.25 (ISO). The shorter total duration of action in patients receiving neostigmine (average 0.5-2 minutes) was statistically insignificant. Following injection of 0.2 mg\/kg of mivacurium, no clinically relevant differences in onset or recovery times were found between children receiving halothane, enflurane or isoflurane. No differences in heart rate or blood pressure were found between groups. Compared to previous investigations with mivacurium, we noted a 30-60% longer mean onset time and a 30% shorter mean spontaneous recovery time. This may be explained by the lower mean age of our patients, which correlates with a relatively higher volume of distribution, resulting in lower plasma concentrations if the dose is calculated per kilogramme body weight. The reduction of the mean recovery time by 2 minutes following neostigmine injection seems to be clinically irrelevant. Similar to adult, a twofold ED95 produces satisfactory surgical muscle relaxation in children receiving mivacurium. Thus, its onset time is comparable to that of vecuronium or atracurium. The shorter duration of action offering a tighter control over relaxation may be of clinical advantage in this age group. ","2835":"This study compared the two short-acting intravenous anaesthetic agents, etomidate in lipid emulsion and propofol, for anaesthesia during elective outpatient cardioversion. After institutional approval and informed consent, 40 patients (ASA II\/III) scheduled for cardioversion were studied. Patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 30% were excluded. The anti-arrhythmic medication was not discontinued, and no patient was given pharmacological premedication. Anaesthesia was induced either with etomidate (in lipid emulsion) 0.25 mg\/kg or propofol 1.5 mg\/kg. Both agents were administered over 30 seconds. Subsequent increments were given until the patients no longer followed verbal commands and the lid reflex was absent. Patients were allowed to breathe 40% oxygen via face mask. Artificial ventilation was performed if a patient became apnoeic for more than 20 seconds. The blood pressure was monitored continuously with the Finapres noninvasive blood pressure monitor, and the heart rate was recorded simultaneously. All data were collected electronically. The duration of anaesthesia was taken as the period from the start of induction until the opening of the eyes on command. For assessment of recovery from anaesthesia, patients were asked to perform a series of psychomotor tests. The two groups were similar in their demographic and haemodynamic baseline data. In both groups, a significant decrease in blood pressure occurred 120 seconds after anaesthesia induction, which was due to the performance of the cardioversion. Five minutes after induction, the blood pressure returned to baseline in the etomidate group, while it remained below baseline in the propofol group. Propofol caused a significant decrease in heart rate. Significantly more patients needed artificial ventilation after propofol administration because of apnoea. Involuntary muscle movements occurred only in patients receiving etomidate. The immediate emergence from anaesthesia was faster after propofol. However, 15 minutes after awakening there was no difference in psychomotor skills between the two groups. No residual psychomotor impairment was evident 60 minutes after anaesthesia in any patient. All patients were discharged four hours after the cardioversion. Because the recovery characteristics were similar in both groups, the occurrence of side effects may be a major factor when choosing between etomidate and propofol for outpatient cardioversion. ","2836":"Trauma to the cricoarytenoid joint represents a rare but serious complication of endotracheal intubation. Subluxation and luxation of the arytenoid cartilage may occur during difficult but also following uncomplicated intubation. Forces on the arytenoid cartilage exerted by the laryngoscope blade or by the distal part of the endotracheal tube may cause anterior and inferior displacement of the arytenoid cartilage. Due to the conventional intubation technique the left arytenoid cartilage is affected most frequently. Posterolateral subluxation is attributed to the pressure exerted on the posterior glottis by the convex part of the shaft of the tube. Systemic diseases (e.g. terminal renal insufficiency, bowel diseases, acromegaly) may cause degeneration of the cricoarytenoid ligaments, thus making the cricoarytenoid joint more susceptible to traumatic dislocation. Persisting alterations of voice, sore throat and pain on swallowing may hint to the diagnosis of arytenoid dislocation. However, stridor and shortness of breath have also been observed. If pharyngo-laryngeal complaints persist, evaluation by laryngologists is mandatory. In addition to indirect and direct laryngoscopy, computerised tomography and electromyography of the larynx play an important role in differentiating arytenoid dislocation from true vocal cord paralysis due to nerve damage. Early operative reposition results in fair prognosis, whereas delayed diagnosis may lead to ankylosis of the cricoarytenoid joint with permanent impairment of the voice and possibly compromised airway protection.","2837":"","2838":"","2839":"","2840":"","2841":"","2842":"","2843":"","2844":"","2845":"","2846":"","2847":"","2848":"Severe thoracic trauma is always an important risk factor for the development of acute pulmonary failure.

The left lung could not be ventilated even after separate artificial ventilation on each side with positive end expiratory pressure. After administration of surfactant (50 mg Exosurf per kg body weight) and continued separate artificial ventilation on each side, there was a complete re-expansion of the left lung with an increase of the arterial pO2 value from 65 mm Hg to 416 mm Hg with a FIO2 of 1,0 and a decrease of the intrapulmonary venous admixture from 34% to 12% within a few hours.

They cannot meet the demands of modern intensive-care medicine. At the inauguration of our Surgical I.C.U. in June 1992, an occupational-group oriented documentation system was introduced and put into operation. Because of negative repercussions on patient care, it was replaced by a patient-centered, conventional prescription and documentation system in April 1993. In April 1994, an evaluation of the patient-centered system was carried out. We report on our initial problem analysis, the subsequent developmental and introductory phases, and the results after having used the system in our I.C.U. for one year. Data condensation, standardised data recording, as well as structured prescription, examination, assessment and decision processes, saved 730 working hours for medical and nursing staff per year, reduced the cost for documentation materials by 58% and improved the extent of data recording.

METHODS. A training circuit (Fig. 1) was conceptualised using training manikins (i.e. BLS, intubation, megacode training, ATLS training), computer programmes (ECG-simulation) and other means of instruction to simulate twelve realistic situations. These practical skill sessions were linked with case presentation and lectures. Its topics were chosen depending on the prevalence, type and urgency. Separate guidelines for teachers and students were edited prior to the beginning of the course in 1994. RESULTS. Evaluation showed good acceptance by the students for most parts of the course except the ATLS skill station and CPR computer simulations (Table 5). The score of the national board examination (multiple-choice test) of the students from Ulm was nevertheless not better than the mean of all german examinees (72.1 to 71.7%). CONCLUSION. The concept of the course in emergency medicine is well accepted by our students. Results of the national examination were not improved, since the course aims at performance, skills and competence in emergency medicine and not at teaching factual knowledge that is measured by the MCQ examinations.","2860":"In a previous study we investigated the analgesic efficacy of metamizol. After laparoscopic operations, in particular, the reduction of postoperative opioid requirements within the first 24 h after surgery attained clinical relevance (-67%). In the present study we investigated the analgesic efficacy of supplementary diclofenac. 86 patients, scheduled for minor orthopaedic surgery, laparoscopic cholecystectomy or resection of the thyroid gland, participated in a doubleblind, randomised, placebo-controlled study. The setting was comparable to our previous study, apart from the supplementary administration of diclofenac. Before induction of anaesthesia, verum-treated patients received a diclofenac suppository (100 mg), in addition to metamizol (1 g\/100 ml NaCl 0.9% intravenous over 15 min). These infusions were repeated at 6h and 12h. In addition to the third infusion, the patients received a further diclofenac suppository (100 mg). Cumulated doses of buprenorphine (PCA, patient-controlled analgesia), pain scores (0-10), blood pressure, pulse and side effects were recorded during the first 6 h and again at 24 h. All verum-treated patients had significantly less pain immediately after surgery and required lower cumulated doses of buprenorphine during the first 24 h after operation (laparoscopic cholecystectomy -33%, minor orthopaedic surgery -73%, resection of thyroid gland -60%). Combination of metamizol and diclofenac cause a clinically relevant reduction in opioid requirements, in particular after minor orthopaedic surgery and resection of the thyroid gland. There is no need for supplementary diclofenac following laparoscopic surgery.

To date, results are on hand for four different 5-HT3 receptor blockers: ondansetron, tropisetron, granisetron and dolasetron. Applied intravenously, all four have been effective both in prophylaxis and also as therapy for postoperative emesis. Except for ondansetron, there is so far no definitely clear knowledge about the lowest possible effective dosage. The entire group is well tolerated: only occasional and minor side effects have been reported. Even though not all the hopes originally set in the 5-HT3 group of antagonists have been fulfilled, progress has nevertheless been achieved.

Secondary objectives included the evaluation of fever days, days of antibiotic therapy, days at ICU and days of overall hospitalisation required for the treatment of the nosocomial pneumonia for both methods of treatment. A prospective randomised open study involving multiple study sites was conducted. Total cost, efficacy and safety of an initial therapy with Imipenem were compared to results achieved with selected other antibiotic regimens. Altogether 109 patients were enrolled into the study; 85 patients could be assessed. Both treatment methods showed equal clinical efficacy. Total cost of the therapy of nosocomial pneumonia for all patients was in the range between 1,616 DM and 82,141 DM, the arithmetic mean was calculated to be 11,307 DM and the median was found to be 6,507 DM. Imipenem-treated patients incurred lower cost (median 5,649 DM, mean 10,009 DM) than patients treated with other antibiotics (median 9,334 DM, mean 12,701 DM). The total cost of treatment of nosocomial pneumonia was lower for Imipenem-treated patients than for patients receiving initially other selected antibiotic regimens. The savings are apparently due to a faster recovery of the patients resulting in reduced duration of therapy.

","2870":"The course in emergency medicine was introduced by the German Federal Government to meet the requirements of the curriculum of the 4th year of medical education in 1992. The Department of Anaesthesiology of the University Hospital Ulm drew up a course consisting of one week of practical instructions (Table 3) for groups of 24 students, case presentation and accompanying lectures that cover the topics of emergency medicine (Table 2). The course is part of continuous education in emergency medicine. It starts with courses in \"first aid\" and \"first medical attendance to emergencies\" followed by the \"course\"in emergency medicine\" and further training weeks on the \"mobile intensive care unit (MICU)\" during the \"internship\" as well as a course on emergency medicine for ambulance doctors and the training on he job by an emergency physician during residency (Table 1). The aim of the course is training competence (psychomotoric skills and clinical competence) for the primary care of life-threatening emergencies. The following educational methods were included in the concept: problem oriented learning, situation-oriented learning, learning by doing (cognitive apprenticeship).","2871":"Since 1993 special lectures in emergency medicine are part of curriculum in the study of medicine at German universities. To intensify practical teaching in this field an integrative concept was followed in performing emergency training, the experiences of which are described in this paper. Seminars dealing with the most important subjects of preclinical care were combined with practical training blocks such as attendance at operations of the preclinical emergency physician service, resuscitation training using computerised resuscitation models (Mega Code), and an anatomical training course for endotracheal intubation, coniotomy, thoracic drainage, or central venous catheterisation on a corpse. If supported by physicians, senior students may supervise groups of 4 to 5 students during the Mega Code training in a tutorial system, thus allowing to intensify practical education. Since the integrative concept is based on cooperation of different medical specialties, the students expect one or two physicians to be chiefly responsible for the entire course. Additional dates during the semester interfere with the students' leisure activities and require individual practical activity. This means giving up a passively receptive attitude. However, as reflected by the results of the exams and questionnaires, response to this step of improvement in Emergency Medical Education has been very positive. Future efforts are directed at including more physicians as practical supervisors, scattering of training dates, an increase in compulsory practical participation such as one-day attendance at an intensive care unit, and intensified exams on practical issues. However, the improvement of the quality of teaching is imperative in the job planning of the medical profession.","2872":"Previous studies using EEG for assessment of depth of anaesthesia correlate anaesthetic concentration with the anaesthetic stage. This procedure neglects the well known effect of individual different susceptibility to anaesthetics. Thus, patients receiving similar concentrations of anaesthetics may not necessarily be at the same level of \"anaesthetic depth\". The aim of this study was to define an interindividual comparable level of anaesthesia by recording the autonomic cardiovascular reaction to a standardised painful stimulus (tetanic stimulus, 80 mA, 100 Hz). In 61 patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery general anaesthesia was performed with isoflurane in 66% N2O. Starting from 0.4% isoflurane, endtidal isoflurane concentration was increased in a stepwise manner (0.1% isoflurane) until the patient did not show any relevant cardiovascular reaction (increase of heart rate and\/or blood pressure &lt; 10%) after tetanic stimulation of the ulnar nerve. If patients demonstrated no haemodynamic changes at 0.4% isoflurane, the concentration was decreased until a relevant cardiovascular reaction was registered. During each steady state period multichannel EEG was recorded and mean values of power density (median: microV2\/Hz) were computed. Comparing EEG-results between both groups exhibiting a cardiovascular reaction (CVR+ , median endtidal Iso: 0.5%) and without reaction (CVR- , median endtidal Iso: 0.6%) an increase in low frequency bands and a significant decrease in high frequencies was found (Wilcoxon-test, p &lt; 0.05). In contrast, comparing EEG-data only in relation to endtidal isoflurane concentration neglecting individual haemodynamic responses, no differences of power density in high frequency bands were detected. This method to define individual depth of anaesthesia as described, results in more consistent EEG patterns and may be useful in relating EEG to depth of anaesthesia. ","2873":"The perioperative risk in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) might be influenced by premedication procedures. This study was undertaken to evaluate present premedication regimens in CABG patients in Germany. Using a detailed written questionnaire, each of the 58 German centres of cardioanaesthesia were asked to complete it. 37 (64%) of all questionnaires were returned and analysed. All centres used orally administered drugs for premedication in the evening before the operation. Flunitrazepam is the most often administered drug (54%), followed by dipotassium clorazepat (8%), and diazepam (8%). Premedication in the morning on the day of surgery is performed orally in 29 centres (78%), of which 18 centres (49%) prefer flunitrazepam and 6 centres (16%) midazolam as first choice. In contrast, 7 centres (19%) used intramuscularly administered regimens. 5 centres (14%) combined intramuscularly opioids with sedatives for that indication. If anaesthesia was induced late in the morning or in the afternoon, respectively, 11 centres (30%) administered additional benzodiazepines early in the morning. 68% of all centres maintained the administration of chronic treatment with ss-blockers until the morning of the operating day. Chronic treatment with nitrates is continued in 65%, treatment with calcium-channel blockers in 62%. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are continued in 30%, alpha 2-agonists in 27%, other antihypertensive drugs in 19%, and inotropic glycosids in 11%. 31 of 37 centres (84%) discontinued the administration of acetylsalicylic acid 5 or more days prior to surgery, but 68% tolerate individual exceptions from this principle. The results of our survey indicate that most of the German cardioanaesthesia centres use oral premedication regimens in patients undergoing coronary revascularisation. Anti-anginal medications, with the exception of anti-platelet agents, were continued until the day of surgery in most of the centres. ","2874":"The aim of this study was to investigate: 1. Whether the perioperative administration of metamizol causes a significant reduction in postoperative opioid requirements within the first 24 h after surgery. 2. The opioid-sparing effect after different types of operations. 3. Whether preoperative application of metamizol causes a significant reduction of the pain-score immediately after operation. In a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study, 117 patients, scheduled for minor orthopaedic or laparoscopic surgery or other operations (mainly resection of the thyroid gland and inguinal herniotomies) received either metamizol (1 g\/100 ml NaCl 0.9%) or placebo (100 ml NaCl 0.9%) intravenously over 15 min in three separate doses: the first dose was given just before induction and the others 6 h and 12 h later. After surgery all patients were allowed to self-administer buprenorphine from a PCA (patient-controlled analgesia) pump (Bolus: 30 microgram, lockout: 5 min in the recovery room, 30 min on the ward). Every hour for the first 6 h and after 24 h, cumulated doses of buprenorphine, pain scores (0-10), blood pressure, pulse and side effects were recorded. After minor orthopaedic and laparoscopic surgery, metamizol-treated patients had significantly less pain immediately after surgery and used a significantly lower cumulated dose of opioid in the first 24 h after surgery (-20% and -67% respectively) than patients receiving placebo. After the other types of surgery no analgesic effect could be established. Perioperative administration of metamizol results in better pain relief and significantly lower buprenorphine requirements particularly after laparoscopic operations. To achieve a significant pain reduction immediately after the operation, the first dose should be applied before induction. ","2875":"A global hypoxia resulting in an oxygen debt is assumed to be present in patients who suffer from the different stages and degrees of sepsis including septic shock and ARDS. As a consequence, the therapeutic concept of optimal values for cardiac output and oxygen delivery for these patients was proposed. This article reviews the literature with the objective of determining whether investigations dealing with oxygen delivery and consumption and with the plasma lactate concentration support the idea of the global hypoxia in septic patients. The finding of a pathologic oxygen supply dependency and an increase in plasma lactate concentration were taken as evidence for a global hypoxia. Between 1983 and 1991, oxygen supply dependency in septic patients was reported in an increasing number of publications. The increase in plasma lactate concentration was interpreted as lactic acidosis without presentation of plasma pH values and taken as evidence of global hypoxia and oxygen debt. From 1989 on, the number of publications that failed to show oxygen supply dependency even in the presence of an increased plasma lactate concentration increased. The problem in the method of determination of oxygen supply dependency became evident. Deducing both oxygen consumption and oxygen delivery from cardiac output from a common shared variable subject to measurement error may produce errors in the calculation of the regression between oxygen delivery and consumption. Oxygen supply dependency was not demonstrated in most investigations in which oxygen delivery and consumption were measured independently of each other. No decrease in mortality could be shown in prospective randomized studies for patients with sepsis and septic shock who were treated according to the concept of the optimal values. The lactate plasma concentration was below 5 mmol\/l in most studies, which represents the borderline value for a clinically significant lactic acidosis. The term acidosis is not justified without a decrease in plasma pH or a decrease in the bicarbonate plasma concentration. An increased lactate plasma concentration can be merely the result of a hypermetabolism which is often found in septic patients. There is no proven evidence for global tissue hypoxia in septic patients from the investigations of oxygen delivery and consumption. This is also true for patients in septic shock after plasma volume expansion. The dogmatic proposal to increase cardiac output and oxygen delivery to certain levels cannot be sustained. However, regional hypoperfusion (e.g., of the splanchnic vascular bed) cannot be excluded. New approaches like gastric mucosal tonometry, measurement of splanchnic blood flow, and determination of regional metabolism are currently under investigation.","2876":"Ischaemic stroke is predominantly caused by cerebral emboli which may originate from cardiac sources or atherosclerotic lesions of the cerebral arteries. The diagnosis is primarily based on clinical symptoms and may be confirmed by typical patterns in cranial computed tomography. Echocardiography, ultrasonography of the supraaortic vessels, and angiography are additional diagnostic tools and helpful in clarifying the pathogenesis. Circulating cerebral emboli can be detected using transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD). Emboli are characterised by short-term, high-intensity ultrasonic signals with characteristic audible \"chirps\". Because of their acoustic impedance, gaseous emboli reflect the ultrasonic beam with a higher intensity than do formed particles. The differentiation between true embolic signals and artifacts (probe dislocation, electrocautery) requires an experienced observer. With recent developments in automatic detection systems, monitoring will become more feasible for clinical applications. During cardiovascular surgery, TCD signals implying cerebral emboli have been registered in various studies. The incidence of embolic signals during cardiopulmonary bypass varies with stage (before, after aortic declamping) and type of surgery (coronary, valve replacement) and the perfusion regime (bubble, membrane oxygenator). For carotid surgery, embolic signals are most likely to occur with carotid clamping, during shunt insertion, and after declamping. There are some studies suggesting a relation between intraoperative embolic signal count and post-operative neurologic state, but the prognostic significance of these signals is still under debate. Strictly controlled prospective studies including a large number of patients have to be conducted to answer the question whether embolic signal count indicates an increased stroke risk. The high number of patients after valve replacement showing up to 30 embolic signals per minute without suffering from neurologic symptoms raises the question whether continuous, predominantly gaseous microembolisation may cause cumulative brain damage. At present, the nature of emboli (gaseous vs. solid) cannot be easily identified by TCD in clinical settings. Future technical improvement of ultrasonic devices may solve this problem, since detection of solid rather than gaseous emboli seems more likely to be clinically relevant.","2877":"","2878":"","2879":"","2880":"In many anaesthesia departments, the autologous transfusions concept is an integral part of the perioperative measures catalogue.

By employing contemporary quality management practices, including computer technology, the quality of the execution and management of the components as well as the quality of the patient care can be evaluated according to the quality of the structure, process and results. By this assessment the efficiency of the procedure can be confirmed and the advantages of using this technique, when utilised by an anaesthesiologist experienced in transfusion, can be underlined. An overview of the pre-existing and expected perioperative risk is of special advantage to the anaesthesiologist to make a realistic and effective decision regarding the possibility of safely processing the autologous blood donation concept.","2881":"We investigated hypovolaemia induced by bloodletting, accompanied by statistically significant, but clinically irrelevant increase of heart rate together with unchanged blood pressure, with regard to hepatic glucose production as well as alanine and glycerol turnover rates. Healthy male volunteers (n = 18) were bled 15 ml\/kg body weight over 20 min and remained hypovolaemic for 60 minutes. Heart rate was recorded by ECG and blood pressure by an oscillometric device. Before and after bloodletting hepatic glucose production as well as alanine and glycerol turnover rates were determined using the stable isotopes 6.6-D2-glucose, 15N-alanine and D5-glycerol as tracers. Simultaneously, the blood concentrations of adrenaline, noradrenaline, free fatty acids and glycerol were measured. Bleeding did not change the mean arterial blood pressure, but increased the heart rate significantly from 61 +\/- 9 to 70 +\/- 13 1\/ min. Noradrenaline levels increased significantly from 1.16 +\/- 0.41 to 2.15 +\/- 0.69 nmol\/l.

The blood levels of adrenaline, free fatty acids and glycerol did not change during the study. In respect of clinical signs, the cardiovascular status of the volunteers was stable after bleeding. In contrast, the decrease of HGP as well as the drop in alanine and glycerol turnover rates might be interpreted as a sign of an altered functional status of single organs, induced by changes of regional perfusion.

Shed blood was processed by a cell-saving device. AWECs specimens were analysed for red blood count, electrolytes, LDH, extracellular haemoglobin, osmotic fragility, blood culture and bacterial concentration. In addition, data of urine cultures, adenoma cultures and adenoma histology were analysed. AWEcs were not retransfused.

Bacteria found in the urine cultures of patients with urinary tract infections could also be isolated in their AWECs. 16% of the patients had prostatic cancer not know preoperatively. Mass of resected adenoma and volume of AWEC did not correlate. In despite of good haematological quality we considered the rate of 82% bacterial and 16% tumour cell contamination of the AWECs unacceptable and, contrary to some literature data, we no longer use a cell-saving device in TURP.

Instead of being static entities, beta-AR undergo dynamic regulation upon repeated or prolonged exposure to agonists (down-regulation) or antagonists (up-regulation). After exposure to agonists, an early desensitisation caused by phosphorylation of amino acid residues can be distinguished from receptor sequestration. Finally, the internalised receptor is digested by proteolytic enzymes.

Corning's use of the term \"spinal anesthesia\" in his publications probably caused the error that he was the first to describe and apply this new widespread technique.

Problems associated with anaesthesia in this patient were difficult intubation and venipuncture and a potential risk of developing malignant hyperthermia when using volatile anaesthetics. For preoperative blood chemistry sampling and intravenous induction of general anaesthesia, the patient received a central venous catheter under local and N2O\/O2 anaesthesia on the day before surgery. Following intravenous induction of trigger-free anaesthesia using fentanyl, thiopental and vecuronium, the child was intubated and ventilated with 30% O2 in N2O the next day. A caudal catheter was inserted for intraoperative reduction of anaesthetics and postoperative pain relief. Intraoperatively, caudal anaesthesia was performed with 2 ml of 2% mepivacaine every 90 min. No inadvertent reactions were seen during a 7 h operation. In the recovery room, the patient received 4 ml of plain 0.25% bupivacaine per 4 h via the caudal catheter and had excellent analgesia during 24 postoperative hours.

Magnesium plasma concentrations were determined before the magnesium tolerance test according to Ryzen was performed. For this purpose, magnesium sulfate (0.1 mmol\/kg) was infused intravenously over four hours. Renal magnesium excretion was measured in the 24 h urine beginning at the start of the infusion. Magnesium concentrations in plasma and urine were determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. In 12 patients magnesium plasma concentrations were decreased to 0.58-0.79 mmol\/l. 6 patients showed values within the normal range of 0.80 to 1.0 mmol\/l.

","2898":"Monitoring of jugular-venous O2-saturation (SjO2) enables the assessment of cerebral oxygen supply and the rapid detection of cerebral desaturation in patients with severe head injury. Furthermore, it may help to optimize circulation, ventilation, and intracranial hypertension therapy in these patients. This study was performed to evaluate the reliability of SjO2-monitoring as well as to measure cerebral O2-extraction and the frequency of episodes of cerebral desaturation after traumatic brain injury. In 16 patients with severe head injury (GCS 3-8), SjO2 (fibreoptic system), arterial blood pressure, and intracranial pressure were continuously recorded after admission of the patients to the intensive care unit. Fluctuations of SjO2 (&gt; 10% within 30 min), which were not included by therapeutic measures, were classified by off-line analysis as irregular-isolated or irregular-combined, if accompanied by similar fluctuations of ICP and arterial blood pressure. Recordings which were unreliable due to technical reasons, mainly because of wall adherence of the tip of the fibreoptic catheter, were evaluated separately. Episodes of cerebral desaturations (SjO2 &lt; 50%) were assessed with regard to their frequency, duration (5-10\/&gt; 10 min) and underlying mechanisms. Cerebral O2-extraction was calculated as the difference between arterial and cerebrovenous O2-saturation and averaged for each day after trauma. Mean time of measurement for each patient was 194 hrs, a total of 3106 hrs were recorded. The correlation coefficient between in-vivo and in-vitro measured SjO2 was r = 0.62 (n = 367, p &lt; 0.001). Reliable and artifact-free measurements of SjO2 were obtained only during 58.3% of all hours. Irregular-isolated fluctuations of the SjO2 occurred in 22.2% of the hours, and technical problems in 14.5%. Erroneous readings due to irregular-combined fluctuations of the jugular-venous O2-saturation were detected in 5.0% of the time periods. A total number of 66 episodes of cerebral desaturation (SjO2 &lt; 50%) were found in all 16 patients, 41 of them had a duration of more than 10 minutes. Cerebral hypoxia was attributed to low cerebral perfusion pressure in 35% and hypocapnia in 17%. Global cerebral O2-extraction was significantly elevated at the day of injury compared to days 1-5 after trauma (37.4% vs. 28.9%-31.9%, p &lt; 0.05). Monitoring of SjO2 in severe head injury provides an estimate of cerebral oxygen supply and may improve the assessment of therapeutic measures in these patients. The high incidence of erroneous readings of the SjO2 is a major drawback of this method. Initially after trauma, a high extraction of oxygen was found, followed by a marked decrease in the subsequent days, presumably reflecting an early, decreased cerebral blood flow and a hyperaemic flow pattern thereafter. Continuous measurements of SjO2 may contribute to advanced, organ-specific cerebral monitoring in severe craniocerebral trauma. The reliability of data, however, should be considerably improved for common clinical use. ","2899":"A method for sedation of preschool children in emergency medicine is presented.

The children were breathing spontaneously at a PEEP of 5 cm H2O on a circle system with a fresh gas flow of 61\/min (FIO2 = 0.33). Intubation was performed in deep anaesthesia without muscle relaxant. Halothane concentration was reduced to an endtidal concentration of 0.4 Vol%. With a baby pneumotachograph, minute ventilation, tidal volume, peak inspiratory and expiratory flow and respiratory rate were recorded during quiet breathing. Endtidal pCO2 was measured. Ventilation was then stimulated with 0.2 and 0.41\/min CO2 and the same parameters were recorded. Regression analysis was performed for minute ventilation and endtidal pCO2 to obtain the slope which is a parameter for the sensitivity of the chemoreceptor mediated control of ventilation. The tidal volume and peak inspiratory flow were significantly reduced for a dose of 0.6 mg\/kg compared to the control group. No statistical difference could be found for any other parameter between the control and study groups. We conclude that nasally administered midazolam reduces tidal volume and inspiratory peak flow in spontaneously breathing children at a dose of 0.6 mg\/kg b.w. compared to control during halothane--nitrous oxide--oxygen anaesthesia. The CO2 mediated control of respiration under this condition is preserved.

In the present study the pharmacodynamics and the cardiovascular effects of a bolus dose of mivacurium (0.15 mg\/kg) in relation to impairment of renal function were evaluated. 60 patients (ASA class 2-4) were assigned to one of three groups according to the degree of renal dysfunction. Creatinine clearance (Krea-Cl) as a measure of renal function was calculated using weight, age, sex and serum creatinine concentrations. Group C (control): Krea-Cl &gt; 50 ml\/min; group P (preterminal): 20 ml\/min &lt; Krea-Cl &lt; 50 ml\/min; group T (terminal): Krea-Cl &lt; 20 ml\/min. PChE activity and dibucaine numbers were assessed preoperatively. Neuromuscular transmission (Train-of-Four) was monitored using electromyography (Relaxograph, Datex Inc.) with stimulation of the ulnar nerve. The response was recorded from the hypothenar muscle. Five minutes after induction of anaesthesia with propofol and fentanyl, 0.15 mg\/kg mivacurium was given i.v. over 30 s. 150 s later patients were intubated. Anaesthesia was maintained by propofol (2-10 mg\/kg\/h) and fentanyl (0-5 micrograms\/kg\/h) infusion. Patients were ventilated with oxygen\/nitrous oxide (FiO2 = 0.35). As soon as T1 recovered to 5% or more, mivacurium was administered continuously and this part of the study was finished. Times of onset (onset 10; onsetmax), maximal neuromuscular block (NMBmax), neuromuscular block when intubation was started (NMBTubus), and duration 5% (dur 5) were calculated. Arterial blood pressure and heart rate were recorded before anaesthesia, after induction of anaesthesia, 2-times after mivacurium application, and after intubation. All data were compared using Kruskal-Wallis test corrected for multiple comparisons, Friedman test, or chi 2-test (*: p &lt; 0.05). Logarithms of dur 5 and PChEd were correlated using linear regression. Demographic data were comparable between all groups. PChEd was 3.7 (3.0\/4.1) kU\/l in group C, 3.2 (2.2\/4.8) kU\/l in group P, and 3.5 (2.5\/4.0) kU\/l in group T, respectively. There were no differences between groups, neither in the NMBmax, in NMBTubus, or in onset times. But dur 5 was significantly longer in patients with renal impairment, both preterminal and also end-stage (medians: 11 min in group K, 16 min in group P, 17 min in group T). Emphasis, however, is put on the broad range between 5 and 47 min of dur 5 in group P, and between 6 and 53 min in patients of group T which is clinically more important than the differences in the median values. Dur 5 correlates with PChEd (p = 0.0001). Intubation conditions were excellent (relaxed vocal cords, easy passage of the tube, without coughing) in approximately 70% of all 59 patients without significant differences between groups. In 8 patients conditions were poor (successful intubation, inspite of moderately adducted vocal cords, but moderate coughing after passage of the endotracheal tube). There were no clinically relevant hemodynamic changes in each group in the time between injection of 0.15 mg\/kg mivacurium slowly and intubation 2.5 min later. Our findings suggest that 0.15 mg\/kg mivacurium is an effective and safe intubation dose in healthy patients as well as in patients with renal impairment, inspite of a prolonged duration in patients with renal impairment. Low PChE in some, but not in all patients with a renal dysfunction indicates involvement of impaired hepatic function. There was a close correlation between the PChEd and dur 5.

The ensuing DUR 25% (i.e. time from injection to 25% recovery of control twitch tension) is three times as long as with succinylcholine and about half as long as with equipotent doses of atracurium and vecuronium. The principal side effects of mivacurium are facial flushing and a transient fall in blood pressure due to a moderate histamine release following doses of 3-4 times the ED95. In patients with end stage liver or renal disease as well as in patients with atypical plasma cholinesterase the duration of action of mivacurium is prolonged. Rocuronium is a steroidal non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking agent chemically related to vecuronium. Compared with the latter, rocuronium is less potent, has a shorter onset of action, and no cumulative effects. Adequate intubating conditions are achieved within 60 to 90 s after i.v. injection of twice the ED95. Its elimination from the blood occurs primarily via liver uptake, while renal elimination is about 10 to 30%. Slight vagolytic effects are reported following injection of 0.6 mg\/kg rocuronium, while histamine release is unlikely to occur. Atracurium is a mixture of ten stereoisomers. One of them, cis-atracurium, is five times as potent as the chiral mixture while having a similar pharmacodynamic and kinetic profile. It does not cause significant histamine release or clinically relevant cardiovascular effects at doses up to 8 times the ED95.

Objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of complications of this modification in comparison with published data. 151 dilatational tracheotomies were performed on 141 patients of an anaesthesiologic intensive care unit. Ciaglia originally presented an approach between the cricoid cartilage and the first tracheal cartilage. We found it preferable to insert the cannula between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage after blunt dissection of the pretracheal tissues. The Dilators of Cook Critical Care Ltd. were used in this study. With 151 tracheotomies only 11 complications were noted: pneumothorax (1), bleeding (2), mucosal lesion of the trachea (2), others (6). None of these complications was considered to be serious. There was no tracheotomy-related death. Tracheotomy was performed within 11.5 min (range 5 to 23 min). The duration of artificial ventilation following tracheotomy was 21.1 days (range 1 to 142 days). The presented modification of dilatational tracheotomy is a safe and effective technique which can be performed on the intensive care unit. Compared with conventional tracheotomy the new method is quickly done and will be an integral part of intensive care treatment.

With this operation, the latissimus dorsi muscle is mobilised and drawn into the thorax where it is placed around the heart. Lateral and supine positioning as well as thoracotomy and direct manipulation of the heart are associated with particular risks during surgery. Eight patients with the diagnosis of cardiomyopathy underwent cardiomyoplasty. The patients were classified as NYHA III-IV. Continuous dobutamine infusions were routinely started after induction of anaesthesia. All patients were intubated with single-lumen tubes. After sternotomy, lidocaine was administered. Monitoring included Swan-Ganz catheterisation and invasive blood pressure measurement. With early use of inotropic and vasodilatator agents the cardiac index and peripheral vascular resistance were adequately maintained. Double-lumen intubation seems to be unnecessary during cardiomyoplasty and only increases patient risk. Prophylactic lidocaine infusions are effective in preventing ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. We conclude that adequate intraoperative management can improve the haemodynamic status of these patients so that cardiomyoplasty may be performed without significant morbidity.","2914":"Isoflurane is a suitable agent to produce sedation in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, data concerning occupational exposure to isoflurane during long-term sedation are not yet available. The purpose of this study was to evaluate occupational exposure to isoflurane in the ICU. Trace concentrations of isoflurane were measured directly by means of photoacustic infrared spectrometry during isoflurane sedation in ten cases over a period of 24 hours. Values were obtained at four personnel-related and two leakage-related locations in an ICU chamber. All measured values were low, the majority under 3 ppm isoflurane at the personnel-related points. Peak concentrations up to 40 ppm were recorded for several minutes during nursing interventions. At measurement point \"nearby patient's mouth\" values up to 5 ppm were recorded, at location \"anaesthesia machine\" values ranged from 2 to 69 ppm isoflurane. We conclude that an effective high flow scavenging system, a low-leakage anaesthesia machine and an airconditioning equipment without recirculation could keep occupational exposure low. The majority of the measured values was below the NIOSH recommendation (2 ppm). All values was lower than a national state recommendation (10 ppm). Under other circumstances (e.g. without scavenging system) air pollution will be higher and therefore measurements at the working place are needed.

However, only a minority of anaesthesiologists really practise this new technique. The scientific basis of continuous intravenous anaesthesia has not been spread widely in the anaesthetic community yet. The following review therefore focusses on recent findings and developments in the field of pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and modern application systems of intravenous anaesthetic drugs. The new opioid remifentanil is described, new aspects in the interpretation of pharmacokinetic data are presented and the concept of context-sensitive halftimes as a parameter to estimate the decrease in clinical effect of intravenous anaesthetics is introduced. Drug effect in clinical anaesthesia is a result of equilibration of the drug with the effect site (Biophase). By means of defining the effect site equilibration time (t1\/2ke0 and the drugs concentration at which this effect is achieved (Cp50) the pharmacodynamic properties of each intravenous anaesthetic can be characterised. Computerised pharmacokinetic data can be used to generate stable drug concentrations (target plasma concentration) when connected to an infusion pump. These target controlled systems are able to reach a predefined level rapidly and to maintain it. Thus pharmacodynamic interactions of intravenous drugs can be evaluated. The newly found properties of propofol, such as antiemetic, anticonvulsive and antioxidant, and its present clinical use are described. Finally, modern continuous intravenous anaesthetica techniques have been feasible only by the development of efficient application systems.

This new branch of medicine was first completely described in Germany by Otto Kappeler from Switzerland, who was asked to do so by his famous colleague Theodor Billroth from Vienna. Starting with remarks concerning the history of anaesthesiology, he described on more than 220 pages everything that was known about the anaesthetics used at that time. Additionally, he outlined the prospects of the then also brand new methods of local anaesthesia. Undoubtedly it was of Kappeler's special concern to avoid the risk of iatrogenic complications while the patient was under any anaesthetic. This can easily be proved by the fact that he put special emphasis on precautions concerning life-threatening situations and their therapy. To avoid the dangers of an acute airway obstruction by the patient's tongue, he modified the so-called \"Esmarch-Heidberg\" manoeuvre, which later on became known as the \"Kappeler\" flick. For the first time ever, Kappeler managed to describe sphygmographically the circulatory effects of narcotics in an anaesthesia-related textbook. Basically, he could not find any differences between them, since \" ... all higher dosages of anaesthetics used during operations caused ... a strong widening of the blood vessels ... by paralysing the vasoconstrictors\". He believed it would be possible to exclude the dangers of overdosing drugs by introducing devices to perform anaesthesia. In using his self-designed device, which was a modification of the device used at that time, invented by Junker, he was able to come closer to the goal of \"in somno securitas\" he so vehemently fought for. This confidence he derived from the fact that he was already a strong believer in the advantage of the \"self-conducted chloroformation or anaesthesia\".","2929":"In the last three years an interdisciplinary ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) team has been set up at the Free University of Berlin in the Steglitz clinic. With this form of management, newborns only a few hours or days old who present with pulmonary failure can temporarily be managed with extracorporeal oxygenation until normal lung function is restored. The set up of this ECMO team, starting with experimental training in animal models, to the bedside clinical use is discussed. The following presentation of the first four cases managed here with ECMO aims to clarify the problems which may be encountered as well as amplifying its use as a life-saving measure.","2930":"Thrombomodulin is a high-affinity receptor for thrombin on the endothelial cell surface. The aim of our study was to investigate whether plasma thrombomodulin represents a marker of endothelial injury following cardiopulmonary bypass. Plasma levels of thrombomodulin were quantitated in 70 plasma samples obtained from 14 adult cardiac patients undergoing hypothermic pulsatile low-flow low-pressure cardiopulmonary bypass. Blood samples were taken before cardiopulmonary bypass (T1), and 15 minutes (T2), 1 hour, 6 hours, and 20 hours after termination of bypass. Plasma thrombomodulin was quantitated with a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Statistical analysis was performed by the Friedman and Wilcoxon tests. Plasma thrombomodulin was significantly elevated 20 hours after discontinuation of cardiopulmonary bypass, when compared with T1 and T2. We conclude from our results that a moderate elevation of plasma thrombomodulin is seen in adult patients following hypothermic, low-flow low-pressure cardiopulmonary bypass, which may reflect endothelial injury. Circulating thrombomodulin levels are thus possibly useful for assessment of endothelial damage occurring in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. ","2931":"In this study investigations were carried out on pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine after it had been applied subcutaneously. Up to now no pharmacokinetic data exist using this kind of application with relevant clinical doses. With 6 patients, who had major general surgery under balanced anaesthesia, buprenorphine was given in a single subcutaneous injection of 5 micrograms\/kg bodyweight for postoperative pain relief. Over a period of 48 hours the level of buprenorphine in blood plasma was measured. The analyses were done with a modified HPLC method with electrochemical detection which is able to achieve measurements as low as 40 pg\/ml of plasma. The pharmacokinetic values were calculated with the \"Topfit\" pharmacokinetic computerised programme. Whereas the period of time (tmax) to reach peak plasma concentration (Cmax) after subcutaneous application is much longer than with other parenteral application forms, the plasma concentration levels tend to be similar after 20 minutes. The most important finding of this study is that the mean terminal half-life (t1\/2c) of buprenorphine is 23 hours. However, the presently available data for other application forms in respect to terminal half-life did not produce the same results. This can be explained by the use of insufficiently sensitive analytical procedures and by too short periods of observation of 3 and 13 hours respectively, leading to values of t1\/2c of 2 and 5 hours. These results indicate that the terminal half-life (t1\/2c) of buprenorphine is much longer than had been supposed. It confirms clinical findings of sufficient pain relief by showing measurable uptake of buprenorphine after subcutaneous application. ","2932":"Long-term mechanical ventilation implies a significant number of weaning failures. The basis of this unweanability is chronic fatigue of the inspiratory muscles which is due to depletion of energy store (e.g. glycogen). Considering this pathophysiological principle, the decisive therapeutic option during weaning from long-term mechanical ventilation consists of resting the respiratory muscles. The commonly used assisted ventilation modes only partially relieve the respiratory muscles because the work of breathing is done both during the trigger phase and during the inspiratory cycle. The essential characteristic of our weaning concept includes the repeated determination of the spontaneous breathing frequency in awake patients, which is followed by controlled intermittent positive pressure ventilation with a slightly higher respiratory rate. Ideally, this results in total suppression of the activity of the breathing centre, and in subsequent relief and recovery of the respiratory muscles by replenishing the energy stores. The close succession of relief and training periods avoids inactivity-induced atrophy of the respiratory muscles and permits regeneration. Additionally, our weaning concept avoids increases in inspiratory work during the phases of spontaneous breathing. This means that high-resistance small-caliber endotracheal tubes have to be replaced by large tubes. Moreover, transtracheal oxygen insufflation during spontaneous breathing decreases anatomic dead space. This reduces minute ventilation and, therefore, the work of breathing. In patients still exhibiting chronic fatigue of the respiratory muscle pump after successful weaning, intermittent home ventilation is initiated via a breathing mask. Apart from the concept described above, successful weaning from the respirator after long-term ventilation is based upon dedicated patient care and depends on the architectural characteristics of the intensive care unit.","2933":"Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) as a natural component of the mammalian brain was first introduced in clinical anaesthetic practice more than 30 years ago. Although GHB induced a reliable state of sedation and anaesthesia without depressing either respiratory or cardiocirculatory parameters or liver and kidney function, the drug was nearly displaced from clinical practice because of its prolonged duration of action. The results of recent clinical studies indicate a re-evaluation of GHB in emergency and critical care medicine. GHB is regarded as a natural neuronal transmitter with circuits which synthesise, accumulate and release GHB. Specific binding sites have also been demonstrated and identified. GHB is completely metabolized in the liver to the natural substrates carbon dioxide and water without accumulation in central or peripheral tissues. The reduction of energy metabolism and its possible properties as an \"oxygen radical scavenger\" may be of therapeutic benefit if tissues are exposed to hypoxia or reperfusion. Therefore, the application of GHB seems to be of advantage in states of traumatic brain injury with cerebral oedema or ischaemic lesions of brain or extraneural tissues. In hypovolaemic states or in patients with impaired cardiovascular function, the pressure effects of GHB may be beneficial for the prevention of tissue damage and may improve survival in the case of cardiocirculatory resuscitation. In the intensive care unit, GHB might be a favourable alternative to established sedative agents. Occurrence of side effects such as tolerance and withdrawal syndromes after the application of sedative drugs, an impaired metabolism with the accumulation of metabolites in the case of liver or kidney dysfunction as well as an insufficient regulation of natural sleep may be diminished by the application of GHB. The results of various clinical studies also suggest that GHB may be useful in the treatment of alcohol and opiate withdrawal syndrome. However, further studies are necessary to specify the proposed indications of GHB in anaesthesiology and critical care medicine.","2934":"","2935":"","2936":"","2937":"","2938":"","2939":"","2940":"","2941":"","2942":"","2943":"","2944":"","2945":"","2946":"","2947":"","2948":"","2949":"","2950":"","2951":"","2952":"","2953":"","2954":"","2955":"","2956":"","2957":"The authors describe intravenous anaesthesia with diethyl ether that has been in use for over 70 years as the only clinically useful form of anaesthesia with intravenously applied volatile anaesthetics. Intravenous ether anaesthesia, which had been introduced in 1909 by Burkhardt, was rarely but regularly used in Europe and the United States between 1910 and 1930. In the course of development of new intravenous anaesthetics such as hexobarbital and thiopental, which were easier to handle, intravenous ether narcosis was used only sporadically after 1930. The method, however, has certain \"pros\", such as: rapid and excitation-free introduction, good manageability, only mild postnarcotic disturbances and volume substitution by the carrier solution. The \"cons\" are a quite considerable incidence of venous irritations and thromboses, complicated and costly equipment and preparation of the solution as well as cardiovascular stress in case of cardiac insufficiency patients. Simulation confirmed the statements from literature in respect of the characteristic features concerning induction and manageability.","2958":"First of all, the meanings of the terms anaesthesia, anaesthetic and receptor are defined. Examples of anaesthetic actions in model systems are then described and compared with clinical actions of anaesthetics. When anaesthetics achieve a certain membrane concentration, they begin to influence membrane protein function in a nonspecific manner. If the anaesthetic drug possesses polar functional groups in addition to lipophilic ones, it may selectively affect membrane proteins and interact with them specifically. The absolute lipophilicity of a drug does not necessarily determine whether or not a drug is a suitable anaesthetic. Rather, it is important that the drug does not show undesirable side effects when it achieves a critical membrane concentration at which lipophilic interactions occur. There are examples of specific interactions of general anaesthetics with receptors as well as examples of nonspecific effects on membranes. Whether these interactions are important for anaesthesia remains to be seen.","2959":"The study investigates the influence of enflurane (EN) on macroscopic currents of the nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptor channel (nAChR). This ion channel is a representative member of the superfamily of ligand-gated receptor channels and is better characterized than all the other receptors in respect of structure and function. For the experiments the patch-clamp technique was used to study the embryonic type of the nAChR expressed by cultured mouse-myotubes. Patch-clamp recordings were performed in the outside-out-mode from these preparations. To match the rapid desensitization kinetics of ligand-activated ion channels, a liquid filament switch technique was used for the application of agonists to the excised patches. This technique allows for change of solution within 300 microseconds. We used a saturating concentration of 10(-4) M acetylcholine (ACh), activating almost all available ion channels on a patch. Pulses of 10(-4) M ACh together with EN in different concentrations were applied repetitively. The current elicited by 10(-4) M ACh is reduced reversibly in a concentration-dependent manner by EN in clinically relevant concentrations: 1,44 x 10(-5) M EN inhibit about 10%, 1.44 x 10(-4) M 25%, 1.44 x 10(-3) M 35%, and 1.44 x 10(-2) M 75% of the ion flux (averaged results from 48 patches). EN decreases the time constant of the current decay. This acceleration of desensitisation kinetics is partly reversible if followed by application of 10(-4) M ACh. In this study we were able to show that EN reduces the currents of the ligand-gated embryonic-like nAChR in clinically relevant concentrations. Volatile anaesthetics are known to influence GABAA-, glutamate-, and glycine- activated receptors, which are members of the same family of ligand-gated receptor-channel units. Thus, the action of volatile anaesthetics on ligand-gated receptors may play a role in the mechanism of general anaesthesia. The interaction of volatile anaesthetics with nondepolarising neuromuscular blockers may also be based on this effect at the neuromuscular junction. ","2960":"Eight patients (ASA status I) who had to undergo minor surgery of the knee received spinal anaesthesia by 80 mg hyperbaric mepivacaine. Clinical parameters of the block were compared with somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) after tibial nerve stimulation. Depending on the degree of nervous block, the early components P40, N50 and P60 of the cortical tibial SEP underwent characteristic changes. After the injection of the local anesthetic, the latencies of the early components rapidly increased. The tibial SEP completely disappeared after 15 min (median). At this time pin prick testing revealed a complete somatosensory block in the corresponding dermatomes. With one exception, motor block was also complete. After 115 min (median) the early components could be recorded again, with latencies significantly increased. The maximum latency shifts were 22.2% (P40), 19.6% (N50), and 11.8% (P60). When the latencies recovered to less than 10% of the starting value, anaesthesia became clinically insufficient. The recovery of the afferent pathway was complete within 5 hours. Because of the good correspondence with the clinical blockade, the latency shift of P40, N50 and P60 is useful in objectively evaluating a spinal anesthesia with mepivacaine. The use of the method is limited by increased equipment and staffing requirements; however, it facilitates the development of optimised dosing strategies.","2961":"The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the premedication and the influence of the two barbiturates methohexital and thiopental on magnetically evoked compound muscle action potentials (magnet MEP) in humans. 40 Patients (ASA-PS I-II) undergoing lumbar nucleotomy were included in this study after obtaining written informed consent. The study was approved by the local ethical committee. All patients were premedicated with 0.5 mg atropine, 25 mg promethazine and 50 mg pethidine. For induction of anaesthesia patients randomly received methohexital or thiopental by continuous infusion with increasing infusion rates every 15 seconds up to a minimal anaesthesia level in 15 minutes. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was delivered by the magstim 200 magnetic stimulator. Magnetic MEPs were recorded from the surface of the short abductor pollices muscle. MEP-examination was performed preoperatively, after premedication and every two minutes during the induction of anaesthesia. Every other two minutes the patients level of consciousness were assessed and documented. Statistical calculations were performed with the U-test. No statistical differences were found for the mean induction time in the two groups. No statistical difference in amplitude and latency could be observed between the preoperative values and the values measured after premedication. During anaesthesia induction the amplitude decreased in both groups. In 25 of the 40 cases, the MEP disappeared completely before the patients fell asleep. The thiopental group showed a significantly lower incidence of MEP preservation (20%) compared to methohexital (50%). Premedication with atropine, promethazine and pethidine has no influence on magnetic MEP. Methohexital allows the highest incidence of successful MEP recordings with sufficient anaesthesia. A success rate of only 50% even in cases without motorpathway affection makes the application of magnetic MEP an unreliable tool for intraoperative monitoring. ","2962":"Treatment with alpha 2-agonists has been demonstrated to improve intra- and postoperative haemodynamic stability. After administration of alpha 2-agonists anaesthetic requirements have been shown to be reduced up to 90% for volatile anaesthetics as well as for intravenous anaesthetics like barbiturates. This study was designed to determine the effect of the alpha 2-agonist clonidine on the anaesthetic potency of the intravenous anaesthetic thiopental in absence of pharmacokinetic influences. With approval by the local animal care committee all experiments were performed using Xenopus laevis tadpoles in the early pre-limb-bud stage. The animals were exposed to thiopental (0.1-250 microM) or a combination of thiopental (0.1-250 microM) + clonidine (100 microM) for up to 120 min. For each concentration at least ten animals were used. Anaesthesia was defined as loss of righting reflex for 10 s. Based on the response of the tadpoles at different concentrations of the anaesthetic a concentration-response curve was generated according to a method for quantal biologic data and halfmaximal concentrations (EC50) as well as slopes of the curves were calculated. All values are reported as mean +\/- sem. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t-test (p &lt; 0.05). The fraction of anaesthetised animals increased with increasing concentrations of thiopental. The logistic concentration-response plots showed a sigmoidal curve with a slope of 2.14 +\/- 0.3. Calculation of the EC50 resulted in a value of 25.5 +\/- 2.0 microM. In presence of clonidine thiopental exhibited a left shift of the concentration-response curve with an EC50 of 12.3 +\/- 1.6 microM (Slope: 2.75 +\/- 0.3). The presented data confirm the clinical impression that clonidine exercises an anaesthetic sparing effect. Clonidine enhances the anaesthetic potency of thiopental under equilibrium conditions, thus allowing to exclude pharmacokinetic influences as well as excluding effects of adjuvants. It is concluded that the reduction of requirement of anaesthetics by clonidine is due to a pharmacodynamic effect. ","2963":"Epinephrine is the drug of choice in cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Its dosage, however, is controversially discussed. The American Heart Association recommends for standard use in adults 1 mg epinephrine every 3-5 minutes, but classifies a medium dose, a high dose and a step-by-step escalating dosage concept as potentially useful alternatives. Aim of this study was to develop a rationale for the escalating dosage concept using an analysis of preclinical resuscitation data. Bonn city (141 km2, 310,000 residents, 52% female, 13.9% &gt; 65 years) was served by a double-response system of two ALS-units (staffed by physicians) and four BLS-units (staffed by paramedics). All patients were included in this data analysis, which were cardiopulmonary resuscitated according to the AHA guidelines by the ALS-unit Bonn-North (66% of area and 240,000 residents) from 1989 to 1994. All relevant data were documented by the emergency physicians using preformed treatment sheets. Discharge rates were determined by reviewing the hospital records, and one-year survival data were collected by mail contact with the primary physicians. The correlations between duration of cardiac arrest, dosage of epinephrine and outcome were determined by regression analysis in patients older than 17 years suffering from unwitnessed and bystander-witnessed cardiac arrest. Statistical significance was assumed for p &lt; 0.05. Within 1989 to 1994 the ALS-team of Bonn-North resuscitated 685 cardiac arrest patients with presumed cardiac aetiology in 383 (56%) return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) could be achieved. The epinephrine dosage required to achieve ROSC increased with prolongation of cardiac arrest interval (1989-1994; patients with ROSC selected, n = 263; r = 0.2276; p = 0.0002). Resuscitation success, however, decreased with increasing, dosage of epinephrine (1989-1992; n = 345; ROSC: r = -0.2643; p &lt; 0.001; survival &gt; 24 h: r = -0.3393; p &lt; 0.001; discharge: r = -0.1677; p = 0.0018; survival &gt; 1 year: r = -0.2685; p &lt; 0.001). Based on these data, we recommend an escalating epinephrine dosage concept, which facilitates titration of the drug to an effective level and meets the needs of the individual patient. This concept avoids overdosage in patients who had just collapsed shortly before initiation of CPR, attains higher levels of epinephrine in patients suffering from prolonged cardiac arrest, and takes into consideration that the effective epinephrine dose varies individually and increases with prolongation of the cardiac arrest interval. ","2964":"Fifteen patients with phaeochromocytoma who underwent surgery were studied consecutively. They received either (10) a balanced anaesthesia technique with isoflurane and fentanyl or (5) a combination of propofol and alfentanil for total intravenous anaesthesia. EEG processing was performed in order to guarantee adequate anaesthetic depth. Antihypertensive therapy was performed with sodium nitropusside. Continuous blood sampling was performed with a roller pump and an autosampler system in order to get high resolution measured of plasma catecholamines. Their concentration was measured by HPLC with electrochemical detection. There were 100fold differences in the maximal catecholamine concentrations during phaeochromocytoma resection between patients. In some cases adrenaline and noradrenaline levels exceeded normal values by a factor of 1000 to 1500. Secretion rates were calculated on a pharmacokinetic basis an revealed secretion rates of 0.3 to 97.3 micrograms\/min for adrenalin and 6.7 und 402.8 micrograms\/min for noradrenaline. If systolic blood pressures were greater than 160 mmHg sodium nitroprusside was given by infusion with a rate of 300 +\/- 315 micrograms\/min. Over a period of 69.2 +\/- 39.8 min during resection of the tumor the total dose was 7017 +\/- 12433 micrograms. There were positive correlations between plasma catecholamine concentrations, systolic blood pressure values, and infusion rates of sodium nitroprusside. The comparison of the two anaesthetic techniques resulted in a significant reduction of antihypertensive therapy and more stable haemodynamics in patients with total intravenous anaesthesia. However, the beneficial effect of this anaesthesia regimen has to be proven on a larger basis of patients in a randomized manner. ","2965":"Nitrous oxide is delivered during most cases of general anaesthesia. Though it has a history of approx. 150 years there is no univocal understanding about its clinical potency. Research studies during the last 10 years support, however, the view that 1. the potency of nitrous oxide in the clinical settings is only 1\/3 of the potency as estimated from the MAC value; 2. the potency of combinations of nitrous oxide and volatile anaesthetics is represented more appropriately by quantities which are derived from the EEG than by the addition of MAC fractions. The findings of the last 10 years do not support the hypothesis, that the addition of nitrous oxide to the breathing gas is more beneficial than waiving the use of nitrous oxide.","2966":"In modern anaesthesia various antagonists are used. They provide efficient tools to facilitate better control of pharmacological effects and side effects of drugs routinely used in anaesthesia. Naloxone is a competitive antagonist of opioids without any intrinsic activity. It counteracts respiratory depression, pruritus, sedation and analgesia caused by opioids. It is fast-acting with a duration of action of 45 to 90 min. Several investigators have reported severe side effects of naloxone including hypertension, tachyarrhythmias, left heart failure and cardiac arrest, and hence the use of naloxone must be carefully considered in every single patient. Flumazenil is a competitive antagonist of benzodiazepines. It is a remarkably safe drug and very effective to terminate all benzodiazepine effects in anaesthesia and intensive-care patients. Serious complications caused by flumazenil have been reported in patients receiving benzodiazepines in the treatment of seizure disorders and in patients with mixed intoxications. Neostigmine is one of several antagonists of neuromuscular blocking agents. Its side effects include bradycardia, increased bronchial secretions and increased peristalsis. Indication depends on the results of neuromuscular monitoring. Physostigmine is an unspecific antagonist of the central anticholinergic syndrome, an acute psychosis that may be caused by numerous drugs used in anaesthesia. Generally, antagonists should be carefully titrated. In emergency medicine the use of these antagonists is not recommended; the primary goal is to restore vital functions.","2967":"","2968":"Fournier's disease mostly occurs in immunosuppressed men in the 5th to 7th decade of life.

Owing to the low blood solubility, rapid induction of anaesthesia and emergence from anaesthesia would be expected. In this study, we compared emergence times and haemodynamics in patients receiving either sevoflurane or enflurane. Furthermore, all adverse experiences were recorded, and the relationship to the drug administered was rated. Thirty ASA physical status I and II patients were studied in an open, prospective and randomised clinical trial. Anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl, thiopentone and vecuronium for facilitating endotracheal intubation. Anaesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane or enflurane, 60% nitrous oxide in oxygen and additional doses of fentanyl (1-2 micrograms\/kg\/h). ECG, blood pressure (non-invasive), inspiratory and end-tidal concentrations of sevoflurane or enflurane were monitored continuously. At the end of surgery, administration of sevoflurane or enflurane and nitrous oxide stopped without tapering and emergence times were recorded. All adverse experiences which occurred until the third postoperative day were recorded and the relationship to the inhaled anaesthetic was rated as \"none\", \"unlikely\", \"possible\", \"probable\" or \"highly probable\". With the exception of the end-tidal concentration at the end of surgery and the mean inspiratory and end-tidal concentrations, which were higher for sevoflurane, the two patient groups were comparable. Pulmonary elimination was significantly faster and emergence time was significantly shorter (5 vs. 9 minutes) with sevoflurane. Emergence time did not correlate with the duration of anaesthetic exposure (MAC hours) for sevoflurane. There was no difference in the time courses of heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure between sevoflurane and enflurane. No adverse experiences with a \"probable\" or \"highly probable\" relationship to the inhaled anaesthetic were observed. Emergence time after inhalation anaesthesia depends on (alveolar) ventilation, blood-gas solubility coefficient and, at least for enflurane and isoflurane, on the dose applied (MAC hours). There is no positive correlation between emergence time and dose applied for sevoflurane. Due to the lower blood-gas solubility coefficient (0.6-0.7 for sevoflurane vs. 1.8 for enflurane) pulmonary elimination is faster and emergence time is shorter with sevoflurane. Supplementing inhalation anaesthesia with fentanyl, there is no difference in the time courses of heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure between sevoflurane and enflurane. ","2976":"Patients with increased intracranial pressure or vasospasm after subarachnoidal haemorrhage with decreased cerebral perfusion present a special problem on developing respiratory insufficiency, since kinetic therapy or extracorporal life support are contraindicated. Superimposed High Frequency Jet Ventilation (SHFJV) has been shown to be of benefit in ventilating patients with pulmonary insufficiency. The aim of this study was to evaluate if SHFJV could be safely applied in patients with critical cerebral blood flow; if so, SHFJV might be beneficial when pulmonary insufficiency occurs concomitantly. The study was performed in 14 patients (3 with pulmonary insufficiency) applying first moderate hyperventilation (paCO2 31 to 36 mmHg) followed by increased hyperventilation (paCO2 27 to 30 mmHg) with CMV and SHFJV and measuring intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and blood flow velocity (BFV) of the middle cerebral artery. BFV of the middle cerebral artery which correlates closely to the cerebral blood flow, was measured continuously with transcranial Doppler ultrasound. CMV: Increased hyperventilation leads to a statistically significant increase in paO2 (121.3 to 147.2 mmHg, p &lt; 0.05), SaO2 (98.5% to 99.2%, p &lt; 0.05) and decrease in BFV (systole 115.9 to 89.6 cm\/s, diastole 44.6 to 31.8 cm\/s, p &lt; 0.05). Heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, ICP and ventilation parameters did not show any statistically significant differences. SHFJV: During SHFJV the parameters demonstrated similar patterns as during CMV. However, none of the changes were statistically significant (paO2 111.9 to 125.9 mmHg, SaO2 97.9 to 98.8, BFV systole 106 to 95 cm\/s, diastole 52.7 to 42.4 cm\/s, n.s.). After calculating the mean BFV according to the Markwalder formula to a standard paCO2 of 40 mmHg CMV and SHFJV were compared to one another. No statistical difference was seen between the two different ventilation techniques. In patients with increased ICP, pulmonary complications such as pneumonia or ARDS are frequently observed. Since there are indications that SHFJV is of benefit in pulmonary insufficiency, the study was conducted to demonstrate that SHFJV can be safely applied in patients with increased ICP. ","2977":"Rapid bronchoscopy in general anaesthesia still has its precise indications, where the high frequency jet ventilation technique offers several advantages. The monitoring of ventilation, however, has been rather unsatisfactory up to date. We therefore studied capnography in 60 bronchoscopies during HFJV (rate: 100\/min; I:E = 0.33; driving pressure: 0.08-0.14 MPa) using a rigid bronchoscope with a distally located sampling port. Continuous capnograms were recorded. End-tidal partial pressures of carbon dioxide (petCO2), however, were obtained from 2-3 single breaths by intermittently reducing the jet-frequency to 10-12\/min. After 6 min (MP1: whole group; n = 60) and 18 min of HFJV (MP2: n = 34 of this group) petCO2 values were regularly obtained and compared to pCO2 in synchronously drawn capillary blood samples (pcCO2). The jet driving pressure initially adjusted to body weight, however, was only corrected according to petCO2, aiming at 34 mmHg. During HFJV, sinusoidal capnograms permitted the identification of every single jet impulse. With instruments being passed through the bronchoscope, however, these curves were substantially distorted. Mean pcCO2 at MP1 (37.8 +\/- 6.7 mmHg) and MP2 (37.2 +\/- 6.7 mmHg) demonstrated normal ventilation to light hyperventilation. Differences from mean petCO2 obtained during low frequency breathing were 3.3 mmHg at MP1 and 4.4 mmHg at MP2 (p &lt; 0.05). There were strong correlations between the individual pairs of pcCO2 and petCO2 from MP1 (r = 0.80) and MP2 (r = 0.75) as well as between the pairs of dpcCO2 and dpetCO2 from both MPs (r = 0.77). The accuracy of the ventilator setting according to petCO2 with reference to pcCO2 was 73% for MP1 and 74% for MP2 (sensitivity: 75%\/79%; specificity: 72%\/67%). Capnography in rigid bronchoscopy during HFJV proved a clinically applicable addition to monitoring. Its routine use is strongly recommended in interventional bronchoscopy. The true petCO2 values obtained by intermittent single low frequency jet breathing permit estimates of gas exchange sufficiently exact for clinical purposes and for adjustment of the ventilator setting. Wave forms of the continuously recorded capnogram during HFJV are a warning of impeded ventilation or airway obstruction and, thus, of the danger of barotrauma or hypoventilation. Besides contributing to patient safety, this monitoring method might improve the acceptance of HFJV for bronchoscopy. Furthermore, it can also be applied to rigid bronchoscopy with common ventilation. ","2978":"Anaesthesia in low-flow techniques gains increasing interest. The possibility of cost reduction, widespread use of highly developed anaesthesia machines and monitors, and introduction of two new fluorinated inhalational anaesthetics with low solubility in human tissues encourage the use of low-flow anaesthesia techniques. Further advantages are improved climatisation of breathing gas and estimation or even measurement of the important parameter \"oxygen consumption\". The anaesthesia machines and inhalational anaesthetics currently available allow a safe use of low-flow techniques if safety requirements are complied with (tight circle system, monitoring of: inspired oxygen concentration, minute ventilation, airway pressure, transcutaneous oxygen saturation). Low-flow anaesthesia techniques using a fresh gas flow rate of 1 l\/min can be performed with almost every anaesthesia machine. However, the use of multigas monitors, analyzing most parts of the breathing gas, facilitates the use of low-flow techniques. Multigas monitors and anaesthesia machines equipped with intermittent fresh gas delivery are recommended for the use of fresh gas flow rates close to the metabolic rate. Because of its physicochemical properties the new inhalational anaesthetic desflurane offers advantages for the use in low-flow anaesthesia techniques.","2979":"","2980":"","2981":"Boerhaave's syndrome (Hermann Boerhaave, 1724 [5]) stands for the atraumatic spontaneous rupture of the oesophagus, and still represents a life-threatening situation. Contrary to the surgical approach, the anaesthesiological management has been largely neglected so far. The present case report introduces a patient requiring surgical therapy due to a belatedly diagnosed rupture of the oesophagus. In agreement with the surgeon, endotracheal intubation was performed using a single-lumen oral Woodbridge tube. During left thoracotomy, artificial ventilation sometimes obstructed the surgeons. Following a life-threatening intrathoracic venous bleeding (after additional right thoracotomy), the situation became almost adverse, since the surgeon could not stop the bleeding due to the movement of the lungs. Ventilation was therefore stopped. The oxygen supply was provided 20 min by application of the so-called apnoeic oxygenation, first described in 1908 by the German surgeon Franz Volhard (15). Using the filled 2.5l reservoir bag of the circle circuit as the oxygen source (CPAP 10 cm H2O), oxygenation was maintained by refilling the bag after its volume had been decreased due to the patient's ongoing O2 consumption. Starting with an initial paO2 value of only 400mmHg (despite pAO2 approximately 670 mmHg, i.e. intrapulmonary right-left shunt of approx. 10-15%), the paO2 declined to 100 mmHg during the 20 min of apnoeic oxygenation (i.e. a drop by 15 mmHg per minute), whereas arterial pCO2 increased by 50 mmHg to a value of 90 mmHg, as stated recently in literature [18]). No relevant changes of ECG, heart rate, blood pressure and partial arterial oxygen saturation (pulse oxymeter) occurred. During thoracic operations adverse situations may arise from the two antipodes artificial ventilation and acceptable surgical access. Alternative respiratory techniques, e.g. one-lung anaesthesia and\/or high-frequency jet ventilation, are not always applicable, although the present case report indicates that a double lumen tube should be recommended. However, the clinical use of oxygenation by apnoeic oxygenation is a useful measure that can be realised in a simple and safe manner. The present case report may help to consider this particular alternative also during thoracic surgery (no influence of FRC size on pAO2 decrease). If applied correctly, apnoeic oxygenation obviously increases both the flexibility of the anaesthesist and patient safety, and additionally provides the ability of safe acting in clinical routine settings as well as during emergencies. In summary, knowledge of this technique of oxygenation seems to be an integral part of serious anaesthesiological education and clinical management.

Consumptive or immunosuppressive underlying diseases such as diabetes mellitus, cardiac insufficiency, alcohol-induced liver damage, malignant tumours or drug-induced immunosuppression after organ transplantation, are among the risk factors. Diagnosis is based on direct identification of the pathogen from body secretions by means of direct immunofluorescence. The serological immunoresponse often takes place long after outbreak of the disease or fails entirely to appear and is therefore only suitable for retrospective confirmation. Therapy of choice is an intravenous administration of erythromycin. There are now increasing pointers to the efficiency of fluoroquinolone antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin. We report on the course of a severe case of legionnaire's disease with multiple organ failure occurring in a patient after bone marrow depression induced by anti-inflammatory drugs. Treatment erythromycin resulted in a marked cholestasis, so that antibiotic treatment was changed to ciprofloxacin. This therapy as well as the supportive intensive-care treatment eventually led to the patient's complete recovery. Based on the case report, fundamental aspects of diagnostics, antibiotic treatment, intensive-care treatment and prognosis of severe cases of legionellosis are discussed.","2983":"","2984":"","2985":null,"2986":"In Austria emergency and disaster medicine is a young interdisciplinary subject.

The ICS was slightly better in overall prediction of patient outcome (ICS: 84.98%; GCS: 82.68%), but more importantly, statistical analysis (logistic regression model) showed a greater distance between the median scores of survivors and non-survivors, when scored with the ICS (survival: 12; non-survival: 3) than when scored with the GCS (survival: 7; non-survival: 4). The results of the present study not only suggest that it is possible to predict mortality prior to therapy for any individual GCS and ICS coma score, but also indicated the ICS to be safer to use than the GCS because of the greater distance of the median scores for survivors and non survivors.

However, there are only a few studies investigating the effect of the new anaesthetic desflurane on the hepatic blood flow. In particular no information is available about the influence of desflurane on liver microcirculation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of desflurane in comparison to isoflurane and pentobarbital on microcirculation of the liver in vivo using intravital fluorescence microscopy. 18 female Sprague-Dawley rats were anaesthetised with pentobarbital sodium, tracheotomised and mechanically ventilated using a rodent ventilator. A midline laparotomy was performed for later intravital microscopy of the liver. At the beginning of the one-hour ventilation period the animals were assigned to one of the following groups: isoflurane 0.75 MAC, desflurane 0.75 MAC and pentobarbital group. Animals of the pentobarbital group received additionally 25 mg\/kg pentobarbital intravenously. After 60 min of ventilation and continuous monitoring of the systemic circulation the hepatic microcirculation was investigated by intravital fluorscence microscopy. Mean arterial blood pressure decreased slightly in the isoflurane and the desflurane groups compared to the pentobarbital group. Neither isoflurane nor desflurane did affect the sinusoidal diameters or the sinusoidal blood flow compared to the pentobarbital group. Hepatic microcirculation is not affected by one-hour anaesthesia with 0.75 MAC isoflurane or desflurane in comparison to pentobarbital.

In Germany, official guidelines govern the hygienic equipment of ambulance cars and hygienic management during and after transport both in routine and special cases. Disinfection of skin, hands and surfaces and hygienic protection of the medical staff predominate in daily work. Standard hygienic procedures during application of venous leads, intubation and artificial ventilation and correct handling of sterile materials should also be considered.

Fibreoptic assessment of the larynx revealed secretions as well as a swollen laryngeal mucosa; endotracheal intubation guided by the fibreoptic bronchoscope was not possible. After multiple attempts to intubate the trachea a laryngeal mask airway was inserted. Endotracheal intubation was completed by guidance of the fibreoptic bronchoscope via the laryngeal mask airway. After surgery the patient was transferred to an ICU and ventilated for one day. Fibreoptically controlled extubation was uneventful. Management of the unexpectedly difficult intubation is a challenge for every anaesthetist. The laryngeal mask airway, a relatively new device for airway protection, has proved to be beneficial in planned as well as in unexpectedly difficult endotracheal intubation. However, although the laryngeal mask airway may solve ventilation problems initially, prelaryngeal alterations present a contraindication for perioperative ventilation via the laryngeal mask airway. The fibreoptic intubation through the laryngeal mask airway is an important technique to consider in the \"cannot intubate\" situation.","2993":"","2994":"","2995":"","2996":"","2997":"","2998":"","2999":"","3000":"","3001":"The double-burst-stimulation (DBS) is a new stimulation pattern developed to facilitate tactile evaluation of residual neuromuscular blockade.

","3002":"Blockade of the stellate ganglion is an established and highly effective diagnostic and therapeutic procedure for management of certain acute and chronic pain syndromes or other disorders. The paratracheal injection of a local anaesthetic is the simplest and most frequently used approach for blocking the cervicothoracic sympathetic nerves (ganglion stellate). However, since serious complications can occur during or following the anterior paratracheal technique including accidental intravenous or intraarterial injection, non-invasive methods for blockade of the stellate ganglion have been suggested. In 1980 Jenkner (15) reported the successful interruption of the sympathetic outflow from the stellate ganglion together with the relief of pain by transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), followed by the development of an \"optimal wave form\" in 1981 (14). Since we were unable to reproduce Jenkner's results of sympathetic blockade in our patients, this study was designed to investigate the effects of TENS on the sympathetic activity of the stellate ganglion in healthy volunteers. 50 healthy volunteers were randomised into two groups (n = 25). In group I the left stellate ganglion was stimulated for 20 min by the mode described by Jenkner (monophasic pulse, small anode, large cathode, frequency 20 Hz), while group II was stimulated by conventional TENS (biphasic pulse, electrodes of identical size, frequency 100 Hz). The method of stimulation was blinded to both the investigator and the subjects investigated. Measurements included cutaneous blood flow of the volar forearm (laser Doppler), skin temperature on two sites of the cheeks (thermistor), pupil diameter and size of the palpebral fissures, sweat production (ninhydrine test) and global sensitivity and pain perception thresholds on both sides (electrical stimulation). Measurements were performed before TENS of the stellate ganglion, after 5, 10, 15 and 20 min of stimulation and 10 min after termination of TENS. Statistical analysis of the obtained data was performed by Friedman-Test and by Mann-Whitney-U-Test. p &lt; 0.05 was assigned statistical significance. Skin temperature increased in both groups and on both sides by 1.2 degrees C, while skin perfusion rate, pupil size, size of the palpebral fissure and sweat production remained unchanged. Global sensitivity and pain perception thresholds of forehead decreased in both groups and on both sides, while there was no change of both parameters on the hands. No signs and symptoms of sympathetic blockade could be demonstrated in any of the groups, neither by TENS of the stellate ganglion as described by Jenkner nor by unspecific TENS. Thus, pain relief by TENS of the stellate ganglion as reported in the literature must involve other mechanisms than sympathetic blockade. In addition, TENS may not replace traditional blockade of the stellate ganglion by local anesthetics, if sympathetic blockade is required for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

The perioperative setting in those patients is associated with the risk of myocardial ischaemia (PMI) and myocardial infarction, and also with the risk of perioperative stroke and dysfunction of the central nervous system (CNS). Perioperative cardiovascular morbidity represents a major healthcare challenge. The relevance of PMI is well documented. It has been demonstrated in early trials that both myocardial ischaemia and infarction are preventable in high-risk patients undergoing surgery, and that therapeutic agents such as adenosine-related agents, alpha 2-agonists, and other stress modulators can be safely administered to these patients. Regarding perioperative stroke, approximately 3 to 7% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery suffer stroke, with an additional 30% or more suffering in-hospital CNS dysfunction, and 10% suffering moderately severe long-term CNS dysfunction. Few data are available for noncardiac surgery. The number of outcome studies addressing prophylactic or therapeutic options in these patients is quite limited. In fact, only one recent study has established that perioperative stroke is preventable with the use of an adenosine-regulating agent. Thus, it appears that it may be possible to prevent stroke, even though these results require confirmation. Because of the aging of our population, and the medical, financial and social impact of cardiovascular disease, the development of anti-ischaemic therapy, particularly in the surgical patient, will be a critical area of medical research for the next several decades.","3006":"","3007":"","3008":"Prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in anaesthetic patients and perioperative pitfalls, events and complications (PECs) in different nutritional states were examined.

Preoperative data (age, sex, defined preexisting diseases, nutritional state, grade of urgency and ASA-class) were integrated in an automatically readable paper record, as well as the perioperative interventions and events, type of anaesthesia, and kind of operation. The records were routinely in use for every patient. After control and correction the data were stored in a modern data base. Data of patients under 16 years of age and incomplete sets of data were excluded from analysis. From July 1, 1992 to December 31, 1993 23,056 anaesthesias were recorded, 5,852 (25.4%) of them with a total of 8,107 PECs. 17,255 patients had normal body weight and 23% of them PECs. 4,484 obese (but not extremely) patients had a PEC rate of 31.2%, 330 extremely obese patients had a PEC rate of 38.2%, 966 patients with underweight (but not extremely) had a PEC rate of 36.1% and 21 with extreme underweight had a PEC rate of 38.1%. Obese patients had a higher prevalence of preexisting cardiovascular disturbances (angina pectoris, myocardial infarction and hypertension) and tended to a higher incidence of perioperative hypertensive, bronchospastic and hypoxic events as well as more difficulties in application of regional anaesthesia. Young adult patients (16-39 years) had a PEC rate of 14% in case of normal nutritional state but of 20% in case of obesity. The incidence of respiratory PECs and of PECs of higher severity was almost double in obese young patients compared to normal weight patients of the same age. When preoperative cardiovascular disease was known there was little difference between the different states of nutrition in respect of perioperative PECs. Nutritional disorder is an important epidemiological factor in anaesthesia. Particularly in younger patients without defined preoperative cardiovascular disturbance but with obesity the anaesthesist may be surprised by a remarkable incidence of relevant problems during and immediately after anaesthesia. We should consider the possible phenomenon that we are underestimating the anaesthetic challenge in young obese patients in a \"healthy\" cardiovascular state.

The anaesthetic technique used has to take into consideration the fact that the patient must be awake and alert in the early postoperative period.

A detailed analysis of the current situation suggests that this may be possible even today--with some reservations regarding the infrastructure of the hospitals. Selection and preparation of the patient is a process in which the anaesthesiologist must play an important role. Delegation of this duty to the surgeon or the general practitioner is not permitted. The anaesthesiologist must have sufficient time, prior to the procedure, to meet the patient; meeting the patient for the first time a few minutes before induction of anaesthesia is unacceptable. Even if one concedes freedom of methods, one drug and one procedure should be avoided while caring for surgical ambulatory patients: this drug is succinylcholine, because of life-threatening hyperkaliaemia in children with occult myopathy and severe and frequent myalgia especially in ambulatory patients. The procedure not suitable in ambulatory patients is subarachnoidal analgesia--due to an unacceptably high percentage of headaches in young ambulatory patients. The postoperative care and observation must be delegated to especially qualified persons only--and these persons should not be distracted by duties outside the recovery area. The anaesthetist must--in addition--be available at all times without delay. Pain, nausea and emesis molest the ambulatory patient during the postoperative course to a particular extent.

In several experiments, performed on himself, Snow succeeded to demonstrate that rebreathing of the exhaled vapours was possible following carbon dioxide absorption, and that it resulted in a pronounced prolongation of the narcotic effects of the volatile anaesthetics. Furthermore, Snow performed experiments on animals using a closed system for evaluating the carbon dioxide production during anaesthesia. It is all the more worthwhile to introduce Snow's publications on these topics, as, despite their extraordinary theoretical and practical significance, they remained nearly unnoticed.

A left thoracotomy was performed and a needle force probe was placed in the left ventricular wall to measure myocardial force of contraction. A Widney gauge was placed around the left ventricle to measure left ventricular circumference changes. The animals were also monitored with left ventricular tip manometers, pulmonary arterial thermodilution catheters, and femoral arterial and venous catheters. Three hours after instrumentation baseline haemodynamic measurements were performed and repeated 30 min after either halothane 0.8 vol.% (n = 8) or isoflurane 1.5 vol.% (n = 8). Then nifedipine (10 micrograms\/kg i.v.) was administered and haemodynamic measurements were repeated. Both volatile anaesthetic agents caused a decrease in MAP, CO, LVP, LVFS, and dP\/dtmax. Heart rate, CVP, PAOP, and the diastolic diameter of the heart did not change with halothane and isoflurane. Isoflurane led to a decrease of SVR that was not seen with the administration of halothane. Nifedipine during halothane anaesthesia caused a further decrease in MAP, SVR, LVP, dP\/dtmax, and LVFS compared to the already reduced values with halothane alone. However, SV did not decrease any further. If nifedipine was added to isoflurane a further decrease in CO and SV was observed despite a constant SVR. Halothane, isoflurane and nifedipine are cardiac depressant drugs. Isoflurane induces vasodilation and appears to be less cardiodepressant than halothane in the clinical situation. However, if nifedipine is added, the vasodilation caused by nifedipine offsets its own negative inotropic effect and in parts the cardiac depression of halothane. Combined with isoflurane the vasodilatory effect of nifedipine is insignificant and the negative inotropic effects of both drugs are additive resulting in a profound decrease in SV and CO.

Meperidine, which binds to both mu- and kappa-opioid receptors, is reported to be more effective in treating shivering than morphine or fentanyl. Recent data indicate that much of meperidine's special antishivering effect may be mediated by its kappa-opioid receptor activity. Nalbuphine, an opioid agonist\/antagonist also has a potent affinity for kappa-receptors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antishivering effect of nalbuphine in comparison to meperidine. 100 ASA physical status I-II patients shivering after elective surgery were included in the study. General anaesthesia was performed with thiopentone, low-dose fentanyl and enflurane in N2O\/O2. After arrival in the recovery room patients shivering within 5 min received either meperidine 25 mg or nalbupine 10 mg in a double-blind, randomised manner. The duration and severity of shivering, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, end-tidal CO2 concentration, O2-saturation and awareness were documented until 20 min after injection. Patients in need of a second injection were excluded from the study. Demographic variables, duration of operation and temperature decreases were not significantly different between treatment groups. The suppression of shivering was achieved within 4.0 +\/- 3.5 or 4.6 +\/- 4.1 min following the injection of meperidine or nalbuphine, respectively (p = NS). Vital signs and postoperative vigilance showed no significant differences. No adverse side effects were observed. The data indicated that nalbuphine suppressed postoperative shivering as effectively and timely as meperidine in equianalgesic doses.

The choice of an anaesthetic technique must not only be made with regard to medical implications; economical aspects have also to be taken into account without challenge to the quality of care. A consequent use of low-flow techniques and a market oriented purchase of drugs and disposables may allow cost savings in anesthesia.","3031":"","3032":"Case report of an acute airway obstruction during general anaesthesia by compression of the left main bronchus in an asymptomatic patient with unknown mediastinal mass. The patient was scheduled for a relief of a thyroid gland cyst. The compression occurred after uneventful induction of anaesthesia during the patient's positioning with flexed neck and elevated upper thorax on a pad. Increasing FiO2 from 0.5 to 1.0, repeated fiberoptic bronchoscopic examination and changing of the position of the endotracheal tube facilitated the operation. After reversal of the flexed neck position ventilation was normal. The intraoperatively suspected mediastinal tumour was confirmed by postoperative computerised tomography of thorax and neck. The teratoma was removed in toto in a second operation. In a review of the literature pathophysiological changes, preoperative assessment and anaesthetic management of patients with mediastinal tumour are discussed.","3033":"","3034":"","3035":"New insights about the pathophysiology of acidosis as well as the efficacy of various buffer solutions have once again started the discussion about the necessity and indications of buffer therapy. After evaluation of the current literature one has to conclude that the spectrum of indications for application of buffer solution is remarkably small; some indications, however, remain well accepted. It has been shown that acidosis with pH-values above 7.2 has to be buffered only rarely, especially if the underlying disease responds to causal therapy. pH-values under 7.2, however, caused by renal tubular acidosis or by certain types of lactate acidosis, respond to buffer therapy. The choice of buffer solution depends on the pathophysiology of the underlying disease. In particular the application of CO2 generating buffer solutions under the conditions of critically reduced circulation and ventilation remains doubtful. Application of CO2 generating buffers seems to be justified only if intracellular acidosis can be prevented by immediate elimination of carbon dioxide generated by the buffer reaction.","3036":"Despite its worldwide propagation, external chest compression is of limited efficacy. Recently a new method of cardiac resuscitation, active compression-decompression (ACD), was presented. In animals and a small series of patients resuscitated within the hospital ACD proved to augment blood flow during cardiac resuscitation as a result of greater intrathoracic pressure gradients. We investigated whether ACD does provide superior survival in patients suffering from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Doctors and paramedics of the mobile intensive care unit at Mannheim University Hospital were trained in the new method. 56 patients were randomly assigned to either standard chest compression according to recommendations of the American Heart Association, AHA (Group I, 30 patients) or to ACD (Group II, 26 patients). ACD was performed by use of a hand-held suction device (CardioPump, Ambu Int.). Compression (30-50 kp) and decompression (10-15 kp) were alternately applied to the patients' chest with a frequency of 80\/min. Duration of compression was 50% of the cycle. In both groups advanced life support was performed according to AHA standards. In Group I, 40% of the patients could be resuscitated; and 13.3% were discharged from hospital. In Group II, 38.5% of the patients regained spontaneous circulation, and 11.5% of the patients were discharged. (Group I vs. Group II: n.s.). One patient in each group survived with a severe neurological deficit. ACD caused greater physical efforts than standard chest compression. Furthermore ACD was difficult to perform in patients with ventricular fibrillation once electrode gel had been used. ACD was not feasible in five patients because of large breast (four women) and kyphoscoliosis (one patient). The rate of serious complications was lower in Group II. Methods to verify the efficacy of ACD in dummy training should be developed. Paramedics performing ACD should relieve each other every 5 minutes. In patients resuscitated by ACD self-adhesive defibrillation paddles instead of electrode gel should be used. Modifications in the design of the CardioPump are desirable to enhance the efficacy of ACD. With regard to future multicentre trials all paramedics should be skilled in the new technique to reach more patients in a shorter period of time.

Those dysfunctions are characterised by preserved memory content and perception, but the coordination and association of these functions are disturbed. Typical clinical signs are motor restlessness, disordered emotions, and symptoms of dementia. Little is known about the aetiology of those symptoms, but they are most likely due to various events, such as direct drug effects, the extent of surgical trauma, sensorial deprivation, and disturbed perfusion. Eight orthopaedic patients (ASA III or IV) scheduled for removal of their total hip replacement were anaesthetised by catheter-spinal anaesthesia (CSA) for pain relief in combination with standardised, modified neuroleptanalgesia (NLA). At six defined times (15 hours preoperatively, immediately before and after surgery and 6, 24, and 36 hours postoperatively) CSF samples were drawn and the ischaemic markers were determined by means of radioimmunoassay (NSE), electrophoresis (CK-BB), photometry (lactate), and high-pressure liquid chromatography (hypoxanthine). The release of ischaemic markers into CSF correlates linear with the extent of ischaemic brain damage. Mean concentrations of the following ischaemic markers increased in all patients intraoperatively: NSE from 12.3 ng\/ml to 13.4 ng\/ml, hypoxanthine from 1.86 mumol\/l to 3.73 mumol\/l, and lactate from 1.4 mmol\/l to 2.0 mmol\/l respectively, all of which returned to normal within 36 hours. The CK-BB concentrations were all within normal values and not affected by the operation during this investigation. Although no clinical signs of temporary mental dysfunction have been observed, the results indicate that in CSF ischaemic markers temporarily undergo certain changes in their concentrations during the removal of total hip replacements in elderly patients. These changes are reason for assuming that risk patients may suffer a temporary disturbed cerebral energy utilisation intraoperatively, even if stable clinical and cardiovascular conditions prevail under anaesthesia. Such a temporary ischaemic penumbra might be responsible for the postoperative development of temporary mental dysfunctions. ","3039":"Left ventricular end-diastolic wall stress (EDWS) ist an index for left ventricular preload. Utilising transoesophageal echocardiography, left ventricular dimensions can be obtained by two-dimensional (2d-) as well as M-Mode measurements, and each can be combined with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) for the calculation of EDWS. In the present examination, both methods were compared with regard to their technical accomplishment and reproducibility under clinical conditions. EDWS was obtained in 24 ventilated patients by 2d-echocardiography (2d-EDWS) and M-mode-echocardiography (M-EDWS) before and after a change in PCWP by 3mmHg. In 12 patients, volume therapy with hydroxyethylstarch (HAES) was started when PCWP &lt; 11 mmHg; in another 12 patients, continuous intravenous administration of nitroglycerine was begun, when PCWP &gt; 14 mmHg. 2d-EDWS and M-EDWS were compared and their relation to thermodilution stroke volume and stroke work index analysed. 2d-EDWS and M-EDWS correlated well in both groups (HAES: r = 0.91; NITRO: r = 0.93), with M-EDWS being systematically lower than 2d-EDWS. The relative difference between 2d-EDWS and M-EDWS, and their mean value--calculated as the mean per cent error--was 11.2%. Directional changes in preload were reflected in all patients by 2d-EDWS and M-EDWS in accordance. Both correlated better with stroke volume and stroke work index than PCWP. Determination of 2d-EDWS showed better inter- and intraobserver variability in the echocardiographic measurements. With regard to direction and quantity, changes of preload as seen with echocardiographic EDWS were according reflected by the 2d- and the M-mode technique. Determination of 2d-EDWS compared to M-EDWS was superior in reproducibility and more useful for the estimation of stroke volume changes. ","3040":"Transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a visualising ultrasound technique that has entered the arena of anaesthesiology and intensive care shortly after its clinical introduction in the early 80s. Due to transducer positioning close to the heart, two-dimensional echocardiograms render high spatial resolution of cardiac structures and in adequate views continuously demonstrate the complete course of cardiac filling and contraction. The high sensitivity of the method, numerous options to assess morphological and functional parameters, and the low related risk involved for the patient explain the growing interest in TEE as a perioperative monitoring device. This utilisation, however, is currently limited by the high costs of the ultrasound equipment, the demand for specialists knowledge, the cost-benefit relation not yet thoroughly explored and the little propagated knowledge of the method's capacity. In addition, the need for information is growing due to the permanent technological progress of the equipment, which recurrently requires actualization in evaluating TEE.","3041":"","3042":"A 77-year-old female patient presenting with recurrent pulmonary embolism and shock had a severe craniocerebral trauma after collapsing at home 2 days before admission. Since systemic thrombolytic therapy appeared hazardous in this patient, percutaneous fragmentation and distal dispersion of the proximal pulmonary emboli was performed using a pigtail catheter. This procedure improved cardiac output immediately by 15%, whereas the mean pulmonary artery pressure dropped only slightly from 48 to 46 mmHg. Thereafter, a streptokinase infusion of 100,000 IU during 1 h was instituted through the pigtail catheter into the pulmonary artery. 12 hours after the treatment was started, cardiac output was raised by 70% and mean pulmonary artery pressure was decreased from 48 to 25 mmHg. 14 days after admission, control ventilation-perfusion scan showed a markedly improved pulmonary perfusion, and right heart catheterization revealed normal right heart pressures. The patient recovered rapidly and there was no evidence of recurrent pulmonary embolism 18 months later. This report demonstrates that a percutaneous catheter fragmentation of proximal pulmonary emboli combined with local intermediate-dose infusion of streptokinase may be a helpful therapeutic option in patients with massive pulmonary embolism in whom systemic thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated.","3043":"In patients with deep venous thrombosis, there is a recent trend towards surgical thrombectomy to avoid late complications. However, up to 10% of these patients suffer from severe intraoperative pulmonary embolism, 30 to 40% of whom die on the operating table. Treatment options for massive pulmonary embolism include embolectomy (high mortality), transvenous thrombus fragmentation techniques, and thrombolytic therapy. However, while thrombolysis is recommended as the treatment of choice for PTE, it is usually considered contraindicated in surgical patients because of bleeding complications. We report on 5 cases of severe pulmonary thromboembolism with marked cardiogenic shock during venous thrombectomy. Three patients were treated successfully by intraoperative thrombolysis alone or in combination with mechanical fragmentation of the embolus using a catheter technique under fluoroscopy (one case). Diagnosis was established by a sudden decrease of mean arterial pressure (from 83 to 45 mmHg), a marked increase of mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) (from 16 to 43 mmHg), hypoxaemia (SaO2 &lt; 90%), an increased arterial-to-end-tidal CO2-difference (from 7 to 42 mmHg), and\/or pulmonary angiography (2 cases). All patients had to be treated with high dosages of catecholamines (norepinephrine 0.5 microgram.kg-1.min-1 or epinephrine 0.1 microgram.kg-1.min-1, and dopamine 6-15 micrograms.kg-1.min-1). Three patients required CPR prior to or during thrombolytic therapy.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether induced hypotension with sodium nitroprusside (SNP) causes changes in lymphocyte subpopulations. In a prospective randomised evaluation 30 patients undergoing elective oto-rhino-laryngological interventions were studied. In 15 patients SNP was administered to reduce the mean arterial pressure to 50 mmHg. There was a control group of another 15 patients. Anaesthesia was induced with etomidate and maintained with isoflurane. At 7 a.m. on the day of operation (T1), 10 minutes after induction of anaesthesia (T2), 60 minutes after T2 (T3, end of SNP-infusion), 120 minutes (T4) after T2; 180 minutes (T5) after T2, and at 7 a.m. on the following morning (T6) blood samples were taken. A new method (whole blood) was used to mark 6 different lymphocyte subpopulations with monoclonal antibodies which were measured by flow cytometry. In both groups a significant decrease in total lymphocyte count (from 32.7 x 10(9) cells\/l preoperatively to 13 x 10(9) cells\/l the following morning in the SNP-group and from 31 x 10(9) cells\/l to 14.2 x 10(9) cells\/l the following morning in the control group) was observed. In the SNP-group the HLA-DR positive T-lymphocytes increased from 11.8% at T1 to 19.2% at T5 and 22.3% at T6. No statistically significant changes were found in percentage of T-, T4-, T8-, B-lymphocytes and natural killer cells. The increase in the percentage of activated T-lymphocytes is possibly due to an activation of the sympatho-adrenergic system after sodium nitroprusside-infusion and a subsequent redistribution of these cells from other organs (bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes). The cell-mediated and the humoral immunity are not altered by induced hypotension. In discussing this result, the age of the patients, the extent of the surgical trauma, the anaesthesiological procedure and the methodological aspects in the lymphocyte assay should be taken into consideration. ","3053":"It is often suggested that atropine should be avoided in patients on treatment with tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants. It is feared that the strong anticholinergic side effects of these drugs could exaggerate the effects of atropine on the heart. In a controlled prospective study, 31 patients on treatment with tri- or tetracyclic antidepressants were given atropine in incremental doses. ECG-changes and changes in heart rate were recorded and compared to a control group. Atropine 2 micrograms\/kg was administered in 60 sec. intervals up to a total dose of 10 micrograms\/kg. The patients on antidepressant treatment had a higher incidence of common anticholinergic side effects (dryness of mouth, accommodation disorders, constipation) due to the anticholinergic properties of the antidepressants. In addition, the basal heart rate of these patients was significantly higher compared to the control group (81\/min vs. 73\/min). After administration of 2 and 4 micrograms\/kg of atropine the patients of the control group showed a 5% resp. 4% decrease in heart rate. 26% of these patients developed conduction disturbvances. These changes could be explained by the parasympathetic effect of low doses of atropine. They were less pronounced in the patients on treatment with antidepressants. Here, only the administration of 2 micrograms\/kg of atropine led to a 2% decrease in heart rate. Only 6% of these patients developed conduction disturbances. Both groups showed an increase in heart rate when higher doses of atropine were administered (8 and 10 micrograms\/kg). However, the increase in heart rate after administration of 10 micrograms\/kg was significantly less in the patients on antidepressant treatment compared to the control group (11.4% vs. 16.2%). There were no changes of blood pressure during these investigations. The results of this study suggest that the anticholinergic properties of tri- and tetracyclic antidepressants include an increase in basal heart rate, but do not render the heart more susceptible to the cardiac effects of atropine. ","3054":"Increasing age and anaesthetics diminish the baroreflex response to acute changes in blood pressure. This study was designed to investigate the effects of propofol and the combination of propofol with fentanyl on the baroreflex activity in geriatric patients. Baroreflex sensitivity was studied by the method of Smyth et al. in 10 elderly (72 +\/- 6 yrs) and in 10 younger (48 +\/- 6 yrs) patients. Nitroprusside (depressor test) and phenylephrine (pressor test) were used to induce changes in blood pressure of 20 mmHg each to alter the stimulation of the baroreceptor sites. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol, 2 mg x kg-1 b.w.m, and maintained by a continuous infusion of 12 mg x kg-1 x h-1 for 10 min and thereafter with 6 mg x kg-1 x h-1. Then a bolus of fentanyl, 7 micrograms x kg-1 b.w. was injected. Haemodynamic parameters and baroreflex activity were measured in the awake state, 10 min after induction of anaesthesia and 10 min after the administration of fentanyl. Plasma propofol concentrations were determined by HPLC 10 min after induction of anaesthesia with propofol and 10 min after injection of fentanyl. The slope of the linear regression changes in RR-interval [ms] per changes in systolic pressure [mmHg] was used as an index of the baroreflex sensitivity. In the awake state the depressor slopes were significantly reduced by 60% in the elderly patients when compared to the younger patients. In both groups propofol decreased reflex sensitivity by 38% and 41% respectively; this effect was enhanced by the addition of fentanyl in the younger patients, while there was no further effect in the elderly. The pressor slopes did not change significantly in both groups neither with propofol nor with the combination of fentanyl, but again reflex response was significantly less in the elderly patients. Our data demonstrate that in geriatric patients the baroreflex control of heart rate already is attenuated in the awake state. Propofol produces a further reduction in reflex sensitivity to an acute decrease in blood pressure; this effect is more pronounced in elderly patients as compared to younger individuals. Acute changes in posture or circulating blood volume during propofol anaesthesia may result in greater cardiovascular instability in older patients due to the greater impairment of circulatory control mechanisms.

The pharmacodynamics of thiopentone are reviewed with emphasis on the effects on the CNS, the cardiovascular system, the respiratory system, renal function, liver and the effect in porphyria. Its side effects such as local reactions and release of histamine are also reviewed. The clinical importance of thiopentone in anaesthesia induction and the present state of cerebral protection are discussed, as well as the results of controlled trials comparing thiopentone to other induction drugs. Thiopentone has the main disadvantage of a slow elimination resulting in minor CNS depression, which seems of very limited clinical importance. In most respects thiopentone seems to be comparable to its younger competitors.","3056":"Total hip replacement is a frequently practised operation. Depending on age, circumstances and individual assessment, cemented, non-cemented and hybrid forms are used. Apart from general risks, such as vascular and\/or neural injuries, thrombosis and infections, there are specific risks, depending on the surgical technique. If cemented systems are used, the anesthesiologist must be on the alert in respect of a possible multi-causal cardiopulmonary depression during the implantation of the prosthesis. Incidents may be reduced or moderated by measures such as reduction of pressure from the femoral cavity or anesthetic measures such as avoidance of N2O during or after cementation, use of anti-histamines, etc., but there is no absolute protection from severe reactions by the cardiopulmonary system. In these cases it is imperative to recognise and treat hypoxic conditions immediately, whatever the cause, such as cardiac or pulmonary depression. If a non-cemented hip replacement is used or a revision is necessary the main problem is usually a higher blood loss. Especially in such cases it is necessary to apply a well-organised sequence of blood-saving methods to protect patients from the general risks of homologous blood transfusion. Even though the main concern of the public is the possibility of contamination of donor blood with the AIDS virus, transmission of hepatitis C virus is a much more common problem. Depending on the diagnostic methods the occurrence of thrombosis after total hip replacement has been reported to be as much as 55%. To minimise this high incidence, sufficient prophylaxis, adequate fluid therapy, suitable anesthetic techniques and cutting down on the duration of the operation should be taken into account. The use of low molecular weight heparins has certain advantages. If deep vein thrombosis has occurred, therapy consists of anticoagulation with intravenous heparin and immobilisation. A rare but severe complication is a deep hip prosthetic infection. More than 50% of infections are caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci and anaerobic bacteria. To avoid sepsis it is imperative to employ adequate high-dosage antibiotics, revisional surgery and, if necessary, even excision arthroplasty. There is no \"ideal\" anesthesiological method for total hip replacement. Regional techniques as well as general anesthesia have their specific pros and cons which are controversially discussed in respect of their priority.

In addition, the boy had complained of transient burning sensations in both feet several months prior to admission. Revision of the old scar at the beginning of the hand symptoms had been without effect. Initial analgesic attempts with oral paracetamol, acetylsalicylic acid, tramadol and intravenous morphine also had had no effect. Carbamazepine, methysergide and immunoglobulins led to no improvement. Symptomatic relief was achieved only by cooling the distal parts of both arms with water. This caused oedema and maceration of the skin after several days. The placement of a cervical epidural catheter and the infusion of morphine and bupivacaine led to a pronounced pain relief within hours and the forearms could be removed from the cool water. The epidural infusion was continued for two weeks with slowly decreasing amounts of morphine and bupivacaine. During this time there was a marked improvement in both oedema and erythema.

The electromyographic response was monitored using train-of-four stimuli applied to the ulnar nerve. Neuromuscular block was induced by constant infusion of atracurium; the dose required for a 95% twitch depression was registered as ED95. The infusion rate was then adjusted to maintain a constant electromyographic response of the first twitch of 5 +\/- 1% for at least 30 minutes and the required dose of atracurium was recorded as DD95. The neuromuscular recovery was studied regarding T1 and T4-ratio. Data are given as medians (25%-\/75%-quartiles). The cumulative ED95 in underweight patients (0.34 (0.31\/0.48) mg\/kg) exceeded (P &lt; 0.05) those in normal (0.29 (0.26\/0.30) mg\/kg) and in overweight patients (0.22 (0.18\/0.26) mg\/kg). In contrast to calculations according to the normal weight (Mn) no difference in ED95 was seen between groups (normal: 0.29 (0.26\/0.30) mg\/kg Mn; underweight: 0.28 (0.26\/0.32) mg\/kg Mn; overweight: 0.31 (0.25\/0.32) mg\/kg Mn). The individual DD95 was best correlated with LBM (r = 0.465, p &lt; 0.01). In view of the difficulty of estimating LBM in routine clinical practice it is emphasized that DD95 correlates only slightly less with normal weight (r = 0.404, p &lt; 0.05). In spite of the variability of DD95 with regard to body weight, the recovery of neuromuscular transmission in the patients of the three groups is comparable.

The EEG was analysed topographically (17 electrodes) and quantitatively. As a typical effect of benzodiazepines, increases in electrical activity in the frequency band beta-1 of the power spectrum were observed, and could be demonstrated 10 minutes after oral application, mainly in the frontal and central parts of the cortex. Increases in the powerbands delta and theta indicated induction of sleep approximately 15-20 minutes after application and were not looked upon as an effect of the benzodiazepine exclusively. These increases were noticed first in the central, occipital and temporal areas and after 30 minutes in the frontal parts of the cortex. Flunitrazepam plus morphine showed qualitatively similar but quantitatively less pronounced results. Topographical differences were similar to the results of an application of flunitrazepam alone. The results demonstrate the importance of a topographical as well as quantitative evaluation in studies on complex interactions of sedative or narcotic drugs and their clinical effects on cerebral function. ","3071":"Electroencephalogram recordings have been advocated for assessment of changes in cerebral function during anaesthesia. Controversy exists on the specificity of EEG parameters indicating depth of anaesthesia, because cortical electrical activity is modulated not only by drugs but also by a variety of exogenous and endogenous stimuli. In clinical practice, EEG measures often fail to accurately predict anaesthetic depth since the effects of nociceptive stimulation on the EEG are still not well defined. Previous reports indicate that in anaesthetised patients sensory stimulation may induce a shift to a dominant EEG frequency with faster waves similar to patterns seen during emergence from anaesthesia under certain circumstances. This electrophysiological arousal (EEG desynchronisation) may be associated with clinical arousal phenomena such as movement and increases in haemodynamic and respiratory activity. However, the mechanism of arousal during emergence from anaesthesia may be quite different from arousal reactions induced by noxious stimulation. Recent studies indicate that surgical stimulation can induce increases in slow wave EEG-activity (\"reverse\" or \"paradoxical\" arousal) associated with clinical arousal phenomena. Stimulus related delta patterns also were observed after acoustical or painful stimulation in head injured patients. The occurrence of slow EEG wave patterns may be related to functional blockade of the ascending activating system of the brain stem. In contrast, slowing of the EEG is comparable to EEG changes seen with increasing concentrations of anaesthetics. This indicates the difficulty to discriminate arousal phenomena from drug effects using EEG monitoring alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","3072":"","3073":"The development of numerous modern anaesthetic technics and methods in the mid of the twenties and thirties, which had become a main topic of scientific interest in the German-speaking countries, is connected with the name of the surgeon Martin Kirschner.

The object of our study was to determine whether sufficient gas exchange can be ensured in patients with a massive stenosis of the respiratory tract applying the Superimposed High-Frequency-Jet-Ventilation (SHFJV) via the jet laryngoscope. Further, it was to be determined whether SHFJV can be applied for insertion of endoluminal stents into the tracheo-bronchial system. SHFJV was applied using the Bronchotron-ventilator (capable of generating simultaneous low frequency and high frequency jets) and the laryngoscope, basically a modified endoscopy tube permitting simultaneous application of two jet modes. SHFJV was performed in 14 patients (including 4 children) suffering from massive laryngeal stenosis and in further 12 patients with stenosis of the tracheo-bronchial system. In all patients total intravenous anaesthesia was performed. In the patients with laryngeal stenosis the average paO2 was 117.5 +\/- 43 mmHg, and the mean paCO2 47.3 +\/- 11.6 mmHg. In the patients with stenosis of the tracheo-bronchial system the mean paO2 was 125 +\/- 77 mmHg and the average paCO2 53.3 +\/- 18 mmHg. The SHFJV technique presents the possibility to ventilate the patients continuously for surgical procedures even with massive stenosis of the respiratory tract. The application of SHFJV via the jet laryngoscope not only enables the anaesthesist to ventilate this group of patients but also helps the surgeon and therefore results in more safety for the patient.

Monitoring usually includes radial artery and vena cava access routes, pulmonary artery catheters help to check on oxygen transport parameters and cardiac output. Echocardiography is a new feature to determine cardiac volumes and left ventricular function as well as possible regional ischaemia. Anaesthesia induction can be performed using thiopentone along with diazepam and opioids. In shocked patients ketamine helps to prevent further drop of blood pressure. Propofol can also be employed for maintenance of anaesthesia. For muscle relaxation succinylcholine is the agent of choice if crush intubation is necessary. Atracurium and vecuronium should be used according to their specific route of elimination, although there can be interaction with antibiotics or adrenergic blockers. To ventilate the patient a mixture of oxygen in air might be useful, since nitrous oxide might be determined to blood cell formation and may distend gas-containing cavities. With the aid of positive end expiratory pressure FiO2 should be kept at a minimum, respiratory rate and inspiratory-expiratory ratio can keep ventilation pressures within an acceptable range and ensure CO2 excretion. Volume losses will be replaced mainly with Ringer's lactate, of which it takes four times the amount of colloidal replacement solutions which have the side effects of blood-borne infection and anaphylaxis.

In this study we review the efficiency, complications and late follow-up results of minitracheotomy in a department of general surgery. Between 1987 and 1991 we prospectively included 152 intensive-care patients who received minitracheotomy. The average follow-up was 24.2 +\/- 6.1 (4-50) months. Endotracheal secretion could be sucked off significantly more often after mini-tracheotomy. The rate of endotracheal suction increased from 5.9 +\/- 4.5\/d to 18.4 +\/- 6.1\/d (p &lt; or = 0.01). The pulmonary gas exchange improved at the same time. PaO2 level of 78.9 +\/- 9.9 mmHg that decreased to critical values of 60.7 +\/- 8.9 mmHg, rose after minitracheotomy above the original levels. Although the PaCO2 level remained constant, a compensatory hyperventilation with a rate of 27.3 +\/- 6.9\/min was normalised by minitracheotomy.

","3106":"Development of acidosis is a prominent pathophysiological factor in acute cerebral disorders, such as ischaemia or severe brain trauma. The impairment of the acid-base state in brain parenchyma among others is involved in the development of brain oedema, eventually leading to irreversible damage of neurons and glial cells. In the present study the pathophysiological role of acidosis for cytotoxic cell swelling and damage of glial and neuronal cells was investigated in vitro under conditions found in the ischaemic penumbra in vivo--the still viable perifocal border zone surrounding an infarct with elevated interstitial K(+)- and H(+)-concentrations. Assessment of cell swelling by acidosis was combined with experiments on underlying mechanisms as a basis for therapeutical interventions to inhibit cytotoxic brain oedema in vivo. C6 glioma cells, astrocytes from primary culture, as well as Neuro-2A cells were cultivated, harvested and suspended as single cells under continuous control of pH, pO2, and temperature according to a standard procedure. Cell volume and cell viability were quantified by flow cytometry. Acidosis was induced by isotonic sulfuric- or lactic acid, respectively. Acidification of the medium led to cell swelling once pH fell below 7.0. Cell viability, however, was not affected by the increasing acidosis down to pH 6.2, while pH 5.6 or below was associated with cell death dependent on the duration of exposure. Acidosis-induced cell swelling was attenuated or completely inhibited by blocking of ion exchange mechanisms, such as the Na+\/H(+)-antiporter, or elimination of Na+ ions from the medium. The present results provide new information on the nature of cytotoxic cell swelling and damage in central nervous system by acidosis under consideration of underlying mechanisms. Accordingly, acidosis-induced cell swelling is attributable to activation of ion exchange mechanisms, such as the Na+\/H(+)- and Cl-\/HCO3(-)-antiporter, in order to maintain a normal cellular acid-base state. This compensation process, however, is associated with the loss of cell volume control by net uptake of osmotic active solutes. Consequently, cell swelling occurring under these conditions is a result of regulatory mechanisms to defend homoeostasis rather than a consequence of cytotoxic cell damage. If cell swelling is inhibited by appropriate treatment, care should be exercised not to enhance the vulnerability of the nerve and glial cells. ","3107":"Carotid endarterectomy has become a standard surgical procedure in the therapy of cerebrovascular insufficiency. An important consideration in this form of therapy is to maintain a low perioperative morbidity and mortality. In planning the procedure the two most frequent complications deserve special consideration. Thromboembolism is the major cause of new neurological deficits and prevention should be emphasized as therapeutic interventions are of limited value. The cardiovascular status needs special attention, since the long-term prognosis is predominantly influenced by concomitant coronary artery disease. Regional anaesthesia provides good cardiovascular stability and the chance to monitor neurological changes in an awake patient. Patient discomfort and limited control of vital functions are obviated by general anaesthesia raising the challenge of maintaining cardiovascular stability and establishing adequate cerebral monitoring. Both electroencephalography and somatosensory evoked potentials monitor cerebral function continuously and enable detection of cerebral ischaemia secondary to inadequate blood flow. Another continuous technique is transcranial Doppler sonography; this, however, does not monitor brain function and its role in carotid surgery is still under investigation. Carotid stump pressure or cerebral blood flow measurements provide intermittent data and should therefore only be used as an adjunct. The goal to find an approach that minimizes the risk for the individual patient can only be attained by close cooperation between anaesthesiologists and surgeons.","3108":"","3109":"","3110":"We report on a 31-year old pregnant patient with von-Hippel-Lindau syndrome who presented to the emergency room with symptoms of increased intracranial pressure.

Thus, inhaled NO is a potent and selective pulmonary vasodilator that may be useful for treatment of pulmonary hypertension of different aetiologies. However, the main danger of NO inhalation is spontaneous formation of toxic nitrogen dioxide (NO2) if NO is added to an oxygen-containing gas mixture. This chemical reaction depends on the time available for the oxidation and the concentration of NO and oxygen. The aim of this study was to assess in vitro the spontaneous formation of NO2 during administration of various NO concentrations with a ventilator. A modified ventilator system is described which can deliver NO within clinically relevant concentrations avoiding excessive formation of toxic NO2. The system was evaluated using an artificial lung. NO and NO2 concentrations were measured by chemiluminescence at the proximal and distal end of the inspiratory limb. In-vitro NO2 formation was assessed during administration of 10, 20, 40, 80 ppm NO while ventilating with an FiO2 of 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75, an inspiratory minute volume of 5, 7.5 and 10 l\/min (IMV) and a respiratory rate of 12\/min. NO2 concentration correlated with increasing FiO2 and NO concentration and was inversely correlated to IMV. While ventilating with 5-40 ppm NO, an FiO2 of 0.25-0.75 and an IMV of 10 l per minute, the NO2 formation was measured to be less than 0.2 ppm and thus not clinically relevant. During administration of 80 ppm NO the NO2 formation increased to 0.3-0.6 ppm. We conclude that for patients safety concentrations less than 80 ppm of inhaled NO should be used with this ventilator system. In addition, online monitoring of the NO2 concentration in the inspiratory limb should always be performed.

This experimental study was designed to investigate the influence of TNG on changes of systemic haemodynamics and coronary perfusion produced by i.v. administration of OR. 16 anesthetized closed-chest mongrel dogs were studied. Anaesthesia was administered using N2O\/O2 (FiO2: 0.33) and enflurane (1Vol%ET). Saline-filled catheters were used to measure intravascular pressures. Left ventricular pressure change (dP\/dt) was monitored with a cathetertip manometer. Cardiac output (CO) was determined using thermodilution, myocardial blood flow (MBF) using a Pitot catheter. Baseline values were taken (control) followed by a bolus injection of 0.03 U\/kg OR i.v. The dogs were randomly assigned to two groups. Group I (Gr.I) (n = 9) received OR only and group II (Gr.II) (n = 7) was treated by infusion of 4 mg\/kg.min TNG 7 to 30 min after injection of OR.

In both groups (Gr.I; Gr.II) OR produced significant changes in systolic (APS) (+29%; +32%) and diastolic (APD) (+47%; +37%) aortic pressure, cardiac index (CI) (-33%; -33%), peripheral vascular resistance (TPR) (+116%); +104%), stroke volume index (SVI) (-23%; -34%), ejection fraction (EF) (-29%; -29% endsystolic volume (ESV) (+39%; +45%) and left ventricular enddiastolic pressure (LVEDP) (+50%; +66%). Myocardial blood flow (MBF) was reduced by 30% and 29% respectively and coronary vascular resistance (CVR) was increased (+97%; +84%). Coronary venous O2 saturation (SO2cor) decreased to 19% and 20% resulting in high AVDO2cor. As compared to Gr.I the administration of TNG resulted in significant decreases of APS, APD, TPR, ESV and LVEDP close to control values. However, administration of TNG did not effect MBF, CVR, SO2cor and AVDO2cor. Systemic haemodynamic effects of OR include hypertension due to peripheral vasoconstriction and impaired cardiac performance resulting in reduced cardiac output with low EF, high ESV and LVEDP. Concomitantly, OR produces coronary constriction with a distinct fall in MBF. Thus, myocardial oxygen balance is impaired. With TNG peripheral vascular effects of OR can be abolished but there is no effect of TNG on OR-induced reduction of coronary blood flow. Therefore, use of TNG for treatment of cardiovascular complications following the administration of OR must be considered with extreme caution.

There are only speculative approaches concerning the pathogenesis and the risk factors of these complications. The aim of our study was therefore to determine the causative factors and to evaluate the diagnostic and therapeutic measures, because early diagnosis and immediate treatment is essential for the outcome of the patients. 500 consecutive patients who underwent cardiopulmonary bypass procedures over a period of 14 months were examined for intra-abdominal complications. The records of these patients were reviewed in relation to possible risk factors and the group with intra-abdominal complications was compared with a random sample of 50 patients in respect of possible risk factors. The diagnostic procedures (serum lactate concentrations, sigmoidoscopy, coloscopy) and the therapeutic interventions were also evaluated. 9 (1.8%) of the 500 patients developed intra-abdominal complications. The mortality rate was 44% (4 of 9). 5 patients had bowel necrosis or ischaemic colitis. Pseudo-obstruction appeared in 5 cases. One patient developed cholecystitis and one acute haemorrhagic pancreatitis. Gastroduodenal complications were not observed. There was no difference between the group with intra-abdominal complications and the random sample with regard to sex, type of operation and preoperative intra-abdominal diseases. Clinical risk factors identified were: age, occlusive vascular disease, atrial fibrillation, prolonged aortic cross-clamping times and mean bypass times, intraoperative and postoperative need for supply of epinephrine and norepinephrine, implantation of an intraaortic balloon counterpulsation pump, low cardiac output, postoperative multiple organ failure. 8 out of the 9 patients had severe intraoperative surgical complications or general complications in the postoperative course. All patients with bowel necrosis or ischaemic colitis had abnormal serum lactate concentrations. With the aid of sigmoidoscopy in one patient, only bowel necrosis or ischaemic colitis could be detected. In one patient with pseudoobstruction, an operation was probably obviated by decompression of the colon by coloscopy. 6 of the 500 patients after cardiopulmonary bypass required emergency laparotomy. Two patients with bowel necrosis were saved by early hemicolectomy. In reviewing both our results and data cited in earlier studies, intra-abdominal complications can generally be attributed to the following: Intraoperative surgical complications with the consequence of prolonged aortic cross clamping and total bypass times can cause low cardiac output and mesenteric hypoperfusion. Predominantly as a result of the low cardiac output, the use of vasopressors increases splanchnic ischaemia, in particular in patients with pre-existing occlusive vascular disease of the mesenteric arteries. Mucosal ischaemia might be aggravated by a concurrent pseudo-obstruction. On the other hand, intraoperative complications and low cardiac output can cause further complications and finally multiple organ failure. Multiple organ failure and ischaemia of the gut can initiate the vicious circle which is responsible for the high mortality from these complications. Early detection by careful physical examination and the combination of the diagnostic procedures and prompt treatment should lead to a reduction of mortality.

Relaxometry was performed by electrical stimulation of the ulnar nerve proximal of the wrist and the evoked EMG was recorded above the hypothenar muscle (Relaxograph, supplied by Datex). Immediately after induction of anaesthesia the calibration of the device was performed. The calibration of the relaxograph could be performed successfully only in 57.1% of the diabetics compared to 93.2% of the non-diabetics (p &lt; 0.001). Consequently the uncalibrated mode had to be chosen more often in diabetics than in non-diabetics. In two non-diabetics and three diabetics no stimulation response could be achieved. Biometrical data, serum electrolyte concentrations, wrist circumference and body temperature were similar in both groups. The calibration mode could be performed in diabetics without peripheral polyneuropathy more often (76.5%) than in diabetics with peripheral polyneuropathy (38.9%) (p &lt; 0.05). The results show that the applicability of the peripheral nerve stimulator in diabetic patients is more difficult than in non-diabetics. The disturbances of the peripheral nervous system seem to be responsible for these problems.

Due to the continuous or phasic secretion of catecholamines from the tumour, patients present with hypertensive crisis, episodic or sustained hypertension or arrhythmia. Excessive intraoperative hypertension unable to control by usual methods should be considered to be a phaeochromocytoma. Surgical removal of identified lesions should be performed under controlled conditions and after sufficient preparation of the patient. Preoperative alpha-adrenergic blockade with prazosin and phentolamine allows an increase in intravascular volume and affords some protection against excessive intraoperative hypertension. The use of beta-adrenergic antagonists is only recommended in patients with arrhythmia (especially tachycardia) and after induction of alpha-adrenergic blockade. For operation of phaeochromocytoma, modified neuroleptic anaesthesia is a useful anaesthetic technique. Intraoperative hypertension is controlled with sodium nitroprusside and phentolamine. Intravascular volume is substituted under CVP or PAP control, and epinephrine or norepinephrine are used if necessary. During the postoperative period, hypotension or hypertension or left ventricular failure may occur. In an own study, 9 patients with phaeochromocytoma were investigated, 7 patients with other operations of the adrenal glands served as controls. Despite specific preoperative preparation and intraoperative use of antihypertensive drugs, excessive increases in blood pressure could not be avoided in some cases. Extremely high plasma levels of catecholamines up to the factor 1,000 of the normal range were found.

The study was approved by the local Medical Ethics Committee and patients' informed written consent was obtained. After induction of anaesthesia (midazolam, fentanyl, etomidate and pancuronium) all patients received either halothane 1 MAC (group I, n = 10) or isoflurane 1 MAC (group II, n = 10), followed 20 min later by enoximone 0.5 mg\/kg. Haemodynamic variables were measured and blood samples (arterial, mixed venous) were obtained before the administration of the volatile anaesthetics (control, t0), immediately (t1) and 5 (t2) min after steady state conditions with halothane or isoflurane, as verified by the end-expiratory concentration and 5 (t3) and 10 (t4) min after the injection of enoximone. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and right atrial pressure were recorded. Cardiac (CI) and stroke volume indices, systemic (SVR) and pulmonary vascular resistance, oxygen availability (AO2) oxygen consumption and oxygen extraction rate were calculated using standard formulae. In both groups HR remained essentially unchanged throughout the investigation period. MAP decreased significantly in both groups under steady state conditions with the volatile anaesthetics (group I: 19%; group II: 30%) but remained unchanged after subsequent injection of enoximone. After administration of halothane SVR remained essentially unchanged, whereas isoflurane decreased SVR significantly by 20%. After enoximone, there was a significant decrease in SVR in both groups (group I: 26%; group II: 25% compared with the values obtained after halothane and isoflurane respectively). Halothane and isoflurane decreased CI significantly and to a similar degree (group I: 17%; group II: 17%). After the injection of enoximone CI increased significantly and reached control values in both groups. AO2 decreased significantly after administration of the volatile anaesthetics (group I: 19%; group II: 21%) and increased significantly after administration of enoximone, returning to control values. Halothane (7%) and isoflurane (13%) produced a significant increase in oxygen extraction. After bolus injection of enoximone oxygen extraction decreased significantly and returned to control value in group II. In group I enoximone decreased oxygen extraction significantly compared with control. Our results suggest that in the presence of halothane or isoflurane the phosphodiesterase inhibitor enoximone produces a comparable increase in cardiac output and decrease in systemic vascular resistance in patients with coronary artery disease.

The epidemiological data were gathered as a contribution to a current project of the German Society for Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care. Preoperative data (age, sex, preexisting diseases, pathological findings, grade of urgency and ASA-class) were integrated in a paper record, as well as the perioperative interventions and directly postoperative events, type of anaesthesia, and kind of operation. The automatically readable paper records were routinely in use for every patient. After control and correction the data were stored in a modern data base. From October 1, 91 to May 20, 92 11,890 anaesthesias were recorded. 2,959 of them with a total of 4,184 PECs. 2,397 PECs were cardiovascular, 875 respiratory. PECs of grade I (no impact on treatment in the recovery room [RR]) occurred in 14% of patients, grade II (impact on treatment in RR, but no impact on discharge to ward) 7.2%, grade III (prolonged stay in RR or special monitoring in the ward) 2.88%; grade IV (PEC leads to transfer to the ICU) 0.63%, and grade V (PEC leads to disabling damage or death) 0.13%. 13 of 15 patients suffering from PECs grade V were of ASA class 4 or 5. PECs had a certain relation to the ASA-classification of anaesthetic risk. But this relation is quite different in several surgical disciplines. Preoperatively known risk factors of the patient and the measures taken by specialists of various disciplines contribute to the incidence of PECs. Available data could be processed multicentrally and in standard form for producing prognostic data for risk prediction. Since PECs of grade II or higher are cost- relevant, requiring an interdisciplinary approach, it appears meaningful to base costing on such an interdisciplinary approach in accordance with the requirements of diagnosis and treatment. ","3158":"In intensive-care medicine, score systems serve to quantify the severity of diseases and to characterise patient groups on the basis of objective criteria. The principle is to describe the severity by adding up points. Objectives are to assess the prognosis, to establish the amount of treatment required and assist in clinical decision making. The most important examples of general scores covering more than one disease are Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE-II, APACHE-III), Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) and Mortality Prediction Model (MPM). General scores assess the deviation of physiological parameters from the normal assuming that the degree of deviation reflects the severity of the disease. The Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System (TISS) constitutes a particular form which evaluates exclusively the amount of therapy required. Disease-specific scores (trauma scores, sepsis scores) take into account the fact that the nature and stage of specific disease determine the outcome in a typical way. Scores are adequately validated and suitable for evaluation of clinical studies or cost-benefit analyses by characterisation of patient populations. The use of score systems for individual prognosis is at present controversial. Their clinical significance might increase in that scores help to make medical decisions by contributing to early identification of endangered patients by systematic establishment and evaluation of investigation results.

An actual indication for reconstructive vascular surgical intervention had been excluded in all patients. The sympatholytic efficacy, different haemodynamic variables, the relief of rest pain and the effect on ischaemic ulcers were quantified before, 3 and 21 days after CLS. The mean intensity of rest pain, as assessed on a visual analogue scale (0-100 mm), significantly decreased from 60 mm to 31 and 34 mm, respectively. 9 of 12 patients with ischaemic ulcers showed partial or complete remission within the study period. Overall, in 88% of patients sympathetic denervation could be demonstrated by ablation of the sympatho-galvanic skin response. The mean difference in skin temperature between the treated and the untreated leg significantly increased from -0.73 degrees C to +0.34 and +0.39 degrees C, respectively. Doppler-sonographic measurements of the ankle-pressure-index showed a minor increase from 0.34 to 0.36 and 0.42; however, these changes did not reach significance. Neither changes of the different physiologic variables nor data of the patient history could predict the relief of rest pain after CLS. The only side effect of CLS was transient neuralgia of the genitofemoral nerve occurring in 19% of patients.

The patients were premedicated with flunitrazepam 2 hours before the investigation. Two intravenous cannulas were inserted in veins of forearm or back of the hand. One cannula was only used for the application of etomidate and removed immediately after injection. General anaesthesia was induced with 0.3 mg\/kg etomidate at an injection rate of 20 mg\/30 s. If the patient did not complain of pain or other sensations during injection spontaneously, he was questioned for 15 s after beginning of injection. The arm used for application of etomidate was kept free of any manipulation during the operation and the following five postoperative days. There were marked differences between the two etomidate preparations concerning venous irritation. About 20% of the patients receiving the hypnotic in propylene glycol complained spontaneously of pain on injection, whereas none with the lipid emulsion. No difference was found in the incidence of myoclonic movements. The time interval between the beginning of injection and loss of eyelid closure reflex was about 50 s and not different for the two galenic formulations. Blood pressure during and after induction of anaesthesia did not differ. The heart rate in the group of patients with etomidate in lipid emulsion was slightly increased before and immediately after intubation compared to the propylene glycol group. 4% of the patients in the propylene glycol group suffered from postoperative venous complications as reddening, swelling, induration or pain. These complications could not be seen in the lipid emulsion group.

The difficulties in correctly diagnosing catheter-related infections and the necessity to remove the device in case of suspected infection require preventive measures in the first place. Most authors stress the importance of strict aseptic catheter management. Nevertheless, there may still be a high incidence of catheter-related infections. Moreover, this problem is potentiated by the increasing use of intravascular devices. The current infection rates may be reduced by instituting novel preventive measures, e.g., decontamination of carriers using the anti-staphylococcal agent mupirocin. Another approach aims at inhibiting the adhesion of bacteria to intravascular catheters by modifying these catheters with antimicrobial agents. Newer studies show that impregnation of catheters with the antiseptic substances silver-sulphadiazine and chlorhexidine is effective in reducing bacterial colonisation of the catheters. A pilot study on intensive-care patients demonstrated a significant reduction in catheter-related infections and bacteraemia by impregnated catheters.

Twenty-five consecutive patients who received inhalation anaesthesia with isoflurane, N2O\/O2, and vecuronium during elective neurosurgical procedures were studied. Whenever intraoperative \"curare clefts\" appeared in the capnogram, diaphragm activity was measured and a simultaneous relaxogram of the adductor pollicis muscle was recorded. After every such event, vecuronium was readministered for complete relaxation. A deformation of the capnogram was registered in 17\/25 patients and in all instances (51\/51) was caused by diaphragm activity. The deformation disappeared after renewed relaxation and was therefore a reliable indicator of spontaneous breathing. However, it did not correlate with the degree of relaxation of peripheral muscles, because diaphragm activity was present during all degrees of peripheral relaxation, but could also be absent even after complete recovery of neuromuscular transmission.

Spinal anaesthesia was performed with the patients in the sitting position at L3-4 interspace. In the CS group CSF was aspirated via the catheter to check its correct position, and initially 0.5 ml of hyperbaric 5% lidocaine were injected. 0.25 ml boli at 5 min intervals were repeated as often as necessary to reach the desired sensory blockade up to the T10 segment. In patients undergoing the single-shot technique 1.5 to 3.5 ml of hyperbaric 0.5% bupivacaine was injected. After performing the block, haemodynamic parameters were assessed for 20 minutes at 2 min intervals, before and thereafter at 5 min intervals. The required time for recovery of motor activity of the legs was assessed postoperatively. The patients were visited on the 1st, 3rd and 5th postoperative day and asked about possible headache. The CoSPAN spinal catheter was easy to handle. CSF could be aspirated via this catheter within 33.1 +\/- 7.6 seconds.

Fractionated injection of the local anesthetic via a spinal catheter was more precise in achieving the desired maximum cephalad spread than SS.

","3195":"Intraoperative awareness, and especially the perception of auditory stimuli occur occasionally under general anaesthesia with high-dose opioids. Mid-latency auditory evoked potentials (MLAEP) reflect the primary cortical processing of auditory stimuli. Hence, we studied the effects of fentanyl on MLAEP. Institutional approval and informed consent was obtained in 20 patients scheduled for cardiac surgery. Anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl (10 micrograms\/kg every 7[ up to a total dosage of 50 micrograms\/kg). Auditory evoked potentials were recorded before and 5[ after every fentanyl dose on vertex (positive) and mastoids on both sides (negative). Auditory clicks were presented binaurally at 70 dBnHL at a rate of 9.3 Hz. Using the electrodiagnostic system Pathfinder I (Nicolet), 1000 successive stimulus responses were averaged over a 100 ms post-stimulus interval and analysed off-line. Latencies of the peak V, Na, Pa, Nb P1 and amplitudes Na\/Pa, Pa\/Nb, Nb\/P1 were measured. V belongs to the brainstem generated potentials, which demonstrates that auditory stimuli were correctly transduced. Na, Pa, Nb, P1 are generated in the primary auditory cortex of the temporal lobe and are the electrophysiological correlate of the primary cortical processing of the auditory stimuli. By means of a Fast-Fourier transformation power spectra of the AEP were calculated. In the awake state AEP peak latencies were in the normal range. Power spectra indicated high energy in the 30-40 Hz frequency range. During increasing dosages of fentanyl the brainstem response V was stable. P1 increased in latency and Nb\/P1 decreased in amplitude after 10 micrograms\/kg of fentanyl significantly. The primary cortical potentials Na, Pa, Nb changed only very slightly in latencies or amplitudes even under highest doses of fentanyl (50 micrograms\/kg) and could be identified like in the awake patients. In the power spectra high energy persisted in the 30 Hz frequency range. MLAEP and especially the primary cortical potentials Na, Pa, Nb did not change markedly in amplitude or latency during high-dose fentanyl analgesia. There is no dose-dependent effect of fentanyl on MLAEP as it can be observed under volatile anaesthetics (isoflurane, enflurane). The primary cortical processing of auditory stimuli can be completely blocked by volatile anaesthetics, but is still preserved under highest doses of fentanyl.

The present study was designed to investigate the cardiovascular effects of atracurium with special regard to the reactions in younger adults and in elderly patients. 20 patients, ASA class I-II, who underwent a neurosurgical operation (posterior fossa surgery) were studied. The patients were divided into two groups including patients below (group A) and above (group B) 65 years of age. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol (2.5 mg\/kg) and maintained with a Propofol\/O2\/N2O sequence. Under steady state conditions with propofol every patient received 0.5 mg\/kg atracurium besylate. Haemodynamic parameters were recorded and plasma concentrations of epinephrine and norepinephrine were determined before (control) and 2, 5 and 10 minutes after the injection of the neuromuscular blocking agent. All measurements were performed before surgical stimulation in supine position. In the younger adults diastolic blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance decreased significantly 2 minutes after injection of atracurium and reached control level 5 minutes after application of the muscle relaxant. In the elderly patients peripheral vascular resistance decreased significantly after 5 minutes and returned to control 10 minutes after the application of atracurium. In both groups cardiac index, systolic and mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure and the parameters related to the pulmonary circulation were not affected. Plasma concentrations of epinephrine and norepinephrine remained essentially unchanged. Side effects due to a release of histamine such as facial or body blush or bronchial spasms were not noted. Since the results of the present study suggest that haemodynamic reactions in younger adults and in the elderly are rare, atracurium can be recommended for neuromuscular blockade in elderly patients under propofol anaesthesia. ","3197":"Since mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) depends on O2-supply and O2-consumption, its measurement is said to indicate tissue O2-balance and to be suitable for ensuring tissue oxygenation in critically ill patients. Blood for SvO2 determinations should be drawn exclusively from the pulmonary artery, because mixing of systemic venous blood is incomplete in the right atrium and ventricle. SvO2 can be determined in vitro and in vivo. Current in vivo techniques determine oxygen saturation from the relation between light emitted into the blood stream and that reflected from blood cells, the use of 3 instead of 2 wavelengths greatly improving the accuracy of the method. For reasonable interpretation of SvO2 it is necessary to consider the concentration of haemoglobin and its derivatives, shifts of the O2-dissociation curve, intracardiac left-to-right shunts, and systemic arteriovenous shunts. Disturbances of macrocirculation (e.g. vascular surgery) and microcirculation (e.g. sepsis) also impair the diagnostic value of SvO2 determinations. The critical value of SvO2 appears to depend on the prevailing disease. Patients with chronically impaired O2 transport appear to tolerate very low SvO2 values better than acutely ill patients, presumably due to adaptive changes in the former group. Central venous oxygen saturation may indicate directional changes of the SvO2, but does not estimate the real SvO2-value. The hypothesis that continuous SvO2 measurements improve prognosis or lower treatment costs has not yet been confirmed. Measurements of mixed venous oxygen saturation may improve monitoring and treatment of critically ill patients in selected cases; however, these measurements are not suitable to indicate reliably the status of tissue oxygenation under all conditions.","3198":"","3199":"","3200":"The case of a patient with abdominal crisis and shock without any discernible origin who died 36 hours after hospital admission despite maximal therapy is described.

A \"multipurpose\" pulmonary artery catheter permits both atrial and ventricular sensing and pacing. Noninvasive transcutaneous cardiac pacing is safe, fast, and easily applicable. However, pain and discomfort from cutaneous nerve or muscle stimulation may be intolerable for unsedated patients. Transoesophageal cardiac pacing is usually successful only for atrial stimulation, e.g., in sinus node bradycardia, but is not indicated in patients with impaired AV-conduction. In patients with implanted pacemakers, temporary cardiac pacing can both impair or improve the haemodynamic situation. Implanted pacemakers should always be checked following surgery involving electrocautery. Preoperatively, rate-responsive pacemakers should be re-programmed so as to avoid activation of the rate-responsive function. Automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillators should be deactivated to avoid delivery of inappropriate shocks. In patients with implanted epicardial patch electrodes, transthoracic defibrillation can be difficult with routine defibrillation protocols and may require positioning of the paddles on the lateral chest wall. However, emergency noninvasive transcutaneous cardiac pacing is possible in such patients with normal thresholds.","3211":"","3212":"The aim of this study was to monitor accelographically the impact of atracurium (A) and\/or vecuronium (V) on intubation anaesthesia in infants and\/or children for elective surgery or minor short-term surgery. An intra-individual evaluation is valid even though a very practical but less established monitoring method is used. Infants receiving a \"priming\"-dose of V 0.01 mg kg-1 BW or A 0.05 mg kg-1 BW followed 3 minutes later by a main dose of V 0.04 mg kg-1 BW or A 0.2 mg kg-1 BW were found to be in good or even very good intubation condition. These minimal doses afforded very short relaxation times, which are next in line to succinylcholin. A combination of V and A in the \"priming\"-technique did not lead to better conditions of any clinical relevance. Medium range non-depolarising muscle blockers, as they are available to the pediatric anesthetist nowadays, seem to compare favourable with the use of succinylcholin, which is to be considered an obsolete drug due to its various side effects.","3213":"","3214":"","3215":"A twenty-nine-year-old man suffering from Franceschetti syndrome requiring a retinal detachment operation was successfully anaesthetised using the laryngeal mask airway. The laryngeal mask has many advantages compared to endotracheal intubation in patients suffering from craniofacial abnormalities i.e. hypoplasia of the mandibular bone and ventral position of the larynx. In these cases the laryngeal mask is easily placed. However, the facilities of fibreoptic bronchoscopy should be readily available. The physician should have gained confidence in using a laryngeal mask before employing this device in cases of difficult intubation.","3216":"A 90-year-old cardiopulmonary high-risk patient had to undergo a laparatomy due to a perforated ulcus ventriculi. Postoperatively he developed pulmonary insufficiency due to an atelectasis of the upper right pulmonary region. The clinical situation deteriorated because of dyspnoea and exhaustion. Conservative therapy failed. Atelectasis was overcome by a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) inserted without relaxation and anaesthesia. The LMA enabled CPAP-training for 45 minutes added by inflation of the lung up to a peak airway pressure of 22 cm H2O. Problems and risks of this unconventional use are discussed. Reintubation involving the necessity of relaxation and anaesthesia could be avoided by this unconventional use of a LMA. This case report confirms the good tolerance and easy handling of the LMA. It demonstrates a further application of the LMA, which is not only a new device but a new idea of airway management.","3217":"","3218":"Pulse oximetric monitoring in air rescue service (rescue helicopter) is primarily influenced by motion artifacts (especially those of a passive nature), by low perfusion and by the problem of probe dislocation. In a prospective study involving 162 unselected emergency patients treated by the medical team of the emergency helicopter service \"Christoph 22\" (Ulm), we studied the possibility of reducing these adverse factors by applying available state-of-the-art technology, such as ECG-synchronization and adhesive probes. By applying the thus modified methods of monitoring, the interference factor was reduced to S = 0.056, that is only 5.6% of measurement time was adversely effected. The increase in measurement stability resulted from the reduction in number of described artifacts (motion artifacts and low perfusion), as well as from the reduction in duration of interfered measurement time. ECG-synchronization very effectively influenced the passive motion artifacts. Their frequency was reduced by the factor 8.2, respectively 42. An effective reduction in number of probe dislocations can be achieved by applying adhesive probes. The high costs of such probes presently limits their application. Radiation can be eliminated by redesigning the probe. ECG-synchronization of pulse oximetric signal has proved to be a method to reduce the artifacts frequently experienced in air rescue and has considerably contributed to the increase of emergency patient safety.","3219":"40 patients who had undergone total hip replacement were included in a randomised prospective study. Postoperative pain management was performed with a continuous 3-in-1 block combined with demand-adapted intravenous meperidine titration (3-in-1 catheter group; n = 20) or by demand-adapted intravenous meperidine titration alone (control group; n = 20). The 3-in-1 catheter was placed before the start of anesthesia, and the patients received 30 ml 0.5% bupivacaine via this catheter. A second dose of 30 ml 0.5% bupivacaine was injected 10 min after postanaesthetic recovery. In the control group intravenous meperidine titration was initiated if the patients required pain relief. Subjective pain intensity was evaluated over a 6-hour period by means of the visual analogue scale. Bupivacaine plasma concentrations were determined in 18 patients at 30, 60, 120, and 180 min after the first postoperative injection of bupivacaine. Good pain control was achieved in both groups. The patients in the control group required a mean of 80.8 +\/- 49.9 mg meperidine. The 3-in-1 block group required significantly less meperidine (54.3 +\/- 44.5 mg). Mean bupivacaine plasma levels ranged between 0.75 and 1.33 micrograms\/ml. Placement of the 3-in-1 catheters was without complications. For the management of postoperative pain following total hip replacement a continuous 3-in-1 block alone was often insufficient but postoperative meperidine requirements were significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.05). Toxic bupivacaine plasma concentrations were not measured.","3220":"19 patients in whom cardiopulmonary bypass (cpb) was performed during different types of cardiac operations, developed myocardial failure which remained refractory to inotropic support with increasing doses of adrenaline, dopamine and dobutamine, so that it was impossible to discontinue cpb. After changing the therapeutic approach to a new regime consisting of adrenaline, dopamine and enoximone, low-output syndrome (LCOS) could be successfully reversed in 12 of the 19 patients. In the 7 remaining patients blood pressure dropped in a clinically relevant way under treatment with enoximone. 5 of these patients needed intraaortic balloon pumping (IABP) inspite of the application of enoximone, before cpb could be successfully discontinued. In three patients receiving enoximone, persisting ventricular tachyarrhythmia appeared under treatment, and disappeared after discontinuation of the drug. One patient needed IABP and left heart bypass by means of the centrifugal pump before cpb could be duly discontinued. One patient died intraoperatively due to untreatable right ventricular failure and inability to discontinue cpb. It is concluded that enoximone represents a useful drug in a significant number of patients developing heart failure refractory to inotropic support, on emerging from cpb during cardiac surgery.","3221":"Since November 1990 until January 1993, the laryngeal mask airway was employed for 1925 general anaesthesias, i.e. 19.6% of all general anaesthesias in our hospital. On the basis of the protocols the age distribution of the patients, the practice of anaesthesia (premedication with oral benzodiazepines, induction with thiopental, anaesthesia sustained with enflurane\/nitrous oxide\/oxygen) and the complications are reported. The complications not directly related to the laryngeal mask were: hypotension (5.92%), dysrhythmias (3.17%) and hypertensive states (1.71%). Other complications directly related to the laryngeal mask (bronchospasm, laryngospasm, difficult insertion of the mask, intraoperative vomiting) were less than 1.3% each. One aspiration was recorded, but could not be attributed to the laryngeal mask. Complications with major influence on the postoperative course and hospital stay were not seen.","3222":"Back pain is a common disease causing tremendous costs for treatment, rehabilitation, litigation and work-loss. The reasons for back pain vary considerably and are often not clear. The effectiveness of current treatment concepts like epidural injection of steroids, blocks of facet joints, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and antidepressants has not been proven. In accordance with literature, only multimodal concepts of treatment seem to be more successful as they consider somatic, psychosocial, and sports physiological aspects.","3223":"The laryngeal mask which was developed by Brain in 1981 and described for the first time in 1983 has been employed worldwide a million times since 1989. Traditionally, all anaesthesiologists are oriented towards the techniques of conventional mask anaesthesia or endotracheal intubation. This new alternative, however, amazes by its easy handling and its concept: insertion of the mask directly onto the larynx without irritating it and sealing the pharynx at the same time thus allowing sufficient ventilation. On the one hand, the laryngeal mask does not even fail in desperate cases of \"can't intubate-can't ventilate\", on the other hand, the new \"old\" problem reappears to the anaesthesiologist used to endotracheal intubation: mask anaesthesia and aspiration--a discussion which needs to be continued in case of the laryngeal mask. This is also true for the use of the laryngeal mask in emergency medicine and resuscitation. However, cases of difficult intubation may be greatly facilitated. All users appreciate the reliability of the laryngeal mask in daily routine even though some fear that more difficult and safer techniques of anaesthesia might be forgotten. The indications of the laryngeal mask expand rapidly at the moment and the fast trend in its spread might continue if this method is not discredited by violations of its contraindications: full stomach, extreme obesity and low compliance of the lungs.","3224":"","3225":"","3226":"","3227":"","3228":"The introduction of pulse oximetric monitoring in prehospital emergency medicine considerably contributed to emergency patients' safety, stability and protection. As inherent in any method of measurement, certain factors can interfere with it and limit its practical application. The emergency helicopter service at Ulm, in a prospective study involving 400 patients, systematically collected data on these limiting factors and evaluated them. The index \"S\" was established to quantify the time lost due to malfunctioning. Within the study group, the index average was S = 0.269, that is 26.9% of measurement time was subject to interference. The major cause was motion artifacts (68%) sensor probe dislocation (15%), low perfusion (14%) and radiation (3%). Regarding the volume of time lost due to specific interfering factors, motion artifacts (61.8%) and low perfusion (25.5%) were dominant, followed by sensor probe dislocation (10.3%) and radiation (2.4%). Interference therefore, both in time and frequency was primarily due to motion artifacts and low perfusion. The conclusions from this study led to the evaluation of two methods by which the interfering factors could be reduced: 1. ECG-synchronisation of the pulse oximetric signal; 2. The use of adhesive sensors.--The degree of increase in pulse oximetric measurement stability achieved by these two methods will be investigated in part 2 of this study.","3229":"In a clinical trial, the influence of repeated intermittent prone position on pulmonary gas exchange was investigated in 6 patients with severe ARDS. Despite various intra- and interindividual differences, oxygenation index (calculated by the paO2:FiO2 ratio) was improved significantly by change from supine to prone position in the first two days of treatment, whereas paCO2 remained unchanged. Later on, a significant improvement of oxygenation could not be verified. In patients with proven or presumed densities of dorsal lung regions, body position changes from supine to prone position in the early phase of treatment may improve arterial oxygenation and may be regarded as a therapeutic principle in conventional ARDS treatment.","3230":"No studies are available so far on the way dying and death in the ICU are perceived by relatives of the patients. It is also not clear in how far the current criticism of intensive care medicine stems from these relatives. These problems were investigated by sending a self-developed 48-item questionnaire to relatives of patients who had died in the ICU. The questions centred on the following subjects: Communication and information structures Perception of the ICU and emotional reaction Assessment of treatment Dying and death in the ICU. Of 181 questionnaires distributed, 145 (85.3%) were returned. We present the replies of the 109 persons who visited their relatives in the ICU. The majority regarded themselves as well informed. Initial impressions were a high technical and medical standard. Emotional reactions to ICU treatment of a relative alternated between anxiety and hope with the dominant impression that the patient received the best possible therapy. However, the treatment was not perceived as an artificial prolongation of life. Although death loses dignity in the ICU according to those questioned, dying in peace does seem possible in this situation. The high response rate, the positive general assessment and the critical view of death in the ICU are discussed in the following.","3231":"The plasmatic albumin concentration (3.5-4.5 g\/dl) represents about 60% of the total plasma protein. Only 25-40% of whole albumin belongs to the intravascular pool, the majority is distributed in the interstitial space especially of the skin. Main physiological effects of plasmatic albumin are the control of the plasmatic volume by preservation of the colloid oncotic pressure (COP) and the plasmatic transport including the binding of drugs. The COP is the main factor for fixation of the intravascular volume and the prevention of interstitial oedema. The acute volume effects of albumin can be totally replaced by synthetic colloids like hydroxyethyl starch, gelatine, and dextran, with the exception of volume substitution in neonates. In intensive care medicine, the COP-effects of albumin can almost be replaced by synthetic colloids as well. A positive COP-effect by administration of human or synthetic macromolecules is unlikely in patients with capillary leak. For therapy control, the direct measurement of COP is superior to the calculation derived from albumin or total protein. The global clinical situation of the patient and the course of haematocrit should be respected as well. For prevention of interstitial pulmonary oedema, a COP of 15-20 mmHg should be achieved. Up to now, no clinical study verified a positive effect of albumin substitution regarding outcome or incidence of complications in intensive-care patients. Thus, an albumin therapy to maintain a COP of 15-20 mmHg in intensive-care patients is only recommended if a capillary leak is unlikely and the dose limits of synthetic colloids are attained.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","3232":"","3233":"","3234":"A 53-year-old woman was scheduled for elective surgery of a L4-L5 lumbar disc prolapse. Preoperatively, she reported of a hereditary muscle disease in her family which could be identified as familial hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis. In patients with familial periodic paralysis, only limited information is available in the current anaesthesiological literature. This is especially true of the hyperkalaemic form which was separated from the hypokalaemic form in 1957. Most patients suffering from periodic paralysis will develop myotonic symptoms in time, but evidence is lacking that the incidence of malignant hyperthermia (MH) is higher than in normals. However, abnormalities of the electrocardiogram (ECG) due to changes in the potassium serum levels are not unusual, and the anaesthesiologist must be aware of cardiac arrhythmias. In the present case, the patient was anaesthetized using fentanyl, midazolam, and vecuronium, and ventilated with 66% nitrous oxide in oxygen. Radial artery blood pressure, end-tidal CO2, and nasopharyngeal temperature were monitored continuously. Surgery was completed after 2 hours with no abnormalities in the intraoperative course. Recovery from anaesthesia was uneventful. During the postoperative follow-up for 1 week, further attacks of paralysis, intermittent sodium-potassium imbalance of the muscle cell membrane appears to be the primary pathogenetic factor. In this special disease, prevention of carbohydrate depletion and the avoidance of muscle relaxants are recommended in the anaesthesiological literature. However, a specified regimen of general anaesthesia has not yet been outlined. In our special case, the use of anaesthetics deemed to be safe in MH susceptible patients produced an uneventful perioperative course.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","3235":"The development of local anaesthesia is connected with the name of Carl Ludwig Schleich, a Berlin surgeon. His method, the so-called \"infiltration anaesthesia\", did not receive due attention from his surgeon colleagues right from the beginning. This, however, was partly a fault of Schleich himself. The initial restraint, however, changed within a few years and became soon known as the \"first great medical feat in the discipline of German surgery\". At the same time, the fact that he had been rejected in the beginning was criticised as a \"disgrace for surgery\". Schleich experienced the same ignorance and refusal when he demanded that only specially trained physicians should perform any kind of anaesthesia. Moreover, these specialists should be responsible for the training of younger colleagues, a revolutionary concept at that time in Germany. Unfortunately, all these ideas and efforts of Schleich to develop a new concept of anaesthesia techniques have fallen into oblivion, a concept that started with his \"infiltration anaesthesia\" 100 years ago.","3236":"","3237":"","3238":"A patient is presented who developed pulmonary artery embolism and thrombocytopenia with various arterial clots several days after an ankle joint osteosynthesis, which finally caused the amputation of the right arm.

Laboratory investigations showed an antibody (IgG) induced thrombopenia mediated by all low molecular weight and unfractionated heparins. By eliminating heparin and further treatment with a low molecular weight heparinoid (ORG 10,172), platelet count rose sufficiently and thrombotic process ceased completely.

In the therapy group the endotracheal colonisation with ps. aeruginosa was significantly lower between the 4th and 14th day (p &lt; 0.05). The incidence of secondary pneumonia was reduced from 42% to 17.5% (not significant). Systemic administration of antibiotics, e.g. of aminoglycosides, was significantly more often necessary in the control group. No increasing of growth of fungi in the upper respiratory tract was observed, but these was a non-significantly higher incidence mainly of staph. epidermidis. The application of 80 mg tobramycin four times a day as an aerosol was well tolerated by the patients. Under there conditions, tobramycin could not be measured in the serum. No allergic reactions, increased respiratory pressures or bronchoconstrictions were observed.","3248":"The aim of the present study was a comparison of the intraoperative sympathoadrenergic response and the postoperative vigilance of a propofol\/alfentanil anaesthesia to a conventional isoflurane anaesthesia. 25 patients were admitted to the study undergoing septorhino surgery. Patients with continuous intravenous anaesthesia with propofol\/alfentanil combined with nitrous oxide showed better haemodynamic conditions without an increase of blood pressure and catecholamines under laryngoscopy, intubation and surgical stimulation. In contrast to that the patients with isoflurane anesthesia showed a significant increase in haemodynamic parameters and capillary bloodflow. The measured plasma adrenalin levels showed wide intraindividual fluctuation but no significant difference between the groups. The suppression of plasma noradrenaline was more pronounced under intravenous anaesthesia. Recovery was significantly faster and vigilance significantly better in the patients undergoing intravenous anaesthesia. After 30 min patients with i.v. anaesthesia fulfilled all the conditions to be transferred to the regular ward; the other group needed more than one hour. It can be concluded that continuous i.v. anaesthesia with propofol\/alfentanil is superior in suppressing the stress response to invasive stimuli and provides faster recovery and better postoperative analgesia.","3249":"To evaluate whether midazolam has analgesic properties in humans after intravenous injection we studied the influence of a subhypnotic dose of midazolam (50 micrograms\/kg) on the cumulative alfentanil consumption in 53 patients during extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) using a patient-controlled analgesia system (PCAS). In a randomised double blind fashion all patients received either midazolam or an equal volume of saline (placebo) prior to ESWL. Heart rate and arterial blood pressure were measured before and during ESWL. Alfentanil consumption was assessed 20 minutes after injection of midazolam or placebo, respectively. All patients received oxygen via face mask. In patients older than 60 years (median: 70 years, range: 61-88 years) pretreatment with midazolam resulted in a significantly lower cumulative alfentanil consumption (0.41 vs 0.97 mg; p = 0.027) compared with patients younger than 60 years after midazolam pretreatment (0.84 vs 0.71 mg; p = 0.27). Mean arterial pressure also was significantly lower in the former compared with the latter group, while heart rate remained unchanged. In contrast, in patients younger than 60 years (median: 47 years, range: 24-56 years) no significant differences were observed between the midazolam and the placebo group. Thus, low dose intravenous midazolam pretreatment led to a significant decrease of alfentanil consumption in patients beyond 60 years of age. We conclude that subhypnotic doses of midazolam are capable of reducing alfentanil demand in elderly but not in younger patients during ESWL.","3250":"The neurotransmitters adrenaline and noradrenaline are non-selective adrenergic agonists which interact with both subtypes of alpha- and beta-receptors. Clonidine, an alpha 2-adrenergic drug with a selectivity ratio of 200\/1 for alpha 2\/alpha 1 has been used in clinical practice for more than 20 years. Although alpha 2-agonists have vasoconstrictor properties, sympatholytic effects on the central nervous system predominate. As a result, the sympathetic outflow from the medullary pressor centres is decreased mediating the hypotensive effects of the alpha 2-agonists. These compounds also exhibit sedative, anxiolytic, analgesic, and haemodynamic stabilising properties. The identification of alpha 2-adrenoceptors has yielded information on their biochemical properties, signal transduction, modulation of the sympathetic nervous system and neurotransmission. The classification of alpha 2-receptors based on anatomical locations and identified as presynaptic alpha 2-receptors and postsynaptic alpha 1-receptors proved to be untenable after postsynaptic and extrasynaptic alpha 2-receptor locations had been identified. At least 3 isoreceptors which are heterologously distributed in the brain have been identified. Guanine nucleotide proteins (G proteins) couple the receptor to an effector mechanism (i.e. intracellular messenger cascade, ion channel). More selective for the alpha 2-adrenoceptor than clonidine is dexmedetomidine (1600\/1 of alpha 2\/alpha 1), a very potent agonist at the alpha 2-adrenoceptor. Imidazole derivatives (like clonidine and dexmedetomidine) also bind to other nonadrenergic receptors (\"imidazoline receptors\") which may produce some effects (i.e. vagotonia) previously ascribed to alpha 2-adrenoceptors. alpha 2-receptors exist in brain tissue and several peripheral organs and tissues including the liver, eye, kidney, pancreas and platelets. Anaesthetic interest has focussed on reductions in anaesthetic requirements since experimental and clinical studies have shown that alpha 2-agonists expert powerful analgesic and anaesthetic effects. The hypnotic response is probably mediated by activation of alpha 2-adrenoceptors in the locus coeruleus. Analgesia is induced by modulation of the nociceptive pathway at the level of the dorsal root neuron and other sites not yet unambiguously characterised. Dexmedetomidine reduces the anaesthetic requirements for halothane by more than 90%. Cerebral blood flow and intraocular pressure are reduced by alpha 2-agonists. Epidural, intrathecal, intravenous and transdermal application of clonidine resulted in pain reduction, during and following surgery and in patients with neurogenic or otherwise intractable cancer pain. Administration of alpha 2-agonists induces only minor respiratory effects.

Postoperatively, severe hypoxaemia occurred (AaDO2 548-602 torr) despite extensive mechanical ventilatory support. There was no obvious chance to overcome this situation by conventional therapeutic measures and the decision was made to institute IVOX therapy. Hypoxaemia was resolved immediately and both FiO2 and tidal volume could be reduced within hours. The patient's respiratory condition continued to improve over the next days leading to termination of IVOX therapy after 71 hours. However, the necessity of long-term ventilatory support secondary to recurrent pneumonia and sepsis, multiple abdominal reoperations for ischemic colitis and retroperitoneal abscess prolonged his recovery. He was discharged from the hospital after four months and is alive and well now 14 months after his operation. He is the first long-term survivor after IVOX therapy in Europe. IVOX may be successfully used in selected patients while the indications and it's potential role in the therapy of severe respiratory failure still need to be defined.","3260":"This retrospective follow-up studied lung function and reconvalescence in 38 young patients without primary lung disease, who suffered from severe ARDS and survived by means of extracorporeal lung assist (ELA) treatment. Over a period of 3, 6, 9 and 12-20 months dynamic and static lung volumes and the results of X-ray and CT scan of the thorax were studied. Within the third and sixth month the forced vital capacity, FEV1, and arterial blood gases reached the lower range of normal values. Obvious relative emphysema RV\/TLC was observed at the time of discharge from hospital and during the first four months. This was found to reverse during the following months. After a period of 12-20 months all patients had an abnormal diffusion capacity (TLCO) but with normal transfer coefficients (TLCO\/VA). Even though ARDS did not induce obstructive changes, the diminished diffusion capacity and the slightly reduced expiratory peak flow in 25-75% of FVC (FEF 25-75) indicates slight changes in the small airways. Following up the X-ray and CT results we found extraordinary morphological restitution. Spiroergometry results showed a normal cardiopulmonary pattern for untrained individuals. 36 of the 38 patients were integrated in normal working and social life within 12-20 months.","3261":"Capnometers measure carbon dioxide (CO2) in inspired and expired air. Under physiological conditions end-tidal CO2 (peCO2) measurements closely reflect arterial pCO2 (paCO2). End-tidal CO2 concentration has been found to correlate with cardiac output in animal models and in clinical studies with cardiac arrest during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). In the present study in 23 cases of CPR end-tidal CO2 concentrations were registered during precordial compression with a transportable, battery-carried capnometer. In 7 cases of successful CPR mean concentrations of end-tidal CO2 were higher than in unsuccessful CPR (13 +\/- 7 mmHg versus 8 +\/- 6 mmHg). No statistical significance was found. In case of successful CPR there was a sudden rise in end-tidal CO2 up to 54 +\/- 6 mmHg, indicating satisfactory spontaneous circulation. With capnometry it is possible to assess the efficacy of precordial compression during resuscitation and the return of spontaneous circulation in cardiopulmonary arrest.","3262":"To determine the effects of vecuronium neuromuscular blockade on O2 consumption (VO2) during isoflurane anaesthesia 12 patients were studied. 12 patients (ASA-PS I-II, 37.1 +\/- 12.1 yr, 173 +\/- 8 cm, 70.1 +\/- 8.6 kg), scheduled for urological lower abdominal surgery, received isoflurane-N2O-O2-anaesthesia under steady-state conditions (1.3 MAC). Duration of anaesthesia was 169 +\/- 32 min and 0.057 +\/- 0.016 mg\/kg\/h vecuronium were needed. The desired level of neuromuscular transmission was set to 10% of control. This level of neuromuscular blockade was kept constant for 60 min by a negative feedback controlled infusion of vecuronium. VO2 was measured by an indirect calorimetry device (MMC Horizon, STPD). During and after recovery of neuromuscular function anaesthesia was maintained and oxygen measurements were continued. Preanaesthetic values of VO2 were in the predicted range for basal metabolism. Steady-state general anaesthesia lead to an 26-28% reduction of VO2 (Range: 144-232 ml\/min) compared to the preanaesthetic values (202-288 ml\/min, p &lt; 0.01). Neuromuscular blockade showed no significant effect on O2 uptake. We conclude that in patients with adequate depth of anaesthesia vecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade does not lead to a further reduction of oxygen consumption, since muscular tone is already reduced by general anaesthesia.","3263":"Erythropoietin (EPO) is the main regulatory hormone for the control of erythropoiesis. EPO leads to enhanced mitosis and differentiation of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow. The major stimulus for EPO-formation is anaemia of various origin, resulting in an exponential relation between EPO levels and a decrease in haematocrit. Another important stimulus for increased EPO production is a fall of the arterial oxygen tension caused by either cardiopulmonary disorders or by a decrease of the oxygen tension in the inspiratory gas. Human erythropoietin was first isolated and purified from a large amount of urine of patients with aplastic anaemia. After the EPO gene had been cloned and expressed, biotechnically produced recombinant human erythropoietin (rHu-EPO) became available for clinical trials. EPO deficiency appears to be the major cause of renal anaemia, and hence the treatment of these patients is the most important indication for clinical use. Encouraging results in patients whose anaemia is not of renal origin have also been reported, using treatment with rHu-EPO. In preoperative autologous blood donation programmes prior to elective surgery, rHu-EPO therapy improved the amount of donated blood and ameliorated the decrease of haematocrit values. Side effects such as hypertension, thrombosis, hypercalcaemia, elevated liver enzymes were rare and were mostly related to the underlying disease.","3264":"","3265":"","3266":"","3267":"A thirty-year-old male patient suffered subarachnoidal haemorrhage from an angioma positioned in the cranio-cervical transition.

Neither fluid restriction and sodium substitution, nor administration of hydro-chlorothiazide\/indomethacin affected natriuresis and polyuria. It was only after treatment with fludrocortisone-acetate\/hydrocortisone that hyponatraemia and polyuria were resolved. At the same time a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt was applied. Differential diagnosis excluded the syndromes of inadequate antidiuretic hormone secretion, renal and cerebral diabetes insipidus, osmotic receptor hypofunction, chronic renal dysfunction and tubular necrosis. Natriuresis and polyuria developed under dexamethasone therapy. Since patient history, physical examination and laboratory criteria could not explain the electrolyte and fluid imbalance, this might be attributed to the hydrocephalus. Similar disturbances have been reported from other patients with intracranial disorders. Mechanical pressure exercised on the hypothalamus might cause the disturbance of fluid and sodium balance. Assuming a cerebral salt wasting syndrome, a putative natriuretic factor coming from the brain or an imbalance in the cerebral renin-angiotensin-system, as described in rats and dogs, must be discussed.","3268":"","3269":"","3270":"","3271":"","3272":"","3273":"","3274":"The results of two studies on the effects of halothane and isoflurane in increasing end-tidal concentrations (0.25; 0.5; 1.0vol%) on the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen and the cerebral blood flow are compared. Both studies were performed on baboons using the same experimental model. Cerebral blood flow was determined from a washout curve after the intracarotid injection of 133xenon. Halothane and isoflurane led to a dose-dependent decrease of the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen. Increasing concentrations of halothane caused a decrease of cerebral oxygen consumption from 3.4 +\/- 0.8 (baseline) to 2.9 +\/- 0.8 (0.25vol%), 2.7 +\/- 0.7 (0.5vol%) and 2.4 +\/- 0.4 mlO2 100 g-1min-1 at 1.0vol%.

The lacking increase in cerebral blood flow observed at 1.0vol% of halothane without blood pressure support appeared to be caused by the low cerebral perfusion pressure rather than by vasoconstriction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","3275":"In 40 patients with normal liver function total hepatic blood flow (HBF) was determined by the indocyanine-green clearance method simultaneously with haemodynamic parameters, including cardiac output by means of the noninvasive thoracic electrical bioimpedance method. Furthermore, the influence of halothane, enflurane or isoflurane on HBF and the interaction with haemodynamic parameters was studied. HBF and the cardiocirculatory parameters were determined under normal conditions (waking state) and the 40 patients were then divided into 4 groups (each n = 10). After standardised induction of anaesthesia (0.3 mg\/kg etomidate and 2 micrograms\/kg fentanyl) and tracheal intubation (1.5 mg\/kg suxamethonium chloride) an inhalation anaesthesia in O2\/air under control of normal end tidal carbon dioxide concentration was performed by intermittent positive pressure ventilation. Anaesthesia was maintained in the 4 groups either with 1 MAC halothane, 1 MAC enflurane, 1 MAC isoflurane or 1.3 MAC isoflurane. The measurements were repeated at a steady of the desired end expiratory concentration of the respective volatile anaesthetic. All three anaesthetics produced a significant and comparable decrease of cardiac output and arterial blood pressure. Differences between halothane, enflurane and isoflurane in respect of haemodynamic parameters were only minimal. Contrariwise, marked differences could be seen in the effects of the anaesthetics on HBF. In the presence of halothane and enflurane HBF dropped to 58% and 56% resp. of the control value, whereas during isoflurane anaesthesia HBF remained unchanged. Furthermore, only during halothane anaesthesia a significant correlation between arterial blood pressure and HBF could be observed indicating a loss of autoregulation of the hepatic blood flow.","3276":"11 former premature babies born at a mean gestational age of 32 weeks (range 27-34 weeks) and one baby born at term with congenital diaphragmatic hernia scheduled for inguinal hernia repair were selected to receive a spinal anaesthesia after informed written consent was obtained from one of the parents.

In clinically employed concentrations these negative effects are rapidly and completely reversible. No clinically relevant adverse actions on the immune system have ever been identified in short-term anaesthesia with any substance, not even with the thiobarbiturates although these are known to be highly inhibitory. However, matters are entirely different in respect of highly dosed long-term sedation. In such cases, it may occur with e.g. thiobarbiturates or diazepam that in the course of days or weeks concentrations are attained in the tissue which may lead us to expect in vivo quite considerable suppression of both unspecific and antigen-specific cellular immune mechanisms. This expectation, which is first of all based on in-vitro results, has been indirectly supported by a clinical study in patients suffering from craniocerebral trauma who received artificial respiration and in whom an association was seen between thiopental administration and the incidence of bacterial pneumonias. Over and above this, however, the preoperative condition of the patient and of course mainly the operation as such with its associated stress reaction will cause direct and indirect changes in the immune system (Fig. 4). Trauma and anaesthesia exert not only a direct action, but act as inhibitors or stimulators of important immune functions chiefly by modulating the stress response. We are still unaware as to whether and to what extent the prognosis of the individual patient is actually adversely affected by the combined action of these factors. Many findings, however, seem to point to an essential role played by both the surgical trauma and the stress response it induces, as well as by the pre-operative immune status of the patient, in the occurrence of subsequent infectious complications (Fig. 4).","3278":"","3279":"","3280":"We report on oral ketamine for the preinduction of 3 patients who aggressively refused the commonly used induction of anaesthesia, due to young age or mental retardation. One child and two mentally retarded patients aged 30 and 31 years who were to undergo dental surgery aggressively refused the induction of anaesthesia, either by inhalation or rectal, intramuscular, or intravenous application of drugs. One of them previously injured the medical personnel and destroyed the interior equipment of a gynaecologist, who tried to perform an examination. After having received 6 to 8 mg\/kg body weight ketamine in 10 ml water, which they accepted well, probably because of the long lasting fluid restriction (about 12 hours), they tolerated the induction of anaesthesia by inhalation (2 patients) or intravenously (1 child). Two patients remained awake, but calm, one fell deeply asleep. After several hours of surgery in inhalation anaesthesia they could be extubated within several minutes and discharged the same day. We conclude that 5 to 10 mg\/kg oral ketamine in water which has a bioavailability of approximately 20% is a useful agent for the preinduction of patients who aggressively refuse medical treatment. Because deep sleep states cannot be excluded, we recommend a careful supervision after the application of ketamine.

Curare allowed general anaesthesia to be reduced to a lighter level, thereby conferring a significant safety factor to the patient. Both the shortage in supply of crude curare and its variable composition led the search for synthetic curare analogues conferring well defined pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. Based on the chemical structure of tubocurarine which has been known since 1935 the efforts concentrated on bisquaternary ammonium compounds. Gallamine was the only synthetic curare analogue to contain three quaternary ammonium groups. This drug had significant undesired vagolytic effects. In 1951 succinylbischoline appeared to be the ideal muscle relaxant, particularly with respect to its fast onset and short duration of action. The disadvantages of its depolarising mechanism of action which were appreciated during the years to follow prevented the concept of depolarising neuromuscular blockade to be pursued further. With other muscle relaxants, including curare itself, histamine release, vagal blockade and ganglionic blockade were undesired effects to be eliminated in future compounds. Improved understanding of structure-activity relationships turned out to be an indispensable tool for future research. This in turn required more elaborate methods in chemical analysis, in electrophysiology of the motor endplate, and in ultrastructural research. As a result, alcuronium and pancuronium became available in the late sixties and early seventies. Both muscle relaxants had a non-depolarising mechanism of action with reduced side effects relative to curare. From now on better techniques for pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic research became available resulting in research activity with particular emphasis in this field. Researchers became aware that new muscle relaxants should be designed for larger volumes of distribution and more rapid biodegradation than those currently available. Concurrently, anaesthesia techniques had changed in a way to use intubation and mechanical ventilation as a routine procedure. The risk of intraoperative hypoventilation and hypoxemia was eliminated, yet, due to the lack of adequate monitoring techniques the slow recovery from curare, alcuronium or pancuronium neuromuscular blockade was hardly appreciated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","3299":"Referring to a classification by Cormack, difficult laryngoscopy of Grade 3 (only the epiglottis or a part of it can be seen) was simulated in 16 patients by lowering the blade of the laryngoscope, so that the epiglottis was pushed down and thus covered up the vocal cords. The object of the study was to test whether a newly developed rigid endoscope is a useful tool during intubation in cases of laryngoscopical view Grade 3. After simulation of Grade 3 as mentioned above, using a clip, an angle optic was fixed to the vertical part of the blade, so that the movement of the optic in the sagittal level was still possible.

Combined effects of both modalities mainly depending on the geometry of the thoracic cage, are usually seen. Improvement of flow by modifying the criteria of thorax compression (duration, frequency, strength) is then discussed, and new methods or CPR as e.g. simultaneous\/synchronous compression\/respiration, Vest-CPR, MAST-CPR, abdominal compression and Cough-CPR are mentioned and their mechanisms explained.

Thus, the goal of haemodynamic therapy in septic patients is an increase in cardiac output large enough to permit adequate tissue oxygenation. The purpose of this study was to establish whether the additional use of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor amrinone is useful in hypodynamic septic patients with inadequate tissue perfusion. Nine patients who had developed the clinical signs of sepsis (temperature greater than 38.5 degrees C, leukocytosis greater than 15,000\/mm3, thrombopenia less than 100,000\/mm3 or a drop in platelet count greater than 30%, cardiovascular shock) were given amrinone 30 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for one hour. All patients showed mixed venous oxygen saturations below 70% and oxygen extraction rates above 30%, despite maximum catecholamine therapy. Haemodynamic parameters were measured with the help of a pulmonary artery catheter. Statistical significance was checked using the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test. During amrinone application cardiac index increased significantly from 4.6.1.81.min-1.m-2 to 5.6 +\/- 1.81.min-1.m-2 (p less than 0.01), while central venous pressure was kept constant by volume supply. Mean pulmonary artery pressure remained nearly unchanged, whereas mean arterial pressure dropped significantly from 91 +\/- 13 mmHg to 75 +\/- 8 mmHg (p less than 0.01). The oxygen supply rose during administration of amrinone by an average of 17%, which led to a rise in oxygen uptake. Independence of oxygen uptake from oxygen supply, however, could not be attained. In septic patients, amrinone increases cardiac output via pulmonary vasodilation. However, pronounced systemic vasodilation lowers arterial blood pressure, enhancing the risk of myocardial ischaemia.","3322":"In a porcine CPR-model, we investigated the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of norepinephrine (NE) after intravenous (10 g\/kg, n = 10, group A) and endobronchial (e.b., 100 micrograms\/kg, n = 10, group B) administration. After 3 min of cardiac arrest induced by electroshock, restitution of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved in 8 animals in group A after 3.3 +\/- 1.6 min, and in group B in 6 animals after 2.5 +\/- 0.6 min.

Oedema formation and the degree of inflammation in the pharynx and hypopharynx were examined on the day prior to surgery and three to four hours postoperatively. Complications of the airways were noted in the immediate postoperative phase and at the time of the second examination. Direct laryngoscopy did not induce any significant change in oedema formation or degree of inflammation in both groups. However, there was a correlation between the duration of surgery and the degree of increase in oedema and inflammation in the NaCl group but not in the corticoid group.

Physiological humidification and heating of breathing air are preconditions for mucociliary clearance, pulmonary cleaning and defence mechanisms.

In general the humidification of inspiratory gases should not remain under 70% of relative air humidity at 37 degrees C. Under clinical conditions it is problematic to ensure sufficiently rapid and reproducible measurements of humidity during breathing cycles. We developed a measuring method that enables to make these measurements without big mechanical device. Aim of this investigation was to measure air humidity in typical semiclosed systems during anaesthesia and semiopen CPAP-respiration. The necessity and efficiency of a heat and moisture exchanger (HME) was to be investigated as well. After approximately 5 minutes there was an inspiratory relative air humidity not below 70% at 28 degrees C (19 mg H2O\/l humid air) within the breathing circuit with CO2 double-absorber. By using an HME it is possible to increase relative air humidity within this system to 86% at 29.5 degrees C (25 mg\/l). After one hour's respiration with this system without HME a relative humidity of 87% at 30 degrees C (26 mg\/l) is reached after replaced HME. Initial relative humidity in a semiopen CPAP-system is about 12% at 28 degrees C (3 mg\/l).

Recommendations given are based on results from animal experiments and on a series of anecdotal reports. Regional anaesthesia is presented as anaesthetic technique of choice. General anaesthesia should be based on a fentanyl-nitrous oxide regimen, with propofol as induction agent. In the case of an acute attack, treatment consists of glucose and haematin administration.","3327":"","3328":"Clear differentiation between nociception and pain, or, better, between anti-nociception and pain relief, is essential for understanding the analgesic mechanisms in anaesthesia. Nociception is a neuronal activity in the pain-mediating and pain-processing nervous system, i.e. in the peripheral axons, in the spinal short cord and in certain brain structures. The nociceptive system has been well documented by experiments, especially in animals. If this system is specifically blocked, there will be no transmission and hence no sensation of pain if we leave aside the rare and complicated instances of \"psychogenic pain\". Nociceptive activity is blocked or at least attenuated by anti-nociceptive drugs, such as surface anaesthetics acting in the periphery by blocking the sodium channels in the conductive nerve membrane. Opiates are another example of drugs which develop an effect on specific nociceptive neurons in the spinal cord and in the brain, thus suppressing pain transmission. An ideally effective anaesthetic should act similarly, that is by specifically and selectively suppressing nociceptive activity induced by surgery. However, general anaesthesia is based on entirely different mechanisms. It lowers the arousal level, or the vigilance of the patient. Since pain is the conscious processing of nociceptive information, attenuating the vigilance also alleviates pain; there is no pain without consciousness. Most of the centrally acting analgesics will also reduce vigilance; e.g. driving is not permitted under analgesia with opiates. Alcohol is another example, although it minimally affects the nociceptive system, it substantially lowers the vigilance, thereby alleviating pain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","3329":"To the present day there is no consensus of opinion as to which molecular events lead to the complex clinical state generally referred to as anaesthesia. The multitude of simultaneous physiological changes are also responsible for this lack of consensus. During anaesthesia, for example, consciousness, perception, memory, pain, and muscle relaxation are altered. The actions of anaesthetics correlate very well with their partitioning into lipophilic phases. Lipophilic interactions are non-specific. Therefore, it is likely that anaesthetics act at many different sites. Cell membranes are not the only possible sites but also membrane proteins and the various hydrophobic domains they contain. The multitude of clinical anaesthetic effects is paralleled by the complexity of molecular interactions. A better understanding of anaesthesia requires an integrated view of anaesthetic effects at the various systemic levels, beginning with the molecular domain and ending with the intact central nervous system. Anaesthesia research could be directed more towards man because it has now become possible to conduct molecular in-vitro studies with human cells as well as non-invasive studies of the intact human central nervous system.","3330":"","3331":"","3332":"A 77-year-old woman who had undergone surgery of a non-malignant extracerebral retro-orbital tumor suffered postoperatively from respiratory failure due to impaired respiratory drive and unconsciousness of unknown origin and required artificial ventilation for 14 days. After cerebral and endocrinological causes had been excluded, the residual effects of diazepam were taken into consideration, since the patient had received this substance for premedication and during 3 days postoperatively (total 165 mg). After the application of flumazenil (Anexate), a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, she awoke immediately and was extubated with sufficient spontaneous breathing. The hypothesis that diazepam was the causative agent for the respiratory failure and impaired consciousness was supported by the detection of high serum concentrations of diazepam and its active metabolite desmethyldiazepam. During the following 3 days repetitive injections of flumazenil were necessary to counteract recurring depression of respiration and vigilance. Thereafter further application of flumazenil was not necessary.","3333":"The early diagnosis of traumatic aortic dissections and aneurysms involving the thoracic aorta is of crucial importance for the outcome of patients suffering chest injuries. This subject is presented using two case reports; one illustrates the problems resulting from an overlooked traumatic aneurysm of the thoracic aorta and the second shows the possibilities of detecting such potentially lethal injuries early in patients with thoracic or multiple injuries, using the transesophageal Doppler echocardiography (TDE). The advantages and disadvantages of using TDE as compared to the more conventional methods such as the precordial Doppler echocardiography, computed tomography and angiography, are discussed. The particular advantage of this hardly invasive or burdening method is its immediate availability in the emergency room to assess patients with evident thorax trauma. In the intensive care unit TDE may be of value in screening polytraumatised patients who offered no primary evidence for chest injury upon arrival.","3334":"A close look at the molecular interactions of intravenous anaesthetics reveals a complex and non-uniform picture. A multitude of membrane structures are affected by the individual anaesthetic compounds, although with specific differential profiles of molecular action for the different groups of anaesthetic substances. This is consistent with the hypothesis of a multi-mechanistic mode of action, where anaesthesia results from the superposition and integration of several anaesthetic actions on the molecular level. This overall concept is illustrated by using the well characterised voltage-activated human brain sodium channel protein and its interactions with various intravenous anaesthetics as an example for other membrane proteins. Using the novel lipid bilayer \"voltage-clamp\" technique, single sodium channels were incorporated into artificial lipid bilayers and their single channel properties studied. Compared to controls, all studied anaesthetics (propofol, pentobarbital, ketamine, midazolam) interacted in a dose-dependent manner with two key sodium channel functions: 1. reduction of the voltage-independent fractional channel open-time and 2. interaction with the voltage-dependent steady-state activation process. Only propofol and pentobarbital demonstrated these effects at clinically relevant concentrations; hence, the sodium channel might serve as a molecular site of action for these substances only. Differences between clinical anaesthetics and their clinical actions may thus correlate with differential molecular sites and modes of action.","3335":"The cellular and molecular basis of inhalational anaesthesia is still unknown. Recent biochemical, neurophysiological and pharmacological interest has focussed on membrane proteins in the neuron, the smallest functional entity in the brain. In this review, the effects on ion transport and ion channels potentially relevant to anaesthesia are analysed with reference to the most extensively investigated volatile anaesthetics ether, chloroform, halothane, methoxyflurane, isoflurane, and enflurane. Synaptic transmission proved a major target of all the volatile substances tested so far. Their inhibitory effect seems to be due to an alteration in the Ca(2+)-dependent stimulus-secretion coupling within the presynaptic nerve endings. In contrast, the phosphatidylinositol pathway proved relatively insensitive. In the postsynaptic membrane, receptor-operated ion channels, K+ and Cl- channels are considered possible targets for anaesthetic vapours. Likewise, guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, so-called G proteins, are promising candidates for future research. So far, only limited data exist on the effects of anaesthetics on non-neuronal cellular components of the CNS, e.g. glial cells. In view of the rapidly increasing number of potential target mechanisms, the future challenge of biologically oriented anaesthesia research will be to puzzle out those mechanisms most relevant to the still mysterious state of anaesthesia.","3336":"Postsynaptic chemically controlled ion channels are a possible location for the action of anaesthetics. The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AcChoR) is a member of a superfamily of chemically controlled ion channels, which have a large number of structural similarities in common. This receptor provides an excellent model for studying the effects of anaesthetics on excitable membrane proteins since it is well characterised and available in large quantities. The AcChoR consists of five subunits that surround a central ion channel. Anaesthetics can inhibit the function of the AcChoR by several different mechanisms: 1. By directly blocking the ion channel, 2. by an allosteric inhibition of the ion channel, 3. by changing the properties of the cell membrane surrounding the receptor. In high concentrations, anaesthetics stabilize the receptor in a desensitized state. Investigation of the mode of action of anaesthetics on the AcChoR provides important information as to the mechanisms of anaesthesia.","3337":"Positron emission tomography (PET) has not only a variety of applications to functional diagnostics using methods of nuclear medicine and for the investigation of pathophysiological processes, it also offers new possibilities for pharmacology. As PET is able to quantitatively record \"from outside\" the regional concentration of a positron emitter in a living primate, the distribution and kinetics of a labelled drug at the site of action can be determined non-invasively. This is always the case if the research substance can be labelled practically carrier-free with a short-lived positron emitter such as 11C (T1\/2 = 20 min) or if applicable 18F (T1\/2 = 110 min). The quantities applied in this case are so small that pharmacodynamic effects do not occur. Therefore, this method is particularly suitable for measuring in vivo the regional cerebral pharmacokinetics of centrally acting drugs in humans.","3338":"","3339":"","3340":"Airway obstruction of endotracheal tubes may occur during general anaesthesia. A case is reported where endobronchial intubation and inflation of the cuff caused herniation into the left bronchus before the malpositioning had been corrected. This led to a cuff herniation that caused airway obstruction at the end of anaesthesia. The regional overinflation of the tubes cuff could be reproduced by a model by other tubes of the same type. Malpositioning of endotracheal tubes may cause cuff herniation that potentially leads to acute airway obstruction.","3341":null,"3342":"Artifacts were observed when using epidural pressure monitoring systems (Gaeltec ICT\/B Titan).

The study was designed as a prospective evaluation of patients with total hip joint replacement. The patients received neuroleptanalgesia supplemented with enflurane. After induction of anaesthesia with midazolam (0.1 mg\/kg body weight) haemodilution procedure was started. During surgery a cell saver was used for blood salvage. In the recovery room drainage blood was also being processed by a cell saver. The study includes 10 patients belonging to ASA-group II with an average weight of 79.4 kg (53-100 kg), at an average age of 57.9 years (44-68 years). Midazolam was measured in patient blood and in autologous blood units by gas chromatography. 151 micrograms of midazolam, i.e. 1.8% of the initial dose was retransfused in hemodilution blood. By processing of blood in the cell saver, 99.5% of the amount of midazolam found in the sample unit was eliminated. The maximum quantity was 5.5 micrograms in the washed autologous red cell concentrate. Considering the analytic limit of 2 micrograms\/l of midazolam in plasma, retransfusion of autologous blood cannot influence the plasma concentration of midazolam. Therefore, there is no risk of re-sedation in retransfusing autologous blood postoperatively. ","3347":"This study presents our preoperative autologous blood donation programme that is in use since 1987. 246 patients of cardiothoracic surgery participated in this program. 77% of all patients had preoperative concentrations of haemoglobin above 12g\/dl despite frequent donations. 36.5% of patients were transfused exclusively with their own blood products. Reduction of homologous blood transfusion has been achieved with second preoperative plasmaphereses and more restricted indication for blood transfusion. More blood donation could be performed with application of erythropoietin resulting in more frequent preoperative blood donations.","3348":"The effect of haemoconcentration of shed blood from operative field during vascular surgery by either centrifugation (cell separation, n = 10) or haemofiltration (n = 10) was investigated. Interest in this in-vitro-study was focused on the quality of the blood concentrated. Various parameters were measured in the patient (before onset of anaesthesia), and in the blood after suction from operative field: 1. shed blood, 2.\/3. after haemoseparation\/-filtration. Both procedures were easy to perform but haemofiltration produced whole blood quicker than the cell-separation technique (1.2:3.0 minutes). All patients had normal parameters. Suction led to an activation of plasma coagulation and an increase of free haemoglobin and elastase. Haemoseparation in contrast to filtration led to an elimination of thrombocytes, elastase, free hemoglobin and all proteins including antithrombin III and fibrinogen; concentration of red cells was more pronounced after separation (hct 55 vs. 35%). Heparin reduction was better after separation but plasma-heparin-levels were in a tolerable range after both procedures (0.21 vs. 0.75 U\/ml). None of the procedures was followed by the appearance of activated clotting factors (F XII a). The data presented demonstrate that haemofiltration may be an alternative in intra- and postoperative autotransfusion. The particular advantage of this method is the preservation of plasma proteins after concentration procedure thus avoiding the need for additional application of fresh frozen plasma in patients with significant blood loss.","3349":"","3350":"Coagulation changes due to polytrauma are considered to be an important determinant for the outcome. In this context, physiological inhibitors of activated coagulation are highlighted with special reference to antithrombin-III (AT-III). Blood samples of 20 randomly selected adults with polytrauma (Injury Severity Score mean = 36.7 +\/- 8.6) were investigated. To investigate the very early onset of coagulation changes, samples were taken as early as possible at the site of emergency (mean = 18.3 +\/- 5.5 min. after trauma) as well as at hospital admission (mean = 78.0 +\/- 10.4 min.). By means of a specially designed \"mini-lab\", basic processing of the samples harvested (centrifugation, pipetting, freezing) was done on the spot to obtain haemostaseological results that agree as closely as possible with the subsequent analyses. Due to the activation of intravascular coagulation as well as the consumption of physiological inhibitors, comprehensive coagulation disturbances become obvious at the time of hospital admission. These are intensified by haemodilution as a consequence of high-dose fluid replacement. However, significantly elevated levels of specific coagulation reaction products (thrombin-antithrombin-III-complex) give evidence of the consumption of inhibitory potential exceeding haemodilution.","3351":null,"3352":"","3353":"","3354":"","3355":"We report on the fulminant crisis of malignant hyperthermia occurring in a 30-year-old female during kidney transplantation.

After an initially normal course of anaesthesia, the patient developed symptoms of a fulminant malignant hyperthermia (MH) including excessive increase in end expiratory CO2, hyperkalaemia, tachycardia and hyperpyrexia. The patient was saved by the timely administration of dantrolene. A surgical revision required the next day because of bleeding was done under dantrolene cover and took an uncomplicated course. The patient was extubated 7.5 hours after the second intervention and transferred to a normal ward after 4 days.

Furthermore, the valence and the validity of the used platelet test are discussed for diagnostic purposes. With regard to resulting consequences, first of all in respect of possibly false negative results, we suggest to investigate all patients classified by this platelet test with the accepted and established CHCT.","3357":"The authors report on the course of a fulminant malignant hyperthermia (MH) associated with laminectomy in a 29-year-old man who had been healthy up to that time. Succinylcholine and isoflurane were considered to be the causative triggering agents.

Residue-free restitution was achieved within a few days. Decisive for an early detection of MH is the routine performance of end-expiratory CO2 measurement which is definitely superior to temperature control and significantly reduces the time that elapses before treatment is initiated.","3358":"Two of the persisting controversies concerning malignant hyperthermia (MH) are discussed: storing and dosage of dantrolene and preoperative tactics to be followed with patients who are MH-susceptible.

However, 10-20% of the patients tested are classified as equivocal (MHE), i.e. their susceptibility remains uncertain. A genetic disorder of the calcium releasing ryanodine receptor has been postulated recently. Therefore, 12 patients were tested in addition to the protocol of the European Malignant Hyperthermia Group (EMHG) for dose- and time-dependent contracture after ryanodine application. In this study, contracture of 0.2g appeared significantly earlier in MHS patients (17.5 +\/- 1.7 min; n = 5) during cumulative ryanodine exposition (0.4-0.8-1.6-10.0 mumol\/l) than in MHN (38.2 +\/- 5.4 min; n = 5). A significant difference between MHS (10.0 +\/- 1.7 min; n = 6) and MHN (19.8 +\/- 0.6 min; n = 3) was also seen after bolus application of ryanodine (10.0 mumol\/l). One patient classified as MHE according to the EMHG protocol, manifested as MHN after the ryanodine contracture test. This study supports previous work suggesting the ryanodine contracture test as an improvement in the in-vitro diagnosis of MH susceptibility.","3360":"In accordance with the protocol of the European Malignant Hyperpyrexia Group, an account is given of the experience regarding establishment of the \"in vitro contracture test\" for diagnosis and exclusion of malignant hyperpyrexia disposition at the University Clinic of Leipzig.

Besides the representation of the methodical features (e.g. performance of biopsy in tranquanalgesia in children), emphasis was on the safety of executing this test (attaining higher specificity, total absence of MH manifestations). The epidemiological study of the results shows the varying knowledge of physicians and the interference by insufficient investigation alternatives in individual areas. On the basis of the results, the use of the in vitro contracture test is recommended in all MH suspected cases by the authorized and qualified regional centres.","3361":"There are recent reports that inositol phosphate metabolism is involved in the development of malignant hyperthermia (MH). Consequently, we investigated the basal concentration of inositol phosphate products in skeletal and heart muscles of malignant hyperthermia-susceptible (MHS) and healthy control (MHN) swine. Different inositol phosphates were measured by high pressure liquid chromatography, including inositol trisphosphate, tetrakisphosphate, pentakisphosphate and hexakisphosphate. All inositol phosphate products measured had a higher concentration in MHS than MHN in skeletal (304-1330%) as well as heart muscles (134-440%). An activation of the inositol phosphate metabolism has been shown to mobilise intracellular calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. It is therefore concluded that, firstly, besides involvement of the skeletal muscles a primary myocardial abnormality in MHS is possible; and secondly, the idea that the inositol phosphate metabolism could be involved in the development of MH is additionally supported.","3362":"Besides offering a concise recapitulation of known facts, experiences and related viewpoints concerning malignant hyperthermia (MH), the present article offers a review of the most relevant new aspects in this field.

In the period between 1900 and 1912, he wrote several papers on this topic including a remarkable monograph on intubation, which was not widely appreciated for decades. In this, he discussed--among others--the advantages and possible risks of the endotracheal intubation, for patients during surgical procedures as well as in situations of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Kuhn recommended the use of flexible metal tubes which were generally introduced into the trachea under digital control. Kuhn suggested the advantageous use of Kirstein's autoscope, too, a forerunner of modern laryngoscopes. To overcome the \"pneumothorax problem\" in thoracic surgery, he emphasized the positive pressure ventilation via endotracheal tubes. As an alternative, he suggested the insufflation technique for this purpose. He was the first to incorporate a carbon-dioxide absorption system within the anaesthesia apparatus. Later, he developed technical devices for the perioperative intravenous administration of fluids or the injection of local anaesthetic drugs under high pressure. In honour of Kuhn's 125th birthday, the various contributions to anaesthesia and emergency medicine are outlined.","3365":"Hysteroscopy and laparoscopy are relatively non-invasive methods routinely employed in the investigation of infertility. The danger of air embolism during these procedures was recognized early, and carbon dioxide was substituted for air since it is more readily soluble in blood. In this report we describe 3 cases of circulatory collapse and cardiac arrest in healthy young women during routine hysteroscopy (out of a total of 62 patients during the period 1989-1990) which were most probably caused by massive carbon dioxide embolism. Premedication was with oral diazepam 10 mg. Anesthesia was induced with 0.1 mg fentanyl, 2.5 mg droperidol and 100 mg methohexital (100 mg propofol in one case). Intubation was facilitated with 2 mg pancuronium and 50-100mg succinylcholine. Anesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide 66% and halothane. Ventilation was controlled with a tidal volume of 10 ml per kilogram body weight at a rate of 10 per minute. Monitoring included ECG, automated non-invasive blood pressure, capnometry, pulse oximetry and body temperature. Anesthesia was uneventful prior to insufflation. In each case the signs and symptoms began approximately 5-8 minutes after the start of insufflation and consisted of an initial tachycardia rapidly followed by ventricular dysrhythmias, bradycardia and cardiac arrest. The end-tidal CO2 decreased during the tachycardic phase and prior to asystole. The patients were cyanotic with engorged jugular veins. Resuscitation with closed chest heart massage and intravenous epinephrine or orciprenaline was successful in every case.

In 139 experiments we checked the reliability of the Oxystat-photometer in comparison to the Lex-O2-Con (Lexington Instruments Corporation). High significance could be demonstrated (r = 0.96). There was a range from the control value below 5%.

However, clinical experience as well as recent experimental results indicate that this global view may not always explain the occurrence of regional myocardial ischaemia. It was therefore investigated whether in patients before and after induction of anaesthesia as well as during sternotomy metabolic indices of ischaemia, i.e. lactate and\/or hypoxanthine release into the coronary sinus, are related to global indices of myocardial O2-balance. It was found that neither myocardial O2-demand or O2-supply nor O2-balance correlated with myocardial ischaemic events. Conversely it was observed that in contrast to expectations lactate and\/or hypoxanthine release occurred more often in conjunction with high values of coronary venous oxygen saturation than with low values. Since coronary venous oxygen saturation can be considered as a physiological index of global myocardial O2-balance, the data of the present investigation suggest that during anaesthesia a global imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand is not the main cause of myocardial ischaemia. Thus, regional factors seem to be more important for initiation of myocardial ischaemic events than global O2-balance.","3368":"In 31 of 60 long-term ventilated intensive-care patients, a significant Candida antigen titer in serum was found that correlated with positive Candida cultures. In some cases the detection of the antigen was the first indication of Candida infection, while the isolation of the infectious agent required a culture period of 24-48 hours. In addition to routinely performed controls of Candida colonisation, determination of Candida antigen in the serum appears to be a valuable tool in the early diagnosis of candida infections.","3369":"Reliable diagnosis of pneumonia in ventilated patients is frequently difficult, since there is no single specific criterion. In the present study, the following diagnostic criteria for pneumonia were checked in 25 ventilated patients: 1. temperature over 38.5 degrees C, 2. leukocytosis over 12,000\/mm3, infiltration in the x-ray, 4. positive auscultatory findings, 5. purulent tracheal secretion (TS), 6. positive bacteriological findings (TS). Diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia was assumed if in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) the concentration of a plausible causative organism was greater than or equal to 10(4)\/ml and the \"Bacterial Index\" (BI) was greater than or equal to 6 (16). 15 patients fulfilled more than four criteria for pneumonia. In all patients the concentration of bacteria in the BAL was greater than or equal to 10(4)\/ml (median 10(6)\/ml, BI: 10). 10 patients fulfilled less than or equal to 4 criteria of pneumonia. In three of the patients, BAL was sterile, in four cases organisms less than 10(4) were isolated; none of these patients received antibiotics and diagnosis of pneumonia was not confirmed in the further course of illness. In three patients, bacteria greater than or equal to 10(4)\/ml were isolated (BI 9, 10, 13); they improved under adequate antibiotic therapy. We conclude from these results that \"as a rule\" more than four of the criteria of pneumonia specified above should be present for diagnosis of pneumonia in ventilated patients in a surgical intensive-care ward. If there is any doubt, BAL should be performed to confirm the diagnosis.","3370":"In a prospective study, 10 patients (ASA II-IV) with different ailments received varying amounts of an alfentanil\/midazolam mixture (consisting of 15 mg of alfentanil and 37.5 mg of midazolam) for analgesia and sedation in a typical ICU setting over a period of 3-14 days. Special interest focussed on potential residual activity of both drugs after termination of the treatment. Since both compounds interact with receptor sites in the CNS, neurophysiological measurements were performed before, during and after the sedation. Thus, EEG power spectra were used to evaluate the central effects of midazolam, while the late peak (greater than 50 ms) of the somatosensory-evoked potential (SEP) was used to determine the inhibitory effect of alfentanil on the propagation of efferent nerve volleys along the sensory tract. A residual activity of midazolam after long-term administration seems likely as the return in the fast beta-domain was slow, and the high power in the slow EEG frequency bands delta and theta still persisted 24 hours after treatment. However, rapid recovery of the amplitude of the late N100-peak in the evoked potential suggests no potential \"overhang\" of alfentanil even if administered for several days together with a benzodiazepine. Among the variables most suitable for the determination of a sufficient sedation, the spectral edge activity (the highest frequency component in the EEG incorporating 95% of the entire power spectrum) showed a close relationship to the applied dose. All patients except one, a former alcoholic with CT-verified widening of the cerebral ventricles, could be sufficiently sedated with alfentanil\/midazolam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","3371":"The influence of volatile anaesthetic agents on transcranial magnetic motor evoked potentials (TMEP) is not known.

It is concluded that intraoperative monitoring of TMEP is not possible if halothane and nitrous oxide are administered.","3372":"The effect of Thiopentone on mid-latency auditory evoked potentials has not yet been examined sufficiently. Therefore, mid-latency auditory evoked potentials during induction of general anaesthesia with thiopentone were studied. Following informed consent in 10 patients scheduled for elective surgery, anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone (5 mg\/kg b.w. i.v.). Assisted ventilation via face mask with 100% O2 was performed until the first purposeful movement of the limbs appeared. Then a second bolus of thiopentone (2 mg\/kg b.w. i.v.) was given and general anaesthesia was maintained according to anaesthesiological and operative necessities. Auditory evoked potentials were recorded in the awake and on-line when thiopentone was injected up to 9 min after the onset of general anaesthesia. Latencies of the peaks V, Na, Pa were measured. Using Fast-Fourier-Transform-Analysis, corresponding power spectra were calculated to analyse energy portions of the AEP frequency components. In the awake state peak latencies were in the normal range. Corresponding power spectra indicated energy maxima in the 30-40 Hz frequency range. After induction of general anaesthesia an increase in latencies of the peaks Na, Pa could be observed. The energy in the 30-40 Hz range became suppressed, the AEP energy maxima shifted to the low frequency range. These effects were observable until 3 min after injection.

There is evidence that cerebral monitoring procedures may be of value for an early detection of cerebral hypoxia or ischaemia. Monitoring of central nervous physiology includes both evaluation of systemic parameters like arterial blood pressure, arterial PO2, PCO2, and temperature, and more specific parameters for the assessment of central nervous system function and intracranial haemodynamics. It has been suggested that parameters from the processed EEG may be used as an indicator for depth of anaesthesia. Even though anaesthetic-induced EEG alterations are unspecific, depth of anaesthesia may be assessed quantitatively by combined monitoring of general parameters and processed EEG. Interpretation of the EEG signals has to take into account that critical events like hypoxia or cerebral ischaemia results in EEG patterns similar to those seen under deep anaesthesia. Sensory evoked potentials are frequently used to monitor specific neural pathways that are at risk during surgery. Different pathways may be tested using different trigger modalities (somatosensory, auditory, visual). Changes in latencies and amplitudes of primary components may indicate impaired conduction in the pathway monitored. For operations in which monitoring of evoked responses is indicated, the anaesthetic technique should have minimal impact on latencies and amplitudes. In patients, cerebral blood flow can be monitored only at discrete time intervals. In contrast, non-invasive transcranial Doppler sonography may provide continuous information on intracranial haemodynamics. Relative changes in cerebral blood flow velocity have been shown to correlate closely to changes in cerebral blood flow. Cerebral perfusion pressure can be calculated by monitoring of intracranial pressure in patients with compromised intracranial compliance.","3374":"","3375":"Two cases are reported in whom infusions and transfusions by means of pressure pumps caused a compartment syndrome of the forearm.

When the drug is applied directly into (via) the injection port of the cannula most of these interactions are overlooked, whereas others show no visible signs. Chemical interactions depend on pH changes, formation of insoluble salts, oxidation and reduction, complex formation, or hydrolysis. Physical interactions are caused by changing of solvent system polarity, salting out, emulsion cracking or sorption. Solving the problem requires information (1) and precautions in respect of the mode of application (2). (1) Anaesthesiologists should know the most frequent mechanisms. Glucose infusions cannot be considered as safe carrier solutions for admixtures. Pharmacological databases should offer as much information as possible on incompatibility. (2) Injections into a separate line or lumen with a sodium chloride infusion are safe. Admixture is recommended only if compatibility is known.","3384":"A case is presented involving the use of atracurium (120 mg) as a muscle relaxant in a patient with known variegate porphyria. The concentrations of urinary porphyrins and porphyrin precursors did not increase after this anaesthetic, and no exacerbation of the disease was noted. This single case suggests that atracurium can be used safely in patients with porphyria.","3385":"Analgo-sedation for ESWL treatment has been associated with a variety of problems. Minimal invasiveness of this technique should combine with haemodynamic stability as well as with adequate oxygenation. Patient acceptance has to be considered as another important aspect. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of an analgosedative regimen with regard to these aspects. 50 ASA I-III patients scheduled for ESWL treatment were randomly allocated to receive either no premedication (n = 25) or chlorazepam as oral premedication (n = 25). The analgosedative technique was identical in both groups, consisting of atropine 0.25 mg, droperidol 5 mg (2.5 mg, if body weight less than 60 kg), and alfentanil 10 micrograms\/kg intravenously. If necessary, repeated boluses of alfentanil 5 micrograms\/kg were administered up to a maximum of 2 mg. Heart rates, arterial blood pressures, and peripheral oxygen saturation were measured during treatment. Post-treatment, patients were interviewed to assess the quality of analgesia. The results showed that our analgo-sedative regimen is suitable for ASA I-III patients. Stable heamodynamic conditions and adequate oxygenation were achieved in all patients. Patient acceptance was good. Patients with anxiolytic premedication benefited in terms of reduction in blood pressure and heart rate. The study also showed that anaesthesiologists may underestimate the pain intensity experienced and assessed by the patient.","3386":"Stress can be defined as a \"reaction by living beings to any relevant impairment\". The effect of anaesthesia on endocrine function is closely related to the actual stress concept based on the works by Cannon and Selye. Cannon described the role of catecholamines in stress and characterised the fight-flight reaction. Selye emphasised the role of the adrenocortical reaction defining the \"general adaptation syndrome\", which evolves in three stages (\"alarm reaction\", \"stage of resistance\", \"stage of exhaustion\"). Later, Henry postulated the dual stress concept. The sympathetic-adrenomedullary system is activated during the fight-flight reaction, thus representing an active role of the organism. The pituitary-adrenocortical system is activated during loss of control, submission and depression, especially in a social context. Main valid parameters of this endocrine stress response are adrenaline, noradrenaline, ADH, ACTH and cortisol. In the perioperative period, both pathways are \"stressed\". The most important factors are patient, operation, and anaesthesia. Anaesthesia can influence the stress response by afferent blockade (local anaesthesia), central modulation (general anaesthesia) or peripheral interactions with the endocrine system (etomidate). Up to now, a total peripheral blockade of the nociceptive system is impossible, due to surgical technique (destruction of nerve fibres) and release of mediator substances. With regard to reduction of endocrine stress response, inhalation anaesthesia with volatile anaesthetics and nitrous oxide may be less effective than neuroleptic, spinal or epidural anaesthesia. Immediately after extubation, rapid increases of endocrine parameters are observed. In addition to central modulation of pain and stress, both halothane and enflurane inhibit catecholamine release from the adrenal medulla. Neuroleptic anaesthesia and total intravenous anaesthesia are very potent and sufficient to control the increases in endocrine parameters even during major surgery, due to their central effects. Spinal and epidural anaesthesia alone as well as in combination with general anaesthesia can reduce the endocrine stress response more than necessary. This is due to the sympathetic blockade, combined with an afferent blockade of central cord fibers which modulate the pituitary-adrenocortical system. Only few data are available concerning the stress response during infiltration anaesthesia or nerve block, but additional sedation seems to be beneficial. Peripheral interactions with the endocrine system like blockade of the adrenal cortex by etomidate is dangerous and has caused a high mortality in intensive-care patients if the substance was admitted for a longer period. Assessment of endocrine stress response in anaesthesia and surgery is controversial.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","3387":"","3388":"","3389":"We attempted to facilitate the establishment of treatment regimens in paediatric intensive care units by means of a computer programme and to increase drug safety by standardization of dosage and avoidance of calculation errors. The programme has the following features: the user can enter drugs, oral nutrition and i.v. solutions into data files. Drugs and solutions can be chosen from these data files for the individual patient. Drug dosage is calculated from preselected dosages and the patient's data for individual dosage regimens. The desired intake of fluid volume and glucose can be chosen. Due to this preselection the quantity and concentration of the glucose solution is calculated. The total daily intake of electrolytes, calories, carbohydrates, protein and fat is shown on a balance sheet.

The extraction was performed with a Dormia basket and removed via a 24F dilatator which was placed in the femoral vein. The Swan-Ganz catheter had been placed in a 67-year old patient after Whipple's operation. The technical procedure of the catheter removal is described and the advantages are discussed.","3391":"The heart rate behaviour of 14 emergency doctors was examined in 50 cases of medical emergency service by helicopter. In addition, the subjective stress experienced by the probands was inquired by means of a questionnaire. The alarm and the landing at the site of the emergency resulted in the most marked heart rate increases; also during the period of approaching the patient, his rescue and care, persistent tachycardia could be observed. Recovery began slowly during the return flight, but even 15 minutes after completion of the emergency task the heart rate was still higher than the original value before the alarm had been sounded. Subjectively the total stress was considered to be generally low in the opinion of the emergency doctors. It seems that unconscious mechanisms of repression prevent the actual realistic recording of physical and emotional stress during the emergency service by helicopter.","3392":"In a prospective randomised study, the effects of two different colonisation prophylaxis techniques on colonisation and pulmonary infection were investigated in 40 critically ill patients with long-term ventilatory support (greater than or equal to 4 days). 20 patients were selectively decontaminated with 4 x 100 g polymyxin E, 4 x 80 mg tobramycin and 4 x 500 mg amphotericin B, administered through the gastric tube and with an antimicrobial sticky paste in the oropharynx (group I). 20 patients received 50 mg of polymyxin B and 80 mg of gentamicin dissolved in 10 ml of 0.9% saline at 6 h intervals into nose, oropharynx and stomach as well as 300 mg of amphotericin B in the oropharynx only (group II). All patients received cefotaxime systemically in the first 3 days. In group I gram-negative aerobic bacteria in the pharynx decreased from 35% to 0%, in group II from 40% to 10% and in the rectum from 80% to 61% (10% in the second week) in Group I and from 100% to 73% (33% in the second week) in group II. The decrease in gram-negative microorganisms was accompanied by an increase in the frequency of Staphylococcus epidermidis. In group I, two patients developed pneumonia and two patients urinary tract infections, in group II two patients suffered from pneumonia and 3 patients urinary tract infections. Both regimes are effective methods of prophylaxis for lowering colonisation with gram-negative aerobic bacteria and the frequency of pneumonia in patients requiring long-term mechanical ventilation. A possible selection of gram-positive bacteria must be appropriately monitored.","3393":"Many pathological changes in pharynx and larynx can cause problems in endotracheal intubation. Their preliminary signs and symptoms are often uncharacteristic. Thus prophylaxis is not always possible. Some representative diseases of larynx and pharynx are demonstrated by means of endoscopic photographs and by case reports. The photos were taken during endoscopic examinations in an ENT-clinic. The method of anaesthesia used in these cases is described, as well as prophylactic measures to be taken, if a difficult intubation may be expected. Finally, the procedure in case of an unexpected critical intubation is discussed.","3394":"In 40 patients undergoing thrombendarterectomy of the common carotid artery, the frequency-corrected QT interval in the ECG, as well as the serum sodium, potassium and total calcium were studied. Examination took place preoperatively 1.-3. hour postoperative and the 1. and 5. day postoperative. In 13 patients, pathological prolongation of QT interval (greater than 440 msec) was already found pre-operatively. Postoperative significant QT interval prolongations could not be found in any patient, independent of the site of operation or pre-operative findings. The total serum calcium concentration was postoperatively significantly reduced (P less than 0.01). There was no correlation between the reduced total serum calcium and the QT interval in the ECG. The findings contradict the assumption that clinically relevant reduction of the autonomous cardial innervation is frequent in patients undergoing thromboendarterectomy of the common carotid artery.","3395":"We examined the perioperative course of 1013 patients who had undergone coronary surgery between 1984 and 1987, to identify preoperative examination findings which are suitable as risk indicators in coronary surgery. The features we paid attention to were: anamnestic data, parameters of coronary disease, haemodynamic parameters and accompanying illnesses. We considered a perioperative course as complicated when systolic blood pressure dropped to 80 mmHg or less for longer than 15 min, when reconnection to the heart-lung-machine was necessary, when an intra-aortal balloon counterpulsation was required, when the patient had to have mechanical ventilation for longer than 24 h, when resuscitation took place, or when the patient died in the hospital. The Chi-square test was used for statistical analysis. Very good risk indicators (p less than 0.001) were: age greater than 60 y, resuscitation history, more than two bypass grafts, SvO2 70%, ejection fraction less than 50% and cardiac index less than 2.5 l\/min*m2. Good risk indicators (p less than 0.001) were: functional capacity less than 50 watts, more than one previous myocardial infarction and LVEDP greater than 20 mmHg. LCA-stenosis, arterial hypertension with diastolic blood pressure values above 100 mmHg, and obstructive airway disease were identified as suitable risk indicators (p less than 0.05). The following findings were combined with significantly increased mortality: female sex, age over 60 years, two or more previous myocardial infarctions, history of resuscitation, mixed venous oxygen saturation below 70% and the need for three or more bypass grafts for complete revascularisation.","3396":"Today, the performance of anaesthesia in cardiac surgery is on a high quality level. It requires special knowledge of the various operative techniques, the different methods of extracorporeal circulation and haemodynamic changes of the underlying cardiological disease, as well as extensive experience in cardiac and vasoactive drugs. Heart patients are now being operated on in many departments of cardiac surgery. Over and above this patients with more or less severe cardiac diseases are being looked after in every Department of Anaesthesiology, thus, every anaesthesiologist should acquaint himself with these specific problems during his specialist training.","3397":"","3398":"A patient with refractory diarrhoea (up to 10 l\/d) following colectomy and ileostomy was treated with clonidine, after loperamide, tinctura opii, cholestyramine and somatostatin had failed to reduce stool volume to less than 6 l\/d. Under combined treatment with clonidine (1200 micrograms\/d) and somatostatin (6 mg\/d), which was well tolerated, stool weights were normalised within 24 hours. This case report on the successful anti-diarrhoeic effect of clonidine is completed by experimental data from rat jejunal and duodenal segments. In the presence of the adenylate cyclase-stimulating agent forskolin, clonidine normalised both mucosal cAMP content and cAMP-induced hypersecretion in rat intestine. This suggests that the anti-diarrhoeic effect of clonidine in-vitro results from an alpha 2-receptor mediated inhibition of the stimulated adenylate cyclase. Case report and experimental data therefore support the theory that therapeutical application of clonidine in diarrhoea may be successful.","3399":"An attempt to insert a central venous catheter into the internal jugular vein of a patient suffering from pancytopenia failed and due to massive bleeding into the cervical tissue the patient developed severe dyspnoea and died during unsuccessful endotracheal intubation. A five-year judicial inquiry finally discharged the anaesthesiologist revealing that forensic aspects like a valid patient's consent, exact documentation of operations and therapies, clear arrangement with patient's relatives as well as an early detailed written epicrisis play a major role. This may be the only way to early counteract medically inane causal relationship being presented by the relative's advocate. Especially in the patient at high risk central venous catheterisation requires strict checking the indication, the corresponding choice of the correct technique during venipuncture, and a sufficient haemostatic pretreatment and care after catheterisation.","3400":"","3401":"","3402":"","3403":"","3404":"","3405":"Under the aspect of life-threatening pneumonias in long-term ventilated patients receiving ant-acids or H2-antagonists the prophylaxis of stress ulcer with pirenzepine gains new importance. This study was aimed at detecting cardiac side effects of pirenzepine due to low receptor specificity. Pirenzepine (10 mg) was given via the peripheral or central venous route at an injection velocity of 5 or 30 seconds as well as a control of 2 ml normal saline solution via the central venous route for 5 seconds, 20 times each. Heart rate and blood pressure were determined before and after the injection. Independent of the injection site or velocity, an increase in the heart rate was found after the injection of pirenzepine. The increase was more marked if the central venous route was used. The percentage rise in heart rate was up to the thirteenth minute highly significant when comparing pirenzepine to normal saline solution. There were no changes in blood pressure. If M1-cholinoceptors are blocked, a reduction of the heart rate is seen. Blocking M2-cholinoceptors causes a rise in the heart rate. Injecting 10 mg of the M1-antagonist pirenzepine results in a significant increase in the heart rate, independent of site or velocity of injection which can be explained by blocking M2-cholinoceptors at the same time. To prevent this probably dose-dependent effect, pirenzepine should be given slowly over a couple of minutes.","3406":"A patient is presented in whom an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developed after severe lung contusion. Exchange of gas was markedly restricted under aggressive respiration (FiO2 = 1.0, PEEP = 10 mmHg, breathing time quotient = 0.5, respiratory minute volume = 16 litres; gas exchange values: PaO2 = 67 mmHg, PaCO2 = 45 mmHg, PA-aO2 = 461 mmHg). After control of the computed tomogram of the lungs showed marked densifications in those parts of the lung that are lower most by gravitation according to the positioning of the patient at a particular time the patient was ventilated in ventricumbent (prone) position for 60 hours. After having remained in this position for 48 hours, there was a significant improvement in the gas exchange (PaO2 = 89 mmHg, PaCO2 = 36 mmHg, PA-aO2 = 77 mmHg at FiO2 = 0.3, PEEP = 6 mmHg, breathing time quotient = 0.5 and respiratory minute volume = 9 litres). The control CT in dorsal position showed that the dorsal densifications had disappeared completely. Five days later the patient could be extubated. Respiration in ventricumbent (prone) position may considerably improve oxygenation by perfusion of well-ventilated regions of the lung that are lower-most by gravitation according to the relative positioning of the patient. Besides regions not well ventilated or not ventilated at all (according to the patient's position) may be better ventilated or re-opened and made accessible to ventilation by this method.","3407":"A previously used order schedule for procuring blood concentrates was reviewed, as the need for blood had changed due to the application of blood saving methods. Furthermore, the indication to blood transfusion has been reduced as a result of the potential danger of infection with AIDS. In 1035 patients, we compared the number of preoperatively ordered with the number of perioperatively transfused units of blood. In addition, we documented the factors which lead to increased blood ordering. The relation between ordered and transfused units of blood in total was 596\/97 (Urology: 392\/78, Gynaecology: 179\/18, ENT and Ophthalmology: 25\/1). Anticoagulation, anaemia, secondary illnesses and specific surgical problems have been identified as factors leading to increased blood ordering. As to many units of blood are being crossmatched without being transfused, we developed a revised blood ordering schedule. According to this schedule for certain surgical procedures typing and screening only should be done rather than crossmatching.","3408":"Carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) and methemoglobin (MetHb) in venous blood were determined by oximetry in 1000 non-hospitalised preoperative patients. 370 of them were smokers (S), 630 non-smokers (NS). In addition, in five S we compared the oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (SaO2, p) with that measured by in vitro oximetry (SaO2) and that calculated with reference to COHb (SaO2,korr). MetHb (0.66 +\/- 0.21%, mean +\/- standard deviation) was found to be of no relevance. COHb in S (5.12 +\/- 2.25%, maximum 12.4%) was significantly higher than in NS (1.82 +\/- 0.3%, range 0.9%-4.0%) and is therefore of importance in S for the oxygen transport and for the interpretation of SaO2, p, which overestimated SaO2 at a COHb level of 4.4 +\/- 0.7% by 4.5 +\/- 0.9%. The difference between SaO2, korr (calculated according to Forstner) differed from SaO2 by 0.66 +\/- 0.5% only. We conclude that there is an indication for in vitro oximetry in non hospitalised smokers or cases of unknown smoking history. If oximetry is not available, both a reduction of O2-binding hemoglobin and an overestimation of SaO2 by pulse oximetry in an order of ten per cent should be taken into account. To compensate for dyshemoglobin fractions, pulse oximetry using more than two wavelengths is desirable.","3409":"Anesthesia-related mortality rate is estimated at 1 death per 10,000 procedures. Four general failures in anesthesia management are responsible for the majority of deaths: difficult intubation, aspiration, insufficient ventilation, and insufficient volume substitution. More than half of all critical incidents are considered preventable--by better patient preparation, better monitoring or increased vigilance. One in ten patients complains of simple complications such as nausea, vomiting, or a sour throat. In addition, 10% of all patients experience intra- or postoperative complications such as arrhythmia, hypo- or hypertension. Several patient-related factors, such as age or the number of coexisting diseases, as well as management factors, such as choice of anesthetic technique or the experience of the anesthesiologist, are important determinants of morbidity and mortality. This review gives a comprehensive summary of recent results in risk-analysis and the study of critical incidents in anesthesia.","3410":"","3411":"","3412":"","3413":"","3414":"The authors report on their results of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) which was performed in a group of 11 comatose patients following elective neuro-surgery of different midline lesions (e.g. tumours, aneurysms of the anterior communicating artery). Carbohydrates were administered from day 1 postoperatively in a dose of 18-24 kcal\/kg BW\/day. Amino acids were given as a commercially available 12.5% solution (1.4-1.83 g\/kg BW\/day). Daily routine laboratory values were measured as well as levels of total serum protein, albumin, prealbumin, and retinol-binding protein. Free amino acids in plasma were measured on the day of operation and on day 3, 5, and 7 postoperatively. Renal nitrogen loss was high with maximal values up to 30 gm\/day. By TPN cumulative nitrogen balance remained positive until day 2 and was reduced to -61.8 g at the end of the study period. Short-lived serum proteins remained normal. Free FAA's in plasma increased steadily with their highest levels on day 5 and 7 (twice the normal range). Besides slight elevation of liver enzymes and mild hyperglycaemia, no severe changes were observed in routine laboratory parameters. The authors conclude that severe catabolism is a common feature in comatose patients after elective midline surgery and is comparable to catabolism following brain injuries. TPN is well indicated in this group as it preserves visceral protein levels and reduces nitrogen loss without severe side effects.","3415":"","3416":"Presentation of a newly conceived measuring instrument to determine the energy expenditure of critically ill patients at the bedside by means of indirect calorimetry. The special advantages of the measuring instruments are easy handling, little maintenance and very low working expenses and prime costs. The accuracy of measurement is considerable nd is comparable with that of other measuring methods, as has been established by an extensive validation.","3417":"Blood gases, pH, sodium, potassium, chloride, and ionised calcium in whole blood samples can be determined simultaneously in modern instruments. Preparing syringes with conventional heparin solutions causes a relevant bias of the electrolyte concentrations (especially K+ and Ca2+) by dilution of the sample. Additionally, ionised calcium is decreased by binding to heparin. The solution described in the present paper yields a final heparin concentration of 4-6 mU\/l, thus eliminating the calcium binding effect. The dilution effects are antagonised by an electrolyte composition that is similar to normal plasma. The heparin solution is commercially available.","3418":"The neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is one of the most dramatic psychiatric disorders every doctor in intensive care medicine can be confronted with. Two cases of successful treatment of NMS with intravenous application of dantrolene are presented. Although we used two very different doses, the treatment results were the same. Further studies will therefore be necessary to assess the optimal doses for this therapy.","3419":"Reduction in pain perception during ESWL due to a technical modification of the lithotriptor was expected and prompted a reassessment of anaesthesia techniques for ESWL. In this study the need for analgesic treatment had to be investigated. After satisfactory preliminary results in a previous pilot study, the value of the oral combination of the anti-anxiety drug dipotassium clorazepate on the evening before ESWL together with the analgesic tilidine-naloxone before treatment was tested in a randomised double-blind study in 120 patients. In case of intolerable pain during the treatment all patients were free to ask for additional intravenous analgesic medication (fentanyl). During ESWL, 28.3% of the tilidine-N group patients and 6.7% of the placebo group were pain-free, whereas intolerable pain was reported by 30% of the tilidine-N group and 56.7% of the placebo group. Therefore, 70% of the tilidine-N group patients were treated without any additional analgesic or sedative medication. The good experience with this oral anaesthesia approach, the lack of significant side effects and a good acceptance by the patients warrant further recommendation of this technique.","3420":"Various studies showed an increase of anxiety and agitation after premedication with thalamonal. Subject of the present study was to specify if the psychotropic effect of the neuroleptic drug dehydrobenzperidol given during surgery is also evident during the postoperative period. Patients undergoing tympanoplastic surgery under general anaesthesia were examined by means of a psychometric analogous self judgement scale seven hours following surgical intervention. Sleep behaviour during the first postoperative night was evaluated via a question sheet. The results show that changes in condition, known from the thalamonal discussion, e.g. increase of agitation, irritability, anxious depression -- also occur during the postoperative period. During the first postoperative night, sleep was greatly disturbed. The results of a comparison group who received the benzodiazepine dipotassium clorazepate instead of dehydrobenzperidol showed a better postoperative condition and sleep behaviour.","3421":"Thiopentone concentrations in blood following injection of the induction solution (Thiopental, 2.5%) may be critical in the context of lethal complications arising during induction of anaesthesia and thereby the toxicological aspects of this drug can become an issue in forensic considerations. The study was designed to find out whether the dose of injected thiopentone may be calculated from blood levels measured in nine pregnant and ten non-pregnant patients. The doses injected ranged from 4-5 mg per kg body weight. The drug was administered as a single bolus dose to the patients undergoing Caesarean section. In the non-pregnant group the first dose of thiopentone was given over 25 s. After that repeated doses of 50 mg were injected over 2s every 20s until the eyelid reflex was ceased. Blood samples for determination of thiopentone were withdrawn from an indwelling catheter inserted to a large cubital vein in the arm opposite that used for the injection and thiopentone levels were measured from blood after column extraction (Extrelut) using spectrophotometry. Venous peak values were found 40-115s after injection in the Caesarean group (mean: 20.3 micrograms kg-1) and were higher than in the non-pregnant patients (97-190s, mean: 17.8 micrograms kg-1). No correlation was found regarding venous peak levels (mgkg-1 blood) and induction dose (mgkg-1 body weight), neither in the pregnant nor in the non-pregnant group. Our findings would suggest that the injected thiopentone dose cannot be calculated from the concentration of the drug in the blood. Forensic conclusions concerning the onset of lethal complications during the induction of anaesthesia cannot be drawn on the grounds of venous thiopentone concentrations.","3422":"","3423":"","3424":"In the early postoperative period after liver transplantation a possible neurotropic side effect of middle-chain triglycerides used for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) was evaluated by EEG and Glasgow Coma Scale. Group I: no fat for TPN; Group II: 0.7 g\/kg body weight (BW) and day, of MCT\/LCT emulsion; Group III: 1.5 g\/kg BW and day, of MCT\/LCT emulsion. Only on postoperative day 5\/6 significant differences in distribution of background activity in the EEG were seen between Group I and II. Patients in Group I showed more pathological EEG patterns (Mann-Whitney-U-test p less than 0.05). Per discriminant analysis an influence of applicated fatty acids on the registered background activity could be excluded. Instead an underlying rejection of the graft in 7 of 10 patients could be made responsible for deterioration of the EEG pattern. Following the presented data a negative neurotropic effect of MCT\/LCT emulsions in the described dosages can be negated.","3425":"Controversies exist over the influence of inhalation anaesthesia on blood flow regulation in response to local alveolar hypoxia. This study investigates the blood flow diversion from a hypoxic to an oxygenated lung in anaesthetized and ventilated animals in comparison to unanaesthetized animals. Chronically instrumented adult ewes (n = 14, 32-45 kg) were intubated one week after surgery with a modified Carlen's tube, allowing separate ventilation of the left and right lung. In the awake state (n = 7) or after one hour of constant anaesthetic conditions (n = 7, halothane 1.6% and 2.4%), cardiac output (thermodilution) and left pulmonary blood flow (ultrasonic transit time) were evaluated. Then, under identical ventilatory conditions, the left or right lung, alternately, was rendered hypoxic for 10 min by ventilation with nitrogen. The contralateral lung was ventilated with oxygen. After 10 min, haemodynamics were again recorded. The changes in left pulmonary blood flow under unilateral lung hypoxia were similar either in the awake or the anaesthetized state. Thus, we conclude that, under these experimental conditions, halothane anaesthesia and mechanical ventilation have no influence on blood flow regulation under unilateral lung hypoxia.","3426":"The perioperative period is hazardous for patients with neuromuscular disorder. In case of dystrophia myotonica the anaesthesist must avoid all stimuli that may cause a myotonic crisis. If neuromuscular blockade is required, the moderately long-acting vecuronium bromide seems to be the drug of first choice. Blockade and recovery should be monitored. Postoperative pulmonary complications can be minimised by using regional anaesthetic techniques including epidural anaesthesia with local anaesthetics and\/or opioids.","3427":"The efficiency of intraoperative and postoperative autotransfusion with a cell separator, the elimination of a cephalosporin administered for prophylaxis of infection and bacterial contamination of the blood retransfused were studied in 56 patients undergoing hip arthroplasty (n = 33) or exchange reoperation of hip arthroplasty (n = 23). Intraoperatively only a limited amount of the lost erythrocytes could be retransfused: in hip arthroplasty 250 ml (median) packed red cells of 700 ml blood loss, in exchange reoperation 750 ml of 2200 ml. Postoperative autotransfusion was more effective: during the autotransfusion period (until 6 h after the beginning of the operation) 375 ml of 650 ml and 500 ml of 830 ml could be retransfused in the two groups. Cefuroxime was eliminated effectively from the autologous blood by the cell washing process, usually below the limit of detection. In the washed autologous red blood cells of 3 patients (= 5.4%) bacterial contamination could be demonstrated in low titres (less than or equal to 10\/ml). No clinical signs of bacteremia were observed during retransfusion. Postoperative autotransfusion contributes considerably to the total amount of autologous erythrocytes retransfused. Bacterial contamination of the processed autologous blood is infrequent and probably without clinical significance.","3428":"The effect of 0.2 mg\/kg body weight intranasal midazolam as a premedicant was investigated in 38 children (age 2-13 years, body weight 10-28 kg) prior to ENT surgery. Intranasal midazolam showed a rapid onset of action with 79% and 95% of the children being sufficiently premedicated at 5 minutes (p less than 0.05) and 10 minutes (p less than 0.01) after application, respectively, as opposed to 45% prior to this. This finding is in keeping with pharmacokinetics showing a tmax of intranasal midazolam of 11 minutes and a bioavailability of 51% in children (10). With the advent of a higher concentrated solution of midazolam intranasal application is also conceivable as a premedication in adults.","3429":"Transfusion of homologous blood may be associated with various complications. In this review, the authors present concepts of prevention of homologous blood transfusion. Different autotransfusion techniques are discussed, i.e., predeposit of autologous blood, plasmapheresis, normovolaemic haemodilution, blood salvage with\/without cell washing, postoperative blood salvage of drainage blood, anaesthesia and surgical techniques as well as drugs for minimizing blood loss. The third part of the essay deals with indications of each technique depending on the surgical field. The authors conclude with unanswered questions and problems of the future.","3430":"","3431":"An extraordinary occurrence of death is reported due to blocking of the entrance of the larynx by a denture adhesive.

Therefore a coniotomy or a tracheotomy should be performed.","3432":"We describe a transport concept ensuring unlimited continuation of cardiocirculatory monitoring, drug therapy and artificial ventilation during transfer of critically ill patients within the hospital. The basis of this concept is a mobile transport unit which can be hooked to the patient's bed, containing a power pack for the monitor, respirator or other devices dependent on power supply. The concept probably improves safety of patients not only during postoperative transfer of the ICU but enables also the safe transfer of critically ill patients from the ICU to diagnostic or therapeutic procedures.","3433":"Expired air resuscitation forms an essential part of First Aid in patients with respiratory insufficiency. The use of devices should encourage the rescuer to start the measure, make it easier to perform and protect him from a possible transmission of infectious material. 17 devices (mask, tube instruments) were examined in respect of their physical properties (resistance, leakage). None of them fulfilled all the criteria relevant for their use. In most of them changes and modifications seem to be necessary. Mask and tube instruments have definitive disadvantages compared to foil-like adjuncts which are being developed at present.","3434":"Each year we treated approximately 40 patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in our department of anaesthesiology. In these cases we found with bronchoalveolar lavage followed by microbiological examination, a high incidence (40 per cent) of pneumocystis carinii contamination. An infection with Pneumocystis carinii deteriorates the clinical course of ARDS. Effective drugs were the combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. Under this therapy we always saw a decrease of infiltrations in the chest-x-ray as well as an improved gas exchange. No relapse was seen in any case.","3435":"Depending on surgical and anaesthesiological procedures, anaesthesia leads to a reduction of O2 uptake (VO2), CO2 production (VCO2) and resting energy expenditure (REE). A controversial discussion on the degree of metabolic depression has continued in the literature fueled by a lack of studies in patients under standardised conditions. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether O2 consumption and\/or CO2 production can be correlated to various depths of anaesthesia and whether VO2 could be a parameter to control narcosis. 12 patients (ASA I-II) scheduled for urological surgery of the lower abdomen, were given total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol and alfentanil. During a 60 minutes period the patients were first anaesthesized with an ED50 and then titrated to a dosage correlating with an ED95. The premedicated but awake patients each showed a REE which was about 10% below the calculated basal metabolism. Steady-state general anaesthesia led to an approximately 30% reduction of VO2, VCO2 an REE. Patients with adequate anaesthesia revealed no changes in oxidative metabolism with increased or decreased depth of anaesthesia. VO2 as a leading parameter proves to be problematic. It is useful as a measure for insufficient depth of general anaesthesia but fails to indicate overshooting anaesthesia depth.","3436":"Perforation of the oesophagus, as well as a pneumothorax are described as complications of the use of a nasogastric feeding tube. Clinical tests to determine correct placement are noted to be unreliable and the importance of radiological control, especially in the unconscious patient, ist stressed. The suspected diagnosis of oesophageal perforation should be verified without delay to immediately initiate conservative or surgical treatment.","3437":"40 adult patients, ASA class I-III, were studied with regard to their arterial oxygen saturation during transportation from the operating room to the recovery room, following ophthalmic surgery under general anaesthesia. Before transportation the patients were breathing oxygen spontaneously for 6 min.; during transportation they were breathing air. The time for the transport from the operating room to the recovery room was between two and eight minutes. Hypoxaemia (SaO2 85-90%) was observed in 18 cases, severe hypoxaemia (SaO2 less than or equal to 85%) in 5 cases.","3438":"A 19-year-old patient intending to commit suicide gave himself an intravenous injection of about 14 g methyliodide. The patient was admitted to our hospital in a state of somnolence and agitation followed by a cerebral convulsion and severe hypotension. The serum concentration of methyl iodide was measured by mass spectroscopy. In addition to an antidote therapy with acetylcysteine, haemoperfusion was performed followed by a remarkable decrease of the methyliodide concentration. The patient survived this severe intoxication and was discharged from the hospital after a week.","3439":"For 253 frequently used drugs therapeutic and, if data were available, toxic, and fatal plasma concentrations as well as elimination half-lives were compiled in a table. To assess the significance of drug levels for the therapeutic monitoring of patients, it is essential that a collection of data is readily available. In addition, this list can assist the diagnostic assessment in case of intoxications.","3440":"Since the first characterization of the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), knowledge of its aetiology and pathogenesis has grown considerably. In spite of this, mortality remains up to 50 to 90%, particularly if multiple organ failure is present. Because no causative clinical therapy is available up to now, significant attention is given to preventive measures like early operative stabilisation of long bone fractures, or prophylaxis of nosocomial infections. After clinical manifestation of ARDS, treatment focuses on functional disturbances of the cardiopulmonary system and on the underlying disease. The aim of this symptomatic therapy is to ensure oxygen supply according to the organisms demand. It is still unknown, however, whether the mortality of patients with ARDS can be reduced by optimising the oxygen supply. In general, oxygen supply can be enhanced by improving pulmonary gas exchange, cardiac output and blood oxygen transport capacity. For practical use the therapy often ends up with a therapeutical dilemma: On one hand, the improvement of the pulmonary gas exchange by application of PEEP can be associated with a critical decline in cardiac output, particularly if the afterload of the right ventricle is elevated. On the other hand, to increase cardiac output, both volume replacement and vasodilators can severely affect pulmonary gas exchange if the alveolo-capillary permeability is increased and pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction is disturbed. Thus, oxygen supply can be optimised only via invasive monitoring of the cardiorespiratory system. Although still experimental, the most promising approaches seem to be pharmacological interventions directed at suppressing the formation and effects of various humoral and cellular mediators. An improved understanding of the inflammatory processes might provide new insights in the pathophysiology of ARDS and the related therapeutic interventions.","3441":"Experience has shown that the bolus injection of streptokinase during resuscitation in case of fulminant pulmonary embolism considerably improves the prognosis. In the case presented here a 64-year old female patient with a fulminant pulmonary embolism was injected with 2 x 1,000,000 I.U. urokinase after 20 minutes of unsuccessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Ten minutes after the second injection the circulation could be stabilised by drugs only. The patient survived without any lasting damage. The mechanism of fibrinolysis during resuscitation is discussed. It is also possible to check the diagnosis during resuscitation using echocardiography or angiography. However, treatment must usually start immediately only on clinical diagnosis. Resuscitation in the case of a pulmonary embolism can even be successful after much longer than one hour. Contra-indications must be ignored in such cases. Side effects, which are usually haemorrhages, can as a rule be treated. In our opinion urokinase should be given by preference in the bolus injection during resuscitation. The exception to this is the primary operation during resuscitation. Pulmonary embolectomy is also possible after unsuccessful fibrinolysis.","3442":"Neuropsychological and neurophysiological investigations indicate that the underlying framework of adequate sensory information processing is a 30-40 Hz oscillatory brain mechanism, which also can be observed in mid-latency auditory evoked potentials (MLA-EP). Since high incidence of stimuli perception and wakefulness is a phenomenon during Caesarean section under general anaesthesia it was studied if auditory evoked 30-40 Hz oscillation correlate with intraoperative wakefulness during this surgical procedure. Following informed consent, 21 patients were selected for elective Caesarean section. Anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone (5 mg\/kg b.w. i.v.) and maintained with thiopentone bolus injection (1-2 mg\/kg b.w.i.v). and O2\/N2O 1:1 according to clinical signs of adequate anaesthesia. After delivery, a balanced anaesthetic technique using fentanyl, enflurane and N2O in O2 1:1 was employed. Clinical signs of intraoperative wakefulness were spontaneous movements of the limbs, mimics, eye-opening, wakefulness after auditory stimulation (tape A: crying baby, tape B: classical music), one hour and 24 hours postoperatively reported dreams, hallucinations and detailed reports about intraoperative events. Auditory evoked potentials were recorded on-line before and during general anaesthesia, during the entire surgical procedure. Latencies of the peaks V, Na, Pa were measured. Employing Fast-Fourier transformation analysis, corresponding power spectra were calculated to analyse energy portions of AEP's frequency components. Spontaneous motoric movements occurred in 60% of the patients and did not correlate with heart rate, blood pressure or other clinical signs of inadequate anaesthesia. Provoked motoric reactions were 4 times as often after presentation of tape A as after tape B.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","3443":"Onset time, intubation condition and recovery time after single bolus injection of atracurium (0.3 mg\/kg in body weight less than 10 kg (Group 1), 0.5 mg\/kg in body weight greater than 10 kg (Group 2] and vecuronium (0.05 mg\/kg in body weight less than 10 kg (Group 3), 0.1 mg\/kg in body weight greater than 10 kg (Group 4] were studied in 40 infants and children anaesthetised with halothane. At the end of the onset time (time from the end of the bolus injection of the muscle relaxant until the maximal twitch depression of the m. adductor pollicis) the intubation conditions were judged as good or very good in both groups. The onset time after bolus injection of atracurium (92.5 +\/- 31.9 sec in Group 1, 117.0 +\/- 25.2 sec in Group 2) was slightly shorter than after vecuronium (135.7 +\/- 64.1 sec in Group 3, 123.3 +\/- 26.8 sec in Group 4). The duration from the time of injection to 75% recovery of T1 had been longer by using atracurium (45.2 min in Group 1 + 2) than by vecuronium (36.6 min in Group 3, 34.2 min in Group 4). In infants (Group 1 + 3) the recovery time (duration from 25% to 75% recovery of control twitch height) after relaxation with atracurium as well as vecuronium was longer than in children (Group 2 + 4). Neither cardiovascular side effects nor signs of histamine release occurred after the injection of both muscle relaxants at our dosage level. It is concluded that in infants and children atracurium is a real alternative to vecuronium for relaxation for medium long surgical procedures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"},"articletitle":{"0":"[Measurement of Anti-SARS CoV-2 Antibodies following Vaccination: Valuable Monitoring or Irrelevant Tool?]","1":"[Practice-guided Presentation of the German S3 Guideline \"Strategies to Warrant Rational In-hospital Use of Antibiotics\"].","2":"[Hemodynamic Monitoring 2.0 -
