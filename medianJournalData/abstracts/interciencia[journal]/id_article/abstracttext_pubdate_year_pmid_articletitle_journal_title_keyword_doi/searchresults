{"articleID":{"0":0,"1":1,"2":2,"3":3},"abstracttext":{"0":"Cultural ecology, ethnobiology, sociobiology, models of subsistence and of cultural transmission, and applied ecology as parts of human ecology have a common denominator:  they all present an ecological basis as continued biological force.  Both the concepts and analytical models of ecology are necessary for understanding the relationship between man and nature.  Cultural ecology studies the influence of environmental variables on the behavior of human cultures; sociobiology studies the biological bases of behavior; and ethnobiology studies classification systems of nature.  The disciplines of anthropology, geography, sociology, and psychology represent specific branches of human ecology. Cultural ecology or ecological anthropology arise from the interaction of ecology (evolution of systems) with anthropology.  Sociobiology evolved since the early 1970s, and it includes the disciplines of classical ethnology, evolutive ecology, and genetics.  The interaction of evolutive ecology with ethology helped create sociology.  In Brazil the study of human ecology on indigenous human populations (in particular in the Amazon basin) deals with cultural ecology, ethnology, and models of subsistence (goal model, models of decision, the theory of players, linear programming, central place foraging).  Recent work includes that of Neves (1989), Moran (1983), and Fearnside (1986) who studies acculturated Brazilian half-breed Indians, fishermen, and migrants.  Ethnobiology is well represented in Brazilian studies of indigenous populations.  The works of Posey (1983) about ethnobotanics, ethnoentemology, and ethnoecology with Kayapo Indians are distinguished. Studies about littoral populations and other fishermen and agriculturists include such ecological aspects as territoriality (Forman 1970), diversity, and subsistence models (Begossi 1992, Begossi and Richerson 1993), ethnoichthyology (Marques 1991), and food taboos (Begossi 1992).  In the social, environmental, and conservationist context, the studies of Diegues and Sales (1988) and Diegues (1989, 1990) deserve mentioning.","1":"Primary education, breastfeeding, oral rehydration therapy, and immunization provide effective strategies for countering the diarrhea, malnutrition, and infections that claim the lives of about 13 million children each year.  These interventions must be delivered as part of a primary health care package, not as isolated activities.  Most development aid assumes that economic growth alone will improve health, nutrition, and education; however, experience has demonstrated that rapid economic growth will not necessarily improve living conditions for the majority of people in developing countries.  The Chinese triad of primary health care, primary education, and agricultural reform offers a model for child survival and development.  Much of the funding for improved child survival in developing countries will have to come from the developed world.  Investments in children do not pay off for a long time, a fact that has hindered such investment.  Moreover, natural and man-made disasters have siphoned off much aid that could be allocated toward child survival.  However, these diasters will only increase unless investments are made in family planning, health care, and education.  In the long run, funds for child health will save both lives and money.","2":"Unlike hospital-oriented western medical practice, traditional medical science and technology include aspects of botany, anatomy, psychology, psychiatry, and sociology.  Indigenous medical treatment has been successful in extensive comminuted fractures, psychosomatic disorders, and frantic manic psychosis.  Traditional practitioners also work to prevent disease.  They often advise against marriages that might perpetuate diseases.  Traditional birth attendants and doctors in Africa, Asia, and Latin America routinely perform external cephalic versions on women with breach birth presentations thereby avoiding the need for often risky and undesirable cesarean sections.  In many cultures, traditional birth attendants and female advisors from within and outside immediate families are among the regular local services available to mothers during gestation and early child care periods.  Breastfeeding, which has been discouraged in industrialized countries, is nutritious and partially serves as a form of contraceptive to aid in child spacing, especially if lactation is prolonged.  In most hospitals in developing countries, in contrast to western hospitals, the mother is encouraged to stay with her sick child to provide psychological support and assist with feeding and some aspects of care and treatment.  Family organizations and extended families help in child bearing, care and nurturing and continues into socialization and adolescence.","3":"A very judicious planning for the development of sciences and technology is very important in developing countries.  Planners should define those fields which are susceptible of progress, taking into consideration the availability of human resources and of technological infrastructures already existing in the country in those particular fields.  To create a condition in which domestic scientific and technological capacity might become autonomous, the planning should be incorporated into the long term socioeconomic development of the country, and it should be relevant to the country's needs.  A link must be established between the production of new knowledge and new technology, and the economic and political systems.  Domestic scientific and technological culture must be advertised, to create a preference by consumers for domestically produced knowledge, bearing in mind, however, that totally autonomous production is very seldom achieved in developing countries, and that overplanning can be not only frustrating, but economically disastrous."},"articletitle":{"0":"[Human ecology: an overview of man-environment relationships].","1":"Child health as an investment.","2":"Lessons from traditional medical and health practices.","3":"[Science and technology planning in LDCs: major policy issues]."},"doi":{"0":"","1":"","2":"","3":""},"journal_title":{"0":"Interciencia","1":"Interciencia","2":"Interciencia","3":"Interciencia"},"keyword":{"0":"AmericasAnthropologyAnthropology, CulturalBiologyBrazilCultureDeveloping CountriesEcologyEnvironmentGeographyHuman GeographyLatin AmericaLiterature ReviewSocial SciencesSouth America","1":"BiologyChild HealthChild Mortality--prevention and controlDelivery Of Health CareDemographic FactorsDeveloping CountriesEconomic FactorsFinancial ActivitiesFundsHealthHealth ServicesMacroeconomic FactorsMedicineMortalityPopulationPopulation DynamicsPrimary Health Care","2":"AfricaAsiaDelivery Of Health CareDemographic FactorsDeveloping CountriesHealthHealth ServicesLatin AmericaMedicineMedicine, TraditionalPopulationPopulation CharacteristicsRural Population","3":"Developing CountriesEconomic DevelopmentEconomic FactorsSocial DevelopmentTechnology"},"pmid":{"0":12345859,"1":12314564,"2":12310946,"3":12261396},"pubdate_year":{"0":1993,"1":1986,"2":1981,"3":1979}}
