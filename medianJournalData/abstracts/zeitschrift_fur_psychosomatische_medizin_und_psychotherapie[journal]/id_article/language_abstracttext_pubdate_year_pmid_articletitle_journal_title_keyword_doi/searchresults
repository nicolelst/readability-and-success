experience of early traumatic experiences and relationship-specific attachment styles in alcohol-dependent patients Objectives: The present investigation studied the differences in emotional experiences among alcohol-dependent patients in inpatient psychotherapy, taking into account their traumatic experiences and relationship-specific attachment styles. Three standardized instruments were used on this clinical sample of 70 patients in inpatient psychotherapy: (1) Scales for Experiencing Emotions (SEE), (2) Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), (3) Relationship-Specific Attachment Scales for Adults (RASA). The results showed that traumatic experiences in childhood and adolescence as well as relationship-specific attachment styles were indeed associated with deficits in emotional experience and regulation. Especially emotional abuse was associated with deficits in emotional experience. An insecure attachment style was associated with a lower level of acceptance of emotions, a lower level of self-control, and dysfunctional emotion regulation. In particular, the attachment style to the mother seems to be important. These results suggest that a distinction of alcohol-addicted patients, with respect to attachment styles and traumatic experiences in childhood and adolescent, seems to be important in order to define specific interventions to improve the ability to regulate emotions.

Recently, another line of argumentation emerged, claiming that psychodynamic therapy may work, but that the mechanisms of change underlying its effects were not clear or even could not be tested empirically at all. The present article critically reviews these allegations. The allegations put forward were shown to be mostly untenable. Mechanisms of change of psychodynamic therapy are testable and have been tested empirically. There is evidence for both the efficacy of psychodynamic therapy and for the assumed mechanisms of change. The repeatedly presented critique by representatives of other approaches seems to be motivated more by political than by scientific reasons. However, further research on both the outcome and process of psychodynamic therapy is required.

Despite highly developed implants and surgery, however, this treatment does not always succeed in relieving pain and restoring joint function, i.e., in restoring satisfactory algofunction. Clinicians partly blame psychological factors for this discrepancy, especially in the absence of objective medical complications. The present review summarizes previous studies on the role of psychosomatic interactions affecting the course after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). During the perioperative period, patients with TKA suffer from marked psychic distress that is also linked to the postoperative algofunction. We discuss the theoretical and clinical implications of the findings reviewed.

Support via a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is an alternative to optimised medical management for patients with advanced heart failure. This study evaluated health-related QoL with both therapy options. In this consecutive cross-sectional study, patients with LVAD support (n = 50) and patients with optimised medical management (n = 50) were interviewed comprehensively about various domains of QoL, emotional stress, perceived self-efficacy, social support, life satisfaction, and communication. LVAD patients had a better overall QoL (KCCQ, clinical summary: MW: 67.4 vs. 52.9). Patients with medical management reported increased emotional stress stemming from depressed mood (HADS-D, MW: 7.1 vs.MW: 6.0). Depressed mood proved to be the most significant negative predictor for health-related QoL as well as for emotional well-being. Although they had a worse clinical situation preoperatively, LVAD patients had a significantly better QoL in both physical dimensions and functional competencies as well as significantly less psychological stress through depressed mood and anxiety.

Yet there is a substantial lack of empirical evidence for Balint group effects. 1,460 medical specialists who participated in 352 different Balint groups were investigated using the Balint Group Questionnaire (BG-F) at the end of a Balint group session. Using mixed-model analyses, we examined the predictive value of the independent variables Experience in Balint Groups (in years), Clinical Experience in General (in years), Case Presentation vs. Nonpresentation, Facultative vs. Obligatory Participation (status) with regard to scale characteristics of the BG-F: Scale 1: Reflection of Transference Dynamics in the Doctor-Patient Relationship, Scale 2: Emotional and Cognitive Learning, Scale 3: Case Mirroring in the Group Dynamic. Mixed-model analyses were calculated separately for the subgroups Balint Experience &lt; 1 year (vs. &gt; 1 year) and for Balint Experience &lt; 2 years (vs. &gt; 2 years). Complete data were available for 1,400 participants. On Scale 1, \"somatic\" doctors scored significantly higher than \"psyche\" doctors. Case presenters scored significantly higher than nonpresenters. On Scale 2, \"somatic\" doctors showed highly significantly higher scores than \"psyche\" doctors. Case presenters also scored highly significantly higher than nonpresenters. Doctors with &lt; 2 years of Balint group experience had significantly higher scores than those with &gt; 2 years. On Scale 3, case presenters scored highly significantly higher than nonpresenters. Group participants with less Balint group experience (&lt; 1 year) had significantly lower scores on Scale 3 than group participants with more experience with Balint groups (&gt; 1 year). Participation in Balint groups generates important effects on doctors' knowledge regarding the doctor-patient relationship, both privately as well as professionally. These results confirm scientifically specific effects of Balint groups, providing empirical evidence for the importance of Balint group experiences for professionals in the medical field. ","207":"A retrospective study of expert opinions of a psychosomatic-psychotherapeutic university hospital for public and private customers over a period of 12 years Objectives: Both the public and the legislative have developed an increasingly critical awareness for the fact that expert witnesses need to be independent. In contrast, to date there have been few studies concerning the quantity and the results of psychosomatic-psychotherapeutic expert opinions for public and private clients. In a retrospective study design, 285 expert opinions of a psychosomatic-psychotherapeutic university hospital stemming from consecutive, unselected random sampling over a 12-year time period (1990-2011) were analyzed using a predefined list of criteria. Besides client data, the study also noted the type and the objectives of the expertise, the sociodemographic data of the subjects, the biographic data of the subjects, the size of records, the particular psychopathological findings including conflict and structural diagnostics via the Operationalized Psychodynamic Diagnostics (OPD-2, Research Group 2006), syndromic diagnostics according to ICD-10 (WHO) including the related Impairment Scale Score (ISS, Schepank 1995), and the Global Assessment of Functioning-Scale (GAF, Heuft 2016). 54% of the subjects were men. All subjects were 46 years old at the time of examination; on average symptomatology had existed for 7 years, which made assessment of causality difficult. Most assignments referred to the effects of diseases or accidents in private contexts, followed by pension reports. Among the expert opinions related to possible implications of acts of violence, 95% were women. In 43.2% (n = 123) of the cases, the assessment had occurred in the context of legal action. In 65 cases at least one party had requested a supplemental written report during further procedure. In 17.8% (n = 22) of the cases sought by the courts, the expert witness was requested by at least one party to present the assessment verbally. It should be emphasized that OPD conflict and structural diagnostics appear indispensable also for assessing mental health prior to an external event (accident or assault). The use of the two severity ratings (ISS, GAF) is discussed. It is proposed that expert witnesses be requested to name all their clients fromthe last 5 years at the beginning or end of the expert opinion, so that their independence from possible conflicts of interest can be established.

Physicians' attitudes and expectations toward treating patients with a migration background Objectives: Undergraduate and postgraduate training in cultural competence remains a challenging issue. It might be useful to integrate culturally sensitive learning objectives in existing curricula. As part of a needs assessment, this qualitative study examined the prototypical experiences in clinical routines with patients with a migration background. Twenty physicians took part in half-structured narrative interviews, which were then analyzed by linguistic-ethnographic conversation analysis. The main reasons for difficulties in patient-physician relation proved to be language barriers. Assignments of professional interpreters were rated critically. Physicians attributed the responsibility for successful communication mainly to the patient. The physicians saw little need for training in cultural competence. The integration of learning objectives related to cultural sensibility in existing curricula would seem to be useful, especially because the physicians interviewed reported little need for additional training on their own. The importance of implied negative attitudes and stereotypes in creating a culturally sensitive approach should be taken into account.

We assume that patients with different levels of structural integration differ in the contextual embedding of their negative facial expressions of emotions. Facial affective behaviour of 80 female participants during an OPD interview was analysed using FACS (Facial Action Coding System) and the RFE coding system (Referencesof- Facial-Expression coding system; Bock et al. 2015).Using the RFE coding system, 2192 negative facial expressions of emotions were attributed to different references (e.g., interactive, self-related, object-related) by relying on contextual variables. Pure frequency of negative facial affect was not related to level of structural integration. Negative facial expressions of emotions directed towards the interviewer (interactive reference), as well as negative facial expressions directed towards the displayer's whole self were associated with lower levels of structural integration. In contrast, negative facial affects directed to single aspects of the self, to single aspects of objects, or to external situations were associated with higher levels of structural integration. The differentiation of references of facial affective behavior allows a deeper understanding of the connection between facial displays and structural levels of psychic integration. ","249":"Affective change has been considered the hallmark of therapeutic change in psychoanalysis. Psychoanalytic writers have begun to incorporate theoretically the advanced understanding of emotional processing and transformation of the affective neurosciences. We ask if this theoretical advancement is reflected in treatment techniques addressing the processing of emotion. We review psychoanalytic models and treatment recommendations of maladaptive affect processing in the light of a neuroscientifically informed model of achieving psychotherapeutic change by activation and reconsolidation of emotional memory. Emotions tend to be treated as other mental contents, resulting in a lack of specific psychodynamic techniques to work with emotions. Manualized technical modifications addressing affect regulation have been successfully tested in patients with personality pathology, but not for psychodynamic treatments of axis I disorders. Emotional memories need to be activated in order to be modified, therefore, we propose to include techniques into psychodynamic therapy that stimulate emotional experience.

A recent meta-analysis reported results in favour of pharmacotherapy. Individual studies and meta-analyses on the comparative efficacy of psychotherapy vs. pharmacotherapy were reviewed. Evidence suggests that psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are equally efficacious in the short-term, but psychotherapy is superior in the long-term. For the recently stated hypothesis that pharmacotherapy is superior to psychotherapy in studies without a pill placebo condition, which implies equally including a positive expectancy effect for both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy no evidence was found. Depression may be treated by psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy with equivalent results in the short-term and advantages for psychotherapy in the long-term. As the rates of response and remission are still limited in both treatments, further improvement of treatments is required.

Detailed descriptions and evaluations of specialized psychosomatic treatment are rare. This pilot study investigates the feasibility of inpatient and day hospital treatment of patients with burnout syndrome. Additionally, we present results of an initial, noncontrolled, pre-post-evaluation of changes in symptoms and individual work-related risk factors for burnout. Sixty-four consecutive patients with burnout syndrome were assessed before and after specialized multimodal treatment using a clinical symptom checklist (ICD-10 Symptom Rating) and burnout-specific instruments (Maslach Burnout Inventory, Occupational Stress &amp; Coping Inventory). Patients' average age was 45 (range 23 to 61), 70% were currently employed, 24% in managerial positions or self-employed, and 89% diagnosed with an affective disorder. The average length of time off work due to illness in the past year was 13 weeks. Treatment lasted five weeks on average. After treatment, depression (p &lt; 0.001; effect size d = 0.79), emotional exhaustion (p = 0.001; d = 0.41), and the subjective significance of work (p = 0.001; d = 0.36) decreased, while emotional distancing (p &lt; 0.001; d = 0.56), balance and mental stability (p &lt; 0.001; d = 0.38) and life satisfaction (p &lt; 0.001; d = 0.37) increased. Clinical significance was determined using the Reliable Change Index. The treatment program described here is well accepted by patients with severe burnout. It contributes to positive changes in symptoms and work-related risk factors. Controlled studies are necessary to establish treatment efficacy.

A catalogue of learning objectives (LO) based on existing references was developed to assist medical schools in meeting this requirement. A body of relevant material was compiled using literature research and surveying experts. Then, in a multiphase Delphi process, this was evaluated and condensed by an interdisciplinary working group in dialogue with external (clinical) experts. Competence levels and examples of clinical application were assigned to enhance implementation. The catalogue was revised by the medical faculties, professional associations and the BVMD. This learning catalogue comprised 116 learning objectives for the specific skills necessary to conducting medical consultations as well as exemplary application contexts. The catalogue proved to be practical in terms of developing curricula and networking at medical schools. This catalogue of learning objectives can serve as the basis for developing a sample communication curriculum for use by medical faculties.

This complex of problems could be reduced remarkably by integrating psychosomatic departments into hospitals with maximum medical care. Admitting a few big psychosomatic specialist clinics into the calculation basis decreased the Day-Mix Index (DMI). The massive reduction of the calculated costs per day leads to a gap in funding resulting in a loss of the necessary personnel requirements - at least in university psychosomatic departments. The objective of this article is therefore to empirically verify the reference numbers of personnel resources calculated on the basis of the new German lump-sum reimbursement system in psychiatry and psychosomatics (PEPP). The minute values of the reference numbers of Heuft (1999) are contrasted with the minute values of the PEPP reimbursement system in the years 2013 and 2014, as calculated by the Institute for Payment Systems in Hospitals (InEK). The minute values derived from the PEPP data show a remarkable convergence with the minute values of Heuft's reference numbers (1999). A pure pricing system like the PEPP reimbursement system as designed so far threatens empirically verifiable and qualified personnel requirements of psychosomatic departments. In order to ensure the necessary therapy dosage and display it in minute values according to the valid OPS procedure codes, the minimum limit of the reference numbers is mandatory to maintain the substance of psychosomatic care. Based on the present calculation, a base rate of at least 285 e has to be politically demanded. Future developments in personnel costs have to be refinanced at 100 %.

We conducted structured biographical interviews with 83 Catholic pastoral professionals (47 priests, 36 lay pastoral workers). Attachment representations were diagnosed by use of the Adult Attachment Projective Picture System (AAP). Psychosomatic health data (Brief Symptom Inventory - BSI-18) were taken from the associated German Pastoral Ministry Study. In the sample, the proportion of secure attachment representations was 23%, of insecure- dismissing 39%, of insecure-preoccupied 18% and of unresolved attachment status 21%. Individuals with secure attachment representation were associated with lower values of psychosomatic stress, while individuals with insecure-dismissing and unresolved attachment status had higher values. The amount of insecure attachment representations and psychosomatic symptoms is higher than in data from the healthy samples, especially in the cohorts between 1933 and 1945. Data from biographical interviews indicate the significant role of institutional attachment to the Church, in many cases possibly compensating for dysfunctional parental relationships in personal history.

High expenditures derive frommental health care costs, including medication. In this article we investigate whether the costs and usage of psychopharmaceutic products in Austria are rising. We did a descriptive analysis of the sales figures and number for packaging units of pharmaceutical products of ATC-classes N05 and N06 in all Austrian hospitals, pharmacies and medicine chests for the years 2006-2013. All data were provided free of charge by IMSHealth. The sales volume and number of prescribed packaging units of pharmaceuticals of ATC-classes N05 and N06 increased over the time period in question. In 2013, about 25% more packaging units were being sold than in 2006. Among the two ATC-classes, however, the indication subgroups developed differently. Expenditures increased a total of about 31%within the period of consideration. The increase in psycho-pharmaceutical sales exceeds the expansion rates of other health expenditures (17.8 %). During the 9 years of observation, 25% more psychopharmaceutical products were sold. This may result from increased prevalence of mental disorders, higher usage or an increment in prescriptions.

Prompted by the proposition to favor general, disorder-oriented psychotherapy, we investigate how timely distinctive methods are that are taught in training and practice. We reviewed the pertinent literature regarding general and specific factors, the effectiveness of integrative and eclectic treatments, orientation toward specific disorders, manualization and psychotherapeutic training. There is a lack of systematic studies on the efficacy of combining therapy methods from different approaches. The first empirical findings reveal that a superiority of combined versus single treatmentmethods has yet to be demonstrated. The development of transnosological manuals shows the limits of disorder-specific treatment.General factors such as therapeutic alliance or education about the model of disease and treatment rationale require specific definitions. Taking reference to a specific treatment approach provides important consistency of theory, training therapy and supervision, though this does not preclude an openness toward other therapy concepts. Current manualized examples show that methods and techniques can indeed be integrated from other approaches. Integrating different methods can also be seen as a developmental task for practitioners and researchers which may be mastered increasingly better with more experience.

Confirmatory analyses show a good model fit and support the proposed structure with 25 items and seven scales. In addition, reliability indices were stable throughout multiple assessments over time. Concerning validity, early IDES process measures were moderately associated with symptomatic improvement. The IDES is a psychometrically reliable questionnaire for the evaluation of process factors in inpatient and day-clinic psychotherapy settings.

Concurrently, the diagnostic possibilities regarding the health of the unborn child have been elaborated. The present literature review describes and discusses the possibilities of assisted reproduction (in-vitro fertilization (IVF), intracytoplasmic sperm injection ICSI, cryopreservation, conception of children with the help of a third person) with respect to their psychosocial meaning for those affected and for the children conceived in this manner. The psychological strain pairs experience in the context of prenatal diagnostics and the resulting decisions are illustrated by a case study.

Here, the classic division by discipline and organ system has been abandoned, which requires each discipline to define its own core curriculum in specific catalogues of learning objectives. This article presents such a catalogue for Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy. A two-step DELPHI-method was used to survey faculty representatives for Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy. It reflected the discipline-specific university catalogues of learning objectives as well as the NKLM. A catalogue of learning objectives was then developed and approved. The catalogue consists of two parts: (1) a 12-module core curriculum for Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy and (2) selected interdisciplinary learning objectives from the NKLM with relevant participation of the discipline in ten modules. For the first time in Germany, this article presents a catalogue of learning objectives for Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy that is agreed upon by the relevant representatives. This enables the integration of psychosomatic and psychotherapeutic teaching contents from a department into the overall curriculum as required by the NKLM. In the future, methods should be established to allow regular updating and further development of this catalogue.

This makes short versions of field-tested approaches such as the OPD Structure Questionnaire (OPD-SQ) necessary. With the aim of developing a screening version, the original sample of the OPD-SQ was divided into two subsamples. After developing a preliminary 12-item version in one subsample, we used confirmatory factor-analysis in the second subsample as well as an independent sample to test the factor structure. The analyses confirmed a structure of three correlating factors with adequate fit indices. Other findings relating to the validity of the long version were replicated as well. In addition, data from an independent sample of psychotherapy inpatients confirmed the factor structure and provided further evidence for its validity. The OPD-SQS is a viable screening instrument for supporting clinical decision making in stepped-care approaches in psychotherapy, psychosomatic medicine and psychiatry.

In Study 1 we analyze a partial sample of 20 interviews and postulate 10 categories of functions that can be arranged into three main categories (interactive, self and object). In Study 2 we rate the facial expressions (n=2320) from the OPD interviews (10 minutes each interview) of 80 female subjects (16 healthy, 64 with DSM-IV diagnosis; age: 18-57 years) according to the categorical system and correlate them with problematic relationship experiences (measured with IIP,Horowitz et al. 2000). Functions of negative facial expressions can be attributed reliably and validly with the RFE-Coding System.

Recently, acceptance-based approaches have received growing attention within the treatment of chronic tinnitus. The development of tinnitus acceptance within CB treatment remains unclear. This study investigates the efficacy of a CBT group therapy and the corresponding change in tinnitus acceptance. 68 outpatients took part in a CBT group therapy over a 3-month period. Effect sizes and paired t-tests were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the CBT treatment and to investigate the development of acceptance. Results showed a significant decrease in tinnitus distress and an increase in tinnitus acceptance. Improvements were maintained over a 6-month follow-up period in which large effect sizes were observed. CBT is considered an effective treatment for tinnitus distress in patients with chronic tinnitus. Acceptance of chronic tinnitus clearly improved within a CBT group therapy.

It also touches on methodical challenges and solution processes. Children born of war resemble a target group that is difficult to reach (hidden population). Therefore, an investigation needs consultation of both people from the target group and scientific experts (participatory approach) as well as specific methodological approaches. The questionnaire utilized contains adaptations of established and psychometrically validated instruments as well as adapted self-developed items. N = 146 occupation children were surveyed (mean age 63.4, 63.0% women) via press release and contact to platforms of children born of war. Despite methodological challenges an instrument to assess the target group was developed through participatory methods. The instrument shows high relevance for the target group and is highly accepted.

The paper looks at the experiences from that time and the different modalities of how they were processed and compares them with the mental repercussions today. Evaluation of completely transcribed interviews with 31 female and 29 male contemporary witnesses (at the time of the firestorm between 3 and 27 years old) using \"systematic diagnostic assessment.\"A matrix of the rated diagnostic characteristics was subjected to factor analysis and scales of severity were established in order to calculate correlation coefficients and to determine the degree of interdependence of the diagnostic characteristics. The primary experience of those interviewed was being bombed out of their homes, often with a complete loss of all personal belongings. In particular, the sight of dead bodies has remained in their thoughts to this day. The persistent psychological consequences include anxiety, nightmares, and an aversion to certain noises and smells that continue to be associated with the firestorm. The initial experiences after the war proved to be crucial to their subsequent well-being. Discussions of their dreadful experience remained mostly rare, but when they did occur, they were beneficial to their overcoming the associated trauma. We successfully quantified the essential qualitative information. Long-term psychological outcome appears to depend not only on the severity and circumstances of the - often traumatic - experiences during the war. The individual experiences in the years after the war held an important sway over subsequent well-being to the present day.

We examined N= 548 patients with primary depressive disorders using a naturalistic design. Using a latent-state-mixture model and depression measures at baseline, therapy end and 1-year follow-up we found a total of five patterns. Subgroups were compared with respect to sociodemographic and treatment-related variables. Responders with moderate depressive symptoms at baseline and responders with severe symptoms at baseline were most common (54% and 25% of the sample, respectively) compared to late responders (9 %), small-response patients (9 %) and recidivists (4 %). Patterns of change were related to symptom intensity at baseline and ratings of perceived helpfulness at the end of treatment. Since psychometric scales better predicted change pattern than sociodemographic characteristics, primary and secondary diagnoses, psychometric assessments and feedback systems could be a useful supplement to traditional quality assurance procedures.

There was a marked improvement in the realization of personal resources during inpatient psychotherapy, which showed significant correlations to the improvement of symptoms. The extent of improvement of resources correlated with the duration of psychotherapy and the assessment of the psychodynamic therapy foci on the HSCS. The results show that personal resources are activated when successfully working on the psychodynamic foci in psychodynamic inpatient treatment, and that this corresponds to an improvement of symptoms. ","283":"The currently dominating research paradigm in evidence-based medicine is expounded and discussed regarding the problems deduced from so-called empirically supported treatments (EST) in psychology and psychotherapy. Prevalent political and economic as well as ideological backgrounds influence the present dominance of the medical model in psychotherapy by implementing the randomized-controlled research design as the standard in the field. It has been demonstrated that randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are inadequate in psychotherapy research, not the least because of the high complexity of the psychotherapy and the relatively weak role of the treatment concept in the change process itself. All major meta-analyses show that the Dodo bird verdict is still alive, thereby demonstrating that the medical model in psychotherapy with its RCT paradigm cannot explain the equivalence paradox. The medical model is inappropriate, so that the contextual model is proposed as an alternative. Extensive process-outcome research is suggested as the only viable and reasonable way to identify highly complex interactions between the many factors regularly involved in change processes in psychotherapy.

We found significant sex and age differences concerning narcissistic self-expression. Significant differences between the three groups as well as significant correlations with common clinical instruments (BSI,IPO, IIP) revealed narcissistic self-expression to be problematic.

This paper presents first results of a naturalistic multicenter intervention study. Included were female inpatients suffering from depressive symptoms who had been admitted to 15 psychodynamically oriented psychosomatic hospital units (N = 487). The mean duration of treatment was 61.8 days. Data were acquired at admission (T1) and discharge (T2). Our findings support previous evidence and show that psychodynamically oriented inpatient psychotherapy of depressive disorders is efficient. High pre-post effect sizes were documented in all psychometric instruments used (BDI, HAM-D, SCL-90-R, BSS, GAF). Initial subgroup comparisons reveal that the benefits for patients with comorbid personality disorder are significantly lower than for depressed patients without comorbid personality disorder. Psychodynamic inpatient psychotherapy, as practiced under naturalistic conditions, is an effective treatment of depression. Predictors of therapeutic effects within different therapeutic settings, however, remain unclear.

The 16-item short version of the Inventory of Personality Organization (IPO-16) is a self-report measure assessing the severity of personality dysfunction. This study provides representative norms and determines the smallest real difference value for the IPO-16. Standardization of the IPO-16 was based on a representative survey among the German general population (N = 2502). Retest reliability and the smallest real difference were assessed in a separate longitudinal online survey, whereby participants completed the IPO-16 three times at time intervals of 2 months (N = 495). The average IPO-16-mean score in the general population was 1.87. The influence of age and sex was small, albeit statistically significant.We therefore developed sex- and age-specific norms. The average retest reliability across 2 months was .85, and the smallest real difference was 0.66.

Twenty-eight adolescents fulfilling the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria of borderline personality disorder were treated with psychodynamic therapy. The mean duration of treatment was 29.87 weeks (SD = 15.88). Outcomes were remission rates, GAF, GSI, SDQ, IIP and BPI scores. Assessments were made at admission and after treatment. Pre-post comparisons and comparisons with normative data were conducted. At the end of treatment 39.29% of the patients were remitted. We found significant improvements for the GAF, GSI, SDQ, IIP (all p0.001) and the BPI (p = 0.006). These clinically relevant improvements demonstrate the effectiveness of psychodynamic therapy in adolescents with borderline personality disorder and stress the usefulness of an early intervention for these patients.

It also impairs their well-being and the course of mental disorders.We analyzed whether by addressing unhealthy behavior prevention can be integrated into psychodynamic psychotherapy. We reviewed the literature on the role of unhealthy behavior for mental disorders, on the role of lifestyle risk factors in psychodynamic theory, and on barriers to the integration of addressing lifestyle in psychodynamic psychotherapy. Smoking, unhealthy dietary habits, and physical inactivity constitute dysfunctional behavior, resulting from maladaptive self-representations and an impairment of emotion-regulation capacities. In psychodynamic psychotherapy this maladaptive behavior can be addressed and treated as a kind of defensive behavior and resistance. We believe that by addressing unhealthy behavior prevention can become a crucial task for psychodynamic psychotherapists today.

A total of 51 cancer patients were assessed with the FreiburgMindfulness Inventory (FFA;Walach et al. 2004), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-D; Herrmann et al. 1994), and the Schedule for the Evaluation of Individual Quality of Life -DW (SEI QoLDW; Browne et al. 1997). The nonlinear relationships were analyzed using the instantaneous indirect effect procedure by Hayes and Preacher (2010). The relationship between mindfulness and QoL is mediated by depression. Because the relationship between mindfulness and depression is squared, the total effect of mindfulness on QoL is not constant. Increasing the level of mindfulness results in a decrease in its effect on the QoL of cancer patients. Cancer patients benefit from mindfulness up to a medium level through a decrease in depression, resulting in higher QoL. Patients with very higher mindfulness show more depressive symptoms, which leads to a neutralization of the effect of mindfulness on QoL.

About 70% and 75% of the respondents approved active euthanasia and assisted suicide, respectively. Religious denomination and psychological distress had a significant impact on the attitude towards active euthanasia. About 10%of the deceased patients had asked for active euthanasia. There was no difference between bereaved family members and the general population regarding the acceptance of euthanasia. Attitudes towards active euthanasia are associated with psychological distress and shaped by cultural values rather than by the experience of end-of-life care.

Patients with Social Anxiety Disorder exhibited a significantly more negative self-concept than the norm (all ps0.001). Their self-concept improved significantly in all facets following psychotherapeutic short-term intervention (all ps0.01).

Subgroup analyses were performed for F45.0X, F45.3X, and F45.4X as well as a combined group of F45.1X, F45.2X, and F45.5X. Symptom severity decreased for all subgroups of somatoform disorders. The pre-post effect size was d = -.58 for the Symptom Check-List 90-R (GSI), and -1.26 for the impairment score rated by the therapist. Symptom levels differed among the various subgroups; patients with somatoform pain had the highest scores. Patients with various somatoform disorders appear to profit well from psychosomatic inpatient psychotherapy. Patients with somatoform pain disorders reported the lowest effect on GSI, but received the highest effect in the therapist ratings. ","315":"The \"Fragebogen zur Sozialen Integration (FSI)\" is the German adaption of the \"Social Adjustment Scale (SAS-SR)\". So far, there is no validation of the FSI with regard to patients with cancer. The scales leisure time, relatives and partnership of the FSI were test-statistically analyzed in hemato-oncological patients. Concordant validity was examined referring to the German version of the \"Social Support Questionnaire (F-Sozu)\" and one scale of the \"EORTC QLQ-C30\". In N = 184 participants, we observed in 1% - 20% missing values for several items. Ceiling effects could be observed for the scales relatives (1.22-2.20), whereby for the scales leisure time (1.27-2.95) and partnership (1.51-3.91) the range was substantially higher. Internal consistency averaged about 0.75 (leisure time, partnership), respectively, 0.69 (relatives). Analyses for validity showed values of -0.23 to -0.50 (F-Sozu) as well as -0.29 to -0.40 (EORTC QLQ-C30), respectively. The FSI is a reliable questionnaire to assess social adjustment within hemato-oncological cancer patients. However, psychometric properties in previous studies with psychosomatic patients were better. The high amount of missing values on several items in our study suggests a partial revision of the this instrument would be advisable for use in oncology. ","316":"","317":"Quality assurance in psychosomatic medicine in Austria is currently based on a voluntary continuing medical education programme in psychosocial, psychosomatic and psychotherapeutic medicine. It is questionable whether psychosomatic care can be sufficiently provided in this manner. In addition, a broadly based proposal to create a subspecialty in psychosomatic medicine in order to facilitate quality assurance, is investigated. The necessity to reorganize psychosomatic care was explored through semi-structured qualitative interviews with experts. Data-based analyses probed the labour market of the proposed subspecialty, and the literature was reviewed to look into the cost-benefit ratio of psychosomatic treatment. All experts expressed a need to restructure psychosomatic care in Austria. Examples exist for psychosomatic treatment with an efficient cost-benefit relation in diverse medical settings. Establishing a subspecialty in Psychosomatic Medicine seems feasible and could contribute to increased quality assurance and the nationwide provision of psychosomatic care. ","318":"This article examines the associations between protective factors und the occurrence of postpartum depressive symptoms. Using a prospective-longitudinal design 303 pregnant women were examined at 3 points in time (T1: 1st trimester, T2: 3rd trimester, T3: 3-5 months postpartum). The analyses are based on T1 and T3. Sense of coherence (SOC-L9, Schumacher et al. 2000) at 1st trimester was on average 51.7 (SD = 7.2) - significantly above the mean of a comparison sample. 37 women (15.4 %) had a score of 10 or more on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS, Cox et al. 1987) 3 to 5 months postpartum. Pregnant women who stated that their pregnancy had been planned and desired, with a higher marital and overall life satisfaction as well as a higher sense of coherence, had a significantly lower risk for the development of postpartum depression. Using multiple regression it was found that only sense of coherence significantly predicted postpartum depression. The results suggest that a higher sense of coherence at first trimester is an important protective factor for the occurrence of postpartum depression. ","319":"The aetiology of somatoform disorders is assumed to consist of several factors, as alexithymia, dysfunctional cognitions and emotion regulation. As a consequence of somatoform disorders social withdrawal is discussed. Several studies prove connections between mental problems, emotion recognition, and functioning social relationships. A sample of 35 patients suffering from a somatoform disorder and a sample of 73 persons without any somatoform symptoms were investigated according to their ability to identify emotional facial expressions (computer-assisted presentation of photos). Our results demonstrate significant differences in the ability to decode others' emotional states between people with or without somatoform disorders. In all six tests the patients achieved significantly worse results. Our results suggest that psychotherapeutic treatment of patients with somatoform disorders should also focus on the recognition of emotions and deal with them. ","320":"The present paper focuses on clinical issues concerning the psychopharmacological treatment of severe forms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Using a case study, we discuss problems in this field against the background of psychodynamic and psychotraumatological theories. We also present strategies for the appropriate use of psychotropic drugs in the psychotherapy of PTSD. ","321":"This study explores patients' utilization of psycho-oncologic support and the effectiveness thereof. At the hospital in Munich-Harlaching, 51 patients were recruited following their first admission to the breast centre, 27 of whom utilized the psycho-oncologic service. They were compared to 24 decliners of the service. All patients completed self-rating questionnaires (Distress-Thermometer and Patient Health Questionnaire) at admission and at release. Group differences were calculated statistically by chi-square- and t-tests. We found no significant differences between users and decliners concerning socio-demographic and somatic data, but there were significant group differences in mental health. Users reported more mental distress and more depressive and anxiety symptoms. Psycho-oncologic interventions showed small to large effect sizes. Although this study corresponded more to external than to internal validity standards, it did yield provisional empirical evidence that psycho-oncologic interventions are effective in the treatment of the mental symptoms of breast cancer patients. ","322":"Dysfunctional parenting styles represent a risk factor for the development of psychological disturbances. The present study investigated the differential validity of the German language Fragebogen zur Erfassung dysfunktionaler Erziehungsstile (FDEB; Measurement of Parental Styles, MOPS) and determined whether different forms of psychological disorders are associated with specific patterns of parenting styles. 145 inpatients, 108 outpatients and a control group of 633 representative individuals from the general population were investigated by adapting the FDEB. A comparison of dysfunctional parenting styles showed different distress levels within the diagnostic groups: Patients suffering from depression reported high levels of maternal indifference and over protectiveness together with an abusive rearing behavior on the part of both parents. Patients with anxiety disorders reported having overprotective mothers. Bulimic patients as well as those with personality disorders significantly exhibited stress in almost all areas. However, anorexic patients did not differ significantly from the control group, which appeared to be the least affected of all. The FDEB showed a satisfactory differential validity. There was evidence that specific patterns of dysfunctional parenting styles were associated with different diagnostic groups. ","323":"We examined the attitude towards the importance of medical psychotherapy among physicians working in a hospital. We focused on their opinion about the general role of medical psychotherapy within the health care system as well as on their opinion about the importance of medical psychotherapy in different clinical situations. 105 physicians with various clinical specialties were interviewed using a questionnaire designed for this purpose. From the point of view of the interviewed physicians, medical psychotherapy plays an important role. Especially medical psychotherapists are considered to be competent in cases of life-threatening situations resulting from mental disorders (such as suicide, anorexia nervosa), in psychopharmacological treatment as well as in cases of medically unexplained physical symptoms. Furthermore, medical competence in psychotherapy is requested wherever there is close connection to physical illness (such as stressful events in medical contexts). Especially in times of increasing specialization of physicians there is a need for medical psychotherapy in inpatient health care and clinical consultation.

Together with the related social and psychosocial aspects, they contribute to and enrich the development of new options in diagnosis and psychotherapy. Important research results are discussed here based on the examples of depression, Alzheimer's disease and self-injury, which profit greatly from neuropsychological research, especially through early detection of symptoms and prevention. ","326":"This article investigates the development of the inpatient treatment capabilities of older patients from the age of 50 onward in inpatient psychosomatic-psychotherapeutic departments over a period of 15 years. A Germany-wide postal survey that was almost identical to two previously conducted cross-sectional surveys (Lange et al. 1995; Wenker 2010) was sent to psychosomatic-psychotherapeutic departments. This survey collected data on the status and concept of the department as well as on the number of patients, number of elderly people, programs for elderly people, and future concepts of the departments. The response of psychosomatic departments was higher than in previous years. The forms of therapy used differ between the individual clinic subtypes. The programs for elderly people remained constant, as did the special qualification measures for employees. Proportionally more elderly patients from the age of 50 onward were treated in psychosomatic clinics and departments, two thirds of whom were women. The survey revealed that psychosomatic-psychotherapeutic therapies for the treatment of elderly people increased over the last year. With regard to the demographic change and the future receptiveness of elderly people to psychotherapy, the inpatient sector seems to be prepared for the rising numbers of elderly people. How large the lack of therapy capacity needed for inpatient psychosomatic-psychotherapeutic treatment will be cannot be answered by this survey. ","327":"This study investigates the symptomatic and interpersonal efficacy of inpatient psychodynamic psychotherapy as well as the influence of several patient- and treatment-related factors on the success of psychotherapy. In this naturalistic study, 715 patients were assessed with the Symptom Checklist (SCL-90-R) and the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP). The influence of several patient-and treatment-related factors on the success of psychotherapy was analyzed using logistic regression. Patients improved significantly on all SCL-90-R and IIP scales. The patients' attachment style, ICD-10 diagnosis, and motivation for therapy, as well as additionally job situation for the symptomatic outcome and additionally age for the interpersonal outcome, were significant predictors of therapeutic success. Patients with a secure attachment style, a diagnosis of depression, and a high motivation for therapy are more likely to experience therapeutic success than other patients. Furthermore, regular occupational activity has a positive effect on symptomatic treatment outcome, while a younger age has a positive effect on interpersonal treatment outcome. ","328":"At the centre of the study lay a representation of outpatient psychosomatic and psychotherapeutic care with a focus on different groups of medical and psychological therapists. The routine data of the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians (KBV) from the year 2008 were analyzed based on a systematic literature review (Medline, ISI, to November 2010). Neurologists and psychiatrists see the most patients (n = 3,172 vs n = 1,347 cases per practice), but they rarely provide services according to the directives for psychotherapy (4,4 %). However, specialists for psychosomatic medicine and psychotherapy (65 %), physicians providing only psychotherapy (66 %) and psychological psychotherapists (73 %) provide care mainly according to the directives for psychotherapy and therefore see fewer patients (170-190 cases per practice).Medical psychotherapists work more often on a psychodynamic basis, while psychological psychotherapists perform more often behavioral therapy. The treatment of patients with mental and psychosomatic disorders is based on three columns of care, which differ in their supply profile and each make a specific contribution to the treatment. ","329":"There are different approaches to whether depressed people perceive their environment differently than nondepressed.We analyzed whether depressed patients show greater deficits in decoding emotional expressions than nondepressives. A sample of 52 depressed patients and a sample of 72 nondepressed persons were investigated as to their ability to identify emotionally laden facial expressions (computer-assisted presentation of photos). Our results demonstrate significant differences between depressive patients and nondepressive persons in the ability to decode the emotional states of others. In four out of six tests the depressive persons achieved significantly better results. We suggest that these results can be interpreted as further evidence for the concept of depressive emotional realism.

We summarize the basic tenets of attachment theory, detail the content and structure of the AAI, provide instructions for conducting the AAI, and introduce the Main et al. (2002) coding system. We then report on associations between AAI-Attachment groups and psychosomatic diseases and, finally, demonstrate applications of the AAI in clinical work and research.

In a sample of 513 subjects (261 persons with Polish migration background and 252 autochthone Poles) depression (BDI), anxiety (BAI), and somatic complaints (GBB-24) were measured. Immigrants of Polish origin showed a significantly higher level of anxiety as well as somatic complaints but only a tendency toward higher depressiveness than the German normvalue, but not than that of the native Poles. Female immigrants showed an overall higher number of symptoms in the three domains in question compared to German women and - except for depressiveness - also compared to male immigrants. Persons with a Polish migration background present levels of mental distress higher than the general German population, but similar to the population of their country of origin. Further research is needed to clarify the special structure of the mental morbidity in Polish immigrants.

The present review article shows the special role the wives, and in particular the children, of missing German soldiers played in society and discusses the impact of their loved ones being unaccounted has had on the mental health of this group. An overview of current research on the psychosocial status of the war generation is given following a short historical introduction to the theme. Subsequently, we discuss the legal and social situation of the families of missing German soldiers during the postwar decades. Finally, two psychological concepts drawn from the US research show that specific disorders, such as complicated grief or \"boundary ambiguity,\" can occur in the relatives of missing persons and blur the line between hope and grief occurring as a result of ambiguous loss. The psychosocial impact of having a relative go missing has hardly been noticed in the German research tradition after World War II. Particularly in light of the age structure of those directly affected and the experiences of transgenerational transmission this neglected psychosocial research subject urgently needs further scientific investigation, inasmuch as the age of the family members still allows it. ","335":"Depressive symptoms are common among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). They are associated with both high morbidity and high mortality. In this explorative study we investigated the frequency of Major Depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder in a German dialysis center. We further investigated the correlation between expert-rating and self-report questionnaires as well as the extent to which somatic, dialysis-specific and sociodemographic parameters are associated with depressive and anxious symptoms. During dialysis treatment 52 patients (21 women and 31 men) aged 29 to 85 years with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-D). A physician administered the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) for the expert diagnosis of Major Depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Nine patients met DSM-IV criteria for Major Depression (17 %). The self-report scales showed depressive symptoms in 17 patients (33 %) and 8 patients (15 %), respectively. Generalized Anxiety Disorder according to SCID was diagnosed in 9 patients (17 %), while 12 patients (23 %) scored higher than seven points on the HADS Anxiety subscale. Depressive and anxious symptoms were associated with gender, employment status, and physical activity; anxious symptoms were also associated with the body-mass-index (BMI). The higher agreement between the HADS depression subscale and the SCID diagnosis of Major Depression suggests that the HADS-D depression subscale is more useful than the BDI when screening for depression in patients with ESRD. Physical activity seems to be a protective factor for patients with ESRD and should be further investigated. ","336":"The healthcare sector provides a wide range of services with various treatment approaches for mental or psychosomatic complaints. The present study assesses treatment preferences and knowledge within the general population in Germany. In 2011, a total of n = 2555 individuals aged 14-97 years were interviewed as part of a representative population survey. Using a structured interview, we examined the retrospective, current, and prospective utilization of outpatient psychotherapy, treatment preferences, and knowledge of the alternatives. Outpatient psychotherapy was currently or in the past used by 7.1 % of respondents, inpatient psychotherapy by 3.2 %. Medical psychotherapists were consulted by 12.5 %, psychological psychotherapists by 8.8 %o f the respondents. Future treatment expectations were directed more frequently towards medical than psychological psychotherapists. The primary care physician continues to play a pivotal role in the treatment of mental\/psychosomatic disorders. Treatment expectations were largely independent of the type of disorder. Women were nearly twice as likely as men to utilize or have utilized outpatient psychotherapy (9.1 % vs. 4.8 %). The existing outpatient care for patients with mental or psychosomatic complaints is well accepted among large parts of the population. For mental or psychosomatic problems, the majority of respondents prefer a medical psychotherapist. Further research needs to clarify which factors determine this preference. ","337":"The classification and therapy of patients with chronic widespread pain without evidence of somatic factors as an explanation is currently a matter of debate. The diagnostic label \"fibromyalgia syndrome\"(FMS) has been rejected by some representatives of general and psychosomatic medicine. A summary is given of the main recommendations from current evidence-based guidelines on FMS and nonspecific\/functional\/somatoform bodily complaints. The criteria of FMS and of persistent somatoform pain disorder or chronic pain disorder with somatic and psychological factors partly overlap. They include differential clinical characteristics of persons with chronic widespread pain but without sufficiently explaining somatic factors. Not all patients diagnosed with FMS meet the criteria of a persistent somatoform pain disorder. FMS is a functional disorder, in which in most patients psychosocial factors play an important role in both the etiology and course of illness. FMS can be diagnosed by looking at the history of a typical symptom cluster and excluding somatic differential diagnoses (without a tender point examination) using the modified 2010 diagnostic criteria of the American College of Rheumatology. Various levels of severity of FMS can be distinguished from a psychosomatic point of view, ranging from slight (single functional syndrome) to severe (meeting the criteria of multiple functional syndromes) forms of chronic pain disorder with somatic and psychological factors, of persistent somatoform pain disorder or of a somatization disorder. The diagnosis of FMS as a functional syndrome\/stress-associated disorder should be explicitly communicated to the patient. A therapy within collaborative care adapted to the severity should be provided. For long-term management, nonpharmacological therapies such as aerobic exercise are recommended. In more severe cases, psychotherapy of comorbid mental disorders should be conducted. The coordinated recommendations of both guidelines can synthesize general medical, somatic, and psychosocial perspectives, and can promote graduated care of patients diagnosed with FMS. ","338":"To review the current perspectives and trends of psychotherapy as a key area of psychosomatic medicine with regard to both societal and scientific challenges as well as patient health care services. Also, to draw conclusions regarding the future training and practice of psychosomatic medicine and psychotherapy. Psychotherapy is confronted with many new challenges because of the high prevalence of mental and psychosomatic disorders, because of their increasing recognition as major health problems and because of the rapid technological and demographic changes going on in modern society. Despite its growth, psychotherapeutic care is still limited in many, especially rural, regions and for patients with complex psychosomatic and somatopsychic disorders. New models of training as well as integrated and multimodal care are needed in order to provide both, rapid, low-threshold and specialized, disorder-specific care. ","339":"There is growing evidence from randomized controlled trials supporting the efficacy of psychodynamic psychotherapy (PDT) in specific mental disorders. Yet the evidence for the efficacy of psychodynamic psychotherapy has not gone unchallenged. Several responses have addressed these concerns, showing that most of the criticism was not justified. Nevertheless, the evidence for psychodynamic psychotherapy continues to be frequently ignored, criticized or presented in a distorted way. A recent controversy published in the Nervenarzt may serve as an illustrative example, which is discussed here more in detail. This example shows that some authors are not interested in a truly scientific discussion, but rather try to discredit a rival method of psychotherapy and its scientific representatives for political reasons.","340":null,"341":"The study explored the presence of stress symptoms among orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) recipients and investigated how stress symptoms are linked to health-related quality of life (HRQOL). A new concept of adjustment disorder as a stress response syndrome according to Maercker was considered. We recruited 76 OLT recipients, all of whom had been treated in the Department of Surgery, Division of Transplantation Surgery, University of Medicine of Graz, Austria. A self-rating scale was administered to evaluate stress symptoms (PTSS-10). The data on health-related quality of life were obtained from the SF-36 (Health Status Questionnaire). Following OLT 30.3 % (n = 23) of the sample suffered from stress symptoms. In the group of patients suffering from stress symptoms there were significant impairments in health related quality of life in the SF-36 health-related domains physical functioning, role physical, pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional, and mental health. OLT recipients may face a major risk of OLT-related postoperative stress symptoms in the sense of adjustment disorders according to Maercker.

Data analysis revealed significant differences between the students with regard to self efficacy expectation, depression, psychological distress, and satisfaction. Because no differences in coping strategies were found between the two groups of students, with the exception of relaxation techniques, the impact of contextual and structural factors on medical students' well-being is discussed.

The survey queried 175 therapists from different hospitals and professions who perform group psychotherapy in their hospital. The questionnaire focussed on training experiences, everyday group practice, and training needs. As expected, only some of the therapists had completed training as group therapist. The therapists are faced with a wide variety of group formats and patients in their everyday work and reveal a broad spectrum of training needs. The survey, although not entirely representative, indicates general and specific needs of group therapists within psychotherapeutic hospitals and underlines the role of training and therapist experience in reducing uneasiness toward group psychotherapy. ","344":"Previous studies have shown that psychosomatic rehabilitation treatments were less successful for patients with a migration background. These findings should be explored further with the help of interviews. The main aim of this study was to compare patients with and without a migration background with regards to social-demographic variables, disease model, symptoms, and the course and result of a psychosomatic rehabilitation treatment. 75 patients with and 75 without a migration background were analysed. Half-structured interviews were carried out at admission, discharge and three months after discharge from treatment. Patients with a migration background were \"sicker\" at the beginning of the rehabilitation. Especially men with a migration background benefit less from the treatment and often did not feel \"at the right place\" in the psychosomatic rehabilitation. Patients with a migration background have a more negative view of their work performance than patients without a migration background. Patient with a migration background should receive more information about psychosomatic disease models and different treatment methods prior to their rehabilitation therapy.

It studies the predictive value of pretreatment illness representations and how they change with respect to quality of life. In a pre-post measurement design, data were collected from 199 patients at pretreatment and from 172 patients at posttreatment. The instruments used were the Illness Perception Questionnaire and the World Health Organisation Quality of Life Questionnaire. Patients were on average 41 years old and had spent on average 44 days in the hospital. 76 % of them were women. Patients reported a significant enhancement of their symptoms and a reduction of perceived consequences. The illness representations of timeline and perceived control predicted altogether 11 % of the increase in quality of life. This increase also corresponds to a reduction of perceived consequences and an increase of control. Results point toward the importance of illness representations for patients regarding psychosomatic treatment. Therefore, consideration of illness representations during therapeutic interventions could increase quality of life.

The results are based on an overview of the literature reflecting reviews and meta-analyses. In the elderly, there is a substantial danger of confounding psychogenic with medical or drug-induced symptoms. Self-assessment scales may be useful for screening, but the results should be confirmed by an expert interview. Based on the available research, we cannot yet be sure whether the prevalence of depression and anxiety in the elderly population is in fact higher, lower, or equal to younger age groups. More women are afflicted with depression or anxiety than men. Pharmacotherapy (preferably antidepressants) and psychotherapy are effective for treating anxiety and depression in the elderly, with medium to high effect sizes.

Cognitive-behaviour therapy was compared with psychoanalytic and psychodynamic therapy in the treatment of patients with a primary diagnosis of unipolar depression. In a prospective, quasi-experimental design 100 patients were compared at pre- and post-treatment and three-year follow-up. Outcome measures were the Beck Depression Inventory and Global Severity Index for measuring symptoms, the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems and the Social Support Questionnaire for measurement of social-interpersonal functioning, and the INTREX Introject Questionnaire for measuring personality structure. Comparative effectiveness of the experimental groups was analyzed using mixed models. We found significant outcome differences between psychoanalytic therapy and cognitive-behaviour therapy in depressive and global psychiatric symptoms, partly social-interpersonal and personality structure at three-year follow-up. Psychodynamic therapy was superior to cognitive-behaviour therapy in the reduction of interpersonal problems. Psychoanalytic therapy shows significantly longer-lasting effects compared to cognitive-behaviour therapy three years after termination of treatment, which is discussed as a dose-effect.

However, to date there has been only little discussion about the application context and any necessary adaptations to various clinical fields. The working group \"Implementation of OPD in Clinical Practice\" proposes an algorithm for the sequential and adapted use of OPD depending on the clinical context. Especially for patients who are primarily not open to receiving psychotherapy, e.g., in psychiatric hospitals or general hospitals, OPD can be an important basis for structuring motivating interventions. A stepwise procedure is proposed which is adapted to the usage of OPD in such contexts. Furthermore, also for these contexts, simplified ratings are proposed and discussed for the axes relationships, conflicts and structure. However, complete OPD remains recommended when determining the focus of a psychotherapeutic treatment. ","351":"Family caregivers play an important role in palliative care. However, the number of studies focussing on the quality of life of these family caregivers is limited. The current study evaluates quality of life and satisfaction with medical care in bereaved family members. Comparisons were made between (1) male vs. female family caregivers (N = 44) and (2) bereaved family caregivers vs. general population (EORTC QLQ-C30). Furthermore, the satisfaction of the family caregivers with medical care was assessed after the death of their relatives (ZUF HOPE). The interviews were conducted between six and eight weeks following the death of the palliative patients. Regarding quality of life, bereaved family caregivers suffered from both reduced emotional functioning and general quality of life. Female caregivers had lower functional values and stronger symptoms of insomnia, fatigue and pain than male caregivers. Bereaved family caregivers had a lower quality of life than the general population. Retrospectively, family caregivers were very satisfied with most aspects of outpatient palliative care. The only aspect criticised by the bereaved family members was a lack of psycho-social support. Family caregivers need stronger support in order to prevent burnout and to improve outpatient care. In this context, gender differences must also be considered. ","352":null,"353":"ADHD can be regarded as a lifespan disorder. From biopsychosocial vantage point, ADHD leads to age-specific impairments, high psychological distress and is associated with a high occurrence of comorbid disorders. For this review, we summarize actual findings from epidemiological, neuroscientific and clinical studies to present an overview of ADHD-research. We discuss the proposed revisions for DSM-V criteria by comparing them with the present DSM-IV-TR criteria, with a focus on the implications for research and practice. In the second part of this paper, we present new findings from socioeconomic, diagnostic and therapeutic perspectives. There is evidence for a high economic burden that is indirectly caused by ADHD (e.g., production loss, material costs, higher accident rates). Consequently, there is a high demand for comprehensive diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. We present a summary of the latest available diagnostic instruments and therapeutic manuals. The results of research and practice show a growing support for a lifespan perspective on ADHD psychopathology. The burdens resulting from ADHD are evident in all age groups, which has led to establishing age-specific diagnostic and therapeutic materials. Although there is a lack in ADHD-specific healthcare in adulthood, this should be realized by structural changes in healthcare services.","354":"In clinical theory transference interpretations represent a central therapeutic technique and a specific mechanism of change in psychodynamic psychotherapies. However, the empirical basis lags behind the theoretical considerations. This article reviews both the results of empirical research on transference interpretations and their definitions of the measures employed (systematic database search for the timespan 1970-2011). The empirical results are rather heterogeneous and in part contradictory. As it turns out, specific patient characteristics (e.g., the quality of object relations), the amount and quality of transference interpretations as well as the patients' immediate reaction all decisively influence the potency of the change of transference interpretations. Currently, it is not possible to develop clear therapeutic strategies based on previous findings. Careful use of transference interpretations is generally recommended. Various methods for measuring transference interpretations exist, but the definitions do not correspond completely. A standardization of definitions would increase the comparability and interpretability of findings and greatly improve concordance with theory.","355":"","356":"This study investigated the relationship between meaning in life and coping with trauma, and correlations between posttraumatic growth and mental health.

At the beginning and the end of inpatient psychotherapy and at katamnesis 1 to 8 years later, patients were examined with self-assessment questionnaires (BSI, HADS, IIP). At katamnesis they also filled in a questionnaire designed to record improvement in symptoms, satisfaction with the inpatient treatment, and other psychotherapeutic and\/or psychiatric treatments. 87 (34.3 %) of the 253 participants were 50 years or older, 48 (18.9 %) 60 years or older at time of inpatient treatment. At katamnesis there were no significant differences between the older and younger patients regarding treatment satisfaction, improvement of symptoms, psychometric scales, and further in- or outpatient psychotherapy. Older patients can be treated as successfully as younger patients with inpatient psychotherapy in an age-mixed setting.

The interviews were analysed by means of qualitative content analysis. The categories \"development and course,\" \"coping with anxiety,\" \"image of one's mother\" and \"relationship with partner\" were determined and described. Finally, we developed data-driven, ideal-type models of pregnancies with pregnancy-induced hypertension versus normal pregnancies by detecting the similarities and contrasts between the groups. Interviewees with pregnancy-induced hypertension showed an ambivalence with regard to their pregnancy, which was more often than not unplanned and\/or unwanted. Conflicts with significant others, especially with their partners, were also reported more often. Emotions tended to be understated. The results can be employed in the operationalisation of future projects in a hitherto unclear research field. They should also be considered in the care of patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension.

We studied the association of C reactive protein (CRP), a biomarker of inflammation, with depressive symptoms in 292 women with CHD and 300 healthy age-matched controls, considering confounder variables (BMI, age, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, menopausal status). CRP was measured by a high sensitivity assay. In the overall sample no significant association was found between depressive symptoms and CRP, whereas in the control group women with 2 or more versus 0-1 depressive symptoms showed heightened CRP (p = 0.005); there was no significant difference in CRP levels between CHD patients with 0-1 versus 2 or more depressive symptoms. Women with CHD had higher serum levels of CRP and more depressive symptoms than did controls. Contrary to men and healthy controls there was no link between CRP and depressive symptoms in women with CHD. More research is needed on how the harmful effects of depression are mediated, especially in women. ","360":"The present study investigates the psycho-social stress, the treatment procedures and the treatment outcomes of stressed patients in the hospital from the perspective of the hospital doctors. Physicians from all disciplines who had completed the course \"Psychosomatic Basic Care\" as part of their specialist training documented selected treatment cases. 2,028 documented treatment cases of 367 physicians were evaluated. Anxiety, depression and family problems were the most common causes of psychosocial stress. In over 40 % of the cases no information was found on the medical history. Diagnostic and therapeutic conversations took place with almost half the patients (45%). From the vantage point of the physicians patients receiving diagnostic and therapeutic conversations achieved significantly more positive scores with respect to outcome variables than patients without these measures. Collegial counseling was desired for more than half of the patients and took place mainly among the ward team. There were few significant differences in the views of surgical and nonsurgical physicians. Psychosomatic basic care in general hospitals is possible, albeit with some limitations. Patients undergoing psychosocial interventions have better treatment outcomes. Therefore, extending training to 80 hours for all medical disciplines seems reasonable. ","361":null,"362":"This contribution provides an overview of the development of the professional specialty area of psychosomatic medicine and psychotherapy since its establishment by the German Parliament in 1992. First, the reasons behind the decision to create this professional specialty are elucidated. Then, the three revisions of the official training regimen, the subsequent development of the number of specialists in both outpatient and inpatient sectors, and the development of hospital wards for psychosomatic disorders and rehabilitation clinics for this purpose are discussed. The creation of this specialty may be judged to have been a successful venture that has led to a better treatment of the concerned patients. The recent development of specific psychosomatic research points to the increasing emphasis on special studies of bio-psycho-social interactions, which in turn have shaped and will continue to shape the contours of this specialty. The necessary further developments in continuing education as well as increasing cooperation with other disciplines and other pending decisions concerning treatment alternatives are discussed. ","363":"Renal diseases and their treatment can cause distress and psychosocial problems for both patients and relatives. Relationship dynamics and parameters of quality of life were assessed in 10 genetically related (brothers) and 14 genetically unrelated donor-recipient pairs (spouses) involved in living kidney donation (LKD). LKDs were described by related donors and recipients as fundamentally positive and in many cases led to an intensification of the relationship between donor and recipient. LKDs between unrelated donors and recipients appeared to achieve the same results as donations between related donors and recipients. Particularly the general desire to help determined the decision-making process of donors. In addition to general clinical parameters, especially motivational and relationship dynamics should be evaluated in the pre- and postoperative clinical psychological assessment of potential donors and recipients of LKD. ","364":"Current theoretical and clinical approaches conceive the avoidance and acceptance of emotions as critical factors in the maintenance and alleviation of psychological problems. This study investigates the role of mindfulness, experiential avoidance (EA), and positive and negative meta-emotions (emotional reactions towards the emotional self) on the symptoms and psychological well-being of inpatients. Changes of mindfulness measured during a 6-week stay at a psychosomatic clinic were explored in a sample of 293 inpatients with diverse psychological problems. Multivariate analyses were performed to determine the predictive power of mindfulness and acceptance on symptoms and psychological well-being. Staying on an inpatient ward was associated with reductions in EA and negative meta-emotions as well as improvements in mindful awareness and positive meta-emotions, i.e., participants reported greater acceptance of their own emotional reactions. These aspects were associated with a reduction in symptom severity and greater psychological well-being. A differentiation of meta-emotions allowed the meaningful identification of possible processes of change. Anger and contempt seem to have distinctive functions in self-regulation. Reducing the amount of contempt\/shame for one's own emotions and generating greater interest were associated with symptom reduction and greater psychological well-being. Self-compassion was negatively associated with symptoms, though it had no association with psychological well-being. The theoretical implications are discussed. ","365":"Psychodynamic psychotherapies have proved to lead to relevant symptomatic improvement. An unresolved question, however, is what amount of psychodynamic change can be expected beyond symptom relief. For theoretical and methodological reasons rooted in the psychodynamic approach, this question has been difficult to answer until now. In the German study PAL (long-term psychoanalytic psychotherapy), 32 patients in psychoanalytic therapy and 27 patients in psychodynamic psychotherapy were studied from the perspective of therapists, patients and researchers through three years post-treatment. In this paper we study the aspect of psychodynamic change of dysfunctional relations, unconscious conflicts and structural aspects as diagnosed by the Operationalized Psychodynamic Diagnostic method. Structural change is rated by the Heidelberg Structural Change Scale. A comparison of the two forms of therapy shows more structural change in long-term psychoanalytic psychotherapy compared to the shorter psychodynamic psychotherapy. A comparison of patients with a high level and a low level of structural change revealed that the highly changed patients showed greater symptom relief and greater satisfaction with therapy, and that their therapists perceived a better overall result of treatment. For psychodynamic psychotherapies structural change seems to be a relevant paradigm of outcome in addition to symptom relief. In longer and more frequent psychoanalytic therapies more structural change occurs compared to shorter psychodynamic psychotherapies. Beside the amount and length of treatment, the different therapy targets - working through vs. supportive - seem to be important. ","366":"Over the past years, 35 trauma outpatient units have been established in accordance with the Crime Victims' Compensation Act in the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany) for both children and adolescents as well as for adults. They are operated by the social welfare authorities and, since 2008, by the regional authorities of Westphalia-Lippe and Rhineland. They enable victims to receive qualified psychotraumatological help within the first few days after suffering violence. Since trauma units have now been set up across most parts of this federal state, the time has come to assess the effectiveness of their acute care provision to victims of violence. In 2007, on the order of the Ministry of Labour, Health and Social Affairs of the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia, trauma outpatient units were subjected to scientific evaluation. In 17 trauma outpatient units, a data assessment protocol was officially implemented that included repeat measurements (immediately before the initial contact, after completion of intervention, at follow-up six months after intervention) of traumatized subjects aged 14 and older. Socio-demographic data were gathered, and the scores of the Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R), the Symptom Checkliste-27 (SCL-27), the simplified Beck Depressions Inventory (BDI-V), the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF) as well as the Cologne Risk Index (CRI) (expert rating) were collected. Nearly three-fourths (65.9 %) of the traumatic experiences of the 211 patients investigated can be characterized as type-1 traumatisation. 31.8 % of patients were victims of crimes involving violations of the right to sexual self-determination (94.0 % of sexual offences being committed against girls and women). Crimes against physical integrity, which according to crime statistics are the most frequent of crimes against individuals (88.8 %, 34.8 % females), were suffered by 36.0 % of all patients of the trauma outpatient units (63.2 % being females). In 57.1 % of the victims, the interval between the traumatic event and initial intervention was less than a month. In 51.7 % (n = 109), suspicion of PTBS (F43.1) was raised at the initial presentation. The average of all instruments yielded an effect size of d = 1.04 (SD = 0.28) in a pre-post comparison. Pair-wise comparison showed highly significant differences in averages between pre and post (that is, between initial and follow-up measurements) in the sense of marked symptom reduction for all scales. The services of the trauma outpatient units are utilized in a timely and targeted fashion. The calculated effects show that the trauma outpatient units offer highly effective services to crime victims seeking help there. ","367":"While 50 years ago fathers\/partners were not allowed in the delivery room, nowadays their presence seems to be necessary. Research about this topic is summarized, and the results of a longitudinal study are presented. Expecting fathers (N = 30) were interviewed about one month predelivery (t1) and six months postpartum (t4) by a same-sex interviewer about their plans for delivery and their experiences during labor and childbirth. The interviews were then content-analyzed. Quotations from the prebirth interviews show that all men explicitly stated that they wanted to be present at the childbirth, although 13 % gave the impression that for them it was impossible to say \"no\" to this matter. And in fact all were present (100 %). Their experience of labor and delivery was characterized by intensive positive (joy, relief) and negative (e.g., fears, anxiety, worries, shock, helplessness, disgust, flight impulses) feelings. The newborn baby evoked deep feelings of joy and emotion - but also great helplessness and alienation were described. The implications for childbirth preparation, obstetrics, risks of mental disorders, the parents' relationship, sexuality and the respective research are discussed. ","368":"This study investigates the course of psychological distress, need for psychosocial support and quality of life in prostate cancer patients with respect to their dispositional optimism. A sample of 253 patients with prostate carcinoma completed questionnaires measuring optimism (LOT), psychological distress (PHQ-4), quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30) and need for psychosocial support (HSI) during hospitalization (T1), two weeks (T2) and three months (T3) after discharge. Optimism at T1 is negatively correlated with psychological distress and the need for support at T3. Even after controlling for the baseline levels of these variables, we found that optimism explained incremental variance three months later. The proportion of patients with an expressed need for support ranged from 45 % at T1 to 30 % at T3. Depression is - compared to the German general population - elevated only at T1, while anxiety remains heightened over the entire course. Patients with a high level of pessimism are at risk for higher levels of mental distress in the course of the disease. Their need for counselling should be considered by the psychosocial care system. ","369":"To examine the comparability of depression as defined by PHQ-9, PHQ-8 and PHQ-2 in the German general population. The PHQ-9 was assessed in a representative sample (N = 2524). Depression diagnosis and depression severity as measured either by PHQ-9, PHQ-8 or PHQ-2 were compared. PHQ-8 and PHQ-9 performed comparably in identifying depressive persons, though there are slight differences in rating depression severity. In comparison, the PHQ-2 showed the best performance in the detection of any depressive disorder. The PHQ-9 should be used in clinical settings, whereas in research and when persons are being approached via telephone\/mail\/internet the PHQ-8 is preferable. The PHQ-2 is recommended as a very economic and brief screener for depressive disorders. ","370":"","371":"Do some life story patterns exist, which are associated with depression? Can some life story factors be identified, which influence or determine a special kind of personality, predisposing to depression? Retrospective, cross sectional study with nonexperimental character, using a number of 60 nonmelancholic depressed patients. First, they were asked to give an interview on their life story. Then, they were asked to fill in questionnaires about personality, parental style of raising, clinical symptoms and personality disorders. Significant correlations could be found between parental style of raising, a family history affected by depression, a dysfunctional household, the family composition, negative school experience and all investigated styles of personality. Further, clusters of personality, clusters of parental style of raising and clusters of specific life story factors could be detected. Results show a strong relation between life story factors and personality styles, predisposing to depression and emphasize the importance of considering personality, when exploring special life story factors. Vice versa, actual personality styles can point to different patterns of life story and thus, show the relevance for the diagnostic and therapeutic process. ","372":"This study investigated whether dermatology inpatients with chronic pruritus benefit from an 1-hour psychoeducational group therapy, adapted from educational programmes for patients with atopic dermatitis. Such a symptom-specific intervention for patients with chronic pruritus has not been evaluated before. 91 of the 315 group participants (28.9 %) and 175 of the 318 patients who had been admitted to the hospital without group therapy (55.0 %) were examined at admission and discharge using standardised questionnaires (Adjustment to Chronic Skin Diseases Questionnaire, Itch-Cognition Questionnaire) and a Visual Analogue Scale for itch intensity (randomized pre-post study). Evaluation of the standardised questionnaires and of the change in pruritus intensity indicated no additive benefit of group intervention, both for the whole sample and for subgroups with chronic pruritus. The results indicate either that group intervention in this form is not effective or that the dermatological medical treatment of the patients is so efficient that the intervention brings no added benefit. Perhaps an intervention of 1 hour is simply too short. Further conceptual developments of the psychoeducational programme are necessary. ","373":"The study investigates the factors that have a bearing on the development of a chief expert opinion in standardized German psychotherapy (psychodynamic therapies). As part of the MARS project a documentation system was developed to record the sociodemographic, clinical and biographical data of the patients as well as data relating to the therapists and the evaluation of the experts, all of which are contained in the therapist's reports. In a comparison of n = 153 chief expert opinions with n = 291 opinions relating to the control group under the normal process, differences occurred between the two groups with respect to the data on both patients and therapists. Moreover, the system records the frequency with which the individual experts contribute to the initiation of a chief expert opinion over a period of 3 years. Proceedings based on chief expert opinions are initiated with patients who have severe psychopathologies and marginal prognostic prospects. Reservations expressed by the experts refer in particular to the psychodynamics described and the foreseen treatment planning. The qualification and gender of the therapists are certainly an issue for chief expert opinions. The experts themselves contribute with varying degrees to the initiation of an expert opinion. While the role of patients and therapists in the realization of a chief expert opinion comes as no surprise and is in fact testimony to the quality assurance function of the process, considerable differences have emerged in the handling and approach adopted by the experts themselves. Calls for a better coordination process on the part of the experts should not go unheeded. ","374":"Patient satisfaction plays an important role in the outcome quality of treatment for localized prostate carcinoma. This paper identifies factors that impact patients' assessment of therapy success one year after surgery. Patient assessment of therapy success was measured with the Hamburger Fragebogen zum Krankenhausaufenthalt (Lecher et al. 2002). Also, several sociodemographic, clinical and quality-of-life factors were tested for their impact on the patient assessment of therapy success. 25 % of patients gave a negative assessment of therapy success. Factors with the strongest impact were urinary incontinence, sexual impotence, younger age and higher risk of recidive. Especially the prevention of urinary continence and sexual dysfunction may lead to a better assessment of therapy. Moreover, the patients' expectations have a great impact on the assessment of therapy success. ","375":"We investigated whether patient satisfaction (including its subdimensions) among breast cancer patients depends on the place of the treatment (certified breast cancer centre vs. noncertified clinics). Furthermore, we examined the impact of patient- and disease-related factors on patient satisfaction. 652 breast cancer patients (n = 480 from certified breast cancer centres and n = 172 from noncertified clinics) took part in the study after their hospital stay and completed a questionnaire. Data on patient satisfaction (Hamburger Fragebogen zum Krankenhausaufenthalt, HFK), psychological distress (HADS), as well as sociodemographic and disease-related characteristics were collected. Regardless of the place of cancer treatment, breast cancer patients reported a high level of satisfaction. There was only one significant difference between the two patient groups in the subdimension \"overall judgement\" (breast centre: 1.28 vs. noncertified clinic: 1.19; p = 0.017). In the multivariate analysis, the place of treatment had less explanatory power on patient satisfaction than other factors such as psychological distress. In this study, there were only few differences in patient satisfaction between the two investigated groups of breast cancer patients. This result is discussed in the context of various moderating factors. ","376":"Clinical populations are characterised by a high level of childhood trauma and unresolved attachment status (\"U\"). Unresolved attachment status indicates the inability to integrate attachment-related dangers. Little is known about the interaction of traumatic childhood experiences and an unresolved attachment status. We administered the Adult Attachment Projective Picture System (AAP) to 45 newly admitted psychosomatic inpatients. Childhood trauma (CTQ) and distress were assessed by self-report questionnaires, and cognitive-emotional development was evaluated with the Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale (LEAS).We explored whether unresolved (U) and resolved (R) attachment status differentiated the sample with regard to childhood trauma, distress and cognitive-emotional development. 53 % of the sample was characterized by the attachment status U; physical abuse and neglect as well as emotional neglect were correlated with a diminished ability to integrate trauma indicators in the AAP. A resolved attachment status was related to higher LEAS scores. The level of cognitive-emotional development may mediate the actual integration of attachment-related dangers and the interaction between actual attachment-related anxiety and past traumatic experiences. ","377":"Does quantifying psychotherapy research do justice to its subject matter? Q-sort techniques are presented for the assessment of personality pathology, mental and interpersonal problems, as well as for quantifying the psychotherapeutic process. In studies on psychotherapy planning we identified mechanisms characteristic of nonresponders which could be efficiently captured with q-sort methods. From these clinically relevant intervention techniques can be derived. In psychoanalytic process research we operationalized relevant microelements in the patient-therapist interaction. Q-sort methods are efficient and helpful for studying research questions that are clinically relevant but often difficult to grasp as well as for dismantling studies. ","378":"We examined the frequency of dissociative seizures in inpatients of a specialized ward for epilepsy as well as their diagnostic and therapeutic course. The basic principle of the latter is the therapeutic triad of value-free communication of the diagnosis, training of techniques for seizure interruption and problem solving of inner conflicts. All inpatients in a department of epileptology with a diagnosis of dissociative seizures were examined retrospectively for the year 2009. 65 patients (11 %) were diagnosed with dissociative seizures, 23 patients with a primary diagnosis of epilepsy and 42 with a secondary diagnosis, epilepsy being the primary diagnosis. Symptoms occurred in the 23 patients with dissociative seizures as primary diagnosis between 2 weeks and 40 years. Possible predisposing factors and psychological comorbidities for the development of dissociative seizures were manifold. A psychopharmacological medication was established in 9 patients (39 %), and psychotherapy was recommended explicitly in all patients. There is a great heterogeneity in patients with dissociative seizures with a sometimes long course of the disorder. ","379":"Even psychosomatic researchers seem to want to avoid the so-called body-mind problem, which is actually a mind-brain problem. In line with Beckermann (2008), the first the four possible positions on the mind-brain problem are presented. The debate over the past 100 years has revolved around the question of whether mental events are ontologically independent of brain physiology or whether they are in fact entirely determined by it. Such a physicalism approach based on properties (i.e., mental characteristics or phenomena are physical or can be completely reduced to physical characteristics), however, is diametrically opposed to some of our strongest intuitions, e.g., that computers will never be able to develop qualities of human experience (qualia) and thus become subjects in the first person singular. Yet we are equally unable to prove the fundamental impossibility of such a development. In this stalemate situation, a differentiation was undertaken by Gottlob Frege (1892) which could be of help: Expressed in today's language, a distinction is made between the sense of an expression, its contextual presentation (e.g., where there is a difference between \"the evening star\" and \"the morning star\"), on the one hand, and its so-called reference (the object to which it refers, here the planet Venus in both cases) on the other. The school of Gestalt psychology that developed in Berlin at the start of the last century similarly posited a \"psychophysical level of the CNS,\" a continuum in a pattern of electrical field forces which manifests itself first in cerebral physiological-neuronal processes as well as in other perspectives such as consciousness and experience. A subsequent speculative concept then extends this model to assume also an (as yet) unknown Alpha configuration as being a common reference of two sense contents: (1) the results of the neurophysiological third-person perspective and (2) of the emotional-cognitive first-person perspectives. Only through the latter will Alpha be able to become self-conscious and an instance acting in his world. Only through the latter will Alpha be able to become self-conscious and an instance acting in his world. The postulate of an Alpha configuration thus retains the possibility of a biology not (yet) accessible to our knowledge, such that our fundamental conviction regarding the holism of soma and psyche can be maintained for us as medical practitioners and scientific physicians. Our patients need both, our medical-scientific competence (3rd-person perspective) as well as our empathic sensibility in exploring their phenomenal experience (1st-person perspective). They need us as medical artists. ","380":"The catamnesis study examined the effectiveness of inpatient psychotherapy of patients 60+ years of age 1 to 2 years after the treatment. The patients had been treated in the years 2007 and 2008. Systematic pre and post inpatient treatment data were available for all patients, collected according to Psy-BaDo. For the purpose of the catamnesis the patients received the complaint questionnaire SCL-90-R as self-evaluation questionnaire, based on a shortened form of the BSI. In addition, we also used a special catamnesis questionnaire developed by the inpatient Group Therapy Research Unit staff and revised at the Rhein-Klinik (Wuchner u. Hess 2005). According to their self-assessments, most patients reported of having gained a \"good\" to \"very good\" benefit from the treatment. The effectiveness of the inpatient treatment was high both at the end of the treatment and at the time of the catamnesis (discharge d = 0.86; catamnesis d = 0.84).Nearly 70 % of the patients were also later treated by outpatient psychotherapy, 51 % were prescribed psychopharmacologic drugs and 33 % other forms of medicine. The therapeutic framework for the treatment of older patients corresponded to the rules for psychosomatic medicine and psychotherapy. There is no need for any other fundamentally different concepts. After the follow-up outpatient treatments, older patients and the therapists expressed an increased acceptance of psychotherapy. The effectiveness of treatment in older patients may result from their good resources. The results of the catamnesis show encouraging findings for the psychosomatic treatment of older patients, also in the long term from 1,5 to 2 years. ","381":null,"382":"Alexithymia is characterized by deficits in perceiving, differentiating and regulating affects, both one's own affects and those of others. It is often related to interpersonal problems which are a major reason for seeking psychotherapy. This study assesses the relationship between alexithymia, specific relationship patterns and interpersonal problems in a clinical inpatient sample. We evaluated alexithymia (Toronto-Alexithymia-Scale-26: TAS-26), relationship patterns (Relationship Patterns Questionnaire-II; RPQ-II) and interpersonal problems (Inventory of Interpersonal Problems: IIP) in 152 patients with various mental disorders upon admission to an inpatient clinic for psychosomatic medicine and psychotherapy. Alexithymia (TAS-20) was significantly negatively associated with self-assertion (RPQII) and significantly positively associated with overall interpersonal problems (IIP-total score). Specifically, the interpersonal style associated with alexithymia was characterized by cold, socially avoidant, nonassertive and exploitable behavior (IIP-subscales). Alexithymia in patients with mental disorders is linked to specific relationship patterns and interpersonal problems at the beginning of an inpatient psychotherapy. Because interpersonal problems, and especially the therapeutic alliance, are strong predictors of outcome in individual psychotherapy, specific attention should be paid to this relationship in the treatment of alexithymic patients. ","383":"This epidemiological multicenter study investigates the prevalence and comorbidity of somatoform disorder in psychosomatic inpatients. Twenty psychosomatic hospitals collected the diagnoses of all treated patients in the years 1998 to 2007. The data were analysed at the \"Institute for Quality Assurance in Psychotherapy and Psychosomatic Medicine\" (IQP),Munich. Of the 100,607 patients surveyed, 18,492 (18.4 %) fulfilled the ICD-10 criteria for a somatoform disorder. 91.9 % of patients with somatoform disorder have at least one, on average 2.8 additional psychiatric disorders. The mean duration of the symptoms before current treatment was 62.6 months. The prevalence of somatoform disorder in psychosomatic inpatients is comparable to that found in data from internal or general medicine patients. However, there are major differences in the distribution of the diagnostic subgroups of somatoform disorder. ","384":"Based on a postal survey of Balint group leaders from the year 2004, this study analyses the characteristics of Balint group work as described by Michael Balint (1896-1970)in modern Germany. A questionnaire was sent to 503 German Balint group leaders, 333 (66.2 %) of whom returned the questionnaire (40.5 % women, mean age 57.2 years). Most Balint group leaders are specialists in psychosomatic medicine and psychotherapy (30.6 %), psychiatry and psychotherapy (17.1 %) or are general practitioners (12.3 %). Psychoanalysts rarely serve as Balint group leaders. Sessions are normally held every 2 weeks (26.7 %) or once a month (26.4 %). Despite the original intention of Michael Balint, the idea of holding weekly Balint groups is now seldom(3.9 %). 85 %of the Balint group leaders prefer sessions lasting 90 minutes. An average of 8.6 participants attend, with 2.1 persons missing. There is a great heterogeneity in the professions of Balint group leaders. 17.4 % of them are older 65 years. This study shows that Balint group work in Germany is well integrated in both general practice and psychotherapy, and it is still of great interest to many specialists of other disciplines as well as a good way to realize further education. The ideas of Michael Balint are very much alive, but - because of the changed realities in the medical field - no longer as he originally foresaw, but in settings adapted to the new situations in medicine. ","385":"How clearcut is the clinical significance of mature and immature defense mechanisms in psychological symptoms? Defense mechanisms, symptoms and well-being were assessed in 293 inpatients, 316 outpatients and 157 students. The factors \"mature defense\" and \"immature defense\" predict well-being\/symptoms to a substantial degree. The assessment of defense mechanism via self-report is clinically useful.

To date, little research has been done concerning the impact of this modern lifestyle on partnership and family life, particularly on dual-career couples and long-distance commuters. The results of a literature review are presented based on age, sex, family cycle and consequences for children; research questions are formulated. Sex-specific differences seem to be especially important, confirming the \"household responsibility hypothesis.\" The commuter marriage as a new lifestyle seems to have become a coping mechanism for the increasing necessity in our society to commute.","387":null,"388":"To describe patients' subjective perspectives on hospitalization at time of admission, to prospectively investigate patients' views on changes actually achieved after discharge, and to identify predictors of subjective changes 3 months after hospitalization. We conducted a 3-month follow-up cohort study using qualitative and quantitative research methods. Consecutive adult inpatients of an internal medicine ward and a ward integrating internal and psychosomatic medicine were included. They answered open-ended questions concerning their motivation for change at the time of admission (N = 639) using self-report questionnaires and 3 months post hospitalization via a telephone interview (N = 389). Qualitative content analysis was performed. Predictors of subjective change 3 months after hospitalization were identified using multivariate logistic regression analyses. At admission, more psychosomatic patients than internal-medicine ward patients wanted to achieve change (58% vs. 44 %). Patients expressed desires that were assigned to three main categories: to pay more attention to one's physical health (40 %), to change one's perceptions (32 %), and to change one's way of life (16 %). Three months after discharge, 52 % of patients had experienced cognitive and behavioral changes they attributed to their hospitalization. 31 % of the patients reported continuing to implement changes that had begun during hospitalization. Predictors of subjective change 3 months after hospitalization included high educational level (OR = 2.04, 95 %-CI 1.27-3.26), young age (OR = 0.98, 95 %-CI 0.97-1.00), and length of hospitalization (OR = 1.03, 95 %-CI 1.00-1.05). There is considerable motivation for behavioral and cognitive change among inpatients following admission; this deserves the attention of healthcare professionals. An integrated psychosomatic setting would appear to support cognitive and behavioral changes more effectively than a classical internal medicine ward. ","389":"Studies concentrating on the temporal dependence of subjective concepts during oncological treatment are underrepresented. Subjective interpretation contexts develop in the course of illness. The study focuses on the ideal-typical gestalt of these contents. In a follow-up study on coping, 12 patients with acute leukaemia (AL) were interviewed using a semistructured interview at the end of initial inpatient treatment. Using qualitative methodology, we inductively developed categories and assigned them to formal main categories. The following categories were developed: causal uncertainty as burden; discrepancy between subjective and objective assessment of degree of threat; knowledge of disease: conflict between information-seeking and information-avoiding behavior; dominance of medical approach to treatment; pursuit of normality; defense of emotions; orientation to workflows on the ward; adjustment as a coping strategy; positive attitude as a resource; life between hope and fear; limited future; latent fear of death. Themes of coping with the disease become visible. Some of these contents are tacit and latent, although of high subjective relevance to the patient. Their consideration could improve the patient-physician relationship. ","390":"To provide a systematic overview of the research concerning the frequency of medically unexplained, somatoform complaints and disorders in the elderly, their risk factors, comorbidity, course, management in primary and secondary care, and psychotherapy. We evaluated 248 clinical and randomized trials, reviews, meta-analyses and practice guidelines for adult samples identified from \"PubMed\" and \"PsycInfo\" using the search terms \"somatoform\" OR \"medically unexplained\" OR \"somatization\" OR \"somatisation\" in combination with other terms for their relevance for the elderly. Other relevant trials were identified from the references from these publications. Medically unexplained, somatoform complaints and disorders occur in older persons and are more frequent in elderly women than in elderly men. Although many studies found no increased frequency of somatoform complaints in the elderly, based on present research we cannot draw final conclusions concerning the frequency of somatoform disorders and complaints in the elderly, and we cannot give evidence based recommendations for their treatment in primary and secondary care and psychotherapy. This situation results from the special problems encountered in the diagnosis of somatoform complaints and disorders in the elderly, from problems in conceptualisation also found in younger adults, and from the lack of research concerning treatment focussed solely on the old and very old. ","391":"","392":"The study assesses patient satisfaction and investigates the correlation between patient satisfaction and the setting and attainment of goals. Cross-sectional questionnaire-based assessment data were provided anonymously by 276 patients at the end of their inpatient stay in psychosomatic rehabilitation. Patient satisfaction as well as sociodemographic, disease-related, and outcome parameters including rehabilitation goals were assessed at the beginning of rehabilitation and their attainment at the end of rehabilitation. Goal-attainment scales based on factor analysis showed a high degree of goal-attainment with respect to \"lifestyle and priorities\" and \"psychotherapeutic goals.\" Patient satisfaction correlated most significantly with the goal-attainment level at the end of rehabilitation (r=.62) and the subscale \"attainment of psychotherapeutic goals\" (r=.57). Nonattainment of goals (r=-.55) was more closely related with patient satisfaction than the attainment (r=.40). The results confirm the central role of goal-setting and goal-attainment in rehabilitation, and reveal the necessity of goal-setting assessment of goal-attainment in the process of rehabilitation.

Consultation was initiated mainly by relatives--mostly the mothers (86%); 48% report achievement failure and social isolation, lack of control (38%) and conflicts within the family (33%). Two-thirds of the mainly male (96%) patients (N=131) with an average age of 22 (range 13-47) years met the criteria for pathological computer gaming, characterized by an excessive number of hours and preoccupation with gaming, high distress, and unemployment. Symptoms resemble those of other addiction disorders. The consequences for disorder-specific treatment concepts and research are discussed. ","394":null,"395":"Reduced concentrations of dopamine in prefrontal brain structures may play a role in alexithymia. Dopamine degradation in the orbitofrontal cortex is regulated by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), and a functional single nucleotide polymorphism of the COMT gene, Val158Met, has been related to psychiatric illness. This study examines the association between the COMT Val158Met gene polymorphism, and alexithymia. 120 healthy students and 120 patients with mental disorders were genotyped for the COMT Val158Met polymorphism. Additionally, the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) was administered. COMT genotype did not show a significant correlation with the TAS-20 in either group. COMT Val158Met polymorphism alone does not seem to be a major factor in alexithymia in healthy students. This is true even if patients with mental disorders covering a broader range of alexithymia are included. Thus, other genes, possibly interacting with cultural, environmental, and developmental factors, may be implicated. ","396":"This article reviews the present state of knowledge concerning obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) with respect to its classification, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and therapy. Epidemiological evidence has indicated that OCD may be one of the most prevalent and disabling psychiatric disorders. There is also a high comorbidity with depression and anxiety disorders. OCD is characterized by repetitive, intrusive thoughts and images, and\/or by repetitive, ritualistic physical or mental acts performed to reduce the attended anxiety. OCD is relatively common, affecting 1-3% of both adult and paediatric samples. OCD is clinically a heterogeneous condition in that two different patients with clear OCD can display completely distinct symptom patterns. Furthermore, neurobiological and psychological models concerning OCD as well as the present state of therapy are presented in detail.","397":"Which psychodiagnostic criteria indicate artificial donation motives at work in living organ donation? Using a casuistic we investigated self-harmful behaviour with regard to peculiarities in transference as well as countertransference. Diagnostically of great important is the discrepancy between the difficulty of the examiner to understand the donation request in its psychosocial context and the vehemence with which the donor insists on going through with the transplantation. At the same time, one may notice a lack of reflective ability impeding an ambivalent attitude toward the donation. The doctor\/patient relationship is restricted by aggressive affects, and the body of the donor is reduced to an object with exchangeable organs. When evaluating donor-recipient pairs who belong into the group of pairs with particular emotional investment according to Article 8.1 of the German Organ Transplantation Law, one should consider the possibility of autoaggressive motives as a background to a living organ donation. Also, when discussing the extension of anonymous and predominantly altruistically motivated living organ donation one should consider the exclusion of autoaggressive motives. ","398":"In a systematic literature review we examined patient-related predictors of inpatient treatment duration for mental disorders. The databases Medline, Embase, Psyndex, PsycINFO and EBMR were systematically reviewed for studies in the years 1990-2009 regarding treatment duration of inpatients with ICD-10 diagnoses F3-F6. Also, their methodological quality was evaluated. Twenty-one studies examining 28 predictors (sociodemographic, clinical) were included. Longer treatment durations were found for patients living alone and with higher levels of initial symptom severity, duration of mental disorder, number of previous treatments, work absenteeism, and comorbidity. Obsessive-compulsive, eating and personality disorders were treated longer than depressive, anxiety, somatoform, and adjustment disorders. Results for age, gender, education, and profession were inconsistent. The studies included heterogeneous analyses, treatments, and patients. Despite their sufficient methodical quality, these results are only tentative. ","399":"Since the Winter Term 2008\/2009 the Medical School of the University of Muenster, Germany, has used standardized patients in the clinical course Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy with fourth-year undergraduate students performing bio-psycho-social anamnesis on these standardized patients. We wanted to evaluate the influence of the course on the empathy of the students. A total of 107 students participated in the standardized patient program during the Winter Term 2009\/2010, with 90 (84.1 %) completing the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy before and after the course. In addition, we conducted a standard evaluation of the medical faculty. The pre-post comparison revealed a significant increase in empathy (d = 0.331, p = .001). The standard evaluation yielded a high satisfaction among the course participants, though several students did assess the course critically. The implementation of a standardized patient program in psychosomatics and psychotherapy proved to be of value, since it increased empathy of the students and received a positive evaluation. To prevent the students from being humiliated, it is of particular importance to implement a gentle and tactful feedback. ","400":"Abrupt transient deterioration in the experienced therapeutic interaction is regarded as a sign of the emergence of negative transference aspects. How can these sessions be characterized in terms of similarity to the experience of other important relationships and in relation to the process? The interaction-experience in six therapy courses was measured continuously (Intrex). Abrupt deterioration was statistically determined. The correlation between the experienced therapeutic interaction and nontherapeutic interaction patterns was determined. The transference aspects measured were instable over time. There were significant correlations with the experience of previous and current significant others, and parental interaction. The strongest correlations existed nearly consistently to the interaction with the most important person during the best times. The method allows measuring change and transference aspects in an economic way. After validation, it could be used for clinical diagnostics. Sessions thus selected could be analyzed more precisely with other procedures. ","401":"This study investigated differences in the personal meaning systems of psychotherapists and psychotherapy patients as well as correlations between meaning in life and mental health. We qualitatively assessed the content and structure of the personal meaning systems of 41 psychotherapists and 77 psychotherapy patients. In addition, the participants completed questionnaires measuring meaning in life (LRI-r-d), sense of coherence (SOC-9L), self-esteem (RSES), satisfaction with life (SWLS), self-efficacy (SWK), and depression (BDI). The personal meaning systems of psychotherapists were more complex and coherent compared to psychotherapy patients. In the group of psychotherapy patients, a more elaborate structure of the personal meaning system correlated with the subjective sense of meaning. We were able to confirm correlations between meaning in life and mental health for most of the instances. Psychotherapists had more elaborate and coherent meaning systems than psychotherapy patients. Especially for psychotherapy patients elaborate and coherent meaning systems turned out to be important for mental health. ","402":"The present study investigates the kind and frequency of medical psychotherapy carried out in GPs' offices in South Baden, Germany. Established GPs and other primary-care physicians from South Baden (n = 64) who had successfully completed additional training in psychotherapy were queried about their current psychotherapeutical services using a questionnaire. The data were evaluated by applying descriptive and correlative statistical procedures. The response rate was 93.8 % (n = 60). Standard psychotherapy short-term psychotherapies with up to 25 hours and long-term psychotherapies with up to 50 hours) had been supplied, with an average of 8.3 patients per doctor and quarter. Services rendered outside standard psychotherapy regimen including the approved services for basic psychosomatic care, especially short-term psychotherapeutic interventions of up to ten sessions, were performed with an average of 108.9 patients per doctor. As predictors for the performance of these services we found (1) patients with a high educational level (p = 0.002), (2) the cooperation with other psychosocial professional groups (p = 0.008), and (3) the participation in quality-assurance measurements (p = 0.009). Physicians with additional training in psychotherapy offered a great amount of psychotherapeutical services not covered by the the standard psychotherapy guidelines of the national health services. These offers, borne primarily by idealism, should be acknowledged by new reward models in the future.

Members of the steering group for these guidelines disagree with the authors' description in several points, especially with reference to the efficacy of pharmacotherapy with antidepressants and psychotherapy, as well as the relationship between both strategies of therapy and their combination in diverse phases of treatment (acute\/maintenance). Furthermore, we try to clarify some misunderstandings in matters of the guideline's methodology which arose in the paper cited.","405":"","406":"Psychotherapy research has often been considered a neglected topic in clinical psychology, psychosomatic medicine, and psychiatry because of its massive organizational and financial demands. However, it is unclear whether this assumption actually reflects the research activities in the field. We conducted a bibliometric analysis of the annual volumes for 2008 and 2009 of three clinical journals published in German. All publications referring to facets of psychotherapy research were analysed. About 30% of the publications dealt with issues of psychotherapy research. Outcome and process studies were about equally distributed. Process research frequently focused on patient variables as outcome predictors. Outcome studies most often presented effectiveness studies with rather small sample sizes. Psychotherapy research is a well-represented and multifaceted field in the German speaking research community. However, the traditional distinction between efficacy and process research among the various schools of psychotherapy research may be hampering further developments in this branch. The government-funded research networks may turn out to be promising approaches to overcoming some of the obstacles of classic psychotherapy research. ","407":"This study investigates body image with respect to the age, gender, and psychiatric diagnosis (ICD-10) of psychosomatic outpatients based on apriori formulated hypotheses. 865 of the 1114 patients examined over the course of 10 months in a psychosomatic clinic agreed to participate in the study and filled in the Frankfurt Body Concept Scales (FKKS, Deusinger 1998). Patients with one or more psychiatric diagnoses showed significantly more impaired body images than did healthy controls examined with the FKKS. Especially patients with eating disorders stood out. Men generally had more positive body images than women. Higher age was related to some subscales, but not to the sumscore of the FKKS. We discuss the complex relationship between gender- and age-related differences, mental disorders and body image, as well as their therapeutic implications. ","408":"The communication with patients who have undergoned transplantation is greatly influenced by their subjective experience. This paper deals with this subjective transplant-specific experience six months after surgery. Following their heart, lung, liver, or kidney transplantation, 120 patients were questioned concerning their experiences regarding the transplantation, the organ itself, and changes in their personal life. Their statements were investigated by qualitative content analysis. Generally, the statements concerning the transplantation were positive. Interpersonal contact with the medical staff and or family members was perceived as very helpful. Two-thirds of the patients spoke openly about their organ. For the most part, their statements about changes in their personal life were positive, expressed in the sense of personal growth. Fears and insecurities occurred as negative changes. On the whole, the majority of the patients expressed positive experiences regarding their transplantation. Interpersonal and supportive relationships played a significant role. ","409":null,"410":"According to the German Guidelines for Psychotherapy, psychotherapists need the consent of the respective insurance company to commence outpatient therapy. They have two options: (1) To begin a so-called short-term therapy (KZT) for up to 25 sessions--a quick and easy procedure requiring few formal expenses. Afterwards the therapist must provide the reasons for extending the therapy in a formal expert assessment request (extension request). (2) It is also possible to obtain the consent of the insurance company at the beginning of therapy (initial request) for up to 50 sessions (psychodynamic long-term therapy) or even for up to 160 sessions (analytical psychotherapy), both of which require the same expert assessment to be filled out beforehand (LZT). This study examines the initial and extension requests submitted for evaluation for psychodynamic therapies according to the German Guidelines for Psychotherapy. The question is posed as to what influences are important in the selection of therapists for these two types of request. In the context of the MARS study, we evaluated a total of 362 randomly chosen requests submitted between May 2007 and June 2008, 128 of which were initial requests and 234 of which were requests for an extension. The evaluation of the reports proceeded on the basis of a previously developed documentation system with various modules comprising information on the sociodemographics and morbidity of the patients as well as information on the therapists themselves. Further modules are assessed in this review. There were many more requests for an extension submitted than initial requests. Initial requests were preferably made when planning analytical psychotherapy. Patients for whom initial requests were submitted were also distinctly younger. The morbidity of the patients had no noticeable influence on the choice of procedure. In particular, diagnoses that could require crisis intervention were not more common in the requests for an extension than in the initial requests. Variables among the therapists had no influence on the form of procedure. These results were confirmed by a multivariate statistical analysis. The inconsistencies found in the reported and encoded morbidity of the patients confirm earlier results. Basic conditions, like the guidelines themselves or the payment of trial treatment, seem to determine therapists' behaviour. We also discuss whether or not the advantages of the current procedures to both the patient and the therapist outweigh the possible disadvantages.. ","411":"Adjustment disorders (AD) represent a frequently diagnosed type of disorder for which scientific interest has been limited because of insufficient diagnostic criteria. This study presents a concept comprising cognitive, behavioural, and emotional criteria (ADNM) which investigates differences in symptom severity, willingness to change, and motivation for psychotherapy in subjects with adjustment disorders. 331 outpatients were examined with a number of tools (ADNM, SCL-90-R, FPTM-23, FEVER). The ADNM is evaluated on the basis of theoretical assumptions and divides the sample into subjects with elevated and normal scores. The sample comprised patients with elevated scores (61%) and normal scores (39%).Subjects with AD scored higher on depression, anxiety, and impulsivity as well as exhibiting elevated scores on the SCL-90-R, for contemplation\/action, and for psychotherapy motivation. The ADNM identifies patients experiencing stress. Further longitudinal studies should examine whether patients more frequently enter psychotherapy or not. ","412":"","413":"The study explores whether breast-cancer patients who request psychosocial support have higher psychological strain compared to those who do not. We also explored whether scores on HADS-D and PHQ-D identify the same patients as being stressed as well as the relationship between patient's wish for psychological support and psychological strain. 115 inpatients with breast cancer took part in the screening and were asked if they wanted psychosocial support. Above-normal scores in anxiety and depression are reported by 25-29%, with 41% indicating a wish for psychosocial support. These patients showed significantly higher scores on the questionnaires. Their request for psychosocial support shows a similar sensitivity (.733) and specificity (.662) as the \"Distress-Thermometer\" or \"PO-Bado\". The desire for psychosocial support appears to be a valuable piece of additional information for indicating psychosocial support. However, HADS-D and PHQ-D agree only in 77% of the individual patients. ","414":"Interpersonal problems are typically assessed with the Inventory of interpersonal Problems (IIP; Horowitz et al. 2000). Although patients show different interpersonal profiles, these have to date not been considered in outcome evaluation. We examined whether interpersonal subtypes can be found in inpatients, and whether they differ in the modification of interpersonal problems. Furthermore, we examined the impact of subtypes regarding overall outcome. The Structural Summary Method for Circumplex Data was used to examine the interpersonal problems of N=2809 inpatients from the Asklepios Clinic Tiefenbrunn. Subtypes of interpersonal problems were determined by the centroid method of cluster analysis and were compared with regard to treatment effects. Patients were distributed in the interpersonal Circumplex and were assigned to eight IIP subtypes, which differed in improvement with regard to interpersonal problems and overall outcome. According to the circumplex structure of IIP data, for group level evaluation it is necessary to generate interpersonal subtypes so that clinically relevant results can be demonstrated. ","415":"The study assesses mentalization (reflective functioning, RF), parental bonding, psychiatric comorbidity, and experiences of violence in chronic pelvic pain patients (CPP). Twenty-two CPP patients were investigated using SCID I and II as well as the German version of the parental bonding instrument (FEB). Experiences of violence were assessed by semistructured interviews. Adult attachment interviews (AAI) were rated according to the Reflective Functioning Scale (RF Scale). CPP patients showed a lower capacity of mentalization (RF=2.3) compared to that of healthy individuals (RF approximately 5). Maternal bonding was rated as affectionless control (36.4 %) and as neglectful parenting (31.8 %). 54 % of the women reported experiences of violence. Axis I comorbidity was prevalent in 54.5 %, and axis II comorbidity was prevalent in 36.4 %. Further psychoanalytic-psychosomatic research should focus on the low capacity of mentalization, adverse parenting, and experiences of violence in chronic pelvic pain patients. ","416":"Accidents often have a traumatic impact on the victims. The influence of individual trauma adjustment on psychosocial convalescence is examined according to the different types of accidental event. 192 accident victims were consecutively examined over a period of 12 months. Subjective trauma evaluation and characteristics of trauma adjustment were assessed and differentiated according to the type of accidental event (motor-vehicle, work, and recreational activity accident). The three groups varied in their demographics, in injury severity (ISS), in subjective evaluation, in symptoms of mental and posttraumatic stress, and in the predicting variables. The lowest level of stress after 12 months was found after accidents that had occurred during recreational activities. The prevalence of posttraumatic stress symptoms was similar among motor-vehicle and work-accident victims, whereas victims of recreational activity accidents primarily showed symptoms of other Axis I disorders. Individual adjustment to trauma and the type of accident influence mental health. The role of other variables (work re-entry, claims, financial compensation) also has to be considered. We accentuate the need for immediate psychiatric evaluation and intervention when necessary. ","417":"To obtain data and hypotheses regarding the amelioration of risk estimation and preventive psychotherapy in patients in a prodromal state of schizophrenia by using OPD. 20 participants with a prodromal condition--6 subjects far from psychosis and 14 close to psychosis--along with 10 patients with paranoid schizophrenia as reference group were examined using the first four OPD axes. Both groups differed considerably in all four axes. Compared to the schizophrenic participants, prodromal probands appear to have more favourable preconditions for therapy. Moreover, they experienced the interaction partners, including the investigator, as less aversive and induced less distanced behaviour in the investigator. Conflicts of self-esteem were prominent in both prodromal subgroups. However, patients farther from psychosis showed less conflicts of autonomy versus dependence and displayed a higher integration in structures such as \"defence\" and \"attachment\" when compared to participants closer to psychosis. Particularly the differences between the prodromal subgroups suggest that application of the OPD may positively complement previous approaches of early detection, prevention,and psychotherapy for prodromal conditions. The hypotheses obtained should be tested in longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes. ","418":"To correlate personality structure and clinical severity of borderline personality disorder. Based on data from a sample of 104 female patients with borderline personality disorder, we computed bivariate correlations and group comparisons using the scales from the Structured Interview of Personality Organization (STIPO) as well as indicators of clinical severity of the disorder (axis-II comorbidity, suicide attempts, self-destructive behaviour, service utilization). Patients with a clinically more severe disorder revealed a worse level of personality structure. Specific associations between dimensions of personality structure and phenomenology were found. The diagnoses of personality structure and of phenomenology complement each other and should be combined in clinical settings as well as for research purposes. ","419":"Patient comments and empirical studies suggest an influence of stress on inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). We performed a quality assessment of previous studies on the effect of stress reduction on IBD in order to formulate recommendations for future studies and to evaluate their potential for improvement. Studies were searched for in the PubMed online library and in the bibliographies of the located sources. Based on an analysis of the study design and the methodology of individual studies, we made specific recommendations following recognized methodological principles and used them to evaluate the analyzed studies. The 10 studies identified differed in terms of exclusion criteria, distribution of characteristics, stress reduction, and effect measurements. The recommendations formulated had not been followed exhaustively in these studies. Computation of sample size to detect relevant effects, orientation toward previous studies, documentation of potential confounders, and confidence intervals are criteria that are easy to consider and well-known, and that, if applied to future studies, might enhance the quality of IBD research.

For this reason, new procedures covering psychosomatic-psychotherapeutic und psychiatric-psychotherapeutic inpatient treatment had to be developed. This paper presents the new Psych-Procedures (Psych-OPS) together with first instructions on coding procedures.","421":"The study determines how often Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder (ICD-10: F48.1) is diagnosed in the general population and analyzes the associations of other diseases with F48.1. The sample consists of 1.567 million insured persons of a statutory health insurance fund in Germany. We analyzed the prevalence of F48.1 and the associations of F48.1 with other diseases according to ICD-10. We found a 1-year prevalence of 0.007 % for the diagnosis of F48.1. After adjustment for age, sex, depression and anxiety, several somatic disease groups were found to be associated with an increased likelihood of F48.1, e.g., abnormalities of breathing (R06), cardiac arrhythmias (I47-I49), epilepsy (G40), dizziness (H81, H82, R42) and headache (G43, G44, R51). According to epidemiological studies, the prevalence of depersonalization-derealization disorder is 1-2 %. We therefore conclude that F48.1 is severely underdiagnosed. Increased awareness for the detection of F48.1 and further health care research are urgently warranted. ","422":"Traumatic memories are characterized by not being accessible to intentional recall nor being integrated into the matrix of autobiographical memory. Based on this description, the authors discuss the process of narration as a central means of regaining a sense of self-coherence after traumatic experiences. Formally correct narratives are characterized by three functions: orientation, reference and evaluation. Through so-called \"memory talk\" with socio-culturally competent partners, children learn how to reconstruct memories and to represent experience by narration. It is therefore suggested that narratives are the basic ingredient of autobiographical memory. The process of re-establishing a sense of coherence after trauma relies on the capacity for coherent narration. The latter is often not possible with traumatic experiences. We conducted a literature search in multiple databases for linguistic analyses of trauma narratives empirically correlating narrative style and posttraumatic psychopathology. It is recommended that research in psychopathology and psychotherapy should take issues of language into account more systematically. ","423":"The significance of body perception and satisfaction with one's own body in patients with somatoform disorders of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract is presently unknown, as is the relationship thereof to depression and other psychiatric comorbidities. Consecutive patients from the outpatient clinic of a university centre presenting with symptoms suggestive of somatoform gastrointestinal disorders were examined by gastroenterological and psychosomatic experts. In addition, psychological tests (The Body Image Questionnaire, FKB-20, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS-D) were carried out. Complete data from n = 44 patients were evaluated. In 64 % of patients we found high scores of anxiety, and in 45 % high scores of depression. In the FKB-20, 32 % of patients scored high on the \"Negative Evaluation of the Body\" subscale (AKB), and 96 % had low scores on the subscale \"Perception of Body Dynamics\" (VKD). Patients with functional bowel disorders perceived their own body significantly more negative than did healthy controls and patients after acute myocardial infarction. The AKB subscale of the FKB-20 correlated significantly and positively with anxiety in the HADS. HADS depression in turn correlated negatively with the VKD subscale of the FKB-20: Patients with low scores in depression report higher vitality. Nearly half of the patients with somatoform gastrointestinal disorders seen at a university centre exhibited high scores in anxiety and depression. A substantial fraction reported disturbed body perception and satisfaction with their own body image. These patients have not yet found their place between somatic medicine and psychotherapy: Although somatic und psychological symptoms coexist to a similar degree, patients tend to focus predominantly on their somatic complaints. ","424":"The study investigates the psychic structure and psychiatric comorbidity of chronic pain patients according to Kernberg's concept of personality organization. We assessed 48 chronic pain patients attending the Behavioural Medicine Pain Clinic in the Department of Psychiatry. Patients were diagnosed using the SCID (DSM-IV). Psychic structure was assessed using the Structured Interview of Personality Organization (STIPO). At least one psychiatric diagnosis was found in 94 % of the patients, and 63 % of the patients met the criteria of at least one diagnosis of a personality disorder. In 58 % of the patients, we diagnosed a borderline personality organization, with high deficits in the dimensions of coping, defence mechanisms and identity. The high prevalence of borderline personality organization confirms the importance of a diagnostic investigation of the psychic structure and the necessity for psychotherapeutic treatment in chronic pain patients. ","425":"Stress is widely accepted as an etiologic factor of craniomandibular disorders (CMD). There is, however, a lack of studies evaluating the significance of interindividual differences of stress and coping for the development of CMD. 99 volunteers (33 male, 66 female) were observed over a period of 24 months. The clinical examination at the beginning and end of the observation time were carried out according to the protocol of the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (Dworkin 1992). Data concerning stress and general body complaints were evaluated twice by questionnaires, and data on coping methods were collected at the beginning of the study. Stress, coping methods and general body complaints correlate with clinical functional parameters. Stress and body complaints proved to be significant predictors via linear regression analyses. Stress and general somatic complaints are predictors of the development of craniomandibular disorders. ","426":"What impact do the degree of somatization and the presence of a comorbid psychological disorder have on health-related quality of life in patients with pain-dominated somatoform disorders? 282 consecutive patients (57.6 %) from a total population of N=490 patients fulfilling the criteria of somatoform pain disorders were included in the study following a thorough interdisciplinary diagnostic process at a German university hospital. Structured interviews (SKIDI and SKID-II) to assess comorbid psychological disorders as well as a structured biographical interview to assess chronification factors were conducted. We employed the Screening for Somatoform Disorders form (SOMS) to discover the extent and distribution of somatic symptoms and the SF-36 to determine the health-related quality of life. The patients exhibited a multiplicity of further somatic complaints apart from pain. 69 % had a comorbid psychological disorder. The health-related physical and psychological quality of life was clearly impaired in patients with \"small\", \"substantial\" and \"pronounced\" somatization. Regression analysis explained 48 % of the variance of the body-related and 35 % of the variance of the psychological quality of life: Besides the extent of somatization, older age, duration of pain-associated hospitalizations and the subjective amount of occupational impairment proved to be important. With regard to the psychological (but not the somatic) health-related quality of life, the presence of a current comorbid psychological disorder was also relevant. Patients with pain-dominated somatoform disorders are substantially impaired in their quality of life. Because 31 % of the patients with such disorders have no additional comorbid psychic disorder and the existence of a comorbid psychic disorder impacts only the psychological domain of their health-related quality of life, the results appear to strongly support maintaining the diagnostic category of somatoform disorders in ICD-11 and DSM-V. They also support the grading of the severity of the somatization similar to the grading of depressive disorders. ","427":"","428":"This paper focuses on the relationship between childhood experiences in wartime Germany and mental well-being in adulthood. An analysis of data from the Mannheim Cohort Study is done on a sample of 50 elderly people born between1935 and 1945. Overall development and World War II experiences in particular are correlated with later psychosomatic disturbances recorded over a period of 25 years. Individuals suffering from psychosocially influenced disorders were exposed to a significantly higher level of psychosocial stress during childhood than mentally healthy participants. Psychosomatic illness in adult life is, however, not related to the number of war experiences. The absence of one's father during childhood due to the war is not a predictor of long-term psychosomatic impairment. The results are discussed against the background of most participants coping with life's challenges and preserving their mental health for decades despite painful experiences and various hardships as a result of wartime experiences. ","429":"This clinical trial is concerned with controlling the validity of unconscious conflicts within the OPD by verifying the hypotheses by means of psychometric analysis. Unconscious conflicts were determined by use of the OPD as well as by psychometric tests (GT, IIP, RQ-2) for patients in treatment in a psychosomatic hospital; they were divided into an explorative (n=1377) and a confirmative (n=1380) sample. Using the Mann-Whitney U-test, we investigated the connection between the main conflicts according to OPD-1 and the psychometric findings. For seven of most frequently chosen conflict types, a great coherence was found. For the others the results were inconsistent. Concerning the seven most frequently chosen conflict types, the OPD is a valid diagnose tool. As to the other conflicts, this study cannot clear up open questions concerning validity. ","430":"In the context of an intensification of efforts to ensure sufficient psychooncological care for breast-cancer patients, the discussion concerning valid psychometric screening instruments gains a special relevance. The discriminant and diagnostic validity of HADS-D and PO-Bado were investigated in a sample of 123 women with breast cancer diagnosed for the first time. An ROC analysis revealed a cut-off score of greater than 9 for the subscale anxiety (sensitivity: 50%; specificity: 90%) for the use of HADS-D among breast cancer patients, whereas the recommended cut-off value was greater than 7 (sensitivity: 56%; specificity: 80%) for the subscale depression. Based on the anxiety and depression scores measured by HADS-D, 74% of the clinical cases could be classified correctly. Scores for physical and mental distress measured with PO-Bado were significantly lower in the investigated sample than in the control sample. HADS-D has only a moderate sensitivity for the group at hand. PO-Bado is a comprehensive basic documentation for specific psychooncological distress, though without cut-off values it is not useful as a screening instrument. ","431":"The effectiveness of simultaneous psychosomatic and internal-medicine inpatient care has not yet been satisfyingly investigated. What outcome is found in patients treated in a psychosomatic\/internal medicine setting? Can we predict a reduction in depression and symptom severity? The study design is prospective and naturalistic. Patients from a psychosomatic\/internal-medicine setting and a solely internal-medicine ward filled in self-report questionnaires on the day of admission, five days thereafter, and three months after discharge. A total of 221 patients from a psychosomatic\/internal-medicine setting and 418 patients from a solely internal-medicine ward were included. Patient characteristics differed significantly between the two wards. Treatment was associated with a reduction of depression and somatic symptom severity over time. Depression severity improved more in the psychosomatic\/internal-medicine setting than in the internal-medicine ward (ES = 0.37 vs. ES = 0.65). The strongest predictor of improvement of depression and somatic symptom severity was the patients' belief that their physical well-being was influenced by psychological factors (B = 1.44 and 1 = 0.65). The results document a differential approach to admission in an integrated psychosomatic\/internal medicine setting and underline the favourable course for psychological and somatic symptoms. ","432":"First, to determine the prevalence of symptoms of depersonalization (DP) and derealization (DR) in psychosomatic consultation-liaison patients and psychosomatic outpatients; second, to examine how DP-DR contributes to differences among patients with respect to the spectrum of other diagnoses, disease severity, history of psychotherapeutic outpatient treatment and psychiatric\/psychosomatic inpatient treatments as well as to self-rated distress. The sample comprises n=825 patients. In order to analyze the effects of DP-DR, the sample was divided into three subgroups of DP-DR severity: patients without symptoms of DP-DR, patients with mild DP-DR, and patients with clinical significant DP-DR. 34.8% patients had no symptoms of DP-DR, 48.2% mild DP-DR, and 17.0% scored clinical significant DP-DR. The severity of DP-DR was associated with other indicators of self- and observer-rated disease severity as well as with greater psychosomatic and psychiatric health care use. However, after adjustment for indicators of disease severity, the significant association between the use of psychotherapeutic outpatient treatment and psychiatric or psychosomatic inpatient treatment in the medical history disappeared. Symptoms of DP-DR are very common in psychosomatic patients. They represent an indicator of disease severity, which however is paradoxically not associated with increased use of psychotherapeutic health care. ","433":"This study investigates the stability of symptomatic and interpersonal changes after inpatient psychodynamic psychotherapy. 437 patients were assessed 3 to 5 years after discharge with the Symptom Checklist (SCL-90-R), the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP), global assessment of effectiveness and utilization of posttreatment psychotherapy. The therapist's perspective was evaluated by the Impairment Severity Score (BSS), the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF), and the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI). Patients improved in all SCL-90-R scales significantly. The Global Severity Index (GSI) effect size was 0.81 posttreatment and 0.82 at follow-up. All IIP scales improved significantly; effect size of IIP total score was 0.40 at posttreatment and 0.60 at follow-up. There were substantial gains in BSS,GAF, and CGI. 84% of the patients were in psychotherapy after dismissal. Posttreatment results were in accordance with comparable studies. The results are stable on a symptomatic level and improve further on an interpersonal level. ","434":"The objectives of the study were to examine (1) whether patients with social phobia report higher symptom load at the beginning and at the end of treatment and 1 year after treatment; and (2) whether the presence of social phobia is a factor that influences the course of treatment. 613 patients from a university hospital for psychosomatic medicine filled out questionnaires assessing symptom load (SCL 90-R, KOPS), physical symptoms, psychological and social impairment (KOPS), and depression (BDI). Social phobia was diagnosed based on a standardized diagnostic interview. 25%of the patients suffered from social phobia. They had significantly more concurrent mental disorders (4.18 vs. 2.41) and a higher symptom load than patients suffering from other mental disorders. They reported more physical complaints and depression and felt more impaired psychologically as well as socially. Even though both groups of patients profited from the treatment, compared to other patients, social phobia patients still had higher symptom load, impairment, and depression scores at the end of treatment and even at the follow-up 1 year after treatment. Social phobia is a severe disorder in which concurrent disorders frequently cause a high level of distress and impairment. These patients may benefit more from longer courses of treatment and\/or disorder-specific treatment elements. Diagnostic and therapy approaches tailored to the generalized type of social anxiety are discussed. ","435":"The HEALTH questionnaire, which originally consisted of 79 items, aims to assess generic aspects of psychosocial health. Based on large clinical and healthy samples (n = 1548 psychotherapy inpatients, n = 5630 primary-care patients), the questionnaire was shortened and psychometrically analyzed. The resulting 49-item questionnaire (\"HEALTH-49\") comprises six discrete modules with nine scales (somatoform complaints, depressiveness, phobic anxiety, psychological wellbeing, interactional problems, self-efficacy, activity and participation, social support, and social stress). It proves to be well accepted and feasible under routine conditions. Factor analyses confirm the intended dimensional configuration and the relative independence of modules. The scales reveal high reliability. Evidence of their validity and sensitivity to change are demonstrated. The HEALTH-49 is a self-rating instrument that allows for the comprehensive and economic assessment of generic aspects of psychosocial health. It is highly suitable for use in clinical practice. The questionnaire is available as a free download from http:\/\/www.hamburger-module.de\/ ","436":"This study investigates psychosocial distress and health-related quality of life in younger (up to 40 years), middle-aged (up to 50 years), and elderly cancer patients (up to 60 years). 637 patients (94%women, 75% breast-cancer patients) completed validated questionnaires measuring distress, anxiety, depression, fear of progression, and quality of life at the beginning (T0) and the end (T1) of a cancer rehabilitation program (T0\/T1 response rate: 72 %) as well as at 1-year follow-up (T2) (n = 485, T2 response rate: 76 %). Patients in the different age groups did not differ significantly in psychosocial distress at T0 except for fear of progression, which is lower among the younger age group. Elderly patients have a significantly lower physical quality of life. At the beginning of the rehabilitation program, patients in all age groups were significantly more anxious compared to population-based normative values, whereas higher depression was found only in younger and middle-aged patients. Patients in all age groups have a significantly lower quality of life compared to population-based normative values. In particular, large effect sizes were found for physical functioning domains. Patients in all age groups improve significantly in psychosocial distress and quality of life over time; however, significant interaction effects between age group and time were not observed in psychosocial distress and quality of life. Age differences are predominantly observed in physical quality-of-life dimensions rather than in psychosocial distress. This finding should be considered for the development of rehabilitation services. ","437":"The present state of knowledge about depersonalization (DP) and derealization (DR) is reviewed with respect to classification, epidemiology, etiology, and therapy. Mild and transient DP-DR are considered to be common phenomena. The prevalence of depersonalization-derealization disorder (DP-DR-D) is estimated to be approx. 1-2% of the general population in the Western hemisphere. DP-DR-D is probably severely underdiagnosed. DP-DR-D is strongly associated with depression and anxiety disorders. It is suggested that symptoms of DP-DR indicate disease severity and negatively predict therapy outcome. Neurobiological and psychological models have shown that a disordered body schema and emotional and autonomic blunting are essential components of the disorder. Despite the frequency of DPDR and its clinical relevance, there is a considerable lack of empirical research on DP-DR with respect to the health-care situation of depersonalized patients and with regard to treatment options.","438":"In 2006, the manual of the Operationalized Psychodynamic Diagnostics (OPD) was revised and published in its second edition (OPD-2; Arbeitskreis OPD2006). In particular the axis structure was markedly changed. This study assessed the interrater reliability and validity. Two independent raters judged 139 persons with OPD-2 on the axis structure (a third rater judged a partial sample of 20 persons). In addition, patients were investigated with SCID-Interviews for DSM-IV diagnosis and with the following questionnaires: Brief-Symptom-Checklist (BSI), Inventory of Personality Organisation (IPO), and Borderline Personality Inventory (BPI). Interrater agreement for the axis structure showed sufficient to good results for weighted kappas. The axis structure showed high correlations with the number of DSM-IV diagnoses and the main scales of the BSI, IPO, and BPI. The OPD-2 axis structure is a reliable and valid instrument for the assessment of the crucial clinical dimension of \"psychic structure\". ","439":"This prospective study analyzes the coping mechanisms of police officers directly after an event of potential traumatic nature in the line of duty (e. g. use of firearms) as well as 6 months later. 59 police officers were contacted by professional crisis intervention teams of the police force. After an extended interview, an ICD-10 diagnosis, if applicable, was assigned. Six months later a diagnosis was derived by a clinician (Diplom-Psychologe) using a structured interview. Coping strategies were accessed by the FKV (Freiburger Fragebogen zur Krankheitsverarbeitung) questionnaire. Fourteen police officers (28%) received the diagnosis of a PTSD (ICD-10: F43.1) at 6 months. The coping mechanisms of the traumatized police officers were significantly elevated in a dysfunctional manner in the areas \"emotional control and social retreat\" (only directly after the event), \"regression\", \"mistrust and pessimism\", and \"depressive processing\". Because dysfunctional coping mechanisms impede the decline of the symptoms, it may be considered adequate to strengthen the coping mechanisms for functional coping with these symptoms, thereby focusing on the dysfunctional coping strategy specific to the police force, namely, emotional control. ","440":"Over the last decades, social support (SU) has proved to be an important psychological health resource in the prevention of mental and physical illness as well as for the promotion and restoration of general health. This study evaluates the relevance of social support for the health and well-being of physicians. This is a systematic literature review using PubMed from 1970 to 2007 with the keywords \"social support\", \"physicians\", \"physician's role\", and respectively \"medical staff, hospital\" from medical subheadings (MeSH). From the retrieved articles the additionally relevant keywords \"marriage\", \"spouse\", \"friends\", and \"self-help groups\" (MeSH) were identified and researched. Social support with distinct effects on physician's health could be shown in the areas of colleagues and professional network (30 sources), marriage\/spouse (47), friends (3), and support groups (13). Female physicians appeared to seek and profit more from SU than did male physicians. Informal friendships have yet to be evaluated thoroughly. In the light of a physician's daily stress, SU appears to be a jeopardized resource that could significantly contribute to the prevention of burnout or other profession-related symptoms or illnesses. ","441":"The study investigates the development of anxiety and depression during residents' postgraduate training as well as the symptom patterns and the prediction of these patterns of impaired affectivity by personality factors. It furthermore regards the differences between these patterns in workplace- and career-related factors as well as in worklife balance. In a prospective cohort study (2001-2007), 390 junior physicians of various specialties (54.9% females, 45.1% males) were investigated with respect to the percentage of participants with elevated anxiety and depression scores at the beginning of the second, fourth, and sixth year of residency, respectively. Symptom patterns were evaluated by two-step cluster analysis. The prediction of the assignment to the symptom patterns was investigated by logistic regression analysis. The differences in further factors between the two patterns was analyzed by t-tests. In the second year of residency, relevant anxiety symptoms were found in 30% of the physicians, and in the fourth and sixth year in 20%; relevant depression symptoms were found in 15% and 10%, respectively. The cluster analysis revealed two symptom patterns: Type A (n = 135, 34.6%) with continuously elevated anxiety and depression symptoms; and type B (n = 255, 65.4%) with continuously low values. Personality factors such as the sense of coherence, self-esteem, occupational self-efficacy expectation, and overcommitment significantly predicted the assignment to the symptom patterns. Also in terms of workload, mentoring experience, career satisfaction, and worklife balance, persons of type A differ from those of type B. Personality factors play an important role in physicians' ability to cope with job demands. Persons with an elevated vulnerability for anxiety and depression should be continuously supported and counselled by a mentor during residency. ","442":"The preparation for treatment represents a specific and crucial issue in psychosomatic medicine and psychotherapy. A comprehensive interdisciplinary diagnosis is necessary that comprises both, the patient's psychopathology and biographical background. Since many patients are motivated externally and show a dysfunctional lay etiology, they often have to be motivated to begin treatment. Information must be supplied about the disorder, its etiology, and treatment options. Resistance against psychotherapy has to be addressed, which allows the patient to experience an initial helpful relationship.After a sufficient openness toward psychotherapy has been established, the patient is usually referred to a psychotherapist in private practice, since the doctor can treat only a few psychotherapy patients directly because of the time-consuming nature of psychotherapy. The success of referral can be increased by ad personam referral. In psychosomatic medicine and psychotherapy, doctors in private practice and outpatient units have an important and specific function in health care that cannot be delegated to other professionals. ","443":"Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) is closely associated with the bidirectional pathways between mind\/brain and the immune system. PNI research represents a rapidly growing area within psychosomatic research. Recent studies in PNI are based mainly on the immunological concepts of Th1\/Th2 dichotomy and inflammation. This review covers human PNI studies dealing with stress-associated changes in cytokine (Th1, Th2) levels in immune-related processes such as wound healing, atopic diseases as well as autoimmune and other inflammatory diseases. It is shown that PNI studies measuring immune activity near the site of the disease (e. g. woundhealing) and dealing with objective stressors show more consistent findings (stress-associated Th1\/Th2 shift, stress-associated proinflammatory activation) than those dealing with chronic and complex diseases (e. g., autoimmune disease). This warrants the expansion of the methodological repertoire in future PNI research toward designs allowing for the investigation of complex psychosomatic phenomena.","444":"","445":null,"446":"Findings are lacking that would prove the validity of the present classification of depressive disorders (ICD-10 and DSM-IV). For most depressions, such as nonmelancholic depression, personality style plays an important role for overcoming the stressful situation. During a 3-month follow-up-study we compared a sample of 50 depressed patients with a sample of 50 non-depressed people and further investigated subtypes of the wider class of so-called nonmelancholic depression. We found significant differences between the temperament and personality styles of the depressed and non-depressed subjects. The depressed sample showed significantly more anxiety, interpersonal sensitivity, social avoidance and reservations. An analysis of the subtypes of nonmelancholic depression confirmed the existence of a hostile and anxious depression, but not of an obsessive depression. A multidimensional model for the classification of depressive disorders would appear to be beneficial. It is indispensable for future differential diagnosis and treatment efficiency that the various temperament and personality styles (\"neurotic depression\") be explored. ","447":"This study investigates the success of recommendations for psychotherapy given in a psychosomatic consultation service to neurological inpatients. In 2005, a subset of 401 (55.7 %) former neurologic inpatients from the initial sample of 720 who underwent psychosomatic consultation between 1999 and 2004 completed follow-up questionnaires to telephone interviews. 279 (69.6 %) participants stated that they had received a recommendation for in- or outpatient psychotherapy during the psychosomatic consultation. Of these, 152 (54.5 %) followed this recommendation. No differences in age, gender, familial status, initial symptoms, and diagnoses were detected between those who underwent psychotherapy and those who did not. Patients who underwent psychotherapy reported significant improvement of symptoms, less impairment, and less disability. A psychosomatic consultation may be a useful adjunct to neurological diagnostics in order to determine the correct diagnosis and therapy for patients with pseudo-neurological symptoms or evidence of psychological problems. ","448":"The increasing survival of cancer patients is the result of early detection, improved treatment, and demographic change. This poses urgent questions regarding the stresses and needs for care long-term survivors face. A literature survey (PubMed, Scopus) was conducted based on all publications with a psychooncological background from 2004 to 2008 concerning long-term survivors. Of the 164 publications found, 74 referred to breast cancer; 62 % came from the United States and only 4 % from Germany. Although overall quality of life among long-term survivors appears to be good, considerable adverse somatic effects (long-term effects, late consequences, recidivism, second tumors) and mental effects (e.g., fear of recurrence) persist. Somatic and psychosocial determinants of long-term adjustment, health behaviour, health care needs and utilization, and the quality of life of next-to-kin have hardly been studied. The effects of psychotherapy on survival remain controversial. In light of the growing number of long-term surviving cancer patients, it is necessary to study their strains and needs for care under a lifespan perspective. ","449":"The paper introduces the new German Guidelines for the Treatment of Unipolar Depression in Adults. An overview is given of the long timespan of the development and the process of consensus decisions. We report the essential parts of the statements and recommendations. The recommendations in the guidelines stress the importance of psychotherapeutic approaches to the treatment of depression as a baseline or adjunct treatment to pharmacotherapy. We also describe conflictual issues, such as methodological problems in the psychotherapy section, bias in pharmacotherapy research, and competition in different fields of the health care system. The German Guidelines are a progressive step in the field of health care. They integrate the contributions of many different providers and levels of care.","450":"This review illustrates the present core findings of alexithymia research. We provide a brief historical background and then show the most important clinical, epidemiological, and psychophysiological findings, focusing on recent EEG and neuro-imaging studies. We describe the neuropsychological and developmental aspects of alexithymia and link them with possible treatment concepts and strategies for outcome evaluation. Finally, suggestions for further empirical research activities are given.","451":"Construction of the newly developed \"ICD-10 Symptom Rating\" (ISR) is presented together with some statistical data. This questionnaire is founded on the well-known ICD-10, according to which symptoms are relevant for assessing psychological disorders. The ISR aims at a comprehensive evaluation of the severity of psychological disorders. The ISR 2.0 has 29 items and six syndrome scales: Depression, Anxiety, Obsessive\/Compulsive, Somatoform, Eating Disorders, and the Supplementary Scale, which covers a variety of syndromes, as well as a total score. In a first cross-validation with 108 patients, some rather high correlations were found between the SCL-90-R and the ISR. They ranged from r = 0.78 to 0.37 for the individual syndrome scales, and amounted to r = 0.78 for the GSI versus the total score.

Additionally, we examined patients' interest in participation in a group-psychotherapy. The intervention and its effects on symptom reduction were tested in a subgroup of patients. Assessment of anxiety and depression (HADS) in 58 cardiology inpatients at 3 time points (t1 after one year, t2 after 1(1\/2) years). N = 9 patients were additionally included in a 6-month psychotherapy intervention and compared to N = 14 untreated patients. 79 % of the patients were interested in beginning a psychotherapy intervention. Without psychotherapeutic treatment, the average psychological strain remained stable over the time of investigation. Intervention-group patients, however, achieved a significant (60 %) reduction in depression and anxiety scores. Implications for the clinical practice and further investigations are discussed. ","454":"Mentalization has been primarily investigated in Borderline Personality Disorders. This pilot study takes the first step toward investigating mentalization in depressive patients. First, we present the theoretical background of the concept of mentalization and previous studies. Secondly, we report the results of this pilot study. 20 female inpatients suffering from Major Depressive Disorder were investigated with SKIDI+II, depression-scales (HAM-D, BDI), cognitive tests (TMT, MCVCT), and the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI), rated according to the Reflective Functioning Scale (RF Scale). Depressed patients showed less capacity for mentalization (RF = 2.3) than did borderline patients (RF approximately 3) and healthy individuals (RF approximately 5). Comorbidity with dependent personality disorder correlated with higher RF scores, while comorbidity with schizoid personality disorder correlated with lower RF scores. Moderate to severe depression goes along with a breakdown of mental capacity. Further research should focus on investigating changes in the capacity for mentalization in remission and changes in the course of psychotherapeutic treatments. ","455":"Anxiety and depression are more prevalent in patients with medical diseases than in the general population. The current diagnostic systems for depression\/anxiety in the field of comorbidity, however, are problematic. Higher comorbidity has deteriorating consequences in all bio-psycho-social respects. The aetiologic connections between medical disease and psychological disorders are complex bidirectional somato-psycho-somatic ones. Seven modalities of comorbidity for coronary heart disease (myocardial infarction) and depression\/anxiety are discussed. The psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatment of anxiety\/depression in patients with medical diseases follows general guidelines. ","456":"Prostate carcinoma is the most frequent tumor in men. The psychosocial distress associated with the diagnosis and the relevant treatment approaches available are summarized and critically evaluated based on the present literature. A computer search for appropriate studies was done using previously defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The studies were evaluated for methodological quality based on the criteria of the Cochrane Collaboration. 47 cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of psychosocial distress and 13 controlled studies with mostly psychoeducative interventions were identified for the period from 1980 to 2007. Psychosocial distress resulted from urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, and the related lack of role confidence as well as problems in partnership. The intervention studies reveal their efficacy especially with respect to improved coping with disease in prostate-specific problems. Some studies also show a decrease in depressive symptoms and loss of confidence, improved communication in the partnership and improved physical and emotional well-being of the partner. Because of the broad heterogeneity of the interventions and measuring instruments used, a metaanalysis could not be performed. The results show that even low-threshold, brief interventions may lead to small to moderate effects in disease-specific problems. No intervention studies have yet been performed in Germany. ","457":"","458":"The success of referral for psychotherapy and the predictors thereof are investigated in dentistry in an outpatient unit for psychosomatics. 238 patients were asked in a telephone interview concerning their satisfaction with the consultation as well as any change in their complaints and treatments after their contact with the outpatient unit. 82.3 % of the patients were satisfied with the consultation, and 55.9 % reported an improvement in their complaints. In 76.1 % of the patients psychotherapy was indicated, and 56.7 % showed motivation and were referred to psychotherapy. Thereof, 66.7 % actually began treatment. Introspective capacity and motivation for psychotherapy predicted successful referral. Patients suffering from somatoform disorders were significantly less motivated to begin psychotherapy and showed a tendency toward premature termination of psychotherapy. In patients with anxiety disorders, the reverse was the case. Patients who did not begin psychotherapy changed their dentist significantly more frequently. The consultation at the outpatient unit can be regarded as successful insofar as four-fifths of the patients were satisfied and two-thirds of those referred actually began psychotherapy, which in turn significantly reduces \"dentist shopping.\" ","459":"In the present study we examined the facial affective behaviour of acute adult-onset traumatized patients versus childhood-onset traumatized patients. Furthermore, we analyzed whether a decrease in emotional numbing results from a reduction of symptoms. We used amnestic tendencies as a moderator variable. The facial affective behaviour was coded with the Emotional Facial Acting Coding System, an instrument for the registration of facial movements with emotional relevance. The facial affective behaviour of the patient's first and last EMDR sessions was compared. Childhood-onset and acute adult-onset traumatized patients showed the same reduction of overall facial activity. We found significantly higher psychic complaints (global severity index) (SCL-90-R) in childhood-onset traumatized patients and no difference in amnestic tendencies (FDS) between the two groups. Childhood-onset traumatized patients showed higher values of derealisation (FDS). The facial affective reduction remains constant over time. Also childhood-onset traumatized patients developed more psychic complaints and greater derealisation. ","460":"This study assesses the development of patients with anxiety disorders in self-help groups. An additional investigation studies the attitude of psychotherapists toward such self-help groups. 33 participants from three self-help groups were assessed using nonstandardised and standardised questionnaires (SCL-90-R, STAI). In addition, 250 psychotherapists were surveyed. Subjectively, the patients experienced their group as being helpful and described their symptoms as having slightly improved. The patients showed high scores in the anxiety questionnaire, which marginally improved over time. Avoiding behaviour did not change. The patients showed small improvements on some SCL scales (compulsiveness, aggressiveness, phobia, psychoticism). More than 80 % of the psychotherapists studied share the opinion that a self-help group can indeed support the course of a psychotherapeutic treatment. Self-help groups are effective from the view of both the patients and the psychotherapists. Yet, most patients studied continued to show high scores of anxiety and psychopathology. ","461":"Despite its clinical and health economic importance, only few studies have analyzed the problem of dropout behavior from treatment in psychosomatic medicine and psychotherapy. For quality-assurance purposes and in light of limited resources in our medical system, it is important to identify future dropouts and to intervene appropriately during ongoing inpatient treatment. In a representative sample taken from inpatient psychosomatic rehabilitation, we evaluated the prevalence of dropout behavior as well as characteristics of patients who drop out compared to patients who complete the treatment regularly. Data of 2059 inpatients from the Psychosomatic Hospital Bad Neustadt\/Saale were analyzed as to rates and dates of dropout and other patient characteristics. Overall 15.7 % of the patients dropped out of inpatient psychosomatic rehabilitation after a mean treatment duration of 28 days. Patients who dropped out tended to be younger, reported less distress, were less motivated, and had been diagnosed less often with an affective disorder as main diagnosis. Compared with patients who completed therapy regularly, they also profited less from both self- as well as external assessment of symptom change. It was shown that it is useful to differentiate the method and time of dropout. A differentiation of dropout characteristics is important for developing interventions to reduce dropout rates. ","462":"This study examines the relationship between personality characteristics, depression symptoms, demographic profile, and the amount of the tinnitus-related distress experienced. 121 patients suffering from tinnitus were examined by unique testing in a tinnitus-practice via three questionnaires over a period of 22 months. A relationship between the severity of tinnitus-related distress and demographic profile as well as a relationship between depression symptoms and the severity of the tinnitus-related distress could be shown. Also, significant results were observed within the personality range in the areas of \"impulsiveness,\" \"aggressiveness,\" \"demands,\" \"physical discomfort,\" \"health worries,\" und \"emotionality.\" Patients suffering severely from tinnitus represent a clinically relevant group for psychotherapeutic treatment. Especially persons with comorbid symptoms of depression should be screened regularly and offered additional psychotherapeutic or psychiatric treatment. ","463":"The ADP-IV is a self-assessment instrument of personality disorders providing categorical as well as dimensional diagnoses. The German translation of the Dutch original has already shown sufficient reliability as well as a rather weak convergent validity of categorical diagnoses. This study investigates the validity of the dimensional assessment of personality disorders. Four hundred patients and a community sample of 385 subjects completed the ADP-IV. A SCID-II interview and an expert consensus rating were also performed in 210 patients. Norms for patients and the community sample were calculated by using z-transformation. Receiver operator curves (ROC) were employed for the determination of cut-offs for categorical diagnoses on the basis of the dimensional scores. The ROC analyses resulted in negative predictive values of 99 % for the five most frequent personality disorders in the sample; in contrast, positive predictive values were low. The instrument is well suited for screening purposes, allowing for a reliable exclusion of personality disorders. For diagnosing personality disorders, however, clinical interviewing remains necessary. Norms and a dimensional personality disorder profile provide hints concerning the presence of pathological personality traits with respect to the reference group. The ADP-IV represents the only German-language questionnaire for the assessment of DSM-IV personality disorders which has been sufficiently validated.

Critics see this as a \"watering down\" of medical psychotherapy. The majority applaud the greater proximity to practice and the possibility of achieving psychosomatic expertise. The new advanced specialist training regulations permit therapeutic interventions by the primary care physician beyond psychosomatic primary care. A curriculum has been developed in the Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy of the University Hospital Freiburg, which has completed the pilot phase and is now offered in block courses over a period of 2 years.

The questionnaire TxEQ was translated into German and filled out by 370 heart, lunge, liver and kidney transplant patients. Subsequently, factor and item analyses were conducted. The SF-36 was used to test validity. The TxEQ-D has the same factorial structure as the English version as well as comparable psychometric properties. The TxEQ-D factor \"worry about transplant\" shows the highest correlations with the 10 scales of the SF-36, the lowest correlations with the 10 scales of the SF-36 scales are found for the factor \"adherence\". The TxEQ-D is a useful screening instrument in psychosomatic research and in the psychotherapy practice to detect patients with problematic emotional responses to an organ transplantation. ","467":"The current study assessed the correlation between the trauma \"death of important relatives\" and the prevalence of the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In a cross-sectional study, 317 subjects (age 37.4; SD 12.6) were examined with the Essen Trauma Inventory (ETI). The PTSD point-prevalence was 13.1%. The death of important relatives was the second common traumatic event in the investigated sample (44.6%; N=139). This event was most frequently reported as being the worst trauma (25.4%). About 15.1% of those who reported death of important relatives as their worst traumatic event, fulfilled our study criteria for a PTSD. However, in comparison with other traumas this traumatic event was associated with a low probability of PTSD (4% in the total sample). Women and men did not differ with regard to PTSD prevalence. However, men evaluated the trauma \"death of important relatives\" more often as the worst event in their life than women (chi2=7.24; p&lt;.007). Our data suggest that an omnipresent phenomenon like death of important relatives, despite a lower risk of PTSD, is a severe traumatic event with a high psychological strain for many people. ","468":"While psychosomatic clinics in German hospitals in general provide consultation-liaison and outpatient services, up to now no direct comparisons of the two systems of care have been made. Based on a comparison of 750 CL patients and 617 outpatients from a university hospital during the course of one year, differences between the two patient populations were recorded for referral, reasons for presentation, and psychotherapeutic recommendations. Compared to outpatients (43 years), the average age of CL-patients was higher (50 years); the proportion of men was higher, and level of education was lower. Adjustment disorders and psychological factors in somatic disorders were more frequently diagnosed (versus more somatoform, affective and anxiety disorders in outpatients). CL patients had fewer experiences with psychotherapy and were overall less distressed than outpatients. More frequently they were recommended basic psychosomatic care or psychiatric outpatient treatment and less outpatient psychotherapy. Implications for concepts of care are discussed. A uniform basic documentation for the two fields of care seem to make sense. ","469":"To investigate criteria-related validity of the operationalization of body\/sexuality in OPD-2 in relation to the patient's self assessment of the Frankfurt Body Concept Scales. 105 psychotherapy inpatients were examined by the Frankfurt Body Concept Scales (self-assessment) and OPD-1 research interviews were videotaped in the first week after admission. Two OPD-certified raters rated the interviews first independently, then in a consensus rating. Due to the different frequency of the main conflict and mode, evaluation of psychodynamic hypotheses concerning 4 of 7 conflicts and the structure levels good integration (1) to low integration (3) was possible. The a priori hypotheses could be confirmed for both modes of the conflicts Dependence vs. Autonomy, Submission vs. Control, Self-Value, the passive mode of Desire for Care vs. Autarchy and the levels of structural integration. The deviating results of the active mode of the conflict Desire for Care vs. Autarchy can be explained plausibly. Confirmation of most of the a priori hypotheses indicates validity of the operationalization of \"body\/sexuality\" and \"body self\" in OPD-2.

Using a naturalistic design, 25 sessions of the CMP\/SASB model of short-term dynamic therapy were applied to 112 outpatients. Patients with neurotic disorders constituted the control group. The effect sizes and the clinical significance were established by the end of therapy and at 6- and 12-month-follow-up. All groups improved significantly. Neurotic patients (1.6) performed better than psychosomatic and personality (.82) disorders (.94). Patients showed clinically relevant improvements in the following order: 49% of neurotic, 46% of psychosomatic and 39% of personality disorders. Both target groups attained significant treatment gains and demonstrated the effectiveness of short-term dynamic psychotherapy in clinical practice. However, we found evidence that patients with personality disorders required additional psychotherapy in order to achieve essential dynamic changes.

Using videotapes of 10 fifteen-hour short-term therapies by very experienced therapists treating an unselected group of patients, facial affect and metaphoric language of the therapist and the patient as well as the temporal distance between the two was recorded. The density of metaphors was not significantly correlated with symptom reduction but with treatment satisfaction. However, symptom reduction correlated significantly with the frequency of interactive metaphors used by both the therapist and the patient. It could be shown that there is an optimal time window between facial affect and metaphor production beyond the here and now, but not as a long term memory.

In 38 psychoanalytic treatments, severity of symptoms (SCL-90-R), interpersonal problems (IIP), character traits and psychostructural functioning (SWAP-200) were investigated half-yearly. Predictors for drop-out were identified using stepwise binary logistic regression models and repeated ANOVA models. The statistical stability was controlled using a jackknife algorithm. For the first year denial of needs for closeness, conflicts around engagement and abandonment, as well as fears of an impulsive breakthrough of negative affects predicted dropout of therapy. During the second year externalizing defence, projection\/projective identification, somatisation, hypochondria and dismissive interpersonal behaviour predicted break-ups. For psychoanalytic technique, it is necessary to perceive and catch paranoid anxieties, negative affects, externalizing mechanisms and projective identification from the very beginning as well as to interpret and work through these elements in transference thoroughly in order to prevent treatment dropout.

A consecutive sample of 105 psychotherapy inpatients was examined using self-assessment scales (Inventory of Interpersonal Problems; Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Test of Self-Conscious Affect; Toronto Alexithymia-Scale; Frankfurt Self Concept Scales) and videotaped OPD research interviews in the first week after admission to the hospital. Two OPD-certified raters first rated the interviews independently, then in a consensus rating. Due to the different frequency of the main conflict and mode, evaluation of 4 of 7 conflicts was possible. The a priori hypotheses could be confirmed for the conflicts Dependence versus Autonomy (both modes), Submission versus Control (active mode), Desire for Care versus Autarchy (active mode), and Self-Value (passive mode). Confirmation of the a priori hypotheses indicates validity of axis III (Conflicts) of OPD. We discuss the small numbers of some conflicts, the comparison of expert rating OPD with self-assessment and the meaning of the results for OPD-2. ","475":"Recently, a newly developed German program for the prevention of anorexia nervosa in girls (\"PriMa\") was successfully tested for effectiveness in a controlled study with prepost-design in 1,006 girls from 42 Thuringian schools (Berger et al. 2007). In the present article the test of the program's effectiveness was completed by an evaluation of the program's conception and its process. Using questionnaires, protocols and phone interviews, single parts of the program (kick-off presentation, n = 400; teachers training, n = 34; lessons, n = 392) as well as single lessons (n = 87 girls and n = 14 teachers) were evaluated. All parts of the program were evaluated as being significantly positive (better than 2.5 on a six-point scale). The questionnaires used were reliable (Cronbach's alpha between .74 and .84). The survey of program users resulted in shorter research questionnaires, a more detailed teaching manual with more interactive exercises and smaller training groups (14 instead of 20 participants). The introduced work points out the need to complete the evaluation of program impact with verbal and written evaluations of direct and indirect program users. This is the only way to reveal information about the program's strengths and weaknesses to continuously adjust and improve single program parts. ","476":"A summary of the epidemiology, etiology and therapy of obesity is given with special emphasis on psychosomatic aspects. Overweight and obesity are widespread and go hand in hand with an increased health risk. The etiology of obesity is multifactorial based on gene\/environment interactions; hyperalimentation and physical inactivity, as an expression of the rapid technical advancements within the past decades, have, however, had a decisive influence on the pandemic spreading of obesity. The prevalence of mental disorders is increased particularly in obese women. Although phylogenetically of relevance, an environment that associates slimness with beauty, health, physical and mental proficiency leads to a stigmatization of the obese. The results are mental symptoms and disorders. On the contrary, mental problems up to and including the full clinical picture of mental disorders may lead to changes in eating and exercise behaviour, the result of which may be a sustained positive energy balance with overweight and obesity. The success of conservative weight reduction measures in obesity is inadequate. Surgical measures are more successful, but they are only indicated for severe obesity. The psychosomatic and psychotherapeutic approach to overweight and obesity is multifactorial and indispensable. Obesity is not an eating disorder; it may, however, be the result of hyperalimentation into which pathogenetic and mental factors have been incorporated.","477":"Physicians as well as the general public need easy access to information on regional psychosomatic treatment options as can be provided by a network website. We therefore set out to explore the readiness of the Austrian psychosomatic community to participate in a network for Psychosomatic Medicine and actively contribute to its website. All Austrian psychosomatic societies and all psychosomatic in-patient facilities were addressed personally and\/or by letter. Through articles published in medical journals, physicians in private practices specialized in psychosomatic-psychotherapeutic medicine were also invited to participate. All departments of medical psychology and psychotherapy, all psychosomatic societies and all psychosomatic in-patient facilities in Austria decided to participate in this network. In addition, 100 physicians in private practice applied for registration in the network. These results support the network concept and have led to its implementation, and clearly, the network should be further developed. The first precondition for its functioning seems to be met.

On the basis of 600 assessments by medical experts of applicants for compensation, a list of individual details of posttraumatic stress disorders as well as different salutogenetic elements are identified. In more than the half of the patients the posttraumatic stress disorders did not occur progressively. The most frequent posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were sleep disturbances, recurrent nightmares, intrusive recollections as well as depressive and anxiety disorders. The salutogenetic factors found concerned the state of Israel, the differentiated communication within the marriage of two survivors, the birth of children and various specific holocaust-related issues. The correlations between posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and long-term course on the one hand and salutogenetic factors on the other are discussed. ","480":"The concept of disorders of extreme stress not otherwise specified (DESNOS) was designed to encompass the psychopathological consequences of interpersonal and ongoing traumatic experiences. This study examined the prevalence rate of DESNOS among students who reported having gone through war experiences. The sample consisted of 55 Kosovar students who had been exposed to war-related events. The various variables were recorded with the Structured Interview for Disorders of Extreme Stress (SIDES), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). 16.4% of the participants met the criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder but none of them could be diagnosed as suffering from DESNOS. However, the symptoms somatization, altered relationships, and altered systems of meaning were reported by 21-37% of the participants. The DESNOS total score was found to be a better predictor of psychiatric distress than posttraumatic stress symptoms. The results argue against the validity of DESNOS as a diagnostic construct for evaluating the effects of war traumatisation. Further study is necessary to determine whether changes in the individual subscales are relevant to the assessment of psychological aftereffects of war. ","481":"The aim of this study was to examine the impact of parenthood on the quality of life of cancer patients. A sample of 246 cancer patients (56% female) with different cancer locations were surveyed at the beginning of their inpatient medical treatment (t1) and 6 months afterward (t2) using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Three subgroups were compared in a cross-section and a longitudinal design. The variables sex, partnership, distant metastases and age were controlled. A negative impact of parenthood on certain sub-dimensions of quality of life was seen in contrast to patients without children at the time of the acute treatment (t1). After 6 months (t2) quality of life was increased, particularly in the subgroup of patients with younger children. However, there were no other statistically relevant differences between patients with or without children. Some variables such younger age, male sex and partnership have a positive impact on quality of life of patients. In conclusion, the present findings suggest that special psychosocial support during the acute treatment is necessary for cancer patients with children. The presence of younger children can possibly be interpreted as a protective factor in the process of illness. The development of suitable instruments for the measurement of psychosocial burden of parents with cancer and their children and the implementation and evaluation of specific intervention programs should be the goal of further investigations. ","482":"In this study we investigated for the first time the facial activity of patients with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) compared to healthy controls during the Adult Attachment Projective (AAP). The AAP is a valid interview measure for assessing adult attachment representation. The attachment system is activated by eight attachment-related pictures. The subjects are asked to tell a story about each picture. The affective facial behavior during the AAP interview in 15 female patients with BPD and 14 healthy women was coded using EMFACS. Affective facial behavior was compared between diagnostic and attachment groups (resolved versus unresolved trauma). As expected, there was a significantly higher number of BPD patients in the category \"unresolved trauma\" of the AAP. The BPD patients also showed significantly more disgust during the attachment task as compared to controls. The two main results are discussed in the context of frequent traumatic experiences such as sexual abuse and emotional neglect suffered by BPD patients through their attachment figures. ","483":"In the following study we investigate which patients gained most by attending 10 psychoeducational lessons on cancer-related topics. A total of N=294 cancer patients participated in the prospective study and were assigned either to the intervention group (IG; N=160) or to the control group (CG; N=134). Psychometric data was collected at the beginning of the course (t0) as well as two (t1) and four months later (t2) We found a significant decrease in anxiety after two months in the intervention group. The intervention group also was significantly more satisfied with care after two and four months. Particularly the patients with a higher education level and patients suffering from malignancies with a more protracted course such as lymphoma or colon cancer improved by attending the lessons. Breast cancer and female sex turned out to be predictors for the search for information. Ten sessions of psychoeducation in the context of interdisciplinary cancer therapy can be an effective intervention at moderate cost. ","484":"The study explores the course and outcome of inpatient psychodynamic psychotherapy (N=200) with particular regard to interpersonal experiences and behaviour. Based on the implementation of a focus conference, the multi-professional team members formulated an interpersonal treatment focus and individualised helpful interpersonal attitude towards the patient (so-called therapeutic tuning). This focus formulation follows the systematic procedure provided by the Operationalised Psychodynamic Diagnostics System (OPD-2). The study was initiated to evaluate the effectiveness of the so-called \"tuning-treatment\" compared to inpatient \"treatment as usual\". Compared to \"treatment as usual\", the tuning condition showed greater improvement (p&gt;.001) in interpersonal functioning (GARF). Interpersonal problems (IIP) and symptoms (SCL-90-R) were slightly more improved than in the \"treatment as usual\" cases (p=.13 and. p=.09). An interpersonal treatment focus followed by focus-oriented interventions is a promising approach for inpatient psychodynamic psychotherapy. Generalisation of the empirical results is, however, limited due to problems of internal validity.

Medical students (N = 366) in their clinical training were given half-standardized questionnaires about their attitudes towards psychotherapeutic treatments, their career plans, psychosocial distress and sociodemographic characteristics. There was an overall high interest in psychological distress of patients and in psychotherapeutic treatment methods. Contrary to these findings, however, only few medical students were willing to specialize in psychosomatic medicine, psychiatry or psychotherapy. Psychosomatic and psychotherapeutic career choices were more frequent in women as well as in students who had experienced psychological distress themselves, and who had undergone psychotherapy, and who were less oriented toward economic success and careers. Medical students regarded psychological characteristics as generally interesting and important for medical care, but rarely considered specializing in these medical fields after graduation. Potential remedies (e.g., improved teaching of psychosocial competences and psychotherapeutic knowledge, career counselling) are discussed.

A representative sample of 2552 participants (1206 men and 1346 women) with an age range from 14 to 92 years were questioned using the random-route-technique by an opinion research institute. The subsample of the cohort born until 1945 was comprised of 776 participants (30.4 % of the complete sample), of whom 375 were men (48.3 %) and 401 women. 161 participants (20.7 % of the cohort born until 1945) had been bombed out (66 men and 95 women). Comparing those who had been bombed out to those who had not been did not show any significant differences concerning their age, their place of residence (Eastern vs. Western Germany), marital status, education level or income level. From a gender perspective women had been bombed out more frequently (p &lt; .05). Four predictors rendered in a multiple regression analysis significant contributions for the prediction of negative body functioning: age, having been bombed out, low income level and low education level (9 % of the variance could be explained). The results show the necessity for a new approach to the long-term consequences of severe strain and traumata concerning psychopathology of older people. For this purpose the concept of ambivalence must be further developed. ","489":"In World War II, 2.5 million children in Germany lost their fathers. Most of them grew up with their single mother, often accompanied by financial hardship. In a questionnaire carried out in 2003 in persons born before 1947, a rate of 19 % reported that they grew up with their mother alone. The present study examines whether long-term sequelae can be observed in these persons. Therefore, a representative sample of 883 subjects with an average age of 68 was questioned about psychiatric symptoms (SCL-27), loss of father and experiences during the war. Subjects reporting a loss of father had consistently more psychiatric symptoms. Three out of the six subscales of the SCL-27 displayed highly significant differences (depressive symptoms, symptoms of social phobia, symptoms of mistrust). Vegetative symptoms were also higher, but the effect was less pronounced. Agoraphobic and dysthymic symptoms did not show significantly higher values. It can be concluded that growing up without a father may have life-long consequences. ","490":"By the end of Word War II, a substantial proportion of the German population was subjected to flight and expulsion. Severe strain and traumatization were described in individual reports. Preliminary studies based on selected samples indicated profound long-term consequences but no representative studies have been carried out to date. The purposes of the present study were to compare quality of life and well-being of former refugees and non-refugees and to identify risk factors for compromised well-being. A representative sample of the German population (N = 2.043) was interviewed about experiences of flight and expulsion and their present quality of life. The refugees (18 % of the respective age group; N = 133) reported a reduced physical quality of life at the time of the study (SF-36). Furthermore, they suffered more often from panic attacks and were compromised in their health and well-being. In the regression analysis, the status as a former refugee was predictive for a reduced quality of life and anxiety, in addition to female gender, higher age and lower income. The study demonstrates the long-term consequences of flight and expulsion. Further studies are needed on individual coping with the aging process and biographical exposure to traumatic experiences.

Symptom severity was measured using SCL-R-90 symptom check list and BSS (Impairment Score). A questionnaire for patients' assessment of perceived help and stress by each subsetting of the therapy program was administered weekly. Personality assessment included (1) personality traits related to specific personality disorder as defined by SCID-II interview and questionnaire, (2) interpersonal problems as measured by the IIP, (3) self-related affiliation as measured by SASB-INTREX questionnaire (Introjekt), and (4) psychotrauma as determined by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Therapy outcome measures were: change of SCL-90-R, change of BSS, perceived change in VEV. Perceived help and stress by the total setting, by inpatient group therapy and by fellow patients were shown to be primarily influenced by personality traits related to DSM-IV clusters of personality disorders, particularly by Cluster-A-related traits. Interpersonal dominance and trauma history had an influence as well. Perceived help and stress by subsettings of inpatient psychotherapy can be predicted on the basis of several aspects of personality. ","493":"It is argued that the approaches used up to now for analyzing dysfunctional relationship patterns are more or less explicitly based on a conflict model and therefore not adequate for describing relationships characterized by structural impairments of a patient's personality. Using the concepts of conflict and structure as derived from the Operationalized Psychodynamic Diagnostic system (OPD-2), four principles of a dysfunctional relationship formation are discussed. It is shown that the differentiation of conflict- and structure-related pathology is highly significant with regard to the selection of an appropriate psychotherapeutic strategy. Furthermore, the connections between the OPD axes relationship, conflict, and structure are conceptualized.","494":"Different methods are available for the psychotherapeutic treatment of patients with severe structural mental disorders. Psychoanalytic-interactional therapy is among those methods which have been clinically proven to be effective for many years. Psychoanalytic-interactional therapy was derived from analytic psychotherapy specifically to allow for the treatment of severely disturbed patients, e.g. patients with borderline personality disorders, prepsychotic disorders, addictions and perversions. In a naturalistic study, the effectiveness of psychoanalytic-interactional therapy was tested in a sample of patients with borderline personality disorders (N = 132). The patients were treated at the Clinic Tiefenbrunn near Goettingen, Germany. Standardized, reliable and valid diagnostic instruments were used to study the treatment effects. Psychoanalytic-interactional therapy was found to significantly improve target symptoms, general symptoms, interpersonal problems and life satisfaction.

","495":"The \"Assessment of DSM-IV Personality Disorders (ADP-IV)\" represents a 94-item questionnaire that allows for a categorical and dimensional assessment of the DSM-IV personality disorders. Psychometric properties of the German ADP-IV were investigated in 400 psychotherapy outpatients and a community sample of 385 persons. The SCID-II interview and a standardised expert consensus rating were employed for the assessment of concurrent validity. The ADP-IV showed satisfactory reliability; the median Cronbach's alpha for the subscales was .76 (range .65-.87), the median retest reliability .79 (range .37-.88). Factor analysis revealed an 11-factor solution that explained 49.4% of the variance. The median correlation of the dimensional ADP-IV subscale scores with the SCID-II and the expert consensus ratings were .51 (range: .34-.72) and .44 (range: .27-.62), respectively. The kappas for the chance corrected agreement of categorical ADP-IV diagnoses with the SCID-II diagnoses and the expert ratings were .35 and .29 for any personality disorder and a median of .37 and .30 for the specific personality disorders. The ADP-IV shows satisfactory reliability and a validity that is comparable and partly superior to other self-rating instruments. The advantages of the instrument are its brevity, the inclusion of distress ratings, and the dimensional scoring that allows for the construction of detailed profiles of personality pathology.

Specifically, the research question addressed the efficacy of long-term therapy in specific diagnostic groups and was was compared with that of a parallel group who underwent shorter-term psychodynamic therapy. Data from four German studies addressing the efficacy of outpatient psychoanalytic long-term therapy were collected. Evaluation of these data was carried for specific diagnostic groups allowing for comorbid diagnoses. The effects of psychoanalytic therapy were assessed by pre-post and pre-follow-up comparisons using paired t-tests. Additionally, effect sizes were calculated. Psychoanalytic long-term psychotherapy and shorter-term psychodynamic therapy were compared by using a repeated measure ANOVA: Pretreatment vs. posttreatment\/follow-up (two-levels) with the between subject factor \"therapy conditions\" (two levels). The results showed that in terms of improvement of symptoms and interpersonal problems, psychoanalytic long-term therapy was at least as effective as shorter term psychodynamic therapy with regard to the following ICD-10 diagnostic groups: affective disorders (F3), anxiety disorders (F40; F41; F42), personality disorders (F60; F61; F62), and a group of mixed neurotic disorders (F43; F50; F51; F1; F55). Effect sizes were large and remained stable at follow-up. The authors emphasize the clinical relevance of the examined diagnostic groups and relatively large effects achieved by the psychoanalytic treatment. Furthermore, the occurrence of comorbid diagnoses and their consequences are discussed. The authors stress that the specific effects of psychoanalytic therapy can only be very insufficiently tapped by the outcome measures referring to symptoms and interpersonal problems. ","497":"Depression and anxiety are the most common mental symptoms in patients with thyroid cancer (DTC) and have an important influence on the quality of life. The aim of the current study was to identify protective factors of depression and anxiety in DTC patients. In a cross-sectional study 230 DTC patients were examined with Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-D), the Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC-13) and the Questionnaire of Social Support (F-SOZU). Depression correlated highly significantly with anxiety (r = .633, p = 0,001). Social support and sense of coherence correlated highly significantly negative with depression as well as with anxiety (both p &lt; or = 0,001). Although still significant, the correlation between age and anxiety was lower (r = -.19; p &lt; or = 0,005). The TSH level as an indicator of hypothyreodism did not correlate with depression or with anxiety on a significant statistical level. Furthermore, variables such as education, religiosity and elapsed time interval since initial diagnosis were not correlated with depression and anxiety. Our results support the thesis that low social support and low sense of coherence enhance vulnerability to depressive and anxiety symptoms. ","498":"In the areas of psychosomatic medicine and psychotherapy, the relative proportion of female physicians is above average compared with other medical specialty areas. Is there a gender-specific affinity for the subject even among medical students and if so, how does it affect the students' choice of their subsequent specialty and their further professional career? Gender proportions were studied in a) students of elective courses in psychosomatics and psychotherapy at the University of Goettingen, b) graduate students of German medical faculties between 1993 and 2004 and c) advanced ranks of medical career. Female preponderance in psychosomatics and psychotherapy is already to be found among students and extends to the rank of specialists. However--as in other medical specialties--women are not adequately represented in managerial positions. The relatively high proportion of female physicians might be the result of women's special disposition for the field. While an adequate representation of both sexes among medical psychotherapists is desirable for clinical practice, an increase of female physicians in management and research positions would be expedient in order to direct more attention to gender-specific questions in psychosomatics and psychotherapy. ","499":"Police officers frequently face traumatic stressors of different origins and thus bear an increased risk of developing a post-traumatic stress disorder. The most mentally burdening situations range from shootings, death of fellow officers, dealing with dead bodies in general, the effects of shift work, time pressure or discontent with management due to mobbing. Part of the present study examines the quality of stress in police work with the goal of developing a taxonomy of the origins of stress. A stratified sample of 109 police officers participated in the study. They were interviewed about stressful situations in their work life. In the interviews participants generated incidents describing stressful or straining situations. These incidents were used to develop a taxonomy of stressful situations in everyday police work. A further 22 interviews with officers of the federal police were carried out to examine the transferability of the developed taxonomy to other occupational groups. The taxonomy distinguishes between five sources of strain. Strain can arise from (1.) the task itself, (2.) the organization and structure of work, (3.) the temporal conditions and (4.) the social conditions. The fifth category describes the source of strain based on other conditions. The results also show that the taxonomy is transferable to other occupational groups. This taxonomy leads to the systematisation of the differences among the stress phenomena which occur in police work. The results can help in the development of practical prevention, counselling and therapeutic programs. ","500":"Over the last years the use of diagnosis-related groups (G-DRG) was introduced into most areas of the German health care system, which led to changed compensation for departments outside the G-DRG system as well. We evaluated the development of revenues in 17 different psychosomatic departments over the last three years. Our analyses were based on official daily rates for each of the clinics included. If daily rates changed within one year, we used the average daily rate for that year. Together all departments provided 547 in-patient beds for the treatment of acute psychosomatic patients. With 85% occupancy all departments would achieve a revenue of 62.5 million euro in 2005, two million euro less than three years previously. Due to the introduction of the German DRG system their average income was reduced by approx. 3%. The loss was greater for psychosomatic departments at larger hospitals, which have a higher percentage of departments included in the G-DRG system. The introduction of the G-DRG system leads to reduced revenues for departments outside the G-DRG system, while performance was expected to remain at the same level and costs have increased. Thus, to ensure the spectrum of psychosomatic medicine as it is today, it has become increasingly important to demonstrate the real costs of treatment to political decision makers. ","501":"Attachment is a biological propensity of primate infants to form close protective relationships with their mothers. In humans it is the special relationship in which the organization of emotions, empathy and knowledge about oneself and others is combined and represented in inner working models. For this, it is innate to human nature to form joint attention structures in which language develops for learning individual and particularly emotional and cultural meanings by narrative interpretations of various experiences. These processes are essential for the development of human beings. Joint attention is initially and primarily formed between infants and attachment persons. Fathers in particular can be additional supportive attachment persons, as well as teachers, grandmothers etc. Sensitivity to infants' attachment needs is the key to understanding the development of secure or insecure attachment strategies. These strategies highly influence the development of psychological security in mature and adaptive, or psychological insecurity in less mature and less flexibly adapted adolescents and adults.","502":"On the basis of a case study the conciliar physician procedure in Germany is described in the context of psychotherapy for problematic constellations during severe physical diseases.

Measures to help prevent such cases are discussed from a lawyer's (first author) and a medical psychotherapist's (second author) point of view. OVERVIEW OF THE LITERATURE: In psychotherapeutic practice, the borders of the therapeutic relationship are frequently not clear and sexual abuse of patients by psychotherapists also occurs in Germany. The reported case illustrates that under current German Criminal Code ( section sign section sign 174 c Abs.2, 181 f. Nr. 2 StGB) patients are protected by law against unwanted sexual advances by a therapist. However, physical examination by the therapist while the patient is undergoing psychotherapy may provide unscrupulous therapists with the opportunity to dismiss accusations of unwanted sexual advances as legitimate physical examinations. Thus they could further victimize patients in legal suits since due to the principle of innocent until proven guilty, it is difficult for prosecutors to prove a case. To improve patients' rights and the standards of practice, the first author suggests legal prohibition of simultaneous psychotherapeutic treatment and physical examinations\/treatment by the same doctor. He suggests that a referral to a consulting physician for any physical examination deemed necessary should become the standard practice, thus also providing added protection to any doctor involved against false accusations of misconduct. The second author discusses critically whether such a prohibition would truly protect the patients. She concludes that simultaneous medical and psychotherapeutic treatment of a patient by the same physician should be thoroughly thought through by the physician, but comes to the conclusion that in some cases a combined medical and psychotherapeutic treatment seems appropriate. Instead of a general prohibition she suggests improved information and education for patients and psychotherapists as well as better use of the already existing legal possibilities. ","505":"In the present study we examined facial affective behavior in acutely traumatized patients undergoing EMDR therapy. Furthermore, we analyzed whether a decrease in emotional numbing was due to a reduction of symptoms. Amnestic tendencies were used as a moderator variable. The facial affective behaviour was coded using the Emotional Facial Acting Coding System, an instrument for the registration of facial movements with emotional relevance. The facial affective behavior of the patient's first and last EMDR session was compared. A significant increase in facial affective behavior as well as an increase in mental complaints were found. Furthermore, the reduction in amnestic tendencies did not result in a reduction of symptoms. Under the influence of the treatment it is possible to improve access to episodic affective memory. Nevertheless, a positive influence cannot be denoted at the end of the treatment. ","506":"Partners or spouses of patients with cardiac arrhythmias were examined for mental and physical health. In addition, gender differences and other influential factors of well-being were analyzed. A total of 486 partners or spouses took part in a study which collected data on anxiety and depression (HADS-D) as well as quality of life (SF-12). The situation of the partners was correlated with social variables, psychological distress, and the physical and mental well-being of the patients. Pathological anxiety was reported by 20 percent of the partners and 37 percent demonstrated notable values for depression. In comparison to healthy samples quality of life was diminished, especially in male subjects. There was a strong inter-connection between the patient's psychological strain and that of his or her partner. Most important for the partner's physical quality of life was the patient's quality of life (18.4% explained variance). The partner's mental well-being was determined by his or her own psychological distress (31.1% explained variance). Spouses and partners of patients with cardiac arrhythmias are highly impaired in their psychological well-being. This should be taken into account when dealing with medical care issues in such patients. It is therefore important to inform patients and their families in detail about the potential risks as well as the options for relatives' responses in arrhythmia-induced emergencies. ","507":"Therapist characteristics are relevant for the outcome of psychotherapies. Attachment measures related to aspects of personality are well introduced. We studied a sample of psychotherapists using attachment interviews and questionnaires. 31 psychodynamically oriented psychotherapists who worked in two inpatient institutions were interviewed with the Adult Attachment Interview. We report the results of the distribution of attachment patterns according the Adult Attachment Prototype Rating (Strauss et al. 1999). 14 therapists (45.2%) showed a secure, 4 (12.9%) an insecure-ambivalent and 7 (22.6%) an insecure-avoidant attachment pattern. A comparably high proportion of therapists was rated as mixed-insecure, a pattern of clinical relevance. Discrepancies to other samples lie in the expected direction. There were no correlations with gender, experience or profession. Depression and insecure attachment did correlate; interpersonal problems showed no connection to attachment status. The distribution resembles the general population with a slightly lower proportion of secure subjects. Further assessments, among others, will investigate the occurrence of ,,unresolved states of mind\" with respect to attachment trauma.

Health-related quality of life (SF-12), anxiety and depression (HADS-D), symptom strain (BSI) and social support (F-SOZU) were measured. Alcohol abstinence was examined in each group session by measuring the alcohol concentration in breath. At the beginning and end of the group therapy patients showed subsyndromal measures of anxiety and depression and minor symptoms of psychopathology. Physical quality of life was reduced (t = -8.694; df = 44; p &lt; .001). Mental quality of life was in the range of the normative sample and was correlated with depression (r = -0.400; p = .009). Patients perceived high social support (t = 8.213; df = 45; p &lt; .001). During the course of therapy four patients had relapses but the remaining patients stayed abstinent. Physical quality of life improved (t = -2.275; df = 27; p = .031), mental quality of life and symptom strain remained stable. The therapy presented here facilitated a stabilisation of mental well-being in patients with alcoholic liver disease who were waiting for organ transplantation. The relapse rate measured by alcohol concentration in breath remained low.

The present paper provides an update on the present state of empirical research concerning this question.One fourth of all patients with diabetes mellitus suffer from depressive symptoms up to and including states of depressive disorders. The studies reviewed advise that depression in patients with diabetes concur with an unfavourable attitude towards the illness as well as towards treatment, a reduction in quality of life, an increased risk for the development of follow-up diseases as well as an increase in mortality risk. As a cause for the increasing risk in morbidity and mortality in depressive patients with diabetes, both neuroendocrinologic changes as well as unfavourable therapy and illness attitudes are discussed.

A total of 1083 breast cancer patients were recruited by the Hamburg Cancer Register to fill out various questionnaires (response rate 67 %). Estimates of reliability were high (Cronbach's alpha = .87). The original one-factor structure was replicated. We used the HADS, the PCL-C, and the SF-8, among others, to validate the FoP-Q-SF. Significant positive correlations were found for fear of progression, anxiety and intrusion (r &gt; .60) as well as for avoidance, hyperarousal and depression (r &gt; or = .49). Moderate to high (negative) correlations were observed with health-related quality of life, in particular with the mental health dimensions (r &gt; or = .48). Patients with cancer recurrence reported significant higher levels of fear of progression (p &lt; .001). The short form of the Fear of Progression Questionnaire appears to be a reliable and valid instrument which can be recommended for further use in research and clinical care. ","512":"How do the OPD-based psychotherapy foci formulated by the therapeutic team at the patient's admission develop and how do they relate to change in symptoms and to the patient's individual therapeutic goals? After Operationalized Psychodynamic Diagnostics (OPD) in 188 psychotherapy inpatients, 2-3 clinically relevant OPD foci were chosen in joint team sessions after admission and assessed by the Heidelberg Structural Change Scale (HSCS) at the beginning and the end of inpatient psychotherapy. Patients formulated their individual therapy goals at the beginning and assessed their achievement at the end of inpatient psychotherapy and filled in self-assessment scales. At the end of therapy there was a significant mean improvement of one step on the Heidelberg Restructuring Scale for all three foci (0.9-1.2) in the sample as a whole. In approximately one-fourth of the patients we observed no change in the HSCS (25.5-27.7 %), approximately 70 % improved one to four steps towards higher awareness of, coping with or restructuring of the focus. The hypothesis of high correlations between the different measures of change could be supported only in part. The clinical implications and the implications for quality management are discussed. ","513":"Patient compliance after transplantation is of key importance since even moderate deviations from the prescribed therapy regime may cause organ rejection. Patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis require special therapeutic preparation before the liver transplantation. A manualised group therapy with the aim of maintaining alcohol abstinence, increasing coping skills and therapy adherence is presented and illustrated with a case history. The manual is based on the elements of psychoeducation and problem-solving training. In a second article the results of the clinical evaluation are described. ","514":"Transplant patients are exposed to many different types of mental and social stress. The study investigates these patients' need for psychosocial counselling. At 6 months and again at 12 months following either a lung, liver or bone-marrow transplantation, 76 patients were questioned about their need for psychosocial counselling. The measuring instruments employed were: SF-36 (quality of life), FLZ (life satisfaction), HADS-D (anxiety\/depression), and F-SoZu K-14 (social support). The need for psychosocial counselling in all three patient groups was at its greatest before transplantation. It amounted to 42.9 % (lung transplantation patients), 50.0 % (liver transplantation patients) and 26.7 % (bone marrow transplantation patients). Six months after transplantation, the need for counselling in all patient groups had quite clearly decreased. Among liver transplant patients, however, it increased again between the sixth and twelfth months. The need for counselling in all patient groups correlated significantly with anxiety. Moreover, at one-year follow-up, significantly negative correlations with mental health, life satisfaction and social support were observed. Especially during the evaluation phase prior to organ transplantation, transplantation patients demonstrate a considerable need for counselling. Psychosocial counselling should be an obligatory part of therapy before and after organ transplantation.

N = 13 consecutively admitted day clinic patients (anorexia nervosa; DSM IV) were matched with N = 13 inpatients (variables: age, duration of illness, gender, admission weight, subtype of anorexia nervosa). Results at discharge were compared using defined outcome criteria as well as scores of the SCL-90-R and EDI-2. After inpatient treatment significantly more patients showed a good outcome (predefined criteria). Effect sizes also pointed to a superiority of inpatient treatment. In the initial phase of therapy the structured and holding environment of an inpatient unit may be favourable for severely underweight anorexic patients. The interpretation of these results is limited due to the small sample size. ","518":"We study the pattern of interpersonal alliances typical of depressive symptoms by means of the Core Conflictual Relationship Theme (CCRT) method. In an exploratory manner we examine which CCRT-coded wishes, perceived responses from the other and associated responses of the self predict the magnitude of a score on the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Interview data from 31 mental health patients were coded (CCRT expanded standard categories system). Relations between the CCRT categories and the dependent variable were examined by combining 1000-fold forward stepwise regression analyses, and multiple regression analyses in which confidence intervals were estimated with the bootstrap technique. Three CCRT categories that jointly explain more than half of the variance were selected: diminished levels of the wish to be understood, and elevated levels of disliking others and of feeling helpless. The results and implications for psychotherapy are discussed within a psychoanalytic context. Suggestions for further research are indicated. ","519":"To answer the question of adequate treatment of depression in women from a scientific point of view, it is necessary to investigate the aetiology of depressive disorders as they relate to bio-genetic, mental and social factors. For a comprehensive understanding of depressive disorders in women three factors are analysed: (1) the severity of a depression, (2) the phenomenological description, and (3) the factors of the development of depression in the female life cycle. Different treatment strategies for women can be developed on the basis of these phenomenological and psychodynamic considerations. A case study of a female patient suffering from depressive adjustment disorder who had a background history of sexual reproductive problems is presented to demonstrate characteristic factors in women which may serve as indicators for psychoanalytic focal psychotherapy. In our opinion, psychoanalytic theory in its complexity, working with unconscious phantasies, fears concerning body integrity and relationships to others, is the most appropriate method to determine specific factors behind the pathogenesis and the persistence of depressive disorders in women. ","520":"In the German DRG system the funding of CL services is not ensured. The documentation of psychiatric comorbidity and CL care delivery is a pre-condition to the development of funding models for CL-services. A task force of several German psychosomatic associations (German College of Psychosomatic Medicine, German Society of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, General Medical Society for Psychotherapy) developed a new documentation form for CL-services (CL-BaDo). The pilot study explored the multicenter implementation of CL-BaDo and the use of the documentation form for quality management and cost calculation. Over a period of at least three months, participating CL-services documented all CL cases consecutively with the CL-BaDo. One site applied full electronic data processing. 2116 CL cases from eight psychosomatic CL-services were analysed. The CL-BaDo is a time-efficient, feasible and acceptable documentation form for CL-service delivery. The full electronic data processing enables networking with a hospital information system to produce higher data quality. The data of CL-BaDo can be used locally for quality management, development of management strategies and communication with consultants, as well as nationwide for health policy questions and research.","521":"Mental comorbidities as recorded in the DRG system by the Patient Comorbidity and Complication Level (PCCL) cause extended length of stay in cardiology with resultant higher costs. Studies analyzing the influence of a psychiatric consultation and liaison service on the length of stay and the costs incurred thereby have generated inconsistent results. The present prospective study examines the effects of the psychotherapeutic liaison service on the length of stay. In the course of 6 months, two cardiology wards were alternately provided traditional psychotherapeutic consultation and psychotherapeutic liaison service based on a Cross-Over-Design (A-B-A). Inclusion criteria for patients was the presence of one of the four most common cardiological diagnoses (ischemic heart diseases, heart valve defects, cardiomyopathies, arrhythmias). After the exclusion of patients with a length of less than five days, the random sampling comprised n = 317 patients. The study showed no direct correlation between the intensified care system of the liaison service and a reduction in the length of stay. The results obtained remained consistent even after controlling for age, sex, and case complexity. Recommendations for further investigations are discussed. ","522":"Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are the most frequently studied bowel disorders in the context of a bio psycho-social model. FGID are associated with significant work absenteeism, impaired quality of life, and increased medical costs. Many patients also suffer from psychosocial problems. Most of the research in FGID to date has focused on the irritable bowel syndrome. Randomised controlled studies have shown that psychotherapy is superior to conventional medical therapy. The gut-focussed hypnotherapy seems to be very successful. For IBD it is increasingly recognized that the psycho-neuro-endocrine network can modulate inflammation and pain perception and that psychosocial factors are related to exacerbation of and coping with IBD. The psychosocial consequences of the illness become more significant with increasing severity of the disease. Therefore integrated psychosomatic care should be provided, the patient's psychosocial status and the demand for additional psychological care should be assessed and offered, if indicated.","523":"","524":"The effectiveness of psychosomatic in-patient treatment was evaluated using patients' subjective health ratings and objective data provided by health insurance companies. Associations between subjective and objective criteria were investigated. 318 patients participated in the study. They completed questionnaires on physical complaints, moods and everyday functioning upon hospital admission, at discharge and at one-year follow-up. Insurance companies provided data for 140 of these patients (44 %). Sick leave and the utilization of in-patient treatment were assessed for a period of two years before and two years after psychosomatic treatment. As expected, subjective health status improved. The utilization of in-patient treatment decreased in both years after treatment compared to the year before. Sick leave increased in the first year after treatment but decreased significantly below the base level in the second year after treatment. Self-efficacy expectations and being employed were found to be predictors for long-term reduction in the length of in-patient treatment. Subjective and objective criteria were only slightly correlated. Sick leave and utilization of in-patient treatment were found to increase considerably in the year before psychosomatic treatment. Therefore, pre-post differences over the entire period were only marginal. The change in subjective criteria was more immediate, while changes in some objective parameters were delayed. Both subjective and objective criteria should be included in outcome studies. ","525":"This recent study assesses the correlation of incidence- and reaction-related variables to predict acute and posttraumatic stress disorder in rescue workers after the catastrophe of Kaprun (2000) in Austria, Europe. In a prospective longitudinal study, 250 emergency medical personnel, crisis intervention teams and police officers were assessed using the Acute Stress Disorder Scale (ASD), the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS) and an incidence- and reaction-related questionnaire 6 weeks and 6 months after their mission. After 6 weeks, 7.3 % of the emergency medical personnel, 22.2 % of the crisis intervention team workers and 25.7 of police officers suffered from ADS. At 6 months after the disaster, 6.3 % of all rescue workers showed PTSD. The incidence-related predictors of PTSD assessed in the study were duration of the mission and early arrival at the site. Uncertainty about the help given was found to be a reaction-related predictor. This study provides further support for the usefulness of incidence- and reaction-related factors to predict acute and posttraumatic stress disorder in rescue workers. These results will aid in the development of special prevention strategies for rescue workers. ","526":"Does the subjective emotional experience of patients change in the course of psychoanalytic treatment? Ten patients were interviewed four times during their first two years in psychoanalytic therapy. Interviews were coded with regard to the patients' subjective emotional experience. Changes in individual emotion profiles were then tested for associations with therapy outcome using a hierarchical linear model. Better therapy outcome was associated with an increase in emotional variability and a decrease in the proportion of negative emotions. In contrast, neither the number of emotions verbalized by the patients nor the frequencies of specific emotion categories were associated with therapy outcome. Remarkable changes of emotional experience during the course of psychoanalytic treatment could be demonstrated. Particularly, a more variable emotional experience proved to be closely associated with improvement in mental health. ","527":"Although a majority of psychodynamic-psychoanalytic researchers and practitioners address the issue of psychic structure, reevaluation of the nature of a neurotic conflict system and its relation to psychic structure is necessary. A comprehensive conflict system is presented in the context of operative psychodynamic diagnostics (OPD-2), based on findings confirmed thus far. The conflict levels range from conflict tension to neurotic conflicts to conflict schemata in structural disturbances. ","528":"The introduction of psychosomatic primary care provides for the first time the possibility for general practitioners to treat emotional and psychosomatic disorders and problems which in the past were often not recognized. Using computer-based searches in data bases and journals we surveyed controlled studies in which general practitioners performed psychosocial interventions. The studies were assessed according to standardized procedures for systematic reviews. A total of 9 studies were found which took place between 1966 and 2003. The clinical effects attained were usually limited and of short duration. Studies with specific therapeutic approaches in specific disorders showed the best results. Psychosocial interventions by the general practitioner are effective, but there is need for improvement. Further conceptual development of structured psychosocial interventions which can be applied in the general practice for the most common emotional disorders is necessary. Considering the large number of patients with emotional disorders in primary care, these efforts will undoubtedly be worthwhile.

It provides a procedure indicating dysfunctional relationship patterns. The new version is characterized by the following qualities: The relationship axis is based more consequently on the circumplex model of interpersonal behaviour. Therefore, it is suitable for a broader range of evaluation methods linked to this model. It also contains instructions on how to draw a summary of relationship dynamics. Thus the results of the diagnostic assessment can be summarized for clinical and practical purposes and used directly for therapeutic work. In addition, a simplified version of the rating procedure enables identification of the patient's significant problematic relationship themes and his or her personal resources.","531":"To investigate illness perceptions, treatment expectations, and treatment experiences of patients suffering from acute leukaemia in the initial stage of their disease. In the first week of treatment we interviewed twelve patients with acute leukaemia using a detailed semi-structured interview guide. To investigate the transcribed interviews we applied methods of qualitative research. Case analyses were assigned to interindividual comparison tables representing the following subject areas: complaints, diagnostics, causes, controllability, treatment experiences, and prognosis. This allowed us to describe similarities and contrasts. Dramatic narrations of overwhelming threat in younger patients are in contrast to downplaying, rationalizing, and factual descriptions especially in elderly patients. Feelings of helplessness and efforts of normalization become apparent. Experiences of visible and sensible physical injury are perceived as threatening. Prognosis is estimated as too positive. Mortal fears are only indirectly indicated. Our results have practical consequences for both patient education and psycho-oncological training. ","532":"Patients' self-help group participation has been neglected in psychotherapy research. This study determines previous self-help group experience, therapist recommendations and plans for future participation. 1,604 patients were surveyed by questionnaire at intake and discharge from psychosomatic treatment regarding previous self-help experiences, therapist recommendation and plans for future self-help participation. Patients with self-help experience (12 %) were slightly older and more educated. They reported a longer duration of disease, more previous psychotherapy, more interpersonal problems and less social support compared to non-participants. At discharge, a total of 23 % intended to participate in a self-help group. Therapist recommendations (in 19 %) influenced patients' choices. The significance of self-help group participation in inpatient care, its significance in treatment careers and implications for consulting patients are discussed. ","533":"This study was conducted to explore differentiated aspects of outcome throughout and one year after psychodynamic inpatient psychotherapy with special regard to symptomatic distress and interpersonal behaviour. Sixty-four patients of the Department of Psychotherapeutic Medicine of the Jerichow Hospital (Saxonia-Anhaltina) were investigated with the SCL-90-R and the IIP-D four times: at the beginning of inpatient psychotherapy (t0), four weeks after (t1), at the end (t2), and one year after discharge (t3). The improvement of symptoms four weeks after the beginning of psychodynamic inpatient psychotherapy is equivalent with long term outcome. The Global Severity Index of SCL-90-R demonstrated a statistically significant change from markedly psychological distress to lack of distress after four weeks psychodynamic inpatient psychotherapy (effect-size d(GSI) = 0.82). At the end of psychotherapy, three weeks later, the effect-size was d = 1.11, and one year after discharge the effect-size decreased again to d = 0.85. Major improvements demonstrated the SCL-90-R subscales Depression, Anxiety, and Obsessive\/Compulsive. Regarding interpersonal problems, the subscales Dominance, and Competitive demonstrated statistically significant changes from low Stanine-scores at t0 to higher scores one year after discharge. The subscales Socially avoidant, Nonassertive, and Exploitable demonstrated statistical significant changes from high levels at t0 to lower scores after one year. In conclusion the first four weeks of psychodynamic psychotherapy are not sufficient to demonstrate an optimum level of low psychological distress as well as an optimum change in interpersonal problems. Regarding stability of the effects of psychodynamic inpatient psychotherapy it was demonstrated that the first four weeks initiated changes which improved at the end of psychotherapy until one year after discharge. ","534":"On the basis of characterizations of the psychodynamics of panic patients and previous findings on their affective facial behavior in first psychotherapy sessions, hypotheses are made on affective facial behavior of the therapist and its relationship to outcome satisfaction. Affective facial behaviour in 20 female patients with panic disorder and their male therapists in the first session of psychotherapy was coded with EMFACS. The data of facial behaviour was correlated with outcome ratings at the end of treatment. Therapists show less affective facial behaviour than panic patients; particularly, they smile less frequently. The frequency of smiling in the first session correlated negatively with outcome ratings. Therapists adapted their interactive behaviour to the relationship offers of their patients. The results are discussed on the background of the psychodynamics of panic disorders. Considering the different relationship offers, the results indicate that the interactive dialogue should be formed very specifically in order to create a helpful therapeutic relationship. ","535":"Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has been gaining importance in the treatment of endstage liver disease in adults. Thus far, only few empirical studies have been published on the psychosocial situation of donors who are faced with the risk of medical complications after resection of the right hepatic lobe. The aims were to describe the clinical problems before and after transplantation and to contribute to the discussion of ethical issues based on empirical findings. In the present overview, the pre-\/post-transplant and follow-up periods are characterized from a psychosocial point of view using actual psychosocial and medical findings in living donors of the right hepatic lobe. Before LDLT, 11 % of potential donors were not recommended for the transplantation due to marked ambivalence about the operation. After donation 26 % of donors showed high values for anxious depression and physical complaints despite low rates of surgical complications. For clinical psychosomatic evaluations of potential donors it is important to provide donors an opportunity to report any misgivings and anxieties as openly as possible. The psychosocial impairment and physical complaints of some donors after transplantation are yet not clearly understood. More psychosocial studies in this field will be necessary to investigate ethical questions and to develop criteria for an evidence-based medical care of living donors. ","536":"In consultation liaison (CL) psychiatry and psychosomatics a multicenter documentation form for the assessment of clinical characteristics of patients and CL service delivery is urgently needed for health care planning and future mental health research. In several steps a joint working party of the psychosomatic and psycho-therapeutic societies in Germany (German College for Psychosomatic Medicine, German Society of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, General Medical Society for Psychotherapy) developed a documentation form for C-L service (CL-BaDo). The goals and quality criteria of the patient registration form are defined in an extended consensus process of C-L experts. A pool of formerly 60 items was reduced to 36 items collecting data concerning sociodemographic characteristics, referral information, anamneses, actual psychiatric and somatic status and diagnoses, C-L interventions and treatment recommendations. To enable comparisons, the formulation of items are adapted to existing inpatient and outpatient documentation forms (Psy-BaDo,EuroQA-CL). A special manual guides the coding of the CL-BaDo. 16 CL services in Germany and Austria participated in the testing and pilot study of six months demonstrating the comprehensibility and fast completion of CL-BaDo and consultants' high acceptance of the form. A time-saving and user-friendly electronic version for data entry and data analyses was developed using hand-held technology. The data of the CL-BaDo can be used for 1) quality management and communication purposes with referring departments and 2) for multicenter collaborative studies, mental health care management and care planning. ","537":"Psychotherapy is subjected to the legal conditions of quality assurance(QA). Does operationalized psychodynamic diagnostics (OPD) contribute substantially to this? We investigated the application of OPD in outpatient psychodynamic psychotherapy, inpatient treatment, rehabilitation, and legal assessment. Psychodynamic diagnostics, treatment plan, and evaluation by means of the OPD and Heidelberg Structural Change Scale (HSCS) may be comprehensibly described for quality assurance (QA) of outpatient and inpatient psychotherapy. Virtually all psychodynamic conceptualized departments for psychosomatic medicine and psychotherapy as well as some rehabilitation centres applied OPD. Furthermore, data-collection periods were defined during and after inpatient short- and long-term psychotherapy. OPD serves QA in legal assessment and is of a pivotal significance in judicial proceedings. It must be deliberated whether more extensive use of QA, in cooperation with outpatient psychotherapists and in comparison to institutions, could be of benefit to patients. ","538":"The aim of the study is to assess psychosomatic symptoms and comorbidity in a group of tinnitus out-patients and their correlation with tinnitus distress. 32 subacute (duration 3-12 months) and 71 chronic tinnitus patients participated in the study. Questionnaires were used to assess tinnitus distress (German version of the TQ, VAS), psychosomatic symptoms (SCL-90-R, BDI, BAI) coping strategies (KKG, FKV), social support (F-SOZU) and interpersonal problems (IIP-D). 56 % of subjects met the criteria for a disorder according to DSM-IV (CIDI). Compared to the general population, there is a particularly high comorbidity with anxiety and somatoform disorders. Tinnitus distress was related to depression (BDI), tinnitus loudness and disturbance of activities (59 % explained variance). There were no substantial differences between subacute and chronic tinnitus. The results stress the importance of diagnostic investigation of comorbidity and psychosomatic symptoms already at the subacute stage in tinnitus patients. ","539":"The aim was to investigate psychological motives behind the wish to have children among female and male students, with special consideration of females with eating disorders. 736 participants (437 women and 299 men) were examined using the \"Leipziger Fragebogen zu Kinderwunschmotiven und Einstellungen zum Kinderwunsch\" (a questionnaire concerning the motives and attitudes for the wish to have a child). Disturbed eating behaviour was classified with the Eating Attitudes Test. 15.4 % of the students showed a low, 39 % a medium and 45.6 % a high wish to have children. The subscales \"Desire for emotional stabilization\" as well as \"Social stereotypes\" had the highest and \"Fear of material impairment\" and \"Personal restriction\" the lowest correlation with the wish for a child. Women with anorectic eating disorders displayed a significantly lower desire for children than students with normal eating patterns or women with a bulimic tendency. The psychological motives examined here contributed highly to the explanation of variance concerning the wish to have children. The results for women with eating disorders indicate that primary ambivalences concerning the wish to have children may be involved in the pre-clinical stadium of eating disorders. ","540":"This is a systematic review of the available empirical studies up to 2004 which deal with the question of the correlation between psychosocial factors\/stress and gingival and periodontal disease. The three medical and psychological databases Medline, PsycInfo und Psyndex were searched systematically for relevant literature between 1946 and 2004. 34 empirical studies on humans (16 with and 18 without a control group) and ten empirical studies on animals are presented. Despite serious methodological flaws in many studies, most (particularly the methodologically solid ones) indicated associations between a variety of psychosocial factors and periodontitis incidence and severity. The pathomechanisms between stress and periodontitis should therefore be the subject of further research. ","541":"The importance of shame for the understanding of eating disorders has been well-known for a long time, but only few empirical studies exist to date on this aspect. Particularly the sense of self-esteem and external appearance have been attributed a major influence in the emergence of shame. Since social anxiety has increasingly been considered to be a factor in recent discussions related to eating disorders, and shame is a primary symptom of social phobia and of social anxiety in general, the present study focuses on shame and social anxiety in anorexia and bulimia, as compared to other clinical disorders. Another research question is the extent to which the prevalence of shame in eating disorders is influenced by self-esteem, attitudes about appearance and social anxiety. The sample consists of 104 (female) patients, comprising 26 patients, respectively, with anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, anxiety disorders and depression. The various variables were recorded with the Internalized Shame Scale (ISS), the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS), the Social Phobia Scale (SPS), the Appearance Attitude Scale (AAS) and the Social Autonomous Self-Esteem Scale (SAS). Patients with anorexia and bulimia nervosa have higher scores in internalized global shame than patients with anxiety disorders and depressions. In contrast to anorectic patients, however, patients with bulimia also have higher scores than the other two groups in the area of social performance anxiety; they also differ significantly from the anxiety disorders in terms of interaction anxiety. In the multiple regression analysis of the patients with eating disorders, self-esteem, performance anxiety and perfectionism with regard to appearance prove to be predictors of the affect of shame. The findings indicate that not just shame, but also social anxiety, should be regarded as important influencing factors, especially in the case of bulimia nervosa. The question remains as to what extent social anxiety is a result of shame being projected onto the body. For therapeutic considerations, it seems advisable to work on the affect of shame and also include the aspect of social anxiety in focused therapy strategies. ","542":"The present study investigated the workplace experiences of junior physicians in their first year of residency, and the impact of these experiences on their physical and psychological well-being. In a prospective longitudinal study 518 junior physicians (54.4% women, 45.6% men) were investigated twice within two years with regard to individual and institutional determinants of career development. Gender-relevant workplace experiences, i. e. effort-reward imbalance, and their relation to physical and psychological well-being, i. e. anxiety and depression, as well as life satisfaction were evaluated. The workplace experiences revealed three significant gender-specific results: Women residents received less mentoring, had more positive social relationships at work, and showed a higher over-commitment than their male colleagues. Both men and women residents reported significantly worse physical and psychological well-being as well as life satisfaction after their first year of residency (T2) compared to the time directly before their graduation from medical school (T1). The junior physicians' life satisfaction scores are significantly lower than those of the normal population. 7-10% of the respondents showed anxiety scores above cut-off, and 1-4% depression scores above cut-off. Personality traits such as a high sense of coherence and low expressiveness are protective factors for well-being and life satisfaction. Insufficient leadership of senior residents and unclear hierarchical structures as well as stress at work and over-commitment are risk factors for the development of symptoms of anxiety and\/or depression. The reported results are consistent with the psychosocial stress model by Karasek and Theorell as well as with the model of effort-reward imbalance of Siegrist. ","543":"This study investigated differences between patients in both short-term and long-term inpatient psychotherapy. Results for both settings as well as predictors of treatment outcomes were determined. Consecutive patients of the Giessen University Clinic for Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy, who were treated during a two-year period in both short- and long-term treatment settings, were studied prospectively (N = 166; return-rate 70 %). Standardized questionnaires were applied for distress (SCL-90 R), physical complaints (GBB 24) and interpersonal problems (IIP-D) as well as for object relationships (IPO). In concordance with treatment concepts, patients in short-term psychotherapy had a more acute onset of symptoms, were more highly distressed and better occupationally integrated; patients in long-term treatment suffered more frequently from chronic psychosomatic disorders, personality disorders and comorbid somatic conditions. In both treatment settings distress and physical complaints decreased considerably and remained quite stable during follow-up. Concurring predictors of outcome were more adaptive patterns of object and interpersonal relationships as well as social resources. No differences were seen between the short-term and long-term treatment for utilization of ambulatory psychotherapy after discharge. The study shows that a differentiation between short- and long-term treatments, even within one psychosomatic hospital unit, allows for differential indication and treatment concepts. ","544":"The following paper presents the results of a post-treatment examination on inpatients with personality disorders who received psychodynamic psychotherapy. The examination was carried out approximately 3.3 years after the patients were discharged. Of a group of 110 patients with personality disorders (ICD-10), 72 patients underwent follow-up examination. A comprehensive catamnesis was compiled for 59 former patients; 13 former patients answered by post. Treatment success was evaluated on the basis of the Symptom Checklist 90-R, Inventory of Interpersonal Problems and Questionnaire of Social Support. These surveys show no significant statistical difference between the data of the subgroups of participants and non-participants of the post-treatment examination at the start and end of therapy (Mann-Whitney-U-Test, p &gt; 0.05). Treatment success was also examined using the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale, the Impairment-Score as well as an analysis of the patient's use of psychiatric and inpatient psychotherapeutic care and the medication received. Due to the reduction in general mental stress and interpersonal problems, and the increase in perceived social support, the patients showed a positive development. After being discharged 41% of the patients received outpatient psychotherapy without further psychiatric and inpatient psychotherapeutic care. The above results demonstrate that patients with personality disorders benefit from inpatient psychodynamic psychotherapy. ","545":"Treating patients with personality disorders presents a major challenge due to their maladaptive interpersonal styles which affect the therapeutic relationship. A number of therapeutic approaches using psychodynamic, behavioural, and other origins have been developed to treat patients with personality disorders, most of them dealing with borderline personality disorder. Overall, only a few controlled therapy studies have been carried out to document therapy effectiveness. However, available research indicates that psychotherapy has substantial effects even in personality disorders. From a vast literature based on case reports, therapeutic recommendations are presented for specific personality disorders.","546":"The neuroendocrine and physiological systems related to pain and stress have long been subjected to study. More recently, the corresponding systems promoting anti-stress and restoration have also come into focus. It is not only important to investigate the mechanisms underlying disease but also to examine the physiological and psychological mechanisms which protect and heal the body and soul. The nonapeptide oxytocin, originally known to stimulate labour and milk ejection, appears to play an important role in this regard. Oxytocin can induce anti-stress-like effects such as reduction of blood pressure and cortisol levels. It increases pain thresholds, exerts an anxiolytic-like effect and stimulates various types of positive social interaction. In addition, it promotes growth and healing. Repeated exposure to oxytocin causes long-lasting effects by influencing the activity of other transmitter systems, a pattern which makes oxytocin potentially clinically relevant. Oxytocin can be released by various types of non-noxious sensory stimulation, for example by touch and warmth. Ingestion of food triggers oxytocin release by activation of vagal afferents. Most likely, oxytocin can also be released by stimulation of other senses such as olfaction, as well as by certain types of sound and light. In addition, purely psychological mechanisms may trigger the release of oxytocin. This means that positive interaction involving touch and psychological support may be health-promoting. The social interaction of daily life, as well as a positive environment, continuously activate this system. In addition, various types of psychotherapy involving transfer of support, warmth and empathy are likely to induce similar effects, which thus contribute to the positive effects of these kinds of therapies.","547":"Utilization of the health care system is not determined by the presence of an organic illness, but by a multitude of interacting factors. This applies particularly to somatoform complaints and disorders, in the context of which the health care system is used very intensively and inadequately in relation to the disorder. The present paper summarizes the frequency of somatoform complaints in the general population and health care utilization due to these complaints. On the basis of a survey carried out in 2002 for a representative population of 2089 persons (aged 14 to 92 years), the prevalence of somatoform complaints during a period of 2 years was determined. In this survey, physical complaints were defined as being somatoform when they seriously affected the person's well-being but exhibited a disparity between objective diagnostic findings and subjective experience. The psychosocial aspects were also determined. When somatoform complaints were identified, the specific utilization of the healthcare system for them was investigated. Somatoform complaints are very frequent in Germany: 8.3% of the population claim to suffer from clinically relevant somatoform disorders that fully meet the criteria mentioned above. The health care system is used heavily for these complaints. Within the last two years, each test person suffering from somatoform disorders consulted a physician a mean 18 times and was incapable of working for a mean of 20 days. 16% of these persons were hospitalized, 9 % received treatment at a health resort, 9 % retired, etc. The considerable utilization of health care services is an essential element of somatoform pathology and has immense medico-political relevance. The most important prerequisite for handling the 'commitment to health care system' symptom is thorough training of all physicians in the basics of somato-psycho-social medicine. This will be an important measure for cost reduction in the health care system. ","548":"At the Tiefenbrunn hospital, patients suffering from severe psychiatric and psychosomatic disorders are treated. The treatment concept is psychodynamically oriented. Psychopharmacological treatments are included if necessary. This article reports the results of the treatment of a sample of patients with schizophrenic and other psychotic disorders (ICD-10: F20-F25). An unselected sample of N = 33 patients was studied upon admission and before discharge with a set of routinely administered standardized instruments. According to the data, all of these patients were severely disturbed: Upon admission to the clinic, they showed high pathological values in the Beeintrachtigungs- Schwere-Score (degree of impairment score; Schepank 1995), the Symptom Checklist SCL-90-R (Franke 1995), the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (Horowitz et al. 1994), as well as a high degree of comorbid disorders. A comparison of the data at admission and at discharge shows that these patients improved significantly and substantially concerning symptoms, interpersonal problems, contentedness with life and individually formulated target problems. The results of the present study are discussed with regard to both the treatment of psychotic patients and the results of other studies. ","549":"Modern cognitive behavioral approaches for the treatment of patients with medically unexplained somatic symptoms have been developed on the basis of the classification systems DSM-IV and ICD-10. These systems define somatoform disorders as a homogeneous clinical group. Behavior therapy has additionally developed vicious circle models specifying etiological, triggering and maintaining factors. Treatment goals and strategies can be derived directly from these models. The main components are: (1) motivation of patients to accept the psychotherapeutic approach; (2) introduction of alternative explanations of the symptoms on the basis of both biomedical as well as psychosocial mechanisms; (3) evaluation of the new explanations by patient and therapist; (4) reduction of avoidance and inadequate illness behaviour. Health economical aspects are particularly important because patients with somatoform disorders tend to overuse medical services and are thus considered an expensive problem group for the health system.","550":"We investigate which articles out of the entire fifty volumes of the Zeitschrift fur Psychosomatische Medizin und Psychotherapie (Journal of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy (Psychoanalysis) have been most frequently cited. These articles are analysed according to the groups of authors and topics. The citation frequency was determined in the source journals listed by the ISI and contained in the SCI and SSCI data banks. 58 articles were cited at least ten times, and five of these articles were cited at least twenty times. One article was cited 45 times and thus was the top runner. The authors who are particularly important in their specialized areas dominated, and the most frequently cited articles were distributed quite evenly in both psychosomatic and psychotherapeutic topics. A relatively large number of articles in this journal have a sustained influence among experts in the field. Since there are not many of German journal listed in the ISI data banks or have only recently been included by them, the number of citations is most likely considerably higher. ","551":"Body, brain and mind are all manifestations of one single organism; all mental processes are based on biological-neuronal processes and events. Advances in neurobiology have increasingly enabled the decoding of the correlates of psychological functions: genetic conditions, brain processes from sensation to cognition and from emotion to empathy, and social interaction. In the latter area, which is decisive for psychosocial research, neurobiological investigations are in their very early stages. Complex psychological functions are represented in networks; this renders it impossible to adopt simple reductionist approaches. Clinical phenomena such as pain or depression are also represented in neuronal networks. An abundance of neurobiological data validates (positively or negatively) psychological, psychotherapeutic or psychiatric theories or therapies. Such validation is indispensable. To date, there are no known fundamentally new approaches to psychiatric and psychotherapeutic practice which are derived from neurobiological data. Psychological phenomena emerge from neurobiological processes. Therefore, psychosocial approaches will be necessary in the future to understand such data in the context of methodological dualism (neurobiological versus psychosocial research methods).","552":"The study examines the predictive significance we of the quality of the individual therapeutic relationship for outcome in patients with personality disorders who underwent inpatient psychodynamic psychotherapy. In a prospective study 254 patients with DSM IV Cluster B and C personality disorders were examined at several intervals in the course of inpatient psychotherapy with the Helping Alliance Questionnaire, the Symptom Check List SCL-90-R, the score for severity of impairment and with questionnaires on the form of therapy for patients and therapists. Independent of the outcome, patients classified individual psychotherapy as the most effective form of therapy. Successful patients also favoured group psychotherapy as being particularly effective; unsuccessful patients rated group psychotherapy as poor. Test results from patients in the dimensions therapeutic alliance and relationship in the Helping Alliance Questionnaire correlated significantly with the outcome of the therapy after just two weeks. The investigation supports a central role of the individual therapeutic relationship for the outcome of therapy in inpatient psychotherapy for personality disorders. The Helping Alliance Questionnaire is suitable for an effective monitoring of the inpatient therapy process. ","553":"Inpatient psychotherapy includes the patient's manifold contacts with different therapists, nurses and fellow patients. The present study investigated the association between these multiple relationships and therapy outcome. Pre-post measures of symptom load (Brief Symptom Inventory), interpersonal problems (IIP) and self-efficacy (SEB) were used to define three groups with positive (N=129), unchanged (N=44) or negative (N=40) outcome. These groups were compared 1) by their alliance with an individual therapist, their relationship to the therapeutic team, their experience of cohesion and climate concerning fellow patients in the ward (measured weekly by the \"Stationserfahrungsbogen\" SEB), and 2) by their differences in mean correlations between the courses of relationship experiences and symptom load. Cohesion and relationship to the therapeutic team were not associated with therapy outcome. Therapeutic alliance with the individual therapist and climate among fellow patients turned out to be moderate indicators of the therapeutic outcome. It is recommended to include these process parameters systematically into the process diagnostics of inpatient psychotherapy.

The major focus of the article is a description of the present situation of psychosomatic hospitals in Germany, the kind of inpatient treatment in psychosomatic medicine, current concepts, data on lengths of stay, comorbidity, and the spectrum of diagnoses concerning psychosomatic inpatients. Furthermore, data on effectiveness of inpatient treatment and a description of a typical patient sample in psychosomatic inpatient treatment are outlined.","555":"The development of psychosocial and psychosomatic medicine in Switzerland is as diverse as the country itself with its four official languages and 26 cantons. Psychosomatic medicine of the past and present can be seen in three phases: Psychogenesis of somatic diseases ( phase 1: from about 1930-1960), bio-psycho-social medicine (phase 2: from 1960-1990) and psychobiology in medicine (phase 3: since 1990). In Switzerland the first phase scarcely noticeable, whereas active development in all fields of psychosomatic medicine and psychotherapy has taken place since 1960. The main tendencies of this development are described. The current situation for patients with psychosomatic and somatopsychic disorders is quite good in the outpatient setting. For inpatient treatment there are only about 400 beds in 19 small departments for the whole country. The strengths of the psychosomatic service system are well-established cooperation of doctors and psychotherapists and only few reactions by health insurance companies. Weaknesses are too few inpatient treatment facilities with long waiting times for patients and a lack of specialized treatment for migrants with psychosomatic disorders. Future prospects are not rosy due to the financial situation in the healthcare system, but neither are they bleak, since patients are emphatically asking for more narrative-based medicine and a partnership-based doctor-patient relationship.","556":"","557":"","558":"The effect of comorbid mental disorders on the length of stay and revenue in a DRG system was investigated. For 33,189 cases of an university hospital (year 2002) the revenue based on a fictitious base rate was calculated, at first with and then without inclusion of diagnosed comorbid mental disorders. Furthermore, the effect of the latter on the length of stay was examined. Renunciation of diagnoses of mental disorders lead to an different DRG grouping in 7.9 % of cases and to a reduction in revenues of about 170.000. Minimal influence of comorbid mental disorders on the length of stay (R2 = 0.02) could be detected for single diagnostic groups. The lacking influence of comorbid mental disorders on the length of stay in a university hospital is mainly determined by the limited period of inpatient treatment and by the low frequency of diagnosed mental disorders. Therefore, a psychosocial consultation-liaison service is of major importance to guarantee the diagnosis and treatment of a comorbid mental (process quality) disorder and to guarantee adequate revenues in the G-DRG system (quality of structure). ","559":"Diagnostics and therapy of environmentally related disorders are hampered by one-sided assumptions and by discrepancies between therapists' and patients' assessments of the disease cause. Discrepancies between patient and expert opinions are examined as to (1) whether the sample can be classified in subgroups according to the convergence or divergence between self and expert rating, (2) which features and (3) which disorder-related behaviour and concepts characterize these groups. Medical, psychopathological and environmental symptoms were assessed and their relative influence evaluated. Four subgroups were defined by differentiating between high and low psychological stress according to self and expert judgment, and then compared using statistical and qualitative methods. 61 patients were assessed and assigned to four different subgroups according to the number of psychiatric diagnoses, psychological conflicts, personality structure, environmental exposure and psychosocial integration. Diagnostics of environmentally related disorders must be based on interdisciplinary tools. Treatment should incorporate the individual patient's conception of his or her disorder.

Furthermore, the FDS and the SCL-90-R were administered. 47 of 101 Patients were diagnosed with pathological DP \/ DR. The mean score of the DES scale of the FDS was 32.00 +\/- 15.52. A cut-off score of 17.5 for the DES scale of the FDS yielded a 83.0 % sensitivity and 77.8 % specificity. Depressive disorders, anxiety disorders and trauma-associated disorders were the most common comorbidity. The findings are comparable to the Anglo-American samples. The FDS was found to be quite effective for screening of DP \/ DR. The three-factor solution of the FDS was not well supported in this sample. ","561":"This paper presents a review of the phenomenology and psychodynamics of affects in borderline patients. The first part demonstrates that in most current conceptions of the borderline disorder affective disturbances are regarded as to be characteristic. In this context, the strong overlap between borderline disorders and affective disorders found in many empirical studies is described and different hypotheses are presented to explain this phenomenon. The second part of this review is concerned with the psychodynamics of affects in borderline patients. The role of affects in thinking, behaviour, self perception and the regulation of object relations is discussed. Borderline and other severe personality disorders are assessed from the perspective of affective disturbances. The psychodynamic functions of particularly characteristic affects such as anger, anxiety, depression and boredom are discussed. The close connection between affective and cognitive functioning in borderline patients is described and evaluated with regard to modern theories of affect and cognition. Finally, the role of affects in the treatment of borderline patients is discussed.","562":"In present-day Austria, psychosomatic medicine and psychotherapy enjoy significantly more sociopolitical and cultural recognition perhaps as a heritage from the days of the Austrian monarchy -- than is reflected in their real presence. This development can be traced back to prewar times and the repudiation of the destructive national socialistic ideology. There is an immanent conflict between specialization in psychosomatic medicine and psychotherapy as an independent field of medicine and the integration of a psychosomatic basic approach into the general fields of medicine. The organization of psychotherapy is doubly anchored in the laws governing medical practice (PSY diploma) and the statutes governing the practice of psychotherapy; this, however, has not resolved the sensitive and only partially creative tension between the two. Austrian medical health politics are currently characterized by renewed efforts to organize the field of psychosomatic medicine. Should medical psychology and psychotherapy, internal medicine, psychiatry or general medicine provide the foundations for this new organization? This conflict is crucial since it will influence the further development of the entire medical field.","563":"","564":"","565":"The present article deals with the question as to which kind of evidence is necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of a psychotherapeutic method. The authors point out that randomized controlled studies (RCTs) are carried out in standardized laboratory contexts, whereas naturalistic studies are based on conditions in the psychotherapeutic practice. Accordingly, RCTs and naturalistic studies address different questions of research (laboratory vs. field). This view has several important implications: (1.) RCTs and naturalistic studies do not differ concerning their internal and external validity. (2.) In principal, naturalistic studies do not provide lower level evidence than RCTs. (3.) Evidence from RCTs cannot be transferred to psychotherapeutic practice in the field: If a therapy has worked in an RCT, this does not necessarily imply that it will work in the field as well. (4.) Naturalistic studies provide important evidence for determining the effectiveness of a therapy in practice. (5.) The proposed catalogues for levels of evidence focus on RCTs. Thus, they cannot be applied to hypotheses on the effectiveness of a therapy in the field (naturalistic studies). (6.) It is necessary to define separate criteria for levels of evidence of naturalistic studies. In this article, criteria and levels of evidence of naturalistic studies are defined. The implications of the differentiation of randomized controlled vs. naturalistic studies is discussed. ","566":"Police officers are at high risk of being exposed to psychologically straining situations and potentially psychotraumatic experiences. In this article, such situations are exemplified and categorized, and the role and significance of secondary prevention following traumatic experiences is discussed. From 1994 to 2003, 649 police officers received secondary prevention after being involved in a total of 250 potentially traumatic or psychologically stressful incidents. Psychological support was provided by teams of specially trained professionals in the acute phase after the incident following careful psychological evaluation. In a retrospective evaluation, the diagnoses obtained were analyzed with regard to sex and age and correlated with the severity of the incident. Three clusters of potentially traumatic situations were formed: (1) Employment of fire-arms with danger for the officer, (2) Standard situations including violence towards a third party, (3) Suicide or attempted suicide of a police officer. Police officers who experienced events assigned to cluster (1), comprising situations with considerable traumatic potential, had the highest incidence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other mental illness. Compared to male officers, females were more often diagnosed with other mental illness, whereas males had a higher incidence of PTSD. Cluster (2), which comprised situations of an officer's daily professional life, was not associated with an increased risk of mental illness. Officers were apparently capable of coping with situations considered psychologically straining for the general public without detectable evidence of a traumatic reaction. In cluster (3), which reflects the most dramatic interference with team relations, other forms of mental illness were diagnosed at a higher incidence. ","567":"Many patients are referred to psychotherapy by outpatient units of psychiatric hospital departments. This study investigates predictors of success and outcome of subsequent psychotherapy in this group of patients. Two years after referral, 140 out of an initial sample of 215 patients of a psychotherapy outpatient unit were followed up by means of a telephone interview and questionnaires (GHQ, IIP). In addition, their therapists were interviewed. 57.1% of the patients actually began psychotherapy; of these, 67.5% completed or were continuing the treatment. Predictors of referral success were younger age, female gender, higher levels of depression, a less competitive, subassertive, nurturant, and expressive personality style, and a preexisting high motivation for psychotherapy. In the total sample of 140 patients there was a significant improvement of psychopathology (0.54 &lt; d &lt; 0.99), interpersonal problems (0.25 &lt; d &lt; 0.33), and subjective experience of symptoms (d = 0.26). Patients who began psychotherapy did not show a significantly better outcome after two years compared to those who were non-compliant. Randomized-controlled studies are not comparable to regular outpatient treatment. Patients who did not begin psychotherapy despite referral might have been stabilized by the initial brief intervention they received at the psychotherapy outpatient unit, and consequently did not feel the need for any additional psychotherapy. This group of patients should be identified before being referred and offered a short-term psychotherapy at the outpatient unit. ","568":"In this second paper I present data on the effects of maternal depression on infant mood. Maternal depression is relatively stable and the infant continuously faces an affective climate characterized by negative affects. These negative affects disrupt the interactive experience of the infant and the mother. Positive affective matching is limited and reparation of mismatching states is infrequent. As a consequence infants develop a negative mood that biases their interactions with others and further exacerbates their affective problems.","569":"The directives for psychotherapy, which were established in 1967 for the compulsory national health insurance system, had a strong influence on the subsequent development of psychotherapy in Germany. This article depicts the historic conditions and the general framework of the directives for psychotherapy as well as their development in the decades following. Finally, possible future perspectives and risks are discussed.","570":"Simultaneous transplantation of pancreas and kidney (SPK) has become a standard procedure for type 1 diabetics with terminal kidney failure. Patients often experience SPK as a dramatic event which mobilizes a complexity of affects such as anxiety, hope, and gratitude. Patients often have fantasies regarding their bodies after transplantation which are linked to massive affects. We investigated 8 non-selected patients in the first year after SPK by narrative interviews to study their experiences of transplantation. The interviews were audiotaped, transcribed and analysed according to Grounded Theory and ideal type analysis. Our patients had many different private theories and fantasies regarding transplantation. Patients' experiences were centred around themes of adoption of the transplanted organs and the protection of identity and self, and could be grouped into five ideal type sets. Bodily fantasies of our patients can be interpreted as specific adaptations to coping requirements after transplantation. ","571":"To investigate the prognostic relevance of the axis \"structure\" of operationalized psychodynamic diagnostics (OPD) with respect to the symptom-related and interpersonal outcome of inpatient psychotherapy by applying group comparisons as well as individual criteria. The structural level of 102 psychiatric inpatients was related to the general and dissociative psychopathology (SCL-90; FDS-20) as well as interpersonal problems (IIP) at the beginning and at the end of inpatient treatment. There was a tendency toward an association between the structural level and psychopathological improvement. However, we did not find any clear relationship between structure and interpersonal difficulties either at the beginning or during the course of the treatment. The structural dimensions did not correlate with the reduction of psychopathology or interpersonal problems. From the patients perspective, however, overall personality structure, defence and object perception were important predictors for therapy success. In correspondence with other studies our findings suggest that consistent predictions on therapy outcome in regards to psychopathology and interpersonal problems are not possible on the basis of the axis \"structure\". The possible implications for a differential therapy indication are discussed. ","572":"This naturalistic study aimed at evaluating the implementation of an additional symptom-oriented intervention program for patients with panic disorder and\/or agoraphobia in a psychodynamic inpatient setting. Patients receiving this intervention showed a significantly better therapy outcome as measured by the symptom-specific scales of the SCL-90-R compared to anxiety patients who had not undergone this additional treatment. This specific improvement was stronger than the general improvement found in therapy outcome over time. Our findings show that the combination of different treatment strategies in one setting may prove effective. However, some problems are discussed which may emerge in clinical practice.","573":"Therapy outcome is analysed according to the main diagnoses in a 5 years' sample of psychodynamic inpatient psychotherapy (n=461) and controlled in a 6-9 months follow-up (n=312). Therapy effects, as measured in a pre-post comparison of the patients' self-rating, are generally good and especially noticeable for affective and anxiety disorders, whereas the effects for somatoform disorders are relatively low. The opposite tendencies are seen in follow-up, i.e. relapses in anxiety and affective disorders, and further improvement in somatoform disorders. A surprisingly positive outcome is shown for personality disorders and especially for severe personality disorders (e.g. Borderline). Regardless of the diagnoses, 80% of the patients show a high degree of satisfaction with their treatment and its outcome.","574":"Subject of the article is the future of psychosomatic medicine as a science in the 21st century. The state of the art is reviewed from the perspective of philosophy of science and sociology. The subjects of psychosomatic research are dealt with as well as theory and research methodology. Psychosomatic medicine will be influenced by a decrease in concrete interpersonal interaction and an increase in interaction directed by electronic media of communication. Holistic theories will be replaced by a variety of consistent and interdisciplinary informed middle range theories. And, last but not least, naive research concepts of the subjects of psychosomatic research will be supplemented by more complex concepts due to the multiplicity of qualitative and quantitative aspects of psychosomatic phenomena. The theoretical approach developed in this article will be illustrated by concrete examples from some research projects, in particular a project on the psychology of donors in living donor liver transplantation.

In a further chapter individuals will be presented who have contributed significantly to the journal and made it what it is today.","576":"","577":"The ontogenesis of moods and the process that establishes them is addressed. Moods arise out of normal developmental processes at both a macro- and micro-developmental level. Moods are part of normal development as well as a component of pathological processes and they are a ubiquitous presence that gives meaning to experience in infant and adult during daily life and therapy. In this first part of a two-part paper I will address the normal development of moods; in the second part I will to address issues related to psychopathology and therapy, especially depression and the intergenerational transfer of mood. I argue that moods are dyadic phenomena--something that develops out of the chronic co-creative interactions of two individuals--rather than solely being an intrapsychic process. I will also argue, especially when one considers the development of moods in infants, that moods make sense of the world as components of states of consciousness that give unique meaning to the individual's engagement with the world and further that moods function to bring the past into the present.","578":"Depressive disorders--including mild and subthreshold forms--are frequent in medical patients, although often not recognized. Over the past decades accumulating scientific evidence has demonstrated their clinical relevance. Depressive disorders and also elevated scores on self-rating scales for depressive symptoms are clearly related to disease behavior and quality of life. In many physical conditions they also predict adverse outcome, including premature death. This paper gives an overview of the literature on the relevance and treatment of comorbid depression in patients with HIV infection, cancer and coronary heart disease. It shows that the subjective effects of depression are rather similar in different somatic conditions. In addition, depression also interacts with the physical course of different diseases. However, the specific physiological mediators involved vary among different somatic diseases and have not yet been completely understood. Despite this uncertainty an improved recognition and treatment of comorbid depression can be recommended. Supportive interventions focussing on coping demands as well as regular psychotherapy and in some cases antidepressant medication may be indicated. While it still appears premature to establish generally applicable treatment guidelines, an individualized approach with regard to the different treatment alternatives for individual patients should be advocated.","579":"Patients with depressive disorders who enroll in typical short-term clinical studies have a high risk of early relapse (30-70 %) and chronicity (ca. 20 %). Factors which contribute to this risk are residual symptoms at termination, previous recurrent episodes, chronic stress, etc. Pharmacological strategies offer a multitude of means of relapse prevention, while in psychotherapeutic interventions there is a dearth of such recommendations. Studies on relapse-preventing continuous contacts (maintenance therapy), for example, are very rare. We present empirical data on risk factors for early relapse and chronic course in depressive disorders together with general strategies for relapse prevention. Results of controlled studies with maintenance psychotherapy will then be reported. Psychotherapeutic maintenance strategies have been shown to be successful in several controlled studies. Furthermore, recent studies show typical moderating mechanisms for better resilience against stressors in formerly depressed patients. The typical setting under study was monthly sessions over a period of at least 8 months and up to three years. In case of severe risk factors continuous pharmacotherapy also has to be taken into consideration. The issue is discussed in respect to differential indication (primarily long-term therapy vs. a rather quick change to maintenance contacts of low frequency). Moreover, the ethical questions of inadequate dependency as well as the clinical aspects of transference-countertransference dynamics are viewed. ","580":"Psychodynamic treatment of depression is described as a problem-centered approach which is derived from the etiological model. This treatment is conceptually based on the internalisation of problematic relationship patterns, the development of structural vulnerability, and the formation of specific coping patterns. The therapeutic interventions specific to depression treatment deal with the present state of vulnerability and the tendency to overstrain oneself, which are the result of depressive personality development and which support new relationship experiences. Special emphasis is placed on the specific therapeutic attitude which allows treatment particularly of interpersonal problems by reflecting, supporting and confronting. Psychodynamic depression treatment is problem-centered in that it is tailored to the specifically problematic kinds of relationship expectations and relationship problems as well as the related problems of self esteem.","581":"With the transition from ICD-9 to ICD-10 the diagnosis of neurotic depression was omitted. Freyberger showed that this diagnosis in the ICD-10 was replaced mainly by the diagnoses of dysthymia, recurrent depression and depressive episode (with this ranking of frequency). A renowned German psychiatrist criticized this change as replacing an unsubstantiated dichotomic with an unsubstantiated dimensional model. The same was the case with the change from DSM-II to DSM-III: Torgersen criticized here that the heterogeneous diagnosis of neurotic depression was basically replaced by the similarly heterogeneous diagnosis of major depression. The underlying rationale behind the omission of the traditional diagnosis of neurotic depression in the new glossaries must be seen in the critical contributions of such renowned researchers as Winokur, Klerman and Akiskal during the 60's and 70's of the last century. The present work compares these exclusively phenomenological approaches to classification with a psychodynamic approach, and the author defends the possibility of operationalizing such an attempt as validly as a mere descriptive one. This view is supported by the successful work of a group of German scientists in promoting the OPD (operationalized psychodynamic diagnostics) system. Operationalizable elements are not only to be found in the critics' own contributions, but in recent empirical studies on dysthymia and the other subsequent diagnoses as well. An operationalized and verifiable diagnosis of neurotic depression would have to go far beyond the two main criteria of the ICD-9 (psychoreactive genesis, exclusion of psychosis) and include new insights and perspectives; this, however, is considered feasible. It must be recognized that there is no place in the prevailing diagnostic scene for such a diagnostic construct. Perhaps with time diagnostic modes will change, as has often been the case in the past.","582":"5-10% of the general population suffer from depressive disorders, one third of which are chronic. Depression impairs the quality of life, and 30.8% of patients show reduced working capacity. Patients are on average 10.9 days per month on sick leave. About half of the depressed patients undergo treatment, contacting general practitioners at an average of 14.5 times, psychotherapists 2 times and psychiatrists 1.4 times per year. Approximately 100 million daily doses of specific antidepressants are prescribed per year in Germany, an amount enough to treat 1% of the general population, which is indicative of an insufficient treatment rate. Pharmacotherapy has been found to be more effective than psychotherapy in acute episodes. However, psychotherapy patients show better long term results in respect to relapses and social adaptation. Due to the large number of depressed patients, general practitioners are the primary therapists. Referral to psychiatrists or psychotherapists is indicated in cases of chronic and complicated courses.","583":"","584":"","585":"","586":"","587":"","588":"","589":"","590":"Psychophysiological course studies are still the exception in AP hospitalized for psychotherapy.

From a sample of 28 AP, 13 were psychophysiologically and psychodiagnostically examined and compared to controls (CG) at the beginning and end of in-patient psychotherapy and 4 months later. APs showed higher heart rate (HR) and electrodermal spontaneous fluctuation (SF) than control patients but did not differ in their resting systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Under cognitive stress, the controls had a significantly stronger HR and SBP reaction, while the AP showed more SF during the tone sequence and while being asked about their subjectively experienced anxiety. Following inpatient psychotherapy, the two groups showed correlation in their vegetative reaction patterns.

Stress factors, resources and diagnostic criteria for PTSD were investigated by structured interview. In the entire sample, anxiety, depression and QoL were in the range of normal population. A subgroup of 13 patients with a PTSD diagnose had significantly reduced QoL. Anxiety and intrusion explained the 42 % variance of psychosocial score of QOL. There was a lower influence of depression on the medical score of QoL. Psychological symptoms such as anxiety, depression and PTSD significantly influence QoL after heart or lung transplantation. Patients with a PTSD diagnose had poor QoL. Screening for PTSD should be part of routine evaluation after organ transplantation.

A cluster randomization was used to assign n=108 oncologic patients (55 female, 53 male; mean age=58.5) to the intervention or the control group. The self-rated amount of information about cancer-specific topics, quality of life (EORTC), coping (TSK) and anxiety and depression (HAD-S) were measured at the beginning of the intervention (t0) as well as two and four months later (t1). At t1 the level of information related to different aspects of cancer (p&lt;0.01) and \"emotional functioning\" (EORTC; p&lt;0.05) were clearly improved in the intervention vs. the control group. At t2 intervention group patients again showed an increased level of information (p&lt;0.05) and more emotional stability (p&lt;0.05). In addition, reduced rumination was seen in patients of the intervention but not the control group (TSK; p=0.01). This study provides evidence that even short interdisciplinary psychoeducational interventions can at least improve the level of cancer-related information while hardly denting the budget of any healthcare system.

Conflicts regarding personal needs are the most numerous in the four main areas of administrative workload, time pressure, working overtime, and career prospects - particularly in relation to time pressure. Control concerning administrative workload is attributed mostly externally, whereas control attribution concerning career prospects is mostly internal. Quality of life of hospital physicians is impaired in the area of mental health. The results indicate that it is necessary to reduce the physicians' working hours and, especially, time pressure.

This is presumed to be denied or dissociated to a greater degree by those who harm themselves secretly (factitious patients) as compared to those who show open self-harm. It is hypothesised and empirically tested that self-destructive patients have more profound disorders of narcissistic self-regulation than patients without self-destruction, and that this should be more evident in patients with overt self-destructive behaviour. The sample consists of 354 psychosomatic patients, 32 of whom demonstrated self-destructive behaviour (18 exclusively overt and 6 exclusively covert types of behaviour, according to Willenberg et al.). The narcissism inventory was applied. Self-destructive patients showed higher levels on the \"threatened self\"-dimension than psychosomatic patients without self-harm. Overtly self-harming patients showed a higher degree of narcissistic self-regulation than covertly self-destructive patients. This supports theoretical assumptions of a disturbed regulation of self-esteem in self-destructive patients, especially in overtly self-harming patients. ","606":null,"607":"As in other western countries the proportion of single parent families in Germany is growing. International studies showed lower socioeconomic status and elevated psychic distress in single mothers as well as increased problem behavior in their children. This study was performed to make up for the lack of epidemiologic investigations on this issue in Germany. The family status of a complete cohort of school beginners in Duesseldorf was screened (recruitment rate 97.5%, N = 5,048). Single mothers and their children were compared to a control group of married mothers (N = 278) with respect to social variables and psychic distress (SCL-90-R, CBCL). 907 (18.0%) of all children lived in single parent families. Socioeconomic status (income, education, receiving welfare) of single mothers (total N = 891) who fulfilled the inclusion criteria (N = 531) was lower, while psychic distress was significantly elevated (GSI 0.45 vs. 0.28). Single mothers without additional personal support for their child, younger as well as poor single mothers showed higher values of GSI. Statistically significant increased behavior problems were found only in boys of single mothers. Single mothers are socially disadvantaged. They show an elevated mean psychic distress compared to married mothers. Psychosocial support for higher impaired subgroups of single mothers should be developed. ","608":"","609":"","610":"The subject of this paper is a review of qualitative research in psychotherapy and psychosomatic medicine in German speaking countries. A short systematic survey of the relevant topics is given. The methodology and methods are reviewed as well as subjects and results, e.g. first interview and diagnostics, psychosomatic disorders, research into the course of psychotherapy, patient-therapist-interaction, and follow-up investigations. We briefly examine the historical and sociological backgrounds most relevant for the development of qualitative psychotherapy research. ","611":"Quality management of inpatient psychotherapy must integrate the different aspects of process-quality management as well as the evaluation of treatment outcome. The aim of our study was to investigate the association of the achievement of individually arranged and continuously re-evaluated therapy goals with symptomatic measures of treatment outcome (SCL-90-R, Giessener Beschwerde Bogen). 51 inpatient subjects were assessed directly before and after treatment and again at approximately 1 year after treatment (mean range 14.7 months). Therapy goal achievement was assessed on a weekly basis and, in addition, globally at the end of treatment. Pre\/post-treatment results remained stabile at the follow-up assessment (SCL-90-R GSI effect size: 1.2). No significant association was found between therapy goal achievement and the degree of improvement of symptoms. This result leads us to the conclusion that the continuous evaluation of therapy goals during treatment seems to be a good instrument for quality management, but it is not suitable for the evaluation of treatment outcome.","612":"To investigate the relevance of somatic, psychic and psychosocial factors on the health-related quality of life at the one year follow-up of patients with lower back pain. Prospective cohort study of 109 patients recruited consecutively. At baseline and at one year follow-up self-report instruments were administered to evaluate health-related quality of life (SF-36), psychic or psychological distress (SF-36), and coping strategies (FKV-LIS). In regards to the physical and mental dimensions of the quality of life at follow-up, psychosocial factors evaluated at baseline were far more relevant. Using a multiple regression analysis we were able to account for 38 % of the variance in the physical dimension of the quality of life and 45 % of the variance in the mental dimension. In these two dimensions the factors \"psychic distress\" (GSI, SCL-90-R) and \"sick leave\" were significant predictors, in the mental dimension additionally \"doctor shopping\". Beyond that, impaired health-related quality of life at baseline as well as at follow-up was related to depressive coping (FKV-LIS). The study shows the high impact of psychic and psychosocial factors on health-related quality of life in patients with chronic lower back pain. ","613":"The aim of the present study was to make a precise analysis of social network and social support to patients with chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (CEDE) in comparison with healthy controls. 35 patients with colitis ulcerosa and 47 patients with Morbus Crohn were interviewed using the questionnaire for investigating social network and social support (SONET). Medical data on disease activity were also assessed. CEDE patients were compared with healthy controls, and patients with active disease were compared with those whose disease was in remission. In comparison to healthy controls, the patients demonstrated a significantly smaller network, comprising fewer extra-familial persons but more relationships to the closest core family members. CEDE patients also reported a significantly smaller number of persons from whom they received social support. Patients with active disease were generally more unsatisfied with the support received than those whose disease was in remission. Our study shows that the closest family members are usually responsible for the patient's social support. Further investigation is necessary to assess the needs of the core family in this stressful situation. ","614":"In a cognitive framework appraisal and coping are seen as major factors in the adaptation of chronic pain patients. This study evaluates the differences between rheumatoid arthritis (N = 70) and fibromyalgia (N = 74) outpatients in regard to coping and appraisal, and the relationship between appraisal, coping and adaptation in general. In rheumatoid arthritis patients acceptance of illness and cognitive-reappraising coping prevails. In fibromyalgia patients, however, passive, emotion-focused coping and the judgement of illness as a \"threat\" or \"punishment\" (Lipowsky) was pronounced. A connection between individual appraisal of the illness and means of coping was observed. There was also a strong relationship between coping and adaptation, with one third of the variance of the mood variables explained by appraisal and coping. The presence of a psychic disorders played only a minor role. A detailed understanding of the relationship between appraisal, coping, and adaptation may contribute to improved treatment concepts in pain patients. One aim of psychotherapy in chronic pain patients should be to reduce passive, emotion-focused coping and to change maladaptative concepts of illness. ","615":"To present a review of the current state of the art of psychotherapy of somatoform disorders from a psychodynamic-interpersonal perspective. The review is based on an analysis of the literature used for evidence-based guidelines on the treatment of somatoform disorders and on our own experiences and models of these disorders. An elaboration of practical aspects of psychotherapy with these patients makes up an essential part of the review. Psychotherapy of somatoform disorders is efficient and effective if the typical interpersonal patterns of these patients are taken into account and if the therapist maintains a more active attitude, avoiding early psychosocial interpretations of the somatoform complaints. ","616":"There is evidence from some prospective and several retrospective studies that early biological and psychosocial stress in childhood is associated with long-term vulnerability to various mental and physical diseases. In the last few years research findings have accumulated on those emotional, behavioural and psychobiological factors which are responsible for the mediation of these lifelong consequences. They are the cause of an increased risk of somatization and other mental disorders. Particularly anxiety, depression and personality disorders often result in high-risk behaviour that itself is associated with physical disease (cardiovascular disorders, stroke, viral hepatitis, type 2 diabetes, chronic lung diseases) as well as with aggressive behaviour. A survey on the current knowledge of how these various factors interact is presented and a bio-psychopathological model of vulnerability is educed. Implications for future research are outlined and contrasted to actual political trends in Germany.","617":"A longitudinal study was conducted to investigate the role of maladaptive parental behavior and the association between parent and offspring psychiatric disorders. Psychosocial and psychiatric interviews were carried out in a representative community sample of 593 biological parents and their offspring from two counties in the state of New York in 1975, 1983, 1985-86, and 1991-93. In 1975, the mean age of offspring was 6 years. Maladaptive parental behavior was assessed in 1975, 1983, and 1985-86. Parent and offspring psychiatric symptoms were assessed in 1983, 1985-86, and 1991-93. Maladaptive parental behavior substantially mediated a significant association between parental and offspring psychiatric symptoms. Parents with psychiatric disorders had higher levels of maladaptive behavior in the household than did parents without psychiatric disorders. Maladaptive parental behavior, in turn, was associated with increased offspring risk for psychiatric disorders during adolescence and early adulthood. Most of the youths that experienced high levels of maladaptive parental behavior during childhood had psychiatric disorders during adolescence or early adulthood, independent of whether or not their parents had psychiatric disorders. In contrast, the offspring of parents with psychiatric disorders were not at increased risk for psychiatric disorders unless there was a history of maladaptive parental behavior. Maladaptive parental behavior is associated with increased risk for the development of psychiatric disorders among the offspring of parents with and without psychiatric disorders. Maladaptive parental behavior appears to be an important mediator of the association between parental and offspring psychiatric symptoms.","618":"On the basis of a prospective longitudinal study of over 15,000 women this paper examines the long-term influences of socio-economic disadvantages on psychosocial adjustment. The study draws on data from two British cohort studies carried out 12 years apart from each other. A contextual developmental perspective is adopted to analyse the pathways linking childhood experiences to adult functioning in a changing socio-historical context. The study suggests a causal chain process linking the early and persisting experience of socio-economic adversity to behavioural maladjustment of girls during childhood and adolescence. Socio-economic adversity and behavioural maladjustment in adolescence, in turn, predict the development of depressive symptoms in adulthood. The influence of socio-economic adversity on individual development, however, also depends on the wider socio-historical context in which development takes place. It is concluded that for a better understanding of psychosocial adjustment across the lifespan we have to consider the interactions of a changing individual in a changing context.","619":"This paper concentrates on the prevalence of childhood sexual abuse, physical abuse and emotional neglect in Europe. It includes studies published in international journals or in easily accessible books. Data bases, specifically MEDLINE, PubMed, Psyndex and PsycInfo were used to find papers on this topic. Taking a broad view there is an incidence of sexual abuse experiences of 6-36 % in girls under the age of 16 years and of 1-15 % in boys under the age of 16. The incidence of physical abuse ranges from 5 to 50 % in Europe. There is a need for studies dealing with the prevalence of emotional neglect or psychological abuse. These figures are in line with those found in North America. However, due to the large differences in definitions and data gathering techniques, more precise conclusions are currently not possible.","620":"The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study is a long term, in-depth analysis of over 17,000 adult Americans, matching their current health status against adverse childhood experiences that occurred on average a half-century earlier. We found that such adverse childhood experiences are quite common although typically concealed and unrecognized; that they still have a profound effect a half century later, although now transmutated from psychosocial experience into organic disease; and that they are the main determinant of the health and social well-being of the nation. Our findings are of direct importance to the everyday practice of medicine and psychiatry because they indicate that much of what is recognized as common in adult medicine is the result of what is not recognized in childhood. The ACE Study challenges as superficial the current conceptions of depression and addiction, showing them to have a very strong dose-response relationship to antecedent life experiences.","621":"We present a concept of career promotion in psychosomatic medicine. An analysis of the current guidelines and promotion practice indicates that both are poorly structured, not tailored to specific phases, and not sufficiently goal- and process-oriented. The career path usually reflects a classical modular model: medical specialist education paralleled with many years of psychotherapeutic education and only then a potential start in research. According to the concept presented here, career promotion already begins in medical school and continues through several intertwined phases: Information about career opportunities, development of career plans, focusing on career goals, implementation of career steps, and evaluation of career success. Goal-oriented and phase-specific career promotion requires corresponding institutional structures and processes: career promotion as an institutional quality characteristic, use of synergies through intervision in peer groups, supervision\/coaching by experienced mentors in each phase of career development, as well as systematic networking on all levels. Phase-sensitive and process-oriented career development can contribute to continuous biographies (in particular for women doctors), to more efficient research, and to a more distinct positioning of psychosomatic medicine as an independent area of specialization.","622":"As part of the concurrent validity, we aimed to empirically study the association between the axis IV (structure) of the Operationalized Psychodynamic Diagnostics (OPD) and corresponding constructs, which were assessed byself-report measures. The structural level of 132 psychiatric inpatients was related to the findings of the Borderline-Personality-Inventary (BPI) and the Toronto-Alexithymia-Scale (TAS-20). Analyses of variances indicated that patients with a good structural level scored lower on the BPI and its subscales than those with a low level. However, posthoc comparisons revealed that significant differences were only found between the good and the moderate or the low level respectively. There was no association between the structure and alexithymia. Despite some methodological limitations our findings point at a satisfactory validity of the axis \"structure\" of the OPD. However, its limited ability to discriminate between patients with a moderate and a low level of structural integration needs further attention. ","623":"During the inpatient psychotherapy of a 21-year-old male patient with Brittle Diabetes, psychic reactions and changes of blood glucose after separation were studied. The patient was interviewed using the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI). Specific attachment-related stress factors were elaborated. During the course of therapy, blood glucose, body symptoms and mood ratings were recorded daily and statistically evaluated by time series analysis. The statistical analysis allowed testing of critical instances (separation) and psychic determinants of blood glucose control. Significant predictors for the average blood glucose were as follows: the therapist's vacation (p &lt; 0.02) and the announcement of discharge from the hospital (p &lt; 0.01). A significant predictor for the daily blood glucose variation was mood (p &lt; 0.01); the trend of the blood glucose variation was negative (p &lt; 0.01). Toward the end of the treatment the blood glucose was stabilized. This result suggests the benefit of psychotherapy for these patients. Further empirical studies are necessary to confirm the findings. ","624":"Research has demonstrated that men and women differ considerably on a wide variety of variables. However, the effect of gender on the psychotherapy experience is little understood. This article provides a brief review of the current research literature on gender effects in psychotherapy and reports findings of gender differences in outcome for two different treatment modalities. Literature was collected using Medline and PsycLit search engines. Results from a randomized trial on supportive and interpretive short-term individual psychotherapy were used to investigate interaction effects between patient gender and form of treatment in 88 female and 56 male patients. Gender of the patient, therapist, or their interaction has minimal impact on treatment outcome. However, when gender is compared with the form of therapy, the success of the therapy differs between men and women. The findings suggest that for research on gender effects in psychotherapy to be productive, investigators need to consider how gender interacts with other conceptually meaningful variables.","625":"The Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF) and the Impairment-Score (IS) are important instruments for Quality Assessment. There are only few studies examining the quality of statistical power of the GAF-Scale indicating problems in construct validity and no larger studies for the IS. For a sample of 263 patients the Psy-BaDo and an OPD-Rating were completed. Though the distribution of both scales show large range, the proportion of explained variance is 58 %. This proportion can be increased to 68 % for the IS by including the OPD-Ratings. The GAF-Scale in contrast is not associated with the OPD-Ratings. The results indicate, that the combination of both scales is necessary to represent the whole variance of psychic impairment (ICD-10 Chapter F &amp; Z). In addition the valid rating of both scales is very difficult for patients with somatic disorders and somato-psychic problems. ","626":"The Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is probably the most frequent anxiety disorder, demonstrating a chronic course and severe psychosocial impairments. GAD is seldom diagnosed in practice and research on GAD has in the past been sparse. This may be linked to the less dramatic symptomatology and the diagnostic criteria which were first clearly defined by DSM-IIIR and ICD-10. This article reviews diagnostics, epidemiology and current research on psychotherapy in GAD. Whereas cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is regarded as empirically supported treatment, controlled and manualized studies of psychodynamic therapy in GAD do not exist. However, the results obtained thus far are promising. There is a definite need for further research in this area. Finally, we present an ongoing randomized controlled trial which compares manualized psychodynamic therapy and CBT in GAD. In this trial, efficacy and mechanisms of change (fearful cognitions vs. Core Conflictual Relationship Theme) in both therapies are being evaluated. ","627":"","628":"","629":"","630":"","631":"The influence of the unconscious on psychosomatic medicine and psychotherapy: a comprehensive concept of unconscious processes based on empirical evidence. The theory of the Unconscious constitutes the basis of psychoanalysis and of psychodynamic therapy. The traditional description of the Unconscious as given by Freud is of historical significance and not only gained widespread acceptance but also attracted much criticism. The most important findings of neurobiology, the cognitive sciences, social psychology and emotion research in relation to the Unconscious are compared with this traditional definition. Empirical observations on defence mechanisms are of particular interest in this context. A comprehensive concept of unconscious processes is revealed: the fundamental process of brain function is unconscious. Parts of the symbolic-declarative and emotional-procedural processing by the brain are permanently unconscious. Other parts of these processing procedures are conscious or can be brought to the conscious or alternatively, can also be excluded from the conscious. Unconscious processes exert decisive influence on experience and behaviour; for this reason, every form of psychotherapy should take into account such unconscious processes.","632":"In a prospective follow-up study the German version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to determine the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms in internal medicine inpatients. From a total cohort of 376 admitted study patients questionnaires were completed at admission and after one year follow-up. The data demonstrated that the mean HADS score on the anxiety subscale decreased significantly from 6.7 3.5 at study inclusion to 5.8 3.8 after one year (p &lt; 0.0005) while the mean HADS score on the depression subscale was relatively stable (5.3 3.6 versus 5.4 4.3, p = n.s.). Odds ratios for the prediction of positive HADS results at follow-up were 4.1 (95%-CI 2.0-8.4) for anxiety symptoms and 8.2 (95%-CI 4.6-14.6) for depressive symptoms. Patients with abnormal HADS anxiety scores were significantly more frequently rehospitalized (Odds ratio 1.9; p = 0.028) and also more frequently reported pain symptoms (Odds ratio 2.0; p = 0.019). These results demonstrate the persistence of depressive symptoms and the frequent utilization of health care in internal medicine inpatients with psychiatric disorders in the first year after hospital discharge.","633":"Psychodynamic psychotherapy in the sense of German psychotherapy guidelines is currently the most frequently used treatment in outpatient psychotherapy. This report summarizes the psychodynamic fundaments of this method and distinguishes the conflict exposure and the structure formation as significant therapeutic aims. The subject of personality structure is dealt with according to the OPD (operationalized psychodynamic diagnosis) system which allows an operationalization and empirical investigation of structural aspects. The treatment techniques used to achieve structure-related therapy aims (e.g. the ability to differentiate affects, impulse control, empathy, emotional expression, attachment, separation, etc.) are described in detail.","634":"The existing studies on the effectiveness of psychodynamic therapy are reviewed. All studies published between 1960 and 2001 were collected. In the first part of this survey, the focus is on short-term psychodynamic therapy, the second part focuses on longer-term psychoanalytic and psychodynamic therapy. The studies are reviewed with regard to forms of disorders. The methodological quality of the studies is judged according to criteria of evidence-based medicine. These criteria themselves are also critically discussed. Although they vary concerning their methodological quality, the studies reveal evidence of the effectiveness of both short-term and long-term psychodynamic therapy. In a meta-analytic evaluation performed by the author, substantial effects were found for psychodynamic therapy of personality disorders, i.e. 1.13 (self-report measures) and 1.57 (observer-rated measures) for short-term psychodynamic therapy and 1.05 (self-report measures) and 2.11 (observer-rated measures) for longer term psychodynamic therapy. Although there is evidence of the effectiveness of psychodynamic therapy, further research of specific forms of psychodynamic therapy in specific disorders is necessary.","635":"Depth psychologically founded psychotherapy is a treatment based on psychoanalysis. This article describes the treatment method. The following aspects are emphasized: Terminology definitions, historical development, specific differences between depth psychologically founded and analytic psychotherapy as well as the treatment practice with the focus on current psychosocial conflicts and their implications. Indication, counter-indication and differential indication are also discussed, and the status of empirical evaluation is described. Finally, the therapist's qualifications for this treatment method are elucidated.","636":"","637":"","638":"","639":"","640":"To demonstrate the repercussions for Psychosomatic and Psychotherapeutic Medicine of the politically motivated decision to introduce case mix funding for inpatient treatment in Germany. Description of the development of an appropriate code list of procedures for Psychosomatic and Psychotherapeutic Medicine within the DRG-System. The code list OPS-301 which was valid in 2001 had no appropriate procedures for Psychosomatic and Psychotherapeutic Medicine. The scientific societies therefore had to develop possibilities for coding psychosomatic-psychotherapeutic procedures in the new OPS-301 2.1 which is valid since January 2002. This was achieved through the formulation of so-called complex codes, which are presented together with first coding tips. There are further tasks with risks and potential benefits which have to be accomplished after establishing these complex codes.","641":"A treatment by artificial insemination by donor because of male infertility represents a drastic experience for the affected couples. Imaginations concerning the importance of the anonymous donor or the physician were already picked out as a central theme in the past. In some studies, for example, these imaginations were thought to have an adverse effect on the satisfaction in the partnership as well as for the development of the child. Aim of the examination on hand was the current meaning of the treating physician six years after treatment and his position in the self-system of the couples concerned. 15 successful couples could be examined by Repertory Grid method. The results of this study showed, that the physician had no prominent meaningfulness for the couples six years after the therapy. In the analysis of the self-system of the couples, gender specific differences could be seen. In the self-system of the treated women, the physician had a position close to their self and their ideal-self. This position was influenced by the self-esteem of the women. A higher self-esteem was associated with a greater closeness to the physician as well as to their partner. The analysis of the self-esteem of the affected men showed a completely different pattern. The greater the self-esteem of the male patients, the greater the devaluation of the physician, which showed in a greater distance to their ideal-self. The gender specific perceptions of the inseminating physician can be interpreted as specific adaptations to different coping requirements.","642":"The \"Measure of Parental Style\" (MOPS, Parker et al., 1997) represents an internationally accepted self-assessment instrument. A German translation of the questionnaire, the \"Fragebogen dysfunktionaler elterlicher Beziehungsstile\"(FDEB), is presented and its construct properties are evaluated. In addition, characteristic parental styles in different diagnostic groups are assessed. Psychometric testing was performed in a sample of 108 psychotherapeutic outpatients and 109 students. Parental styles of different diagnostic subgroups were compared to the whole sample. Using discriminant analysis the predictive value of parental style for psychiatric diagnoses was evaluated. The internal consistency of the instrument and its subscales revealed to be satisfactory. The three-factor solution of the English version explaining 55% of variance could be replicated: \"Indifference\", \"over-control\", and \"abuse\". Compared to students patients scored significantly higher on all three factors. Within different diagnostic groups characteristic parental styles could be identified that correctly described 82.2% of psychiatric diagnoses. We conclude that the German version of the MOPS represents a useful and reliable screening and research instrument for the assessment of parental styles.","643":"The study presents the subjective responses of a representative sample of the German population (2050 subjects, aged 14 to 92 years) on the prevalence of somatoform complaints, using the SOMS (Screening for somatoform disorders) developed by Rief et al. (1997). The results show that somatoform disorders are widespread in the German population. The symptoms named most frequently were pains in the back, aching limbs, pains in the arms or legs, headaches, facial pains and sensations of fullness in the stomach. Women named more somatoform complaints than men and elderly suffered more than the young. The higher rate found in East Germany could be accounted for by the responses of the East German women. Of particular economic and political relevance is the health care utilization behaviour of this group of patients. High medical consultation frequencies and increasing drug consumption were found for a significant proportion of all patients with somatoform disorders. In apparent contradiction to these findings is the classification according to DSM-IV and ICD-10, which diagnose somatoform disorders in only 0.2%-0.4% of the population. Such low prevalence can be attributed to the restrictive diagnostic criteria applied by these systems which obscure the real frequency of somatoform syndromes requiring specific treatment.","644":"We postulate that posttraumatic stress disorder is maintained by learnt cortical and subcortical plastic changes. Specifically, we assume that classical conditioning leads to an intense emotional memory of the trauma that is mainly implicit and related to plastic changes in subcortical structures such as the amygdala. At the same time an insufficient explicit trauma memory is formed that manifests itself in insufficient cortical processing of trauma content. This dissociation of implicit and explicit memory prevents the extinction of the emotional response to the trauma and perpetuates the disorder. First empirical results based on this model confirm the main hypotheses.","645":"Present-day therapy approaches in psychotraumatology center around the problem of effective access to specific trauma symptoms: intrusions; affective blunting and avoidance behaviors; hyperarousal. Taking its bearings from the German and American PTSD therapy guidelines, the article outlines the most important therapy methods and assesses them in terms of relevant quality criteria. EMDR, cognitive\/behavioral approaches, modified psychodynamic methods and trauma-adapted inpatient psychotherapy can be recommended as long as they are used in conjunction with stabilizing therapy elements. Normally, further therapeutic interventions are also necessary, drawing on traditional methods for integrating the trauma into the patient's biography.","646":"In the first year after World War II the activities of Berlin psychotherapists produced a therapeutic Institution that offered employment for psychotherapist and simoultanously autonomous groups of psychotherapists possible. ","647":"This paper presents the authorized German version of the 26-item Toronto alexithymia scale (TAS-26). Due to the fact, that the revised version of this questionnaire (TAS-20) displays low reliability concerning the scale \"external oriented thinking\" in the German version, we decided to reinvestigate all TAS-26 items. In a representative sample of the German population (N=2047), the four factor structure of the original version could be reproduced and reliabilities for the four scales as well as for a pooled 5th scale (scales 1 to 3) varied satisfyingly between r=.67 to r=.84. TAS-scale no. 4 \"reduced daydreaming\" correlated negatively with other TAS scales in this German version also, so we can not recommend to use this construct for the study of alexithymia. Scale values proved to be independent from age and sex, whereas a clear relation with education could be detected: persons with low education scored high on alexithymia scales. To validate the German version of the TAS-26, a mood questionnaire and a body experience questionnaire were used. It could be shown that high alexithymia scores were associated with negative body image and undesirable emotions. It is discussed whether the latter correlation is due to a methodological artefact, since persons with high alexithymia scores tend to prefer middle categories of the mood questionnaire.","648":"Although treatment selection in psychotherapy can be conceptualized as an interactive process, as yet there is few empirical research that aimed at addressing the significance of therapists' emotional reactions to their patients when selecting appropriate psychotherapeutic treatments. The present naturalistic-observational cross-sectional study investigates therapists' countertransference which was assessed after the completion of the intake interview. 13 psychotherapists rated their countertransference feelings regarding 237 patients who presented at a psychotherapy outpatient university department, using a 17-items feeling word checklist. By means of factor analysis, three dimensions of the countertransference ratings could be found: 1. sympathy; 2. helpfulness; 3. anger. Clusteranalytically, patients could be assigned to four groups that are characterized by specific countertransference patterns: 1. positive countertranference (n = 82); 2. weak countertransference (n=124); 3. ambivalent countertransference (n=16); and 4. negative countertransference (n=13). The frequencies of both diagnostic categories and selected treatments proved to differ between the clusters. In the positive countertransference cluster, patients with depressive disorders were more frequent and patients with somatoform disorders less frequent. In the positive countertransference cluster, the indication of cognitive-behavioral therapy was especially frequent. Regarding the combination of positive countertransference and selection of cognitive treatment, the result of a previous study could be replicated. This finding proved to reflect different countertransference attitudes and indication preferences of therapists with different therapeutic philosophy orientations (psychodynamic vs. cognitive-behavioral). ","649":"In this piece of work the primary affects, as rage, fear, sadness and lacking of joy (anhedonia) are defined and discussed as specific causes for the development and outbreak of depressive states. Then conflicting primary emotions and depressive mental states are depicted to be followed by a discussion about the significance of emotion and situation-centered coping. Cognitive attribution models covering the development of emotions on the one hand as well as the exacerbation of depression on the other, are discussed on this background in a critical fashion. ","650":"Psychosocial factors have always been considered important causes of heart disease. Because of its extraordinary epidemiological and political relevance, coronary heart disease (CHD) has received Special scientific attention in this field. However, the abundance of literature dealing with its biological, psychological and social precursors is in sharp contrast with a lack of comprehensive modeis trying to integrate the results of different scientific traditions. This paper gives a brief overview of the present State of psychosocial research on etiological factors in CHD. Instead of solely relying on attempts to identify supposedly independent risk factors, it emphasizes the importance of dynamic biopsychosocial processes, which finally lead to manifest coronary disease. The paper outlines an approach which integrates clinical and empirical findings in a bio-psycho-sociodynamic model. This model is open to future extension. It may be helpful for better understanding individual patients as well as scientific findings. By providing hypotheses, which are suggested to go beyond the still predominating reductionistic, linear modeis, it may furthermore be a basis for future research in psychosocial cardiology. ","651":"The occurrence of self-destructive phenomena (direct self-harm; self-induced disease; self-harm delegated to medical staff) in all patients referred to the psychosomatic consultation service and all outpatients during 14 months and all discharged of the psychosomatic ward during 2 months (N=1057) is determined by the typological-descriptive assessment of Willenberg et al. (1997). Self-destructive behaviour was documented in n=79 cases (7.5%), in 40.5% of these on suspicion. 62% showed recurrent self-harm. In 15% there was a high risk to health, in 4% mortal danger. 51% hurt themselves overtly, 24% secretly. Direct self-harm occurred in 71%, self-induced disease in 48%, delegated self-harm in 35% of the cases (39% overlap). An average of 15 years passes between early precursor symptoms and the reference to the psychosomatic unit. Compared to the control group of psychosomatic patients, self-destructive patients are more often female (81%), younger, less frequently married (statistically confounded with age), more frequently medically certified and sick for more than one year. In sum, they have as many somatic diagnoses (M=0.75) but significantly more psychosocial diagnoses (ICD-10: F) (M=1.86 vs. M=1.40). Bulimia, addiction \/ substance abuse, and personality disorders proved to be more frequent co-diseases, anxiety disorders were underrepresented. Occurrence and relevance of self-destructive or facticious disorders are apparently underrated, so far. ICD-10 criteria are insufficient to cover all relevant types of self-destructive behaviour.","652":"We studied traumatic childhood experiences, comorbid posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD), dissociation and self-destructive behavior in 30 inpatients with a borderline personality disorder. A standardized interview for the assessment of PTSD, the Dissociative Experience Scale and the Symptom-checklist were administered. Results were compared to a control of inpatients with neurotic disorders matched for gender and age. Borderline patients showed significantly more childhood sexual and physical abuse as well as emotional neglect than the control patients. Of the borderline patients, 67% met criteria for PTSD and only 13% of the control group. Dissociative symptoms were significantly more frequent in borderline patients and predicted in combination with PTSD symptoms and self-destructive behavior. We discuss our findings with respect to their etiological and clinical significance and propose a model for self-destruction in borderline patients which focusses on dissociation and trauma.","653":"With the increase of elderly patients in psychosomatic clinics the question arise, what about the motivation and expectations of these patients. Here an empirical study is presented, where 189 elderly (55 years and over) and 190 younger (under 55 years) patients are included. They are analysed with different questionnaires. The elderly patients show less psychosocial attribution for their disease, less motivation and expectation for psychotherapy and a more negative accentuated attitude to psychotherapy. But the expectations especially of the elderly differ in a wide range. In a clusteranalysis three groups are separated: low, middle and high motivated patients. The older patients are over represented in the group of the low motivated patients. These older patients doesn't occure any recovery of symptoms. At last some clinical aspects, concerning this group, are discussed.","654":"Whereas the efficacy of inpatient treatment in socalled psychosomatic rehabilitation clinics in Germany has been well researched and documented, studies involving large samples on the efficacy of inpatient treatment in acute hospitals are lacking. A multicentered retrospective study involving clinics for psychotherapy at three separate universities was conducted on a sample of n=495. The patients were treated on an inpatient basis between April 1990 and July 1998 in one of the clinics. The predominant approach to treatment of these clinics was psychodynamic. Other approaches such as behavioral therapy are integrated. In addition to sociodemographic variables clinical data (SCL-90-R, IIP, BSS, ICD-Diagnosis) at admission and discharge were collected. A follow-up study was not conducted. With an average effect size of 0.84 in terms of clinical scales the results demonstrate good efficacy of inpatient treatment. Effect sizes were high on the depression, obsessive-compulsive and anxiety scale of the SCL-90-R, and were low on the phobia subscale. By self report 55% of all patients indicated they had markedly improved, 22% indicated no change and 6% stated they were worse. 17% of all patients were below the chosen cut-off point of the GSI. Patients with a low level of education took benefit as well from the offered therapy. There was no clear relationship between effect size and length of hospital stay. This may be due to the particular setting of a university clinic.","655":"The study presents the results of a representative survey on the utilization of the health system and subjective attitudes to the psychosocial professions, based on the responses of 2179 subjects aged 16 to 96 years. The residents of Germany frequently seek medical and non-medical help in cases of illness or health-related problems. General practitioners are consulted most of all, but medical specialists also play a significant role. Women seek professional help more than men and the demand increases with age. Comparisons between West and East Germany reflect a few persistent qualitative differences. Doctors from the psychosocial fields (psychotherapists, psychiatrists) are consulted least of all. Utilization of psychotherapy is deficient, information about the existence of the psychosocial professions is poor and acceptance of their competence relatively low. However, the high proportion of those who have sought out a psychotherapist on the advice of a doctor demonstrates the high latent readiness to accept help in this field when needed. The particular responsibility of primary doctors in influencing attitudes here is thereby underlined.","656":"Social requirements of shortness and efficiency influence the psychotherapeutical Situation in many ways. Based on this background the author first deals with the concept of time which showed mythic features in Sigmund Freud's writings while today we assume linear processes. This has a direct effect in dealing with therapy time where currently short-time therapies dominate. An understanding of therapy time as a setting variable enables a structuring procedure in both out-patient and in-patient therapies where the end of therapy is included early. The article ends with some remarks on how the therapist handles his time. ","657":"The intention of the study is the empirical differentiation between \"mature\" and \"immature\" (borderline-) hysterics. 366 inpatients of the Department of Psychoso-matic Medicine of the Central Institute of Mental Health in Mannheim (university of Heidelberg) were diagnosed with regard to the existence of hysterical personality traits. 146 patients shared the criteria of the DOPSY-system for hysteria. This group was divided by assistance of the Bordcrlinc-Syndromc-Index (BSI) into a subgroup of n = 79 \"mature\" and a subgroup of n=67 \"immature\" Borderline hysterics. The distri-bution was validated by the Freiburger Personality inventure (FPI). Both groups are similar referring to age, gender and schooleducation. On the level of symptomatology we found the same feature of diagnoses in the area F40-45 in the ICD-10. Two third of the patients with hysterical personality traits have got an additional classification of personality disorder, but only 48% in the group of mature hysterics and 37% in the group of immature hysterics were classified by experienced psychoanalysists as his-trionic personality disorder (F60.4, ICD-10). With respect to risk factors in the life history we found that mature hysterics much more often were characterized by a loss of father in the first three years and the position of the eldest (and sometimes only) child. The results pointed to distinct developmental lines, which suggest, that the two hysterical groups can be differentiated by the style of coping and defense. ","658":"It may be possible to identify elements of psychosomatic\/psychotherapeutic pri-mary care in the Federal Republic of Germany and the former German Democratic Republic by comparing the current state of basic psychosomatic care (BPSC) in the eastern and western part of Berlin. 278 Berlin patients with psychosocial problems were recruited 1995 for a basic documentation system of the BPSC in connection with a project supported by the Federal Ministry for Health at the Berlin Center. Their data were compared with re-gard to diagnostic and therapeutic measures applied in the eastern and western part of Berlin. Furthermore, 617 questionnaires on basic psychosomatic care were filled out by physicians in private practice in both parts of the city in 1994. Despite the identical or lower assessment of their patients* biopsychosocial stress, East Berlin physicians take considerably more therapeutic measures than their collea-gues in West Berlin. There are only minor differences between physicians from the eastern and western part of the city despite variances in the training and advanced training systems for BPSC. The possible causes are discussed. ","659":"Inpatient psychotherapy is characterized by a combination of different therapeutic approaches. Research on psychotherapeutic processes in inpatient psychotherapy uses often only a single observer's perspective, based on the assumption that there exists a unitary process underlying the total process of inpatient psychotherapy. This assumption is investigated in the present study of two single psychotherapy cases. The process is documented by means of Intrex-questionnaire of both therapist and patient, and by the SASB-coded videotaped and transcribed interactions. The results show a marked incongruence of the process as seen from the perspective of independent raters and from the questionnaire based self-report of therapist and patient. These findings put the commonly described process models of inpatient psychotherapy into question. ","660":"Using the data basis of the Mannheim Cohort Study the present paper investigates the correlation between socio-economic Status and psychogenic impairment due to predominantly psychosocially influenced (\"psychogenic\") disorders (neurotic spectrum disorders, personality disorders, stress reactions and somatoform disorders) in a representative adult Community sample. The period of observation amounted up to 11,1 years. Subjects investigated within our follow-up study for this interval (n=301) were drawn from an representative adult Community population sample (N=600). Within the three step class model members of the lower class were at all investigation time points significantly stronger impaired compared to the members of the middleand upper class. Investigating the clinical impairment related to the intragenerative class mobility those subjects, which could achieve a social rise between two points of investigation were even prior, to the first investigation time point, less affected compared to the ones remaining in their social class. Vice versa subjects in the process of an social decline presented a stronger psychogenic impairment prior to their decline compared to those, which remained stable in their social class. These dynamic correlations offer evidence for the effect of the socalled \"drift-hypothesis\", which postulates, that persons due to their disease decline in their social Status respectively after improving rise to a higher social class. ","661":"A gender-sensitive psychiatry and psychotherapy takes into account the characteristics of mental disorders in both genders, in diagnostics as well as in therapy. It thereby not only contributes to quality assurance in our practical work, but also to patient-satisfaction. Teaching and training in this area have, so far, been neglected in German speaking countries, and research is also mainly done in Angloamerican countries. But especially in this area, findings cannot easily be transferred from one culture to another. Furthermore, research on gender differences and influencing factors - biological, psychological and social ones - as well as their interactions are of outstanding importance for research on mental disorders in general.

In this overview the history of twin research is described for the field of psychogenic disorders by the examples of diagnosis of zygosity, representativity of the sample, criminality, homosexuality and some disorders such as enuresis, obsessive-compulsive disorders and anorexia nervosa. Nowadays the modern methods of molecular genetics for diagnosis of zygosity offer new and overwhelming possibilities of twin research.

This program is organised and conducted by the workinggroup \"Psychooncology\" (PSO) within the German Cancer Society in cooperation with the \"Workinggroup for Psychosocial Oncology\" (dapo). This standardised education program can be seen as a measure of quality assurance and a first step toward developing Standards for psychooncological care in Germany. Up till now 262 participants attended the program. First results of the continuous evaluation showed a high level of satisfaction with the concept and the didactics of this curriculum. However, the interdisciplinary orientation of this program in terms as well of content as of professional diversity among the participants serves as a constant challenge to improve contents, didactics and appropriate evaluation. ","665":"Oncologists have been reluctant a long time to accept the existence of spontaneous remissions in cancer disease. The considerable number of patients whose cancer-disease has regressed without (adequate) treatment should have allayed these doubts. Such remissions could serve as a kind of natural experiments that may lead to greater insights in the biology of tumours and to more efficient therapeutic strategies. In the moment the discussion deals with the explanation of spontaneous remissions by the existing biological or psychosomatic theories. Whereas the fact of spontaneous remissions was denied on the one hand some people claim the occurrence of such remissions for themselves without justification. In order to obtain an epidemiological register of these cases it would be necessary to document all patients in question in a standardised manner. Such a set of data should include psychosocial variable as well since the psychosomatic approach seems to be even more in danger of speculations that resemble closely the causal attributions of the patients. ","666":"This review presents the State of the operationalized psychiatric disorder \"PTSD\" and the traumatic Stressor \"cancer\" in the empirical literature. The development of the diagnosis \"PTSD\" in cancer patients in the diagnostic nomenclature and results for assessment, prevalence, risk factors and comorbidity are discussed. The redefinition of the trauma criterion in DSM-IV make the application of PTSD to cancer patients possible. The prevalence of PTSD in cancer patients corresponds with the life-time-prevalence of PTSD in epidemiological studies. Methodical problems with regard to timing of assessment, reliable and valid instruments for the trauma experience \"cancer\" and defining the traumatic Stressor, make it difficult to determine prevalence. Data to risk-factors and comorbidity are incomplete. Prospective, longitudinal studies are needed to define the characteristics and course of PTSD in cancer setting. With this data it would be possible to identify the population at risk and the best time for assessment and therapeutic intervention. ","667":"In the context of a German-wide project establishing oncologic palliative clinics, a discussion has been started dealing with the specific requirements of the health Community. As a result of this discussion, the question as to the possible differences in quality and quantity of stress has arisen. An empiric case study has been undertaken in a Special oncologic clinic with a palliative ward. The following phenomenon were investigated: stress level according to the Maslach Burnout Inventory twice within a period of two years, coping strategies, and the design of the work place. The differences in stress between the groups resulted in only specific differences, but a distinct drop in levels of stress was recognized in proportion to the level of professional competence. Relations between conditions in the work place, coping skills, and subjective perception of stress offer many opportunities for health promoting interventions in palliative wards, namely increasing Special competences of the nursing staff and improving work conditions. ","668":"Epidemiological data show that 40-50% of all cancer patients develop some kind of psychosocial disturbancy during the course of their illness and about 30% will require professional support. Even if there exists a considerable body of knowledge and a differentiated health care System, the vast majority of cancer patients have no chance to receive any proper psychosocial care due to the lack of facilities like psychosocial outpatient Services in the communities and specifically trained psychooncologists on oncology wards, whereas the number of psychooncologists in rehabilitation-clinics seems to be sufficient. Psychooncological societies have established training courses and formulated guidelines relating to some important aspects of psychosocial research and practice, in order to promote good quality in the psychosocial care of cancer patients. ","669":"Duodenal and gastric ulcers are associated with gastric Helicobacter pylori infection in 92% or 73% of the patients, respectively. Without eradication, the relapse rate after one year is about two thirds for duodenal ulcers and more than 50% for gastric ulcers. Successful eradication of Helicobacter pylori reduces the relapse rate to 0-6%. These data confirm the importance of an infectious agent in peptic ulcers. However, only of minority of Helicobacter pylori infected subjects develop an ulcer. Besides predisposing physical factors, chronic psychosocial stress is a weil documented ulcerogenic co-factor. Several interactions between stress and Helicobacter have been suspected to be involved in ulcer formation, and some of them are supported by preliminary empirical data. Acute psychological stress has also been associated with increased risk of gastric ulcers. Like a solely infectious concept, purely psychogenetic models of ulcer development as weil run the risk of reductionism. lnstead, every single patient needs individual assessment of infectious, somatic, and psychosocial risk. This biopsychosocial risk assessment offers the opportunity of individualized treatment, including psychotherapy in certain patients. However, the effect of individualized psychotherapy in ulcer treatment still needs to be evaluated in systematic intervention studies. ","670":"Endometriosis is one of the most frequent gynecological disorders in the reproductive age. Discrepancies between clinical findings and subjective Symptoms cause the question of the determing factors for the subjective experience. In the present study an hermeneutic, sense-orientated approach was employed by using qualitative methods of research. Eleven interviews with endometriosis patients were recorded on tape and transcribed, followed by an individual-case and a comparative analysis in partly deductively and inductively defined categories. The psychosexual development has been found as negatively influenced. Endometriosis patients show conflicting concepts of their sex-specific role. A found aggression conflict manifests itself in the pain Sensation, at an intrapsychic land an interpersonnel level: it influences the relations with other persons, in particular, the doctor-patient relationship.

The most studies of substantial collectives describe an inconspicious mental and emotional development of the children. However, due to examinations of Special cases, negative effects on the development of the children are expected as a result of the behaviour of social fathers to keep the insemination secret and to turn away from them. In a follow-up study six years after the treatment of insemination 22 successful couples of parents of originally 57 couples (before insemination) could be reexamined. They rated their children by a detailed interview, as well as by a variant of the repertory grid technique, which permits an estimation of object relations. Under an idiographic aspect, the use of the repertory grid technique made it possible to learn the individual meaning of the children to the respective couple. As a group examination it allowed generalizable Statements to judge the children in relation to the self-image of the parents. The major part of the parents judged their children as \"close\" to their seif and their self-ideal. Any indication of retreat by social fathers could not be given. ","672":"Infertility means psychological stress for both sexes if their wish to have a child remains unfulfilled. The way men cope with infertility is partly due to the psychodynamics of their motives for parenting. In the paper, these motives are analysed by a combination of statistical and qualitative methods (content analysis). 137 Patients addressing an andrological outpatient department were asked to fill in a questionnaire of their motives for parenting. A cluster analysis yielded a four cluster solution, two of them being contrary to each other. One was interpreted as characterising \"ambivalence towards the child\", the other as \"child-dependent or offspring-fixated\". This interpretation was validated by qualitative data drawn from content analyses of psychodynamic interviews performed with a subgroup of 80 andrological patients. The results do have clinical relevance; they allow to better understand the psychological and psychodynamic sequelae of male infertility thus providing some cues for specific therapeutic interventions. In addition, the study is of methodological interest, because of the combination of quantitative and qualitative empirical methods.

The paper presents an overview on basic assumptions, research methodology and empirical findings in the field of attachment research. Four issues are addressed, which are relevant for psychosomatic research. These concern: (1) The prevalence of insecure attachment representation in psychosomatic disorders; (2) the association between insecure attachment representation and an increased psychophysiological reactivity; (3) the potential link between attachment and affect regulation and (4) the question, whether the classification of attachment representations may increase our understanding of specific aspects of illness behavior in psychosomatic conditions such as somatoform disorders. ","674":"From the theoretical perspective of this contribution, analyses of psychological adjustment and coping in holocaust survivors should not only focus on the presence versus absence of diagnostic criteria of mental disorders. Coping with traumatic reminiscence in holocaust survivors is conceptualized as human behavior reflecting competences and resources as well as chances and limits of successful adjustment provided by life-long development and a given Status in society. On the basis of a clusteranalysis five pattems of coping are distinguished. The number of persons characterized by specific coping pattems indicates that most extermination camp survivors do possess effective coping abilities that allow them to establish or maintain a personal satisfying perspective on life. Coping pattems are influenced by biographical factors as well as by specific characteristics of reminiscence, health Status, social integration and financial resources. ","675":"Facing the increasing number of single-parent-families we investigated the impact of fathers absence within the first six years of childhood on psychic\/psychosomatic impairment in later life. We used data from the Mannheim Cohort Study on the Epidemiology of Psychogenic (neurotic spectrum) Disorders for a comparison of extreme groups with a favourable or bad course of clinical impairment. In adition we performed regression analysis of the long term course of clinical impairment for the total follow-up sample (mean follow-up intervall 11 years, N=301) with psychometric, clinical and childhood variables. The absence of the probands father (&gt; six months within the first six years of life) was a significant independend predictor of clinical impairment in later life, accompanied by clinical and psychometric variables. A significant and increasing impairment existed even in 73 of 125 older probands (birth cohort 1935), who missed their father in early childhood. The sociopolitical implications of these findings are discussed. ","676":"This contribution is aimed to put forward the theoretical position that general perceptions of stressfulness in the actual life Situation do not simply reflect concrete episodes, experiences and events, but are at least in part result of former coping processes, initiated to maintain or (re-)establish a personal satisfying perspective on life.

In the following parts the relationship between an objective measure of stress and perceptions of stressfulness in actual life Situation, the impact of the quality of medical treatment and social Services on this relationship, and proposals for a possible improvement of medical treatment and social Services are discussed.

","681":"Contributions to the psychoanalysis of so-called \"destructive cults\" are reviewed and criticized for several overgeneralizations. In order to gain a full understanding of religious feelings and commitments it is necessary to distinguish between different qualities of regression in a religious context. Religious groups differ in their \"psychological offers\" and therefore tendencywise in their members' personality structures, too. With regard to destructive developments of religious groups we must consider that collective projective identification with these groups can encourage such trends. Empirical results concerning commitments to so-called \"destructive cults\" are highly dependent on paradigms and research methods. In their entirety they rather contradict the assumption that the majority of these groups' members has severe personality disorders. As a consequence of the current status of research and discussion, religiosity should be respected as a complex domain of human experience that, despite the possibility of mixing with psychopathological tendencies, should not necessarily lose its creative potential.","682":"The encounter between physician and patient is impregnated by contemporary theories of disease. From the point of view of psychotherapeutic medicine, the physician-patient-relationship fuses normative and relationship-oriented thinking. The disease as the object of treatment is being supplemented by the care for the patient as a subject. The participating observation and the respective reflection are professional tools of the medical carer. The realisation of this point of view in clinical practice is exemplified using the Aachen Psychosomatic model of Liaison.

After a period of one year they were contacted and asked if they had started or refused psychotherapy. Those who refused psychotherapy were asked about their reasons for doing so. 67,3% responded and 49,2% of the patients commencced psychotherapy. Signifiantly more younger patients as well as patients with a higher educational qualification took the advice of the institute to start psychotherapy. Gender did not influence the patient's decision to accept or refuse psychotherapy. The participants suffered more profound depression and anxiety than their counterparts. Lack of seeing a need for psychotherapy was the most common reason for refusals, accounting for 26,7% of the cases. The second miost common reason was reported to be practical and organisational in nature as well as mistakes done by the therapists. Comparing the group in view of the reasons for refusing psychotherapy no difference in age and gender was evident. However, patients with a lower educational qualification were less judicious as far as the need for psychotherapy was concerned. Less frequently they believed in a psychogenic cause for their complaints. The results of this study can help the therapist identifying patients who need to be admitted more intensely during the first diagnostic session in order to achieve a higher motivation for psychotherapy.","688":"Psychotherapy is an interpersonal and interactive process. As this view gained acceptance, methods in psychotherapy research for analysing the intersubjective dimension of the psychotherapeutic dialogue became more important.

Ninety-one female inpatients who met the DSMIV criteria fo AN or BN were investigated during inpatient treatment by using: a semistructured diagnostic interview, the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI), the Narcissism Inventory (NI), the Hamburg Obsession-Compulsion Inventory, and the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP). The patients were divided into two groups: those with and those without narcissistic self-disorders as measured by the NI. Seventy-five patients were assessed at follow-up thirty months after discharge. Fifty-one percent of the follow-up group no longer fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for AN or BN, and there was no significant correlation with the earlier presence of concomitant narcissistic self-disorders. At follow-up, patients with narcissistic self-disorders had significantly more pathological mean scores than patients without such disorders on four of the eight EDI scales and on four of the eight IIP scales. ANOVA for repeated measures revealed significant improvement over time on seven of the eight EDI scales in both groups. However, significant group-by-time interactions demonstrated that patients with narcissistic self-disorders had improved more over time than patients without selfdisturbances. Furthermore, the obsessive-compulsive Symptoms of those patients with narcissistic self-disorders who no longer fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for AN or BN had significantly decreased. Our findings indicate that the improvement of eating disorder Symptoms corresponds to a decrease in obsessive-compulsive Symptoms. In addition, there is a certain degree of independence between the severity of narcissistic self-disorders and the outcome of AN or BN. The results suggest that concomitant narcissistic self-disorders do not indicate a significantly poorer prognosis in patients with AN and BN.

Repeated follow-up questionnaires, roughly one and two years after termination, showed that psychoanalysis and long-term therapy patients had superior outcomes on measures of Symptom, social adjustment, and existential attitudes, in comparison with patients without any recent therapy or patients who had been in various kinds of low-dose therapies. During the second year of follow-up, the differentiation among the groups increased, with psychoanalysis developing in a more positive way than the other treatments.

From the beginnings of clinical psychoanalytic research, neurobiological correlates were considered for the understanding of obsessive-compulsive-disorder. However, within etiological psychoanalytic modeis those correlative biological markers have not the Status of monocausal independend variables.

","694":"With the increasing application of imaging techniques, characteristic changes in the structure and functional activity of certain neuronal networks and transmitter Systems have been discovered in the brains of patients suffering from various psychiatric disorders. These findings have often been assumed to support biological concepts of the genetic background and causation of these disorders. However, several lines of research are converging to indicate that the initially established genetically programmed neuronal Connectivity is further elaborated, fine tuned and modified by usedependent neuronal and synaptic plasticity. In all socially organized species in general and in human subjects in particular, psychosocial experiences appear to represent the most important trigger of use-dependent adjustments of neuronal Connectivity through the facilitation, modification and reorganization of neuronal networks. In experimental animals, changes in psychosocial rearing conditions were shown to cause profound and persistent changes in the cytoarchitecture, dendritic arborization and synapse formation in individual brain regions as well as in the maturation of monoaminergic afferences. Based on these findings, the mechanisms of the biological affixation of psychosocial experiences are described and the implications of experience dependent neuronal and synaptic plasticity in the prevention and the therapy of mental disorders are outlined. ","695":"The paper discusses a variety of perspectives of psychoanalytic psychosomatics in the past, the present and the future. An epigenetic model of scientific development is introduced and developmental strains in psychosomatic medicine are evaluated according to the claims of the bio-psycho-social model. In historical terms, the psychological dimension of psychoanalytic psychosomatics has been the first strain to be elaborated; it is being extended still. The biological, somatic and bodily dimension of psychosomatic medicine was the next to be explored; during the last decade, this strain has found increasing interest, especially neurobiological research. Though the social dimension has not been neglected, it will be the main task for psychoanalytic psychosomatics to consider in the future. Likewise, a mandatory future challenge will be a more intensive discussion of the epistemological basis of psychosomatic medicine and psychoanalytic psychosomatics.

Regression parameters of the symptom curves were taken for correlational and path analytic calculations. Initial symptom alleviation is able to predict better global outcome. However there is a relevant subgroup of patients which has a good outcome despite an initial deterioration. Initial remoralisation predicts better outcome but is not a necessary condition. The results partly call into question the group statistical \"dose-response-curves\". Further studies should test the influence of other process parameters (group cohesion, therapeutic alliance etc.) on the course of treatment.

In how many patients can a successful change in the personality area be observed? 732 patients were assessed at the beginning and the end of an inpatient treatment as well as 2 1\/2 years after this treatment. Data were collected by means of the personality inventories \"Freiburger Persoenlichkeitsinventar (FPI-R)\" and \"Narzissmusinventar\". A definition of success was constructed using the clinical significance concept. It is related to the scales life satisfaction, inhibition (FPI-R), powerless self and negative body self (Narzissmusinventar). The results in both questionnaires show the clinically well known psychopathology characteristics of eating disorder patients. During the inpatient treatment and also afterwards, there are improvements in the personality data, but not to the extent of the values obtained from a healthy control group. In the outcome measure, one third of the patients experienced remarkable improvements. The success in the personality area is positively correlated to the success in the eating disorder symptoms. This success could not be predicted by initial data or by therapy data. There are marked impairments of the patients in the personality data. Changes in this domain take time and are rather small.

For depicting interaction the textual parameters - direct speech, acknowledgement tokens, activity of speech and personal pronouns - of Formal Psycholinguistic Text Analysis (Overbeck et al., 1996) are applied. The activity of the unconscious theme is measured by the Interferenzindex (Argelander, 1984). The link of emotional experiences with words is depicted by the Computerized Referential Activity method (Mergenthaler and Bucci, 1999). The attainment of emotional insight in the Model of the Therapeutic Cycle is perceived via the Emotion-\/Abstraction-Patterns (Mergenthaler, 1997). Three phases are discriminated accordingly: Resistance, characterised by defensive intellectualization, symbolic representation on the basis of the secure relationship and emotional insight and detachment. The validity of the results in this single case study is guaranteed by the multi-methodical strategy. ","699":"The present study explores the connection between neurotic or immature strategies for coping with conflict in the presence of specific psychosocial adversities during childhood and their cumulative effect. Here we test the hypothesis as to whether certain coping strategies can be viewed as a pathogenetic link between psychic illness in adulthood and adversities during childhood. 407 consecutive patients referred to the outpatient unit of a psychosomatic university hospital were included in the study. The strategies for coping with conflict were assessed by means of two psychometric methods (FKBS, Hentschel et al., 1996; SBAK, Ehlers u. Peter, 1989), and the childhood adversities were assessed using the Mainz Structured Biographic Interview (Egle, 1993). Patients with sexual abuse and\/or physical maltreatment during the first 14 years of life showed significantly higher values for immature coping mechanisms than patients without such traumatisation. Childhood adversities correlated negatively with mature coping strategies and positively with immature strategies. Significant differences also arise when patients with low risk are compared to those with a higher amount of childhood adversities. The latter group exhibits significantly higher scores for immature neurotic coping strategies, while the former exhibits mature ones. By means of a multivariate logistic regression analysis, 7 and 10% respectively of the variance of the predominant coping strategies within each group occurring in adulthood could be accounted for. The results suggest that in patients exposed to psychosocial stress during childhood an increased vulnerability for psychic disorders in adulthood is, in part, caused by the use of immature strategies for coping with conflict. ","700":"Based on the current literature, the paper gives an overview of the state of knowledge in psychosomatic dermatology. The authors propose the following classification: (1.) Dermatologic problems as a consequence of psychic disorders (e.g. factitious disorder, trichotillomania, dysmorphophobia, delusions of parasitosis etc.); (2.) Multifactorial dermatologic disorders, which can be substantially influenced by psychological factors (e.g. atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, chronic urticaria etc.); (3.) Psychic disorders developing as a consequence of disfiguring or life-threatening dermatoses (e.g. adjustment disorder, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder); (4.) Comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders. Psychosomatic dermatology developed from an anecdotal initial stage to more systematic research with larger numbers of patients, employing control groups and psychometric instruments. During the last decade, research focused on psychophysiological and psychoneuroimmunological mechanisms which influence dermatologic disorders. This course of development and the current state of knowledge are presented for atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.","701":"In the long term anorexia nervosa has after toxicomania the second highest lethality of all psychiatric disorders. The genesis of this eating disorder may be found in a combination of biological, cultural, familial and intrapsychic factors. Long-term investigations have not only verified the seriousness of the prognosis of lethality but have also demonstrated that depressive illness, compulsive behaviour and addiction quite often supersede anorexia nervosa. It therefore seems justified to assume biological pathomechanisms as co-factors both in triggering the disease as well as in the chronification of this illness. Besides the discussion on a genetic disposition based on results of twin- and family research, psychobiological models of appetite and satiation behavior based on known neuropeptides and neurotransmitters are presented with regard to the development of anorexia nervosa.","702":"The psychological significance of the body changes in the course of a person's life. Using clinical cases it was examined how conversion symptoms influence these changes. Elder patients having conversion symptoms hardly perceive the aging processes of the body. Based on the assumption that the body self develops in the course of a life through internalization processes and that the body scheme is influenced and becomes more concrete through cognitive processes (e.g. experiences with illness) the body self and the body scheme become increasingly separate. The conversion with pseudoneurological symptoms is characterized by the cognitively perceived body image, the body scheme, through which normally also the aging processes become conscious. Since the conversion requires the body scheme to portray psychic conflicts the somatogenic organization function (Heuft) is repealed and as a result the aging processes of the body and therefore aging are not dealt with adequately.","703":"Approximately thirty years ago the term alexithymia was coined but it is still open which characteristics have to be considered core symptoms of alexithymia. A selective review of recent expert definitions reveals dynamism in defining the alexithymia construct. At present, the self-report Toronto-Alexithymia-Scales (TAS) are the most frequently used measures of alexithymia. Empirical findings regarding various aspects of validity (factorial, concurrent, and experimental construct validity data) question the validity of the Toronto-Alexithymia-Scales. Alexithymia as measured by the TAS appears not to be consistently related to physiological, affect decoding or affective vigilance characteristics. The heterogeneity of the results could be due to the fact that non-alexithymic persons such as depressed or socially anxious individuals yield high scores on the TAS; on the other hand self-report appears to be in principle a methodologically inadequate approach for the assessment of alexithymia. Objective or direct measures of alexithymic characteristics as the Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale or the prototypicity analysis of mood diaries based on adjective checklists seem to be promising assessment methods for future research.","704":"Long-term follow-up investigations of the effect of psychological preparation on postoperative physical outcome measures have very rarely been done. In this study a three-month follow-up of a previous investigation of videotape preparation before hip replacement surgery is reported. 100 patients who previously participated in a randomized controlled study received physical examination and x-ray of the hip joint three months after the operation. The mobility of the replaced hip joint was recorded as well as ossifications of the joint. Prepared patients showed a significantly higher improvement of internal rotation, rotational range of motion, and abduction, compared to the controls. The effect sizes ranged between 21% and 32% and, thus, were of clinical relevance. Prepared patients showed less ossifications (15%) that controls (22%), this difference was not significant. For the first time it could be demonstrated that psychological preparation before surgery can not only improve short-term and psychosocial outcome parameters, but also long-term physical measures. The reason for this effect remains to be investigated.","705":"Psychoanalysis has made fundamental contributions to our understanding of somatoform pain disorder; however, psychodynamic therapy procedures have not been accorded their due recognition in the treatment of chronic pain. This is due to the inadequate differential indication for the employment of psychodynamic treatment methods, on the one hand, and to the refusal of most of the psychoanalysts to modify the standard psychoanalytic procedures in accordance with the requirements of pain treatment. This article reviews evidence of the modification of psychodynamic therapy procedures and their outcome in chronic pain patients in the context of past research. We conducted a systematic computer-based literature research employing MEDLINE, EVIDENCE BASED MEDICINE, and PSYNDEX data-bases between 1980 and 2000. Psychodynamic therapy procedures are indicated in the first instance for patients with psychic co-morbidity and those with somatoform pain disorder. A modification of the psychotherapeutic technique, involving an approach that is more structured and is also rather supportive at least at the beginning, is necessary. While employing psychodynamic methods in the treatment of pain patients, greater importance should be attached to the physical level and to the 'holding function' of the therapist than is usually the case with the conventional psychoanalytic therapy procedures.","706":"We investigated how the progressive function of the metaphor, the model world of signs, language and culture, link the cell's immunological knowledge with a perceivable concept of the body. Using ethnomethodologically oriented, partly interpretative text analysis, we examined the lymphocyte stimulation test, word clusters in immunology and other medical specialties, the linguistic presentation of the body in German, American and the internet, the presentation of the \"self\" of the cell in biology and immunology, and protocols of oncological out-patient interviews and chatrooms. When an abstract sign model is created, then the existence of a \"negotiable\", \"competent\" and \"tolerant\" immune cell is predominated by the concept of a cell and much less by elements of the body. Thus, the passive, spatial-anatomical concept of the body can be overcome and the position of the microscopically describable inner observer achieved. This is related to the American concept of a body that can be formed at will from animated individual parts. This model immune system impresses upon physical life and also provides a new metaphor for human interaction in accordance with the pattern of immunocompetent cells.","707":"Affective disorders are accompanied by central nervous changes that may lead to diseases of brain and peripheral organs. To gain an insight into neurobiological mechanisms that underlie such diseases we are studying tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri). This animal model is based on the fact that male tree shrews are very territorial and that under laboratory conditions, two males establish a clear social rank order with a dominant and a subordinate animal. In the visual presence of the dominant, the subordinate shows all typical signs of stress with pronounced activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and of the sympathetic nervous system. If there are daily confrontations with the dominant during a time period of several weeks, the subordinate experiences chronic psychosocial stress. Tree shrews can be regarded as a suitable animal model to investigate the neurobiological basis of affective disorders since (1) behavioral and endocrine symptoms of subordinates resemble those of depressive patients, (2) antidepressant treatments lead to an improvement of symptoms, and (3) also in humans chronic stress can lead to depression. Using this model we showed that chronic stress induces changes in the morphology of hippocampal pyramidal neurons, affects neurogenesis in the hippocampal formation, and changes the expression of glucocorticoid, serotonergic and noradrenergic receptors in the brain. These changes depend on the duration of the stress period with some of the alterations being reversible whereas others persist during a longer time period. Since the above receptors modulate neuronal activity, the stress induced alterations lead to an impairment of neuronal activity in distinct brain regions.","708":"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by flare-ups, the cause of which is unknown. According to new stress concepts, two \"integrative single-case studies\" have been conducted in order to gather evidence about whether daily stressful incidents and associated emotions interfere with the dynamics of urine cortisol and urine neopterin in SLE. Patients under study collected their urine at home, for a period of at least 50 days, on a daily basis, divided into day and night urine. Additionally, patients filled out questionnaires twice a day to determine their emotional state, life style and disease activity. Each week, patients were examined clinically and interviewed to identify the past week's stressors using the Incidents and Hassles Inventory (IHI, Brown and Harris). Statistical analysis of the serial data was performed using time-series analysis according to Box and Jenkins. In both \"integrative single-case studies\" we were able to demonstrate that stressful incidents predicted an increase in urine neopterin 36 hours (Case 1) to 60 hours (Case 2) later (p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, in Case 1 the neopterin levels were highly associated with stress resulting from the weekly examinations and interviews. Furthermore, in Case 2 it turned out that depending on their predictability stressful incidents were preceded by a decrease in urine cortisol 12 hours earlier or were followed by a decrease in urine cortisol 36 hours later. And finally, emotional irritation was highly correlated with the course of urine-neopterin. In Case 2 irritation led to an increase in urine neopterin 84 hours later. There were no clinical signs of SLE during both prospective studies. In conclusion, our results validate the idea of \"integrative single-case studies\" as a new \"bio-psycho-social\" approach in psychoneuroimmunology. Further studies with SLE patients as well as with healthy probands will be necessary in order to both strengthen and generalize these results.","709":"Cortisol is one of the major parameters investigated in psychoneuroendocrinological research, but the methods employed for sample collecting are often unsatisfactory. A suitable method of sample collection should allow for the integrative assessment of long-term changes of the HPA-system, should be non-invasive, and should not exceed the subject's compliance. The assessment of cortisol in night-urine fulfils these demands; although this method has been occasionally employed, it has not yet been described systematically. For the first time a detailed description is given here that allows for a standardized replication. In ten previous studies and three investigations of our own this method has been successfully applied to detect changes in the cortisol excretion of patients with endocrinological and psychiatric disorders as well as in subjects under conditions of psychosocial stress. The determination of cortisol in night-urine represents an ideal method for the assessment of changes in the basal HPA-activity in numerous areas of psychoneuroendocrinological research, e.g. field and screening studies in natural environment, clinical studies in psychiatry and especially follow-up studies in psychotherapy research.","710":"Psychoneuroimmunological research investigates the influence of psychosocial factors on the immune systems. We reviewed clinical studies dealing with the following three topics: life events, psychological\/psychopathological factors and social support, and their influence on cellular and humoral immune activity. There is strong evidence that stressful life events (especially losses) have a decreasing effect on immunity. Depression has a similar effect and may be the mediator between life events and the immune systems. Results dealing with the influence of social support on immune functions are still inconclusive. In the second part, we reviewed prospective studies concerning the role of psychosocial factors on cancer incidence and progression. Most of the life event studies reviewed have methodological problems, thus the results are heterogenous. There is some evidence that psychological\/psychopathological factors can promote cancer progression. This is even more obvious in case of insufficient social support.","711":"","712":"","713":"","714":"","715":"","716":"Following a short history of the development of the therapeutic techniques of psychoanalysis as derived from the basic rules of hypnosis, the apparent contradictions between the two approaches are called into question, with particular reference to the importance and efficacy of suggestion and suggestibility in both methods. How the integration of hypnotic interventions can both intensify and at the same time shorten the process of analytic therapy is demonstrated by two vignettes. The range of indications for the use of hypnosis as a complementary measure is currently restricted to the analysis of resistance and of the making conscious of past traumatic experiences that are involved in the psychogenesis of anxiety disorders. Particular importance is attached to the careful establishment of the indication and then psychoanalytic working-through of the accompanying transference-countertransference-dynamics following the completion of the hypno-analytic phase and in the course of the ongoing uncovering therapeutic process.","717":"The state-versus-trait discussion in coping research would become more meaningful if attention is paid to the variability both of coping patterns in individual patients as well as stability of single coping strategies over time. 35 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery were interviewed three times about their coping and stress experience: after cardiac catheterization, on the day before surgery, and six days after surgery. Anxiety and depression were measured. A coping attitude of \"positive passivity\" was present at all three points of time. While the group means were stable, vast interindividual differences occurred. Also, there was a high degree of scatter in the stability of single coping items; emotion related coping modes were more stable than cognition and action related ones. The variability of the patients' coping patterns correlated positively with the amount of stress experienced and with preoperative depression. Different coping strategies are linked to a different degree with personality traits, emotional coping modes revealing the closest connection. The variability of individual coping efforts might be linked to a personality disposition characterized by a vulnerability for stress and depressive reactions.","718":"The concepts of statistical and clinical significance of pre-post-changes have been used to class patients into four groups of therapy outcome: \"recovered\", \"improved\", \"unchanged\" and \"deteriorated\". Aim of this study is to investigate the advantages of this classification in comparison to a simple division into \"successful\" and \"not successful\". 43 patients were examined before and after an in-patient psychotherapy and again two years later with several test inventories. Therapy outcome was measured by the changes in the Global Severity Index of the SCL-90-R. \"Recovered\" and \"improved\" patients did only differ in regard to their initial symptom severity, but not in regard to the amount of symptom reduction or stability of therapy effect. \"Deteriorated\" patients could reduce their increase in symptoms until follow-up. Our results do not indicate a general advantage of the classification into four outcome groups over a division into \"successful\" \/ \"not successful\".","719":"The present study addressed the relationship between patients' causal attributions of their disorders on one hand and their personality traits on the other. The investigation was based on the self-reports of 197 psychotherapy patients who presented at a university outpatient department for diagnostic evaluation. Personality traits were measured using the Giessen-Test (Beckmann et al., 1991), causal attributions were assessed by a check list (Faller 1997). Intrapsychic causal factors were rated highest; after those, interpersonal and social factors followed next, while somatic factors were judged to be least important. Psychosocial attributions showed strong correlations with the self-report of depressed mood in the Giessen-Test. Similar relations were found with other personality traits such as low ratings of social resonance, low openness, and low social potency. The reported interrelations suggest that psychological symptoms, personality and causal atttributions are closely intertwined.","720":"The question is discussed how changes concerning the patient's ability to recognize and obtain insight into dysfunctional relationship patterns, life-determining conflicts, and structural vulnerability as well as the readiness to take on the responsibility for the negative effects caused by these may be conceptualized. A model has been developed based on Operationalized Psychodynamic Diagnosis (OPD) in which individual problem areas for each patient may be chosen from a list of foci. Changes in these foci are evaluated using the Heidelberg Structural Change Scale which is presented and discussed in detail. This concept is applied to a sample of patients who had been treated in an in-patient setting. It is demonstrated that this method of measuring changes can be used reliably. Furthermore, the changes registered with the structural change scale correlate on an absolute level quite high to the global assessment of outcome through the therapeutic team; this correlation is even higher than the correlation between symptomatic changes and the global assessments. How this concept may be applied in planning, evaluating, and ensuring the quality of psychotherapy is presented in conclusion.","721":"","722":"","723":"","724":"","725":"","726":"","727":"","728":"","729":"","730":"","731":"","732":"","733":"","734":"","735":"","736":"","737":"","738":"","739":"","740":"","741":"","742":"","743":"","744":"","745":"","746":"","747":"","748":"","749":""},"articletitle":{"0":"[Mental Health Screening of Syrian Refugees in Germany: The Refugee Health Screener].","1":"[Attachment predicts changes in the level of personality functioning after psychotherapeutic inpatient treatment].","2":"[Editorial].","3":"[Reliability and validity of the OPD-conflict-questionnaire in an inpatient treatment sample].","4":"[Exploration and consideration of media problems in the psychotherapy of adults: An online survey of psychotherapists].","5":"[Doctoral theses in the field of psychosomatic medicine and psychotherapy 2021].","6":"[Grieving in high-speed society.
