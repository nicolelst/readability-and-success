He was diagnosed to be a case of bilateral myopic strabismus fixus. Silicone band-assisted myopexy of superior and lateral rectus was done along with passing the band through the scleral tunnel. The patient had satisfactory alignment postoperatively and did not require any intervention over 1-year follow-up. Scleral fixation has an advantage as it prevents migration of band, and passing the scleral band through the scleral tunnel lowers the risk of scleral perforation as it does not require the need for passing suture needle through the sclera once the tunnel is made.","5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":"","9":null,"10":null,"11":null,"12":null,"13":null,"14":"","15":null,"16":null,"17":null,"18":null,"19":"We describe a four-year-old girl with bilateral severe iris hypoplasia and secondary ocular hypertension.

As they are removed at the termination of the surgical procedure, they are presumed to be innocuous and not associated with significant postoperative complications.Methods: We describe two cases presenting to the same tertiary care center for the management of their complications post strabismus surgery, the causative factor in both cases being the stay sutures used during the surgical procedure. The clinical details of each case are discussed, followed by a literature review.Cases: Case 1 showed evidence of epithelial ingrowth into the cornea from the stay suture site. This case, previously reported by the senior author, is now described over an eight-year period, along with clinical photographs. Case 2 developed microbial keratitis and postoperative endophthalmitis with the locus at the stay suture site.Discussion: Complications of stay suture are rare but can occur, with potentially blinding sequelae. It is important to be aware of these risks and consider alternate methods of globe traction during strabismus surgery.","26":"","27":null,"28":"Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) is a neurotropic virus whose reactivation can affect the central nervous system (CNS) and manifest as different neurological syndromes usually with dermatological involvement. Extraocular muscle palsies are not commonly described associated with VZV and their presence in the absence of a typical zoster rash is even rarer. Case report of a young immunocompetent patient with unilateral abducens nerve palsy, as an isolated manifestation of VZV infection. A 25-year-old healthy female presented to the emergency department with a subacute onset of painless horizontal binocular diploplia, over a month. Ophthalmological and neurological examination revealed an isolated right abducens nerve palsy, and polymerase chain reaction of the cerebrospinal fluid identified a VZV infection. There was no skin rash involvement. Other infectious, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases were excluded. Treatment with intravenous acyclovir and dexamethasone improved but not completely resolved the diplopia and strabismus. The patient was submitted to a medial rectus recession surgery. VZV manifestations in the CNS can occur in healthy young individuals and can manifest in the absence of the typical skin rash. Isolated sixth nerve palsy is a very rare manifestation of VZV infection. Young patients with isolated ocular motor mononeuropathies, even with cardiovascular risk factors, benefit from a CNS-based approach and MRI and lumbar puncture should be considered. Reports show that extraocular muscle palsy associated with VZV is a transient condition and resolve partially or completely after few weeks.

Families were questioned on their experiences with preoperative counseling, practical teaching, additional support and the patient literature that was provided by the orthoptists in the CL clinic. Qualitative data and free comments were analyzed. 18\/20 (90%) said they had received good practical insertion and removal teaching. 19\/20 (95%) felt they received good emotional support. Only 6\/20 (30%) families agreed with the statement that they found learning insertion and removal difficult. 15\/20 (75%) families did not feel rushed, and 18\/20 (90%) said they could learn at their own pace. All except one family (95%) achieved daily CL handling within a few months, with ongoing support from a multi-disciplinary team. One family surveyed was much earlier in their postoperative journey, but was on track to achieve this imminently. All families (100%) felt they were appropriately counselled preoperatively regarding the need for training and daily CL handling. 95% found the provided written information useful. 8\/20 (40%) reported they found insertion harder than removal, 4\/20(20%) reported they found removal harder. Teaching insertion and removal skills is an important aspect of managing paediatric aphakia and presents many challenges. Most parents eventually cope well and achieve daily CL handling within a few months, with support from a multi-disciplinary team. Families surveyed were all competent and were satisfied with their experience. The parental satisfaction survey gave our team confidence that our orthoptic-led service works well, orthoptists have the knowledge and skills to provide technical training to parents alongside vital emotional support, and contact lens handling is a rewarding extended role for orthoptists in a multi-disciplinary team.","35":"This review aims to develop an evidence-based pathway for isolated adult orbital blowout fractures. Evaluation of assessment methods, outcome measures, imaging modalities, and crucially, the optimal timing of surgical intervention was critically examined to develop a clinically applicable care pathway. A literature search was carried out using Scopus, PubMed and Web of Knowledge. The literature favors the use of HAR% ratio, Field of Binocular Single Vision (FOBSV) and Exophthalmometer as the core tests that should form part of the standardized assessment for blow-out fractures (BOFs). CT imaging remains gold standard, particularly to identify 'red-flags' warranting early intervention. There was some disagreement in relation to timing of intervention in adult fractures who continue to be symptomatic without initial extraocular muscle (EOM) entrapment and enophthalmos &gt;3 mm, where early intervention within two weeks is not indicated. The limited literature available agreed that successful functional and radiological outcomes can be achieved with conservative or late surgical management following an extended observational period of four weeks, opposed to the conventional two weeks. An evidence-based care pathway has been created, confidently including the initial assessment methods, imaging modality, and the criteria for observation. A four-week observational period has been advocated due to evidence suggesting that there is no significant difference in outcomes from two-week observation, plus with careful functional evaluation, surgery may be avoided in some cases.","36":"To evaluate the current clinical practice of quantifying ductions and fields of BSV in the UK and Ireland using an online questionnaire. An anonymous online questionnaire with twenty-one questions was distributed in February 2019 via the British and Irish Orthoptic Society (BIOS) members' newsletter. Objectives were to investigate: methods used, frequency of assessment, limiting factors and opinions of importance. Informed consent was gained to include the responses in the study. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Testing. The questionnaire was completed by 105 orthoptists. The methods reported to quantify ductions and fields of BSV respectively were: Goldmann (33% and 34%), Aimark (22 and 23%), Lister (7%), Octopus (5 and 4%), Thomson ocular motility analyzer (2 and 3%), Binocular vision analyzer (2%) and no method reported (30% and 32%). The frequency of measuring ductions and fields of BSV per week (median 1-2) was significantly less than the number of patients seen with limited ocular motility per week (median 6-9). The main reasons for never or rarely measuring ductions or fields of BSV were not enough time, no method available and only on selected patients. Respondents indicated that they would measure ductions and fields of BSV more frequently if a quicker portable method was available (median 3-5 times per week). Most agreed that measurements of ductions and fields of BSV are important (89 and 95% respectively). There is no standardized method of quantitively measuring ductions or fields of BSV, with almost a third of respondents not measuring either. Although most orthoptists agreed these measurements are important, they are infrequently performed. The main factors limiting these assessments are insufficient time and lack of a testing method. If a faster portable device was available, orthoptists would measure ductions and fields of BSV more frequently.","37":"Strabismic deviations can be horizontal, vertical, cyclorotational, or a combination of all three. Previous literature has established the difference between subjective and traditional objective torsional angles; however, often there is a failure to consider the physiological position of a normal fovea-optic nerve head (ONH) relationship. Using the temporal raphe (TR) orientation has been suggested as a solution for this discrepancy. The current study, approved by IWK Health Center research ethics board was created to assess the viability of using the TR in assessment of ocular torsion as well as investigate the effect of the physiological position of the fundus. Subjective tests were compared to traditional fundus photographs and novel TR scans in patients with long-standing unilateral fourth nerve palsies. Results found no differences between subjective and objective angles when considering the physiological fundus position and that TR angles were not comparable to other torsional testing methods. Therefore, it was concluded that the physiological position should be considered when determining the true amount of abnormal fundus torsion. As well, we found no significant value to using TR imaging by optical coherence tomography compared to the traditional fovea-ONH relationship by fundus photography to assess ocular torsion.","38":null,"39":"Alcohol Dependence Syndrome (ADS) is defined as excessive alcohol consumption accompanied by psychological, physical, social, and economic disorders. Alcohol consumption affects motor and proprioceptive functions, decreasing motor and cognitive functions and causing attention deficits. We aim to evaluate visual function and attention, and psychological profiles in consumer and abstainer ADS patients. This quantitative, descriptive, cross-sectional and correlational study evaluates visual function in a sample of ADS patients. The Portuguese version of the Brief Symptom Inventory was used to assess patients' psychological status. The orthoptic examination protocol for visual function consisted of 11 standardized tests: VA for distance and near, ocular movements, near convergence and accommodation point, cover and prismatic cover tests, fusional vergence for distance and near, near stereoacuity, chromatic vision, contrast sensitivity and visual attention. The sample included 176 patients. 121 were consumers and 55 were abstainers, aged between 31 and 72. The most affected parameters of visual function were visual acuity (80.39%), contrast sensitivity (67.50%), convergence at distance (66.44%) and near stereopsis (62.75%). Visual function was impacted in both groups. Regarding psychological status, consumers had higher averages for the Depression subscale, followed by Paranoid Ideation and Obsession. Abstainers had the highest averages in the Obsession subscale, followed by Paranoid Ideation and Depression. Statistically significant differences existed between the groups in the subscales for depression (p=.046) and paranoid ideation (p =.042). Changes in visual function and attention, as well as psychopathological function, should be considered in the rehabilitation of ADS patients.

The literature and clinical experience show that some individuals who meet the criteria for registration either decline or are not offered registration. The aim of this Orthoptic stroke service review is to determine the reason for declining and whether the individuals feel supported without registration and to recommend service changes to improve the certification process. A service evaluation of stroke survivors who had declined SI registration was undertaken. All those with a diagnosis of stroke, a full Orthoptic assessment, a period of monitoring and were discharged between September 2017 and August 2019 were identified. . Fifty-four stroke survivors were eligible to be registered SI at their last appointment; 31 (57%) were not offered registration for reasons including end of life care. Of the remaining 23s, 14 proceeded with SI registration and nine declined. Four who declined were excluded (44%), as two were registered at a subsequent ophthalmology appointment, two were inappropriate to contact. A telephone interview was undertaken with the remaining five individuals. Of the five stroke survivors that were contacted, three (60%) recalled declining SI registration at their last appointment. All felt they were given enough information to aid their decision. Reasons given for declining registration included not accepting the VI, hoping for recovery and having enough support. The individuals felt they were still able to access services and were happy to remain unregistered. The remaining two stroke survivors could not recall being offered SI registration and subsequently requested to be registered following the telephone call. Of those individuals who initially declined registration, two (40%) decided to proceed with registration following the telephone interview. Although numbers are small it is worth considering a post discharge telephone consultation to stroke survivors who decline registration.","42":null,"43":"The aim of this presentation is to highlight how orthoptic exercises can be adapted from the standard implementation and gain results in an intractable diplopia case. A 16-year-old male presented with a 20 prism diopters residual right esotropia and intractable diplopia following Surgery and Botulinum Toxin. Having had further BT and surgery ruled out and no success with Fresnel prisms or occlusion, he commenced on standard orthoptic exercises without success. Additional orthoptic assessment discovered that the patient could achieve binocular single vision (BSV) on convergence at 10 cm. The patient then proceeded on a course of exercises to help extend this area of BSV. These exercises included a reverse dot card and a variation of the distance cat stereogram. Over the next couple of visits, the area of binocularity was extended to 30 cm and the esotropia measured 18 prism diopters. However, the patient felt that progress was slow, and they were keen to learn to drive and so opted for an occlusive contact lens instead. It is unfortunate that the patient did not continue with the exercise program as it showed potential to increase his area of BSV. However, this case does demonstrate how utilizing current knowledge concepts of both exercises and BSV, and adapting them to a specific patient could lead to improvement in the likes of intractable diplopia and be a potential management option.","44":"","45":"Care for children with acquired brain injury requires a multi-disciplinary team (MDT) to maximize rehabilitation. These children frequently present to the orthoptic clinic with complex difficulties impacting visual functions and eye movements. We report on one case which led to a reevaluation of our current assessment methods, clinical care pathways and the contents of clinic correspondence. We present a case report of a 14-year-old girl who suffered a cardiac arrest due to underlying Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome; MRI revealed hypoxic brain injury with extensive white matter and basal ganglia volume loss. On presentation, it was evident there was a significant impact on visual function. Conventional optotype acuity testing was not possible. Her inability to maintain fixation made observational responses unreliable. Observations revealed no steady fixation, exotropia and roving eye movements. Although she was reported to be unable to speak, progress with communication was reported and she was able to give repeatable, reliable responses to indicate \"yes\" or \"no.\" These cues were used and a response of 1.70 cycles per degree was obtained under binocular conditions. This communication method was also utilized to assess visual fields by confrontation. However, the clinic letter written by the ophthalmologist based on the orthoptic assessment simply provided the acuity score with no interpretation of the information or how it was obtained. This case highlighted the importance of understanding a child's communication methods so that assessment can be appropriately adapted. The referral letter was lacking in detail regarding the patient's abilities but equally the ophthalmology letter provided limited detail impacting on the MDT practitioner's ability to understand and apply the information. This case has highlighted the importance of good communication: professionals need to acknowledge and work with an individual's communication methods so that assessment can be completed. Professionals also need to improve communication of relevant findings to others involved in the patient's care.","46":"","47":"","48":"New-onset binocular diplopia after cataract surgery in adults is a rare but significant complication. The aim of this study was to analyze causes, risk factors, and treatment outcomes. Forty consecutive patients with new-onset binocular diplopia after uncomplicated cataract surgery were enrolled in this retrospective study at a tertiary medical center. We evaluated risk factors including type of anesthesia, preoperative presence of strabismus, and others regarding their effect on the development of diplopia after cataract surgery. We further analyzed ocular alignment and motility at presentation and during the clinical course. The majority of the patients with new-onset diplopia presented after cataract surgery on the left eye (28 of 40). Vertical strabismus occurred in 37 of 40 patients, and regional (peri- or retrobulbar) anesthesia was the main risk factor for postoperative diplopia (present in 37 of 40). There were four distinct ocular dysmotility patterns in patients with vertical strabismus: deficient elevation with (type 1a) or without over-depression (type 1b), deficient depression (type 2), or normal motility (type 3). After surgery of the right eye, most patients (6 of 9) showed type 2. After cataract surgery on the left eye, type 1a was most common (20 of 24). Three patients had horizontal strabismus due to a decompensated heterophoria or convergence insufficiency. In total, 17 patients required strabismus surgery (mean 1.3 operations, range 1-3). Regional anesthesia was the main risk factor for new-onset diplopia after cataract surgery in adults.

For each participant, spherical equivalent value, cylindrical value, and pupil size were measured in the right eye using the Spot Vision Screener and Grand Seiko autorefractor devices by two different orthoptists under two conditions: monocular and binocular (three consecutive refraction measurements). Repeatability-reproducibility of values measured using both devices were evaluated using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs). The mean spherical equivalent value measured using the Spot Vision Screener was -2.79D in the monocular condition and -2.69D in binocular condition, which showed a small significant difference to those measured using the Grand Seiko autorefractor (-2.98D and -2.93D, respectively). The mean cylindrical value measured using the Spot Vision Screener was -0.59D in the monocular condition and -0.52D in the binocular condition, which showed a small significant difference compared with those measured using the Grand Seiko autorefractor in the binocular condition (-0.70D and -0.75D, respectively).

The medical records of twelve young patients with divergence insufficiency esotropia and a history of excessive near work were reviewed, and the duration of near work, angle of primary position deviations at distance and at near, and angle of primary position deviations after refraining from near work for 3 months were analyzed. All patients with divergence insufficiency esotropia (age range: 21-35 years) showed an initial esodeviation ranging from 18 to 35 prism diopters for distance fixation and ranging from 8 to 20 prism diopters for near. Neurological evaluation in all cases was normal. Myopic refractive errors were detected in twelve patients. Every patient persisted near work for more than 6 h a day over a period of several months (minimum 4 months). Reductions in esodeviation were noted in twelve patients after refraining from near work for more than 3 months. Only one patient was diplopia free in all positions of gaze. The remaining eleven patients were treated successfully, six with prisms and five with surgery. They were all orthophoric and demonstrated restored binocularity at the post-treatment examinations. Our findings suggested that excessive near work might influence the development of divergence insufficiency esotropia in young adults. Refraining from excessive near work could decrease the degree of esodeviation in these patients.","75":"","76":null,"77":"Reports of isolated anomalies of the medial rectus (MR) muscle in literature are sparse.

On examination of ocular movements, there was -6 limitation of adduction. There was no limitation in other ocular movements. In the preoperative CT scan, all extraocular muscles were present. He underwent surgery in right eye. Intraoperatively in the site of medial rectus, we found an empty sheath without muscle fibers indicating medial rectus hypoplasia. The width of muscle insertion was normal. Surgery consisted of lateral rectus muscle recession 10 mm in hang-back method and vertical muscle transposition procedure, by a modification of Nishida technique, in which the vector of superior and inferior recti was transposed medially by inserting non-absorbable sutures at nasal margins of muscles secured to sclera 8 mm posterior to medial rectus site without tenotomy or splitting. The deviation was decreased to less than 10 PD exotropia in primary position. The adduction was improved from -6 to -4. The palpebral fissure asymmetry was also corrected. Here, we also reviewed clinical features of all cases of medial rectus hypoplasia\/aplasia in the literature and discussed surgical approaches. For vertical rectus transposition and horizontal muscle weakening, this technique has the advantages of being simpler and less traumatic to ocular tissues and unlike the traditional transposition procedures, there is no need for tenotomy and splitting.","78":null,"79":null,"80":null,"81":null,"82":null,"83":"","84":"","85":"","86":null,"87":null,"88":"V pattern arises when the eyes diverge more in up-gaze, as compared to down-gaze, leading to vertical gaze incomitance of a horizontal strabismus.

The prevalence of esotropia was significantly higher in older age groups (24 years old) (p = .040) . The prevalence of exotropia was significantly higher in females (0.039) and in myopic individuals (p = .001). The overall prevalence and 95% CI of phoria, exophoria, and esophoria were 12.9% (10.7 to 15.6), 11.7% (9.6 to 14.3), and 1.2% (0.6 to 2.3), respectively.

We performed a conventional recession and resection procedure, which was combined with a nasal loop myopexy between the superior rectus (SR) and medial rectus (MR) in the same session, under local anesthesia, to correct the deflected course of SR and MR; with the aim of correcting the deviation in primary position and improving ocular motility, mainly elevation in abduction. We present a case series of three adult males with exotropia hypotropia complex, who were operated between March 2017 and October 2017. In all the three cases described above, it was noted that the preoperative exotropia and hypotropia improved following the combination of nasal loop myopexy with a conventional recession and resection procedure, as shown by improvement in ocular deviation in the primary position (measured by prism bar cover test, PBCT). First patient improved from 50 prism exotropia with 16 prism hypotropia to 5 prisms exophoria and 6 prisms hypotropia in left eye. Second patient improved from 45 prism right exotropia and 10 prism hypotropia to 10 prisms exotropia and 6 prism hypotropia. Third patient improved from 40 prism left exotropia and 20 prisms hypotropia to 10 prism esotropia and 5 prisms hypotropia. Ocular motility showed no restriction following surgery in any of the gazes.

Cycloplegic refraction and subjective trial lens visual acuity were measured in all children with distance unaided visual acuity &lt; 20\/20. Gender, ages, ethnics, and regions were assessed with analysis of difference and Odds Ratio (OR) respectively, by statistics software R.Results: Of all 24296 children, the incidence rate for visual impairment from ametropia was 19.18% (myopia accounted for 94.31%) for 7 ~ 12 years old in Yunnan primary schools in a multi-ethnic region. Myopia prevalence differed significantly among gender, ages, ethnics, and regions (P = .0003, P &lt; .00001, P &lt; .00001, P &lt; .00001, respectively). Girls were more prone to have myopia (OR = 1.19, 95%, CI = 1.11-1.27) than boys; the risk of myopia increased with age: 9-10 years OR = 2.6 (95% CI = 2.62-3.2), 11-12 years OR = 6.6 (95% CI = 6-7.26).

Methods: A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted comparing the Lang Stereopad stereoacuity results to results from the Lang II, Frisby, and TNO stereo tests. Mean stereoacuity values and their correlation with inter-ocular visual acuity difference were compared for each stereo test. Results: 98 subjects (mean age of 33.5 years, SD 14.1; 39 males and 59 females) with normal parameters of visual function underwent multiple stereotest assessments. Median stereoacuity values were the lowest (i.e. more detailed stereoacuity) when using the Frisby stereotest (median 40\"; 20-170\" [minimum-maximum]) and TNO stereotest (median 60\"; 15-480\"). In comparison, medians were about double at 100\" (50-800\") for the Lang Stereopad and greater at 200\" (200-200\") for the Lang II stereotest. There was no correlation for each stereotest with interocular visual acuity differences. Conclusions: The Lang Stereopad test is easy to administer and it has certain advantages such as no requirement for additional test glasses. It is a useful assessment to add to the clinical armamentarium for binocular assessment of stereopsis. The Lang Stereopad does not agree well with other stereo tests such as the TNO and Frisby but provides a greater stereoacuity test range than the Lang II.

Interviews with children with amblyopia identified items (questions) and response levels to be tested in a draft questionnaire consisting of 11 items (sad, feeling on face, hurt, doing schoolwork, cross, how other children treat you, doing things, worried, upset with family, playing with friends, happy). This study describes the refinement of the descriptive system for the CAT-QoL instrument using the application of Rasch analysis. Methods: A multi-centre pilot study was conducted, and data collected from 342 participants. Participants were asked to self-complete the appropriate treatment version of the CAT-QoL questionnaire socio-demographic and clinical data were collected by the clinician using a standardised proforma. A \"measure\" of child's health was obtained from the parent by asking how they would rate their child's health over the previous week. Rasch analysis techniques were applied to refine the questionnaire. Rasch was used to examine response categories and collapse item response levels, identify poorly performing items, and explore local dependency of items. Results: A total of 331 subjects were included in the study sample, however only 315 were accepted into the RUMM program as a number of subjects had missing questions responses on the CAT-QoL. RUMM also excluded a further 41 subjects as these demonstrated extreme responses. Disordered response categories were found for each item, requiring adjacent response levels to be combined. This was applied to all items, and the model fit was re-examined. Two items were found to have poor fit (cross and happy) and were removed from the measure and the model fit was re-examined. No statistically significant differential item functioning (DIF) was found for any item, using person factors of age, sex or general health. Two items showed some dependency (worried and upset with family), and the poorer fitting item was subsequently removed (upset with family). This resulted in a refined CAT-QoL instrument that consists of 8-items, each with three-level response scales. Conclusion: The refined CAT-QoL instrument includes the following items: sad, feeling on face, hurt, doing work at school, how other children treat you, doing things, worried and playing with friends. The CAT-QoL can be Rasch scored, with a range of 0-16 where a greater value indicates a worse quality of life (or greater impact of treatment on the individual). The CAT-QoL may be useful in determining how amblyopia treatment affects children, and offers an alternative to generic patient reported outcome measures.","119":"Purpose: Despite the importance of information on the prevalence of strabismus, which can be effective in planning preventive and curative services, no study has addressed its prevalence comprehensively. In this study, a systematic search was done to estimate the regional and global prevalence of strabismus in different age and sex groups and factors affecting prevalence heterogeneity. Methods: A comprehensive and systematic search was done in different international databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, Embase, etc. to find published articles on the total prevalence of strabismus and the prevalence of exotropia and esotropia. A binomial distribution was used to calculate the prevalence and 95% confidence interval (CI). The Cochran's Q-test and I2 were applied to evaluate heterogeneity and a random-effects model was used to assess the pooled prevalence. The Begg's test was administered to investigate publication bias and finally, a meta-regression method was applied to determine the factors affecting the heterogeneity among studies.

Age had a direct effect on heterogeneity in the prevalence of exotropia (b: 3.491; p: 0.002). Moreover, WHO region had a significant direct effect on heterogeneity in the prevalence of strabismus (b: 0.482; p &lt; .001) and esotropia (b: 0.168; p: 0.027), and publication year had a significant direct effect on heterogeneity in the prevalence of exotropia (b: 0.059; p: 0.045). Sample size and publication year did not have any association with strabismus nor with other variables. There was no publication bias according to the Begg's test. Conclusion: The prevalence of strabismus varies widely in the world. As for factors affecting heterogeneity in the prevalence of strabismus, the results showed that age affected heterogeneity in the prevalence of exotropia, WHO region affected heterogeneity in the prevalence of strabismus and esotropia, and publication year affected heterogeneity in the prevalence of exotropia. Information about the global prevalence of strabismus can help health care planners design interventions and prioritize resource allocation.","120":"Purpose: Mobius sequence is a rare disorder that results from underdevelopment of the sixth and seventh cranial nerves, with subsequent facial weakness and impairment of ocular abduction. Approximately half of the affected patients have esotropia with limitation of extraocular movements. This study retrospectively reviews the long-term outcome of strabismus surgery for such patients. Methods: The long-term follow-up results in five children with Mobius sequence, who were observed after strabismus surgery for congenital esotropia, were analyzed. Results: All patients had a limitation of abduction in both eyes. Preoperative esotropia ranged from 20 to 30 prism diopters (PD) (mean 27 PD). Patient age at surgery ranged from 4.5 to 14 months. Bilateral medial rectus muscle recession was performed in all cases, ranging from 4.0 to 6.5 mm. Inferior transposition of the medial rectus muscles was performed in two patients for treatment of V-pattern, and two patients also had surgery for vertical strabismus. Follow-up ranged from 4 to 19.5 years (mean 11.7 years). The final horizontal alignment was &lt;8 PD in all patients, and all demonstrated some binocularity. Conclusion: Bilateral medial rectus muscle recession is an effective treatment for esotropia associated with Mobius sequence, with good long-term stability.","121":"","122":null,"123":"Background: Fusional amplitudes are important for clinical practice in diagnosing and managing binocular vision anomalies. Several measurement methods can be used to assess fusional amplitudes. However, those methods are not interchangeable, and measurement repeatability has been questioned. Objectives: To compare the normative values of tests for the measurement of fusional vergence and to investigate sources of heterogeneity of diagnostic accuracy including: age, variation in method of assessment, study design and size, type (convergent, divergent, vertical, cyclo) and severity of strabismus (constant\/intermittent\/latent). Data sources: Bibliographic databases were searched up to March 2018, including Cochrane registers, PubMed, Web of ScienceTM, Google Scholar and Science Citation Index. Trial registers and conference proceedings were hand searched. Review methods: The review observed and reported according to the PRISMA guidelines and was registered with PROSPERO. The I2 was used to show the percentage of observed total variation across studies that is due to real heterogeneity rather than chance. The results of the different studies and the overall effect (meta-analysis under the random effects model) are shown. Results: Eighty-one studies were included in the review. Heterogenous information about break vergence amplitudes is reported for the step vergence method (I2 &gt; 50%; p &lt; 0.05) in children. Four parameters were reported consistently to affect measurements; age, method of assessment, order of testing and target size. For the smooth vergence technique break vergence values heterogeneity was not present in children and adults (I2 = 0%; p &gt; 0.05). Limitations: The results are based on cross-sectional studies that were performed independently of each other, with different examiners, methods of examination and different populations. Conclusions: The source of heterogeneity between studies for vergence break points measured with the step vergence method seems to be linked with age. Normal vergences reported in children had considerable heterogeneity compared with adults. In clinical practice, the population-based vergence ranges measured with the step vergence method in children should not be used as one single criterion. For the smooth vergence technique, normative population data can be used.","124":null,"125":null,"126":"","127":null,"128":null,"129":"We report a case of inferior oblique (IO) muscle adherence with fat adherence, which developed following unilateral IO anteriorization (IOAT).

All participants underwent detailed clinical examination, as well as appropriate investigations and were asked to complete the self administered VFQ-25. 35\/38 participants completed the questionnaire. The mean age of the population was 35.1 years (range 17-64). Mean overall VFQ-25 score at baseline was 65 (SD 13, range 34-91). Participants specifically demonstrated lowest scores for the impact of IINS on mental health, role limitations and dependency. 26\/35 of participants were not driving, either due to sub-normal vision, lack of confidence or difficulties with contrast sensitivity. IINS can have a greater than expected impact on an individual's quality of life, without necessarily causing markedly reduced visual acuity. Our study showed lowest scores in the domains of mental health and wellbeing. Patients also reported reduced visual functioning in driving, which can impact adversely on employability and independence.

Hippocrates and his followers were the first to introduce the hypothesis of a hereditary condition. Many ancient Greek physicians like Galen (ca 2nd AD) provided several definitions, while Paul of Aegina (625-690 AD) was the scholar who introduced a method to treat it. Paul used a full face mask and an oil lamb to guide the eyeballs toward the desired direction. It seems that this approach endured for centuries to come. During 11th century AD in Constantinople, the Byzantine scholar and politician Michael Constantine Psellus (ca 1020-1105 AD) composed a series of philosophical, religious, political and scientific treatises. Among his work stands a medical iambic didactic poem of 1732 lines, in which he had mentioned strabismus. Although he was not an oculist, he had managed to define strabismus. His definition was noted as such, \"Strabismus is caused by a spasm of the bodies which move (the eye balls) and the oblique tendency of the muscles\". Psellus was aware of the knowledge of the past and recorded what was still valid at that era, presenting a memorable definition. As his reference was completely neglected from the medical bibliography, our study aims to add him in the scientific chain of those who understood this disorder. This study aims to compose Psellus biography, present ancient Greek and Byzantine ophthalmology's opinion concerning strabismus and note Psellus' definition.

A 40-year-old healthy woman was referred by a general ophthalmologist at a secondary care center to our hospital. She had undergone recurrent pterygium excision with amniotic membrane transplantation on the nasal side of her right eye. Immediately after the last operation, she complained of horizontal binocular diplopia. On the first postoperative day, the patient could not adduct the eye beyond the primary position. Her measurements in primary position were 45 prism diopters of right exotropia on distant and near. The diagnosis of iatrogenic medial rectus disinsertion was made. Three weeks after pterygium excision, revision surgery was performed; the medial rectus was found and reattached to its normal insertion site. On the first postoperative day, the patient referred a small vertical diplopia in the primary position. Orthoptic examination five months post-operatively demonstrated orthotropia and absence of diplopia in primary position, but minimal horizontal diplopia in right gaze.

There is little data on feasibility and and the present study aimed to provide this information. We completed a pilot Randomized Control Trial (RCT) at a single tertiary referral centre in London, UK. We enrolled 38 adults with idiopathic INS and randomised them to either plano CL (with corrective spectacles if required) or to corrective CL. CL wear was required for a minimum of 2 weeks. Primary outcome measures were feasibility and safety of CL wear in INS; secondary outcome measures were visual acuity and nystagmus waveform parameters. 27 completed the study (27\/38,71%). 4 partcipants withdrew due to difficulty with CL insertion\/removal and 7 were lost to follow up.

Diffusion tensor imaging was used in four subjects with infantile esotropia (IE) and nine control subjects with normal binocularity, in order to study interhemispheric fibers in the CC connecting the right and left primary visual cortical areas. The number of callosal fibers linking both visual cortical areas between the hemispheres was found to be higher in subjects with IE. Also in IE, the amount of visual callosal fibers found after analysis from the primary visual cortical areas on one side appeared significantly different from the amount starting from the contralateral primary visual areas. The distribution area on one side is wider. We show callosal visual fibers to be abnormal in human IE. Subjects with IE showed abnormal numbers of transcallosal fibers connecting the visual cortical areas on both sides which likely results from an abnormal elimination process during development.

In this expanded cohort, statistical significance was reached confirming the previous findings that convergence is significantly affected by encouragement, divergence is significantly reduced if assessed after convergence, and near amplitudes are significantly higher than distance amplitudes. Finally, there is a negative correlation between age and convergence break point. The results of this study demonstrate that divergence is significantly reduced if assessed after convergence in the subject with normal binocular function. Next, convergence is significantly affected by the use of encouragement. Measurements at near produced significantly higher results for all of the convergence and divergence tests.

When different groups of patients were viewed separately, it became apparent that almost all specialists agreed that every patient with a third nerve palsy and patients under 50 years of age should undergo MRI scanning. In patients with fourth nerve palsy, MRI scanning was not indicated. The neurologists in this study were more likely to perform MRI scanning in every patient presenting with ocular cranial nerve palsy.

Subjects underwent binocular and monocular visual acuity testing on high-contrast Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) as well as 2.5% and 1.25% Sloan low contrast acuity (LCA) charts. BiS was calculated as the difference between better eye and binocular scores. Strabismic amblyopes and strabismic controls did not significantly differ in preoperative BiS, but both had subnormal BiS preoperatively on LCA charts. Among 11 strabismic amblyopes with preoperative and postoperative BiS measurements, average postoperative BiS was not significantly different from preoperative.

In addition to collecting demographic data, optometric examinations were performed for each participant. Unilateral and alternating cover tests were performed at far (6 m) and near (40 cm) to detect tropia and phoria, respectively, and the magnitude of the deviation was measured using alternating cover test and prism bar. Tropia was defined as the presence of constant unilateral or alternating horizontal strabismus (exotropia or esotropia) at either far or near fixation distances. Far and near exophoria were defined as more than 3 prism diopters (PD) and 9 PD of exophoria at far and near fixation distances, respectively. Far esophoria was defined as more than 1 PD of esophoria at far. Near esophoria was defined as any amount of esophoria at near. Of 3851 selected individuals, 3314 (86.5%) participated in the study.

Seven patients required further surgery, 2 patients needed further botulinum toxin A. Eight patients experienced an overcorrection; five at 3 weeks, seven at 3 months, and eight at 1 year. There was a significant difference in the mean near angle at tie-off post-adjustment in the patients that overcorrected compared to those that did not reverse (3.1 PD vs 7.1 PD; P=0.005). Adjustable surgery for vertical strabismus in thyroid eye disease may result in late overcorrection and the need for further intervention. We propose that aiming for an immediate post-adjustment angle of 8 PD undercorrection for near would allow for postoperative drift and reduce the chances of a late overcorrection. This would require careful preoperative counseling of the patient in order to explain that immediate undercorrection and persistent diplopia were necessary in order to generate a better long-term result. ","194":"The theme of the 2016 Burian Lecture is how our understanding of strabismus has been changed by the research carried out in our laboratory in Reading over the years. Accommodation and convergence are fundamental to orthoptics, but actual responses have often been very different compared to what we had expected. This paper outlines how our laboratory's understanding of common issues such as normal development of accommodation and convergence, their linkage, intermittent strabismus, anisometropia, orthoptic exercises, and risk factors for strabismus have changed. A new model of thinking about convergence and accommodation may help us to better understand and predict responses in our patients.","195":"To present an overview of the range of systematic reviews on intervention trials pertinent to orthoptic practice, produced by the Cochrane Eyes and Vision group (CEV). We searched the 2016 Cochrane Library database (31.03.2016) to identify completed reviews and protocols of direct relevance to orthoptic practice. These reviews are currently completed and published, available on www.thecochranelibrary.com (free to UK health employees) or via the CEV website (http:\/\/eyes.cochrane.org\/) . We found 27 completed CEV reviews across the topics of strabismus, amblyopia, refractive errors, and low vision. Seven completed CEV protocols addressed topics of strabismus, amblyopia, refractive errors, low vision, and screening. We found 3 completed Cochrane Stroke reviews addressing visual field loss, eye movement impairment, and age-related vision loss. The systematic review process presents an important opportunity for any clinician to contribute to the establishment of reliable, evidence-based orthoptic practice. Each review has an abstract and plain language summary that many non-clinicians find useful, followed by a full copy of the review (background, objectives, methods, results, discussion) with a conclusion section that is divided into implications for practice and implications for research. The current reviews provide patients\/parents\/carers with information about various different conditions and treatment options, but also provide clinicians with a summary of the available evidence on interventions, to use as a guide for both clinical practice and future research planning. The reviews identified in this overview highlight the evidence available for effective interventions for strabismus, amblyopia, refractive errors, and low vision or stroke rehabilitation as well as the gaps in the evidence base. Thus, a demand exists for future robust, randomized, controlled trials of such interventions of importance in orthoptic practice.

Interventions are aimed at reducing myopia in childhood and include environmental considerations, spectacles, contact lenses, and pharmacological agents. We reviewed recent literature with interventions aimed at reducing myopia progression in children and found that a number of interventions were significant in reducing the progression of myopia. Of these interventions, atropine showed the largest dose-related effect on myopia progression control. Although higher doses are associated with side effects of pupil dilatation, loss of accommodation, near vision blur, and rebound phenomenon, low-dose atropine has also been shown to provide effective myopia control with minimal side effects and rebound. To a lesser degree, bifocal soft contact lenses have also been shown to be effective in reducing the progression of myopia, though compliance is an issue. Similarly, orthokeratology lenses have also been shown to be effective in reducing axial length elongation and myopia progression, though long-term data on its rebound effects are unavailable.","198":null,"199":"A rating scale is a critical component of patient-reported outcome instrument design, but the optimal rating scale format for pediatric use has not been investigated. We compared rating scale performance when administering potential questionnaire items to children with eye disorders and their parents. Three commonly used rating scales were evaluated: frequency (never, sometimes, often, always), severity (not at all, a little, some, a lot), and difficulty (not difficult, a little difficult, difficult, very difficult). Ten patient-derived items were formatted for each rating scale, and rating scale testing order was randomized. Both child and parent were asked to comment on any problems with, or a preference for, a particular scale. Any confusion about options or inability to answer was recorded. Twenty-one children, aged 5-17 years, with strabismus, amblyopia, or refractive error were recruited, each with one of their parents. Of the first 10 children, 4 (40%) had problems using the difficulty scale, compared with 1 (10%) using frequency, and none using severity. The difficulty scale was modified, replacing the word \"difficult\" with \"hard.\" Eleven additional children (plus parents) then completed all 3 questionnaires. No children had problems using any scale. Four (36%) parents had problems using the difficulty (\"hard\") scale and 1 (9%) with frequency. Regarding preference, 6 (55%) of 11 children and 5 (50%) of 10 parents preferred using the frequency scale. Children and parents found the frequency scale and question format to be the most easily understood. Children and parents also expressed preference for the frequency scale, compared with the difficulty and severity scales.

Statistical modelling was undertaken on a combined data set of the Monitored Occlusion Treatment of Amblyopia Study (MOTAS) and the Randomized Occlusion Treatment of Amblyopia Study (ROTAS). This exercise permits the calculation of future patients' total effective dose (TED)-that predicted to achieve their best attainable visual acuity. Daily patching regimens (hours\/day) can be calculated from the TED. Occlusion data for 149 study participants with amblyopia (anisometropic in 50, strabismic in 43, and mixed in 56) were analyzed. Median time to best observed visual acuity was 63 days (25% and 75% quartiles; 28 and 91 days). Median visual acuity in the amblyopic eye at start of occlusion was 0.40 logMAR (quartiles 0.22 and 0.68 logMAR) and at end of occlusion was 0.12 (quartiles 0.025 and 0.32 logMAR). Median lower and upper estimates of TED were 120 hours (quartiles 34 and 242 hours), and 176 hours (quartiles 84 and 316 hours). The data suggest a piecewise linear relationship (P = 0.008) between patching dose-rate (hours\/day) and TED with a single breakpoint estimated at 2.16 (standard error 0.51) hours\/day, suggesting doses below 2.16 hours\/day are less effective. We introduce the concept of TED of occlusion. Predictors for TED are visual acuity deficit, amblyopia type, and age at start of occlusion therapy. Dose-rates prescribed within the model range from 2.5 to 12 hours\/day and can be revised dynamically throughout treatment in response to recorded patient compliance: a personalized dosing strategy.

Data were collected prospectively over a 3-year period (2012-2015) from children participating in the vision screening program provided by orthoptists and carried out in schools located in the city of Bradford, UK. Prevalence of strabismus was determined for 17,018 children aged 4 to 5 years. Data linkage was undertaken for 4563 children participating in the Born in Bradford birth cohort study and the vision screening program. 4067 children had complete data and were included in the multivariable regression analyses to determine associated factors. 401\/17018 (2.4%) children were found to have either a constant or an intermittent strabismus; 179\/401 (45%) had an esotropic deviation, 214 (53%) an exotropic deviation, and 8 (2%) had a vertical deviation. No significant difference in the overall prevalence of strabismus was found between the white British, Pakistani, or children of other ethnic origin (P=0.41). Multivariable analysis showed that children of white British ethnicity have twice the odds of having esotropia (OR 2.4, 95% CI: 1.1, 5.3). The odds of having esotropia were highest in children with a hyperopic mean spherical equivalent (OR 2.0, 95% CI: 1.7, 2.6). There was some evidence of an interaction between ethnicity and mean spherical equivalent in children with esotropia (P=0.058). Prevalence of strabismus is consistent with other population-based studies in this cohort of children aged 4-5 years. Prevalence of esotropia (constant or intermittent) is greater in the white British population, odds of esotropia increased with increasing hyperopic refractive error in both white British and Pakistani children. Exotropia (constant or intermittent) was not found to be associated with refractive error, ethnicity, or other early life factors.

We aimed to identify specific symptoms in children with intermittent XT, their frequency, and effects on health-related quality of life (HRQOL). 35 children (5-13 years) with intermittent XT without previous surgery were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. Specific symptoms were identified from a previous study involving child and parent interviews and formulated as a 22-item symptom questionnaire. A frequency Likert-type rating scale was used and a response of \"sometimes\" or more was considered consistent with having the symptom. All 35 children, along with one parent for each child, also completed the patient-derived intermittent XT HRQOL questionnaire (IXTQ) with Child, Proxy, and Parent components. The frequency of symptoms was calculated, and the relationship between individual symptom question scores and Child, Proxy, and Parent HRQOL scores, was evaluated in multivariate linear regression analyses. The mean number of specific symptoms was 7 (range 2 to 19). The most frequently reported were: rubbing the eye (29 [83%] of 35), problems with eyes in the sun, and the eyes feeling tired (each 22, 63%). Lower (worse) Child IXTQ HRQOL scores were associated with symptoms of difficulty focusing eyes (P=0.0007), double vision (P=0.007), eyes hurting (P=0.006), and problems with eyes in the sun (P=0.06). There were weak associations between Proxy IXTQ and Parent IXTQ scores and child symptoms. Overall, 7 symptom questions were associated with reduced HRQOL in multivariate models.

The 7 patients presented with the following clinical characteristics: enophthalmos, restriction to eye movements in most fields of gaze, and presence of an anomalous orbital structure that was interpreted on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to be an accessory extraocular muscle inserting onto the posterior surface of the globe in the affected eye. The fellow eye was normal in all cases. Five of the 7 patients underwent surgical correction with partial improvement in only one patient.

Participating orthoptists provided standard orthoptic care for one year, adding the Patchbook in the second year. They attended courses on compliance and intercultural communication by communication skills training. Many other compliance-enhancing measures were initiated. Orthoptists' awareness, attitude, and activities regarding noncompliance were assessed through interviews, questionnaires, and observations. Their use of the Patchbook was measured. The study was performed in low socio-economic status (SES) areas and in other areas in the Netherlands. It was attempted to integrate education on compliance into basic and continuing orthoptic training. The Patchbook was used by all 9 orthoptists who participated in low-SES areas and 17 of 23 orthoptists in other areas. Courses changed awareness and attitude about compliance, but this was not sustained. Although orthoptists estimated compliance during patching at 70%, three-quarters never suspected noncompliance during a full day of observation in any of their patients. Explanations to parents who spoke Dutch poorly were short. In the second year, explanations to children were longer. Implementation of all 7 additional compliance-enhancing measures failed. Education on compliance was not integrated into orthoptists' training. Almost all orthoptists used the Patchbook and, as another study demonstrated, it proved to be very effective, especially in low-SES areas. Duration of explanation was inversely proportional to parents' fluency in Dutch. Noncompliance was rarely suspected by orthoptists. Although 7 additional compliance-enhancing measures had been conceived and planned with the best intentions, they were not realized. These required extra, unpaid time from the orthoptists, which is especially scarce in hospitals in low-SES areas where the educational cartoon is most needed.

A 28-year-old woman underwent uncomplicated strabismus surgery of her right eye for sensory exotropia under general anesthesia (6 mm right medial rectus muscle resection and 8 mm right lateral rectus muscle recession). Retrospective, observational case report and literature review. One month after strabismus surgery, the patient presented with surgically induced necrotizing scleritis in the nasal aspect of sclera. Bacterial culture of the bed of the scleral melt showed no growth and all laboratory evaluation was normal. The scleritis completely resolved after initiation of systemic corticosteroids and oral azathioprine. Three weeks later (after tapering dose of systemic medication), the patient returned with large area of necrotizing scleritis in the same eye, but this time in the temporal aspect of sclera. To our knowledge, this is the first documented case of multifocal surgically induced necrotizing scleritis occurring after strabismus surgery. This study also highlights the fact that scleritis may recur even in an area distant from the site of surgery, despite initial control. It seems that maybe with a longer course of treatment it is less likely to recur, and tapering medications should be carefully managed.

All participants had measurements of uncorrected visual acuity, corrected visual acuity, and non-cycloplegic refraction, and they had near and far cover tests to determine tropia and phoria. Of the 3765 selected children, 3701 participated in the study. The prevalence of tropia was 1.21% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.86-1.57). Near and near\/far tropia was observed in 0.83% (95% CI: 0.53-1.12) and 0.39% (95% CI: 0.18-0.59), respectively. Tropia was significantly more prevalent in boys (P=0.005).

We noted on surgical exploration that the superior oblique tendon had attached to the sclera under the nasal border of the superior rectus. Further weakening of the tendon was achieved by a No. 240 band expander that resulted in improvement of adduction in elevation.

The aims of this study were to determine current practice and estimate the incidence of intractable diplopia following amblyopia treatment. Current practice and incidence of intractable diplopia following amblyopia were determined via a questionnaire distributed to head orthoptists in every eye department in the United Kingdom. The questionnaire explored testing and test conditions, interpretation of the test results, and cases of intractable diplopia over the last 5 years. There was considerable variation in clinical practice of the measurement of the density of suppression and interpretation of the results to guide the treatment of amblyopia. The minimum age of patients taking the test ranged from 2 to 8 years and the minimum filter considered still safe to continue treatment ranged from 4 to 17. It is estimated there were 24 cases of intractable diplopia over the last 5 years. The issue of intractable diplopia and amblyopia treatment is likely to become increasingly important as there appears to be greater plasticity and scope to treat amblyopia in teenagers and adults than was previously thought.

Preoperatively all patients preferred chin-up head posture and three had pseudoptosis or ptosis. One of the 5 had prior vertical muscle surgery. Surgery correction for the MED consisted of near maximal superior rectus recession on the contralateral sound eye. Compensatory chin-up head position and alignment in primary position was improved in all patients. Average age at surgery was 5.3 years. Average superior rectus recession was 9.7 mm. Mean follow-up was 4.8 years (range 12 months to 11.5 years). The vertical deviation of the paretic eye in primary position postoperatively was orthotropic for 2, hypotropic for 2, and overcorrected for 1.

This is a retrospective chart review of all pediatric patients with esotropia and a history of ventricular-peritoneal shunt placement seen by our pediatric ophthalmology service between January 2000 and December 2010. Sixteen patients between the age of 3 months and 5.6 years met study criteria. Nine were premature and all but one of the patients had developmental delay. Although all patients had a ventricular-peritoneal shunt, the diagnosis leading to shunt placement was intraventricular hemorrhage or congenital hydrocephalus in 75% of the patients. In all but 3 patients the hydrocephalus was diagnosed before the esotropia. Ten children had congenital esotropia and 6 had acquired esotropia. Eleven of the 16 children required glasses: 5 had a myopic prescription and 6 had a hyperopic prescription. Treatment of the esotropia resulted in 9 patients (56%) with successful ocular alignment (&lt;10 prism diopters) on their last visit: 7 underwent strabismus surgery and 2 were treated with glasses only. Of the 9 patients who had strabismus surgery, 6 had congenital esotropia and 3 had acquired esotropia.

The reliability of the final version was tested with the test-retest and internal consistency methods. The construct and criterion (concurrent) validity were also tested for the questionnaire. Then, 112 patients with strabismus completed the questionnaire 1 week before and 3 months after strabismus surgery. The Persian version showed high reliability and validity. The patients with preoperative diplopia had significantly poorer median preoperative total and functional scores than the patients without preoperative diplopia (p=0.04 and 0.009, respectively). In the cases with and without diplopia, the median total, psychosocial, and functional postoperative scores were significantly better than preoperative scores (p=0.01, 0.01, and 0.028, respectively, in diplopic cases, and p&lt;0.0001 for all scores in non-diplopic cases).

All patients included in this study suffered from acute exposure keratopathy and they all required chemodenervation of the levator muscle to induce a protective ptosis. Patients in group A received BTXA (Dysport) transcutaneously though the upper eyelid skin crease. Patients in group B received BTXA (Dysport) into the subconjunctival space at the superior border of the tarsal plate of the upper eyelid transconjunctivally. All subjects were closely monitored after BTXA injection and during each follow-up assessment the upper eyelid was lifted in order to uncover the effects on ocular motility. All patients had a follow-up of at least 1 year following injection of BTXA for their facial nerve palsy and its complications. In group A, 20 patients were included. Reduced upgaze occurred in 9 patients (45%). Five required treatment with a Fresnel prism or ocular occlusion to avoid intractable diplopia.

Larger deviations may require second surgeries. SOPT does not cause iatrogenic excyclotorsion and avoids surgery to a potentially much scarred inferior rectus area.

One hundred and forty patients fulfilled our criteria with a mean length of follow-up of 27 months. Thirty-three patients (23.6%) were symptom free following botulinum toxin injection alone and were discharged from the clinic, 50.5% of these after only 2 injections. Fusion was regained in 37.9%. The only factor associated with lack of restoration of fusion in the multivariate analysis was visual acuity in the injected eye. Complications were seen in 2.9% of patients.

Optical coherence tomography allows high-resolution in vivo imaging of the retina. Recent studies have shown characteristic foveal abnormalities in patients with albinism, PAX6 mutations, and isolated foveal hypoplasia. Arrested development of the fovea leads to foveal hypoplasia, which causes reduction in visual acuity. Previous studies have shown correlations between visual acuity and the degree of foveal hypoplasia. Furthermore, in achromatopsia a characteristic lesion has been described that is associated with cone photoreceptor degeneration. Patients with achromatopsia also have foveal hypoplasia, however with atypical features. The signs of photoreceptor degeneration were progressive, which suggests that gene therapy is likely to be most beneficial if given within the first few years of life. With the advent of high speed and ultrahigh resolution optical coherence tomography it is now possible to document reliably the stages of foveal development and cone photoreceptor degeneration. This will aid clinicians in diagnosis and predicting prognosis in patients with infantile nystagmus.","347":"The purpose of this study is the evaluation of fixation disparity curve (FDC) parameters with an instrument that includes a central fusion lock (the modified near Mallett unit) and another without one (the Wesson fixation disparity card) to determine which is useful for diagnosis of symptomatic from asymptomatic subjects. In this analytical-descriptive study, 100 students were selected randomly and divided into symptomatic and asymptomatic groups. FDC parameters were determined with the Wesson card and the modified near Mallett unit for each subject and compared in symptomatic and asymptomatic groups. Data were analyzed by Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney U, Spearman correlation coefficient and Chi-square tests. The mean slope, y-intercept, and x-intercept with the Mallett unit and the Wesson card were significantly different in the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups (p &lt; 0.001). Significant correlations were obtained between the Mallett unit and the Wesson card in y-intercept, x-intercept and slope (p &lt; 0.001). There was a significant difference in the distributions of fixation disparity curve types in the two symptom groups with the Mallett unit (p = 0.01) and the Wesson card (p = 0.002) by Chi-square test. Among symptomatic participants in this study, both Type I and Type III FD are more common than previously thought, but depend upon the method used to measure it. The x-intercepts were on average displaced in the base-in direction, y-intercepts were shifted in the exo direction, and the slopes were steeper with the Wesson FD card compared with the modified near Mallett unit. This may be related to the design of two devices. These differences were more significant in the symptomatic group.

Of the 3 types described in the literature, one involves accessory muscle fibers that are innervated by the III and\/or VI cranial nerves originating in the posterior orbit and inserting on the globe, optic nerve, or extraocular muscles. Although these structures do not cause specific symptoms that enable us to make a diagnosis, we must take them into account in patients with atypical restrictive strabismus. Computed tomography and, particularly, orbital magnetic resonance imaging are essential for correct diagnosis and treatment, as the only other way to diagnose this condition is through casual findings during surgery to correct strabismus. Our patient was a child who were initially diagnosed as Duane syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an anomalous unilateral orbital structure that limited all ocular movements except adduction, and possibly contributed to globe retraction.

Two patients underwent a single injection, three patients 2 injections, and one patient 3 injections. Complications included transient ptosis and a vertical deviation. Mean follow-up from last BTXA injection was 16 months. At last follow-up, 4 of the 6 patients were orthotropic and stereopsis was present in 4 of 5 patients old enough to cooperate with testing. One patient was treated with strabismus surgery following a single BTXA injection. BTXA is an efficacious treatment for consecutive esotropia in children.

All respondents had visual acuity and refraction testing. Anisometropia was defined as the absolute interocular difference in the spherical equivalent based on non-cycloplegic refraction. The prevalence rates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of anisometropia were determined based on cut points of 0.5 diopter (D), 1.0 D, and 2.0 D or more, and we used the 1.0 D cut point to examine associations.

Accommodative amplitude and near-point convergence were assessed, together with best-corrected visual acuity (VA). A questionnaire was answered regarding possible problems at school. Binocular accommodation (P = 0.03) and convergence (P = 0.003) were significantly poorer in prematurely born children. Accommodation was correlated to neurological findings in the preterm group, but not to the degree of prematurity or stage of ROP. Regarding convergence there were no correlations to neurology, stage of ROP, or degree of prematurity. For neither accommodation nor convergence were any correlations with distance and near VA found. Preterm children had a higher prevalence of school problems, and there was an association with poor accommodation. Prematurely born children had poorer accommodation and convergence than full-term children, but no association with near VA was found.

Their data are matched against findings on advanced language development in blind children (age range: from 6 to 10 years; N = 12) and hearing-impaired and deaf children (age range: from 5 to 11 years; N = 20). The data give evidence that language acquisition in sensory-impaired children follows the same overall developmental path with respect to macrostructural changes and the succession of phase-shifts. System-specific temporal discrepancies expressed in protracted phase-shifts and delayed increases of variability are most evident in the early phases. Self-organizing maps (SOMs) help to visualize individual and group-specific variation.

A hypothetical model is presented in which both conditions are explained. The basic organization of the oculomotor system is most likely monocular and synchronous eye movements may have developed by neuronal coupling of the symmetrical oculomotor structures. The vertical dissociation of both eye movement disorders is explained by insufficiently developed neuronal coupling between the superior colliculi.

Here we provide objective evidence that they do, by reviewing quantitative data from a number of studies comparing their performance with that of matched normally sighted subjects on a range of everyday visuomotor tasks. Because in real life, these tasks (grasping objects, walking, driving, reading) are habitually performed with both eyes open, our focus is on their binocular skill deficits, rather than those with their amblyopic eye alone. General findings are that individuals with abnormal binocularity show impairments in critical aspects of motor control--movement speed, accuracy or both--on every one of these activities, the extent of which correlates with their loss of stereoacuity, but not the severity of their amblyopia. Impairments were especially marked when the task was time-limited or novel. Implications are that children and adults with severely reduced or absent binocularity may be accident-prone when required to respond rapidly to unexpected situations and that amblyopia management should focus more attention on evaluating and restoring stereoacuity and stereomotion processing.","386":"To develop a treatment for amblyopia based on re-establishing binocular vision. A novel procedure is outlined for measuring and reducing the extent to which the fixing eye suppresses the fellow amblyopic eye in adults with amblyopia. We hypothesize that suppression renders a structurally binocular system, functionally monocular. We demonstrate that strabismic amblyopes can combine information normally between their eyes under viewing conditions where suppression is reduced by presenting stimuli of different contrast to each eye. Furthermore we show that prolonged periods of binocular combination leads to a strengthening of binocular vision in strabismic amblyopes and eventual combination of binocular information under natural viewing conditions (stimuli of the same contrast in each eye). Concomitant improvement in monocular acuity of the amblyopic eye occurs with this reduction in suppression and strengthening of binocular fusion. Additionally, stereoscopic function was established in the majority of patients tested. We have implemented this approach on a headmounted device as well as on a handheld iPod. This provides the basis for a new treatment of amblyopia, one that is purely binocular and aimed at reducing suppression as a first step. ","387":"Amblyopia is a common visual disorder that results in a spatial acuity deficit in the affected eye. Orthodox treatment is to occlude the unaffected eye for lengthy periods, largely determined by the severity of the visual deficit at diagnosis. Although this treatment is not without its problems (poor compliance, potential to reduce binocular function, etc) it is effective in many children with moderate to severe amblyopia. Diagnosis and initiation of treatment early in life are thought to be critical to the success of this form of therapy. Occlusion is rarely undertaken in older children (more than 10 years old) as the visual benefits are considered to be marginal. Therefore, in subjects where occlusion is not effective or those missed by mass screening programs, there is no alternative therapy available later in life. More recently, burgeoning evidence has begun to reveal previously unrecognized levels of residual neural plasticity in the adult brain and scientists have developed new genetic, pharmacological, and behavioral interventions to activate these latent mechanisms in order to harness their potential for visual recovery. Prominent amongst these is the concept of perceptual learning--the fact that repeatedly practicing a challenging visual task leads to substantial and enduring improvements in visual performance over time. In the normal visual system the improvements are highly specific to the attributes of the trained stimulus. However, in the amblyopic visual system, learned improvements have been shown to generalize to novel tasks. In this paper we ask whether amblyopic deficits can be reduced in adulthood and explore the pattern of transfer of learned improvements. We also show that developing training protocols that target the deficit in stereo acuity allows the recovery of normal stereo function even in adulthood. This information will help guide further development of learning-based interventions in this clinical group.","388":"We review the findings of trials of mainstay amblyopia treatment conducted within the last 5 years. These have confirmed that an initial period of full-time refractive correction is beneficial in all types of amblyopia. Adopting this practice may allow up to 30% of children to avoid any further treatment. Studies that have investigated the role of atropine occlusion as a first-line treatment for amblyopia have shown \"weekend atropine\" to be as effective as patching for children with both moderate and severe amblyopia. Where patching is prescribed, 2-4 hours\/day of occlusion appears sufficient to provide an optimum outcome for the majority of children, although those over 6 years tend to require a larger dose to achieve best outcome, their amblyopia being more resistant to treatment. Educational interventions such as cartoons and written and video explanations of treatment aimed at improving compliance appear to raise it to a therapeutic level in those who may otherwise have poor compliance or drop out from treatment. Formal, evidence-based practice guidelines for the management of amblyopia have emerged although their adoption by practitioners, at least in the United Kingdom, has been questioned.","389":"Human amblyopia has been modeled in a number of mammalian species in physiological, anatomical and behavioral terms for nearly 50 years, and insights from these studies have both offered explanations of observations made in humans and resulted in improved prevention and refined treatment.

The main manneristic or stereotypic behaviors associated with visual impairment are eye-manipulatory behaviors, such as eye poking and rocking. The degree of visual impairment influences the type of behavior exhibited by visually impaired children. Totally blind children are more likely to adopt body and head movements whereas sight-impaired children tend to adopt eye-manipulatory behaviors and rocking. The mannerisms exhibited most frequently are those that provide a specific stimulation to the child. Theories to explain these behaviors include behavioral, developmental, functional, and neurobiological approaches. Although the precise etiology of these behaviors is unknown, it is recognized that each of the theories is useful in providing some explanation of why certain behaviors may occur. The age at which the frequency of these behaviors decreases is associated with the child's increasing development, thus those visually impaired children with additional disabilities, whose development is impaired, are at an increased risk of developing and maintaining these behaviors. Certain manneristic behaviors of the visually impaired child may also help indicate the cause of visual impairment. There is a wide range of manneristic behaviors exhibited by visually impaired children. Some of these behaviors appear to be particularly associated with certain causes of visual impairment or severity of visual impairment, thus they may supply the practitioner with useful information.

Twenty-nine patients undergoing strabismus surgery were studied. Group 1 included twelve cases in whom Tisseel was used for closure and group 2 included seventeen cases in whom 7\/0 Vicryl was used. Severity of redness, watering, pain, and discomfort in opening eyes were evaluated postoperatively. In the first hour, severe pain was experienced in both groups without statistical significance; but in group 1, pain was less severe in the 12th and 24th hour (P &lt; .0001). After the first hour severity of watering was less in group 1 (P &lt; .0001). Discomfort in opening eyes was detected in fifteen patients in group 2 in the first 12 hours where only one case with fibrin glue had discomfort.

","397":"We describe a novel, simple, rapid technique for inferior oblique recession. Access to the muscle is gained through a peripheral radial conjunctival incision midway between the lateral and inferior recti. The anterior edge of the inferior oblique muscle is identified coursing parallel to the limbus on the undersurface of Tenon's capsule, at the apex of the exposure. A locking vicryl suture is placed 1 mm from the muscle insertion. The insertion is cut along the globe under direct vision and attached to the sclera 2 mm posterior and lateral to the lateral border of inferior rectus. The conjunctiva is closed with interrupted vicryl sutures. The technique described allows direct visualization of the muscle throughout the procedure. In addition, bleeding is usually avoided and tissue manipulation is minimized, thus ensuring good visibility throughout the procedure and minimizing the risk of scarring. Severence of the inferior oblique muscle insertion under direct vision, facilitated by good traction of the globe in the same meridian, affords a rapid minimally invasive approach to inferior oblique recession.

They were observed in their practice, received a structured questionnaire, and underwent a semi-structured interview. Finally, a short survey was sent to all working orthoptists in the Netherlands. Nine orthoptists working in non-native, low-SES areas and 23 working elsewhere in the Netherlands participated. One hundred and fifty-one orthoptists returned the short survey. Major discrepancies existed in conception, awareness, and attitude. Opinions differed on what should be defined as noncompliance and on what causes noncompliance. Some orthoptists found noncompliance annoying, unpleasant, and hard to imagine, others were more understanding. Many pitied the noncompliant child. Almost all thought that the success of occlusion therapy lies both with the parents and the orthoptist, but one third thought that noncompliance was not solely their responsibility. Patients' compliance was estimated at 69.3% in non-native, low-SES areas (electronically, 52% had been measured), at 74.1% by the other 23 orthoptists, and at 73.8% in the short survey. Actions to improve compliance were diverse; some increased occlusion hours whereas others decreased them.

A retrospective analysis of all operated cases of concomitant large-angle strabismus (50 prism diopters or more) during a 1.5-year period was performed from patient's case files. A successful outcome of surgery was defined as deviation within 10 prism diopters of orthophoria\/tropia for both distance and near. Fifty patients met the inclusion criteria. The overall success rate was 60%, with the esotropia group having a higher success rate (68.75%) than the exotropia group (44.45%).

Thirty-three patients had two-muscle surgery with a success rate of 57.58%, while 17 patients had three-muscle surgery with a success rate of 64.71%, the difference being statistically insignificant. There was no statistically significant difference between the various age groups analyzed for overall success rate, suggesting that age group is not a factor for positive outcome in large-angle strabismus surgery.

Neuroanatomical data and clinical characteristics of DVD, however, contradict this hypothesis. From these data a new hypothesis arises: corticotectal lateralization.

Unfortunately, there is a lack of research into which method of treatment cessation is the most appropriate once therapy has been completed. The purpose of this study is to investigate if the cessation method affects the recurrence rate of amblyopia. This study was a prospective randomized clinical trial of 20 subjects who were wearing full-time occlusion and were at the end point of their therapy. The subjects were randomized into one of two groups: abrupt cessation or therapy tapering. All subjects were followed for 3 consecutive 4-week intervals, for a total of 12 weeks, to assess the short-term recurrence rate of amblyopia. Subjects who were in the tapered group had their occlusion reduced from full-time occlusion (all waking hours minus one) to 50% of waking hours at study enrollment (i.e., from 12 hours\/day to 6 hours per day); occlusion was reduced by an additional 50% at the first 4-week study visit (i.e., from 6 hours\/day to 3 hours), with occlusion being discontinued completely at the week 8 visit. All subjects who were in the abrupt cessation group had their full-time occlusion discontinued completely at the start of the study (i.e., from 12 hours\/day to none). Additional assessments were also conducted at week 26 and week 52 post-therapy cessation to determine the longer term amblyopia regression rate. For the purposes of this study, recurrence was defined as a 0.2 (10 letters) or more logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) loss of visual acuity. A recurrence of amblyopia occurred in 4 of 17 (24%; CI 9%-47%) participants completing the study by the week 52 study end point. There were 2 subjects from each treatment group who demonstrated a study protocol-defined recurrence. There was a 24% risk of amblyopia recurrence if therapy was discontinued abruptly or tapered in 8 weeks. In this small sample, the assigned cessation method did not affect the rate of amblyopia recurrence. It is recognized that the smaller sample size in our study prevents us from making definitive conclusions on the potential role that abrupt cessation has on the regression rate of amblyopia. The sample size was too small to reach an acceptable level of statistical power; therefore the generalizability of the findings to the broad population of all patients with amblyopia requires continuing research.

Superior rectus and superior oblique muscles were severed brutally, so that repairing was not possible. On the day after exploration and primary suturation, there was 25 prism diopters (PD) hypotropia and 15 PD esotropia in his right eye with severe limited supraduction and abduction. His major complaint was a large vertical diplopia which resolved partially with the prismatic glasses prescribed. After 6 months follow-up, medial rectus and inferior rectus recession was performed in the right eye. The patient had a limited but improved abduction after the operation. He was orthotropic and had a single binocular vision in the primary position. In suspected extraocular muscle ruptures, orbital imaging methods and surgical exploration should be considered promptly.

The total number of patients in this series was 28 (12 male, 16 female). The main presenting symptoms were diplopia (14) or cosmetically objectionable strabismus (11). Three had symptoms unrelated to strabismus and were excluded from further analysis. The most common strabismus findings were large angle exotropias (mean 47 prism diopters), half of which had associated vertical deviations. Strabismus management consisted of prisms (3), occlusion (3), botulinum toxin (7), and surgery (8). Two patients were offered surgery but were deemed unfit for general anesthesia, and a further 2 declined surgery or defaulted follow-up. Three had no active treatment for strabismus. The most effective procedure for exotropia was maximal, bilateral lateral rectus recessions (8 mm or 17 mm from the limbus) with medial rectus resections (7 mm) using adjustable sutures. Patients who had less than maximal horizontal muscle surgery were inevitably undercorrected, even in the early postoperative period. Long-term stability of measurements was rarely achieved, with either progressive increase in the angle of exotropia, or with new onset vertical deviations. In selected patients with CPEO and exotropia, maximal bilateral surgery significantly improves ocular alignment and may relieve symptoms of diplopia, but due to the progressive nature of the disease, strabismus often recurs. Toxin can be invaluable in maintaining a satisfactory ocular alignment in patients with residual or progressive exotropias, who have undergone maximal horizontal rectus muscle surgery or multiple previous strabismus procedures.

Eighty-eight patients were identified, 48 females and 40 males. The average age at presentation was 29 years, range 5 to 68 years. The left eye was affected in 50 (57%) patients and 21 (24%) patients were affected bilaterally. The average angle was 28.6 +\/- 18.4 Delta for the esotropic patients and 32.5 +\/- 14.5 Delta for the exotropic patients. In 58 patients the medial rectus was injected, in 30 the lateral rectus. As a result of the outcome of botulinum toxin, 41 (46.5%) patients proceeded to surgery; 12 (14%) continued with maintenance toxin. Forty-seven (53%) demonstrated a long-term reduction in deviation. Transient complications were ptosis in 11 patients and induced vertical deviation in 10. This is the first study to explore the diagnostic role of botulinum toxin in Duane syndrome. It is a safe treatment that may also offer long-term benefits. ","438":"To report a case of sixth nerve palsy after intravitreal bevacuzimab injection. After intravitreal bevacizumab injection in a 64-year-old man, the patient admitted to our clinic with the complaint of diplopia. A complete ophthalmologic examination was done to clear the symptomatology of patient. Examination of ductions revealed marked limitation of abduction of the right eye and full ductions of the left eye, consistent with right lateral rectus paralysis. Although intravitreal bevacizumab injections are generally well tolerated, it is possible that some serious systemic adverse events may occur. For this reason, patients must be closely monitored following these injections. ","439":"The study aimed to audit the results of horizontal strabismus surgery in the hospital's pediatric ophthalmology department in Maharashtra, India. Medical records of strabismus surgeries done over 3 years were collated. Preoperative visual acuity, deviation, refraction, and orthoptic evaluation were noted as well as post-operative residual deviation and patient satisfaction. Post-operative residual deviation &lt; or = 10Delta was considered good outcome, 11-20Delta borderline, and &gt; 20Delta was considered poor outcome. The surgeons were briefed about their results periodically and the cause of poor outcomes discussed. Between March 2004 and December 2007, 529 children were operated upon, of whom 461 (87.1%) completed the 6-week follow-up. Average age was 9 years 7 months (range 1-19 years). 260\/461 (56.3%) patients had good, 100\/461 (21.6%) borderline, and 101\/461 (21.9%) had poor outcome. 133\/231 (57.6%) cases of esotropia and 127\/230 (55.2%) cases of exotropia had a good outcome, while the poor outcome was 50\/231 (21.6%) and 51\/230 (22.1%), respectively. Bilateral medial rectus recession for esotropia had 25\/56 (44.6%) good outcome and 15\/56 (26.7%) poor outcome, while recess-resect procedures (R\/R) for esotropia had 108\/175 (61.7%) good and 35\/175 (20%) poor outcome (p = 0.062). Bilateral lateral rectus recession for exotropia had 30\/56 (53.6%) good and 12\/56 (21.4%) had poor outcome, while for recess-resect procedures for exotropia it was 97\/174 (55.7%) good and 39\/174 (22.4%) poor outcome (p = 0.97). The result did not significantly change over 3 years. 433\/461 (93.9%) expressed satisfaction about the surgery on 6-week follow-up. Large pre-operative deviations and amblyopic eyes accounted for 63\/101 (62.3%) cases of poor outcome. Fifty-seven patients recorded an improvement in stereopsis. Recess-resect procedures had better outcome as compared to bilateral recess procedures, but it was not statistically significant. Clinical audit helped maintain and improve good outcome over the 3 years. ","440":"To determine the prevalence of ketamine side effects in children receiving botulinum toxin injections for strabismus under ketamine anesthesia and to establish the prevalence, severity, and duration of ptosis in these children. Children who had undergone ketamine anesthesia for botulinum toxin injections (1999 to 2006) to correct strabismus were identified in a retrospective review. A questionnaire to establish occurrence of nightmares, sleepless nights, hallucinations (ketamine side effects), or ptosis (botulinum toxin side effect), was sent to parents or guardians. Details of side effects were obtained by telephone and the patients' medical records were analyzed. Questionnaires were sent to 113 patients (total of 130 injections). Ninety-seven (114 injections) completed questionnaires were returned. Emergence reactions were experienced by 12 patients (12.4%). Two children experienced sleepless nights, nightmares, and hallucinations. The remaining 10 experienced one side effect only. Eighteen children had ptosis at their 2-week follow-up appointment, most which resolved within 6 weeks. There were no life-threatening or sight-threatening adverse events. Botulinum toxin injection under intravenous ketamine anesthesia can safely be used for children. Ketamine anesthesia may be associated with side effects, namely hallucinations and sleep disturbances. ","441":"To evaluate the short-term dose effect of botulinum toxin in manifest and intermittent horizontal strabismus types. Dysport of 2 international units was injected into a single muscle in cases of constant esotropia and exotropia plus decompensating esophoria and exophoria. Electromyography (EMG) signal was recorded during each procedure. Angle of deviation was measured in each case pretreatment and posttreatment at 2 weeks by prism cover test for near and distance fixation. Change in deviation was evaluated by nonparametric statistical evaluation. Sixty-six patients were reviewed: 30 males and 36 females. The mean age was 24 years (1-79: SD 20.4). Of the 66 patients, 28 had botulinum toxin to the right eye and 38 had it to the left eye. Thirty-nine had eso deviations (19 constant, 20 intermittent) and 27 had exo deviations (12 constant, 15 intermittent). EMG signal was classed as excellent (30%), good (26%), low (6%), or absent (38%). Percentage net change in angle of deviation was 52% to 60% for eso and exo deviations at near and distance fixation. No association was found in extent of reduction of angle of deviation for type of deviation, presence of constant or intermittent deviation, eye injected, or EMG signal. All changes in angle of deviation were significant. Larger pretreatment angles of deviation did not preclude significant changes in angle of deviation using botulinum toxin and significantly greater change in deviation was seen in pretreatment angles greater than 20PD.

During the \"straight\" period the patient has a fully controlled heterophoria for all distances, with very good fusion and stereopsis. During the \"squinting\" period the patient has a constant manifest strabismus for all distances, with no demonstrable fusion and stereopsis. We describe 2 cases of alternate day exotropia. One patient requires strabismus surgery to obtain constant binocularity. The second patient underwent surgery for an intermittent exotropia and subsequently developed an alternate day exotropia. The condition very gradually reduced over the years and the patient is now fully binocular. We report the first 2 cases of cyclic exotropia in non-Japanese female children presenting from about 1 to 3 years of age, without ocular or systemic pathology. ","445":"To assess the practice of the use of an opaque intraocular lens (IOL) for intractable diplopia in the UK. A questionnaire was sent to 892 consultant ophthalmologists in practice requesting information on the treatment of intractable diplopia with an opaque IOL. Respondents were asked whether they would consider using an opaque IOL for intractable diplopia. Information was gathered on the numbers of lenses implanted, the type of lens used, and whether the lens was implanted inside or outside the capsular bag. In addition, we asked for the causes of intractable diplopia, the success in eliminating diplopia, the use of postoperative pilocarpine, and whether postoperative surveillance was part of the follow-up protocol. Of the 481 completed questionnaires received, 72% would consider implanting an opaque IOL. A total of 48 surgeons had implanted 1 or more lenses. There were 97 patients who were implanted with an opaque IOL over the past 15 years. Strabismus, nerve palsies, and previous retinal detachment surgery with diplopia were the main indications. Pseudophakic lenses were used by 38 surgeons in the capsular bag, 6 used iris-supported phakic lenses, and 2 used phakic lenses in the anterior chamber angle. The use of postoperative pilocarpine was reported by 9 surgeons, and 6 surgeons used regular ultrasound fundal surveillance. Patients were reported to be completely asymptomatic at discharge by 31 surgeons, with 15 surgeons reporting patients who were still symptomatic postoperatively. Only 1 intraoperative complication was reported. An opaque IOL is a safe method for treating intractable diplopia. This survey confirms that its practice is widely accepted in the UK.

The gaze-evoked upward saccades disappeared at the age of 2 or 3 years. In addition, they had high-frequency, small-amplitude horizontal pendular nystagmus that remained. Among these infant boys were 2 pairs of maternally related half-brothers, 2 cousins, and 2 siblings. Visual acuity ranged from 0.1 to 0.6, ERG-amplitudes (both A- and B-wave) were reduced, and severe myopia was found in 5 cases. Eight boys had CACNA1F mutations, and 1 boy had a NYX mutation, compatible with incomplete or complete congenital stationary nightblindness (iCSNB or cCSNB), respectively. This points to a defective synapse between the rod and the ON-bipolar cell causing the motility disorder: CACNA1F is located on the rod side of this synapse, whereas NYX is located on the side of the ON-bipolar cell. The coexistence of horizontal and vertical nystagmus has been previously described in dark-reared cats.","448":"To identify the effect of infant hypermetropia on residual amblyopia in children remaining after treatment. 879 strabismic children had cycloplegic retinoscopy at the age of 6 months and later when strabismus was diagnosed. A total of 26 hypermetropes consistently wore glasses from the age of 6 months, and 305 other hypermetropes had their accommodation periodically assessed by dynamic retinoscopy before strabismus was diagnosed. The relation between the last known visual acuity after treatment and all other clinical findings was analysed using t-tests and regression analysis. Vision less than 6\/12 in nonfixing eyes was associated with infantile hypermetropia &gt; +5.0D, and in rare instances in excess of -3.0D of myopia. In hypermetropes only, anisometropia was associated with worse amblyopia. Astigmatism was associated with myopia and low levels of hypermetropia but not with worse vision. The vision of fixing eyes that were hypermetropic was significantly worse than that of emmetropic or myopic eyes. Wearing spectacles from the age of 6 months was associated with better vision in the nonfixing eye. Vision in the nonfixing eye of 19 hypermetropic heterotropes who started wearing glasses between 6 and 18 months of age also was better than that of those who started wearing glasses after 18 months of age. Insufficiency of accommodation was related to the degree of infantile hypermetropia, to worse vision and to failure to emmetropise. Difference in amplitude of accommodation between the eyes was largest in hypermetropes with anisometropia &gt; +1.50 D and was marginally associated with worse vision in microtropes who became anisometropic after infancy. Hypermetropia decreased more in fixing eyes than in nonfixing eyes, thereby causing anisohypermetropia to increase after infancy. This change was most pronounced in hypermetropic microtropes. Conversely, failure of fixing eyes to emmetropise was associated with an increase in their inability to accommodate and heterotropia. On the basis of these findings, severe residual amblyopia in children remaining after treatment could be explained by additional vision deprivation. It can be reduced by starting spectacle correction of hypermetropia before the age of 18 months. Anisometropia seemed the result of deficient emmetropisation. ","449":"We determined the vergence position of rest (horizontal component) in two sessions, 1 to 6 weeks apart. Each session contained 8 trials. Twenty observers with normal eyes looked through Risley prisms that allowed a continuous modulation of their strength. We asked the observers to look at a fully fusionable picture, and to adjust the prisms such that viewing appeared most relaxing. The viewing distances were 400 cm and 50 cm. The standard deviation among the 8 trials of each session, averaged over the two sessions, the viewing distances of 400 cm and 50 cm, and the 20 observers, was + or -1.4 prism dioptres (cm\/m). From the first session to the second, many observers changed the preferred prism significantly. At a viewing distance of 400 cm, 10 of 20 observers changed their preferred prism by more than 1.0 prism diopter, up to 3.3 prism diopters. At a viewing distance of 50 cm, 11 of 20 observers changed their preferred prism by more than 1.0 prism diopter, up to 5.1 prism diopters. The prismatic strength estimated as being most relaxing can be very variable. Before considering a prescription, the practitioner should determine whether the preferred prismatic strength remains reasonably stable. To ascertain this consistency, more than one session seems to be necessary. ","450":"To evaluate the prevalence of complications after low doses (&lt; 3 units) of botulinum toxin (BT) injection to horizontal extraocular muscles for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. A case record review was undertaken of patients treated with BT (Dysport) since 2000. Data were extracted for gender, age, diagnosis, number of BT injections, dose, recorded complications, and time to recovery. Two hundred eleven (211) cases were reviewed, 48.5% children, 51.5% adults (45.5% male, 54.5% female). Diagnoses included constant and intermittent esotropia and exotropia, decompensating esophoria, exophoria and microtropia, accommodative spasm, mechanical restrictions, and cranial nerve palsy. One hundred sixty-three (163) patients had one injection; 38 had two; 7 had three; 2 had four; 1 had six; for a total of 274 injections. BT dose was 1 unit in four cases; 2.5 units in two; 3 units in seven; and 2 units in the remainder. At 2 weeks follow-up, six cases had induced vertical deviation; three had subconjunctival haemorrhage. At 2 weeks, 23 cases had ptosis, but a further 10 cases had ptosis that had resolved by 2 weeks follow-up. All complications had resolved by 6 weeks follow-up. A low incidence of complications per injection (12.4%) was found particularly for induced vertical deviations (2%) and hemorrhages (1%). Incidence for ptosis was the highest (8.4%). Notably, 10 additional cases of ptosis had resolved before follow-up. Two children were given occlusion therapy to prevent the possibility of stimulus deprivation occlusion until ptosis resolution. ","451":"Our goal is to develop an accessible expert system (StrabNet) that will assist in the clinical diagnosis of vertical strabismus, form the basis of a teaching\/learning tool, and contribute to the audit process. Potentially, this model can be extended to other strabismus deviations. Vertical deviations were separated into eight classifications (diagnoses). An expert system based on architecture of artificial neural networks learned the patterns for each class of deviation based on 10 prism cover-test measurements (9 cardinal positions and near fixation). The expert system was tested with previously unseen and real-patient data. This system was extended to a reduced model requiring only six measurements (primary position, right, left, up, down gaze, and near fixation), and evaluated with real patient data. A freely available Web implementation is available on the Internet at www.StrabNet.com . The expert system was found to be highly accurate at diagnosing vertical strabismus (100% and approximately 96% for ten and six measurement models, respectively) from one of the eight classes. StrabNet is of demonstrable value in diagnosing commonly presenting vertical deviations from prism cover test (PCT) measurements. Its potential role in teaching and in audit is identified.

The purpose was to investigate if visually induced ocular torsion is maintained during continuous stimulation and to reinvestigate the effect of stimuli tilt angle. Eye movements were recorded in 19 healthy individuals using a 3-D video oculography system. One visual stimulus was used in the tests, a photographic image of a city scene with spatial clues relevant for body posture. The scenes were tilted counterclockwise around a central pivot point from 0 to 15 degrees (test A), from 0 to 30 degrees (test B), and from 0 to 45 degrees (test C). Each tilted stimulus position was held static for 4 min, 40 sec. A compensatory torsional response was found in all subjects and test conditions. No significant difference was found between the different stimuli tilt angles. The torsional response was not maintained but drifted back towards the reference position. Visually induced ocular torsion in response to a static tilted scene is not maintained, but drifts back towards the initial reference position. Higher cognitive functions such as imagination and attention certainly have an influence on the outcome. ","454":"Children presenting with strabismus and mixed (anisometropic\/strabismic) amblyopia are managed by a local protocol as per guidelines from the Royal College of Ophthalmologists. Decisions regarding intervention for occlusion are currently delayed until a 22 week review allowing for refractive adaptation, with intermediate reviews at 6 and 14 weeks. The purpose of this audit was to determine adherence to the protocol and the benefit of the 14 week review. We performed a prospective data collection of all children attending the orthoptic department with strabismus without pathology, both with and without unequal vision, from October 2007 to July 2008 managed using the protocol. 26 patients were eligible. Mean age at presentation was 3.3 years (1.4 to 6.5). Cycloplegic spherical equivalent (SE) mean was 2.6 dioptres (-2.25 to +7.25). Five patients failed to comply with the protocol; one patient was listed surgery, four patients commenced premature occlusion. At presentation 8 patients had equal vision (defined as &lt; 0.1 logMAR difference) between the two eyes or would only perform BEO vision, by week 14, over 60% were found to have a difference in vision between the eyes, despite refraction correction (mean 0.4 logMAR, range 0 to 1.4 logMAR). In a subgroup of patients (n = 8 at 6 weeks) with a small discrepancy of vision between the eyes (0.1 to 0.5 logMAR) there was no progressive worsening of vision during the period of observation and 50% of patients improved spontaneously, although two patients were lost to follow up. In the subgroup (n = 10 at 6 weeks) with a large discrepancy between the eyes (&gt; 0.5 logMAR), all patients ultimately required occlusion, and there was minimal improvement in only three patients. Recorded vision at 6 weeks is more informative for making treatment decisions than that recorded at presentation. The 14 week review confers no benefit to those with reliable and improving visual acuity. Those patients presenting with a large discrepancy in visual acuity do not improve after 14 weeks and we feel that these patients could be occluded at 6 weeks.

Case presentation and literature review of 16 Japanese patients with inferior rectus muscle aplasia. The age at presentation of 16 patients (9 females, 4 males, and 3 with unknown gender) varied from 7 months to 73 years (mean, 21.8 years). The inferior rectus muscle was absent on the right side in 10 patients, on the left side in 4 patients, and on both sides in 2 patients. Structural anomalies of the eye globe, such as microphthalmos, microcornea, and coloboma of varying degrees, were present on the ipsilateral side of the inferior rectus muscle aplasia in 4 patients and on the contralateral side in 1 patient. As surgical findings, anomalous inferiorly located insertion of the medial rectus muscle was discovered in 5 patients: 1 patient in association with microcornea and iris coloboma. Frequent surgical procedures were recession or tenotomy of the superior rectus muscle, combined with downward transposition of the entire or partial tendons of the medial rectus and lateral rectus muscle to the medial and lateral end, respectively, of the putative inferior rectus muscle insertion. The association of coloboma with inferior rectus muscle aplasia suggests that abnormal optic fissure closure during embryogenesis might underlie the muscle aplasia.

Six cases of severe high myopic strabismus fixus were considered with more than 90Delta esotropia and 25Delta to 30Delta hypotropia. The nasally deviated SR muscle and inferiorly shifted LR muscle were confirmed by MRI or CT scan. Supratemporal herniation of the globe from the muscle cone was also found by imaging. The LR and SR muscles were split in half from the insertion to past the equator. The lateral half of the SR muscle was united to the superior half of the LR muscle. Medial rectus muscle was recessed also. Motility gradually improved and by 8 weeks in four cases there was 5Delta to 15Delta residual esotropia and no hypotropia and mild limitation in abduction and elevation. In two cases due to marked residual esotropia, we performed a second operation, and 2 months later residual esotropia was mild. In highly myopic patients, if the deviant paths of the LR and SR muscles are demonstrated by MRI or CT scan, the surgical method described is effective and recommended. ","459":"Transection of an extraocular muscle can occur from orbital and facial trauma, or as a complication of surgery. The injury can occur either near the muscle insertion or in the muscle belly. Identification of the proximal end of the muscle in the orbit may be difficult, especially if the transection occurs a farther distance from the insertion, and, in these cases, the muscle is often considered lost. We present two patients who suffered from traumatic transections of an extraocular muscle more than 10 mm from the insertion. Both patients underwent transconjunctival orbitotomy to retrieve and secure the severed extraocular muscle. Both patients achieved good primary gaze alignment postoperatively. Preoperative imaging should be considered in cases of traumatic extraocular muscle transection.","460":"","461":"To analyze the effectiveness of botulinum toxin injection for convergence spasm. Review of the Toxin Clinic database to identify patients who had undergone botulinum toxin injection to the medial rectus muscle for convergence spasm. There were 11 females and 6 males. Average age at treatment was 34 years (range 12-57 years). All patients had a variable esotropia, ranging from 10 to 90+ prism diopters but most could demonstrate some binocular function. All patients had convergence spasm, pupil miosis, and diplopia. Previous treatment included surgery, atropine, plus lenses, and occlusion. Fourteen patients (82%) were temporarily overcorrected after their first injection. Three patients (18%) were symptom free after just one injection and were subsequently discharged, all having been temporarily overcorrected. Seven patients (41%) continue with botulinum toxin on a regular basis, with or without occlusive contact lens, to remain symptom free, two being discharged after the third and fifth injections symptom free. Seven patients found no benefit from this treatment and so were discharged from the clinic or did not attend for follow-up appointments. Our rather extensive experience with these patients has led us to conclude that in some patients convergence spasm may be a type of dystonia, and may like other dystonias be suitable for botulinum toxin treatment.

In 31 consecutive patients, previously unoperated horizontal rectus muscles were photographed intraoperatively. Major and minor anterior ciliary arteries (ACAs) were counted from the photographs by a masked independent observer and compared between medial and lateral rectus muscles. Cross sections from medial and lateral rectus muscle resection specimens were stained for elastin to quantify arterial volume in the distal tendons. Twenty lateral and 22 medial rectus muscles from 31 patients were included. There was no significant difference in the mean number of major anterior ciliary arteries between lateral rectus muscles (2.25 +\/- 0.79, range 1-4) and medial rectus muscles (2.05 +\/- 0.65, range 1-3) (p = 0.46). The mean number of minor anterior ciliary arteries was 6.7 in both medial and lateral rectus muscles (p = 0.97). Resected rectus muscle tendons showed no significant difference between lateral and medial rectus muscles for arterial vessel number or cross-sectional area. These results show the contribution from the lateral rectus muscle to the anterior segment circulation may be more robust than is commonly taught.

Excluded were cases of slipped muscles, muscle transpositions, and concurrent cyclovertical procedures. A total of 135 patients of mean age 40 years (range 6-72) were operated with a mean preoperative angle of deviation -40Delta (range -12 to -90). Five were treated with fixed sutures and the rest with adjustables. The surgery included preplanned lateral rectus recessions of mean 6 mm (range 2-9) and maximal possible medial rectus advancements with or without resections of mean 5.6 mm (range 2-11), intraoperatively adjusted to give a resistance of +1 to +2 for abduction on forced duction test (FDT). Adjustable suture patients were seen 4 to 6 hours after surgery and underwent further adjustment, if needed, to achieve the target angle. A further review took place at 2 weeks and 2 months. Children remained under follow-up till 8 years of age. Forty percent needed postoperative adjustment. The mean postoperative angle at final measurement was -2Delta (range +25 to -45).

Many factors, however, may potentially influence the outcome of strabismus surgery for intermittent XT. This study aimed to investigate factors associated with the recurrence of an exo-deviation following horizontal muscle surgery for intermittent XT of the divergence excess type. We retrospectively reviewed the medical histories of patients who underwent surgery for the correction of intermittent XT between January 1998 and June 2005. The factors analyzed were as follows: sex, age of onset, age at initial surgery, family history, size of preoperative deviation, near binocular single vision, amblyopia, oblique dysfunction, refractive error, type of surgery, and postoperative alignment. Eighty-nine patients were included in the final analysis. Of these, 19 demonstrated recurrence of their deviation. The mean follow-up period was 2 years. None of the factors analysed appeared to influence the outcome of intermittent XT surgery. We found that no single factor influenced patients' responses to the surgical treatment of intermittent XT. To address controversies and improve the evidence base regarding surgical intervention of this condition, randomized controlled trials are needed and justified because the results indicate that it would be relatively safe to randomly allocate patients to groups who could receive differing treatments so as to determine optimum management strategies. ","465":"Consecutive exotropia is commonly the result of a surgical correction of a primary esotropia but may develop spontaneously. This study examines the clinical characteristics of patients who have developed a spontaneous consecutive exotropia and relates the key features to previously reported findings. Patients were identified by routine clinical practice from May 2000 to December 2003 by retrospective case note analysis. Patients that presented with an esotropia that became an exotropia (without surgery or botulinum toxin A) were included. This study consisted of 14 patients who presented with an esotropia from early weeks of life to almost 4 years. No patients were undergoing occlusion treatment at the onset of the exotropia and no subject had dense amblyopia. The most common characteristics included (1) age of onset of esotropia of 24 months or less; (2) hypermetropic refractive error of +5 DS mean spherical equivalent; (3) lack of binocular single vision. The results highlight the variability of the condition with no single consistent finding, with the lack of binocular single vision, early onset esotropia, and high hypermetropia being common findings. Amblyopia was not found to be an important characteristic. ","466":"The range of monocular excursions can be determined by several different methods, including the Aimark Perimeter, Synoptophore and Modified Goldman Perimeter. However the relationship between these tests is poorly understood. This is a prospective, cross-sectional study to compare the extent of monocular excursions by three methods. For each eye, the Goldman and the Synoptophore measured 8 axes, and the Aimark measured 12. Each assessment was timed. The results for direct elevation of the right eye are analyzed and comparisons made by the Bland-Altman analysis. One hundred and fourteen patients were recruited: 64 with abnormal eye movements and 50 with no ocular motility restrictions. The mean +\/- SD rotations in degrees were Aimark 50.6 +\/- 12.4, Synoptophore 24.6 +\/- 5.78, and Goldman 40.6 +\/- 9.14. The Bland-Altman plots showed the mean bias was highest when comparing the Synoptophore to the Aimark (-26 +\/- 11.71) where the bias was inversely proportional to the rotation. The mean +\/- SD times per axes in seconds were Aimark 16.38 +\/- 4.62, Synoptophore 20.98 +\/- 57.23, and Goldman 16.16 +\/- 9.76. There was no significant difference in time taken between the tests (ANOVA, p = 0.50). There is considerable variation between these three methods for measurement of monocular excursions, but the difference in the time taken is accounted for by the variation in the number of axes assessed.

Laterality of stroke was right sided in 48%, left sided in 40%, and bilateral in the remainder. Eight percent of patients had normal visual status; 68.4% had eye movement impairment, 46.1% had visual field impairment, and 25.1% had low vision; and 20.5% had perceptual difficulties. Of these, 14.2% had inattention, 1.3% had difficulty judging depth and distance, 0.3% had color detection problems, 2.5% complained of hallucinations, and 2.2% of agnosia. A substantial proportion (92%) of patients referred with suspected visual difficulty had visual impairment. One fifth of patients referred had perceptual consequences to their stroke relating to inattention and cortical visual processing impairment. ","468":"The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of ophthalmic and neonatal factors on motor development in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) children. Sixty-four ELBW children at least 3 years of age were recruited. Visual acuity (VA) was assessed using the Teller acuity cards (TACs) and a letter test, if possible. A validated questionnaire assessing 25 fine (part A) and 20 gross motor (part B) skills was administered to the parents. Data were collected on retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) zone, intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), length of stay in hospital, and number of days on oxygen. Abnormal TAC acuity was associated with significantly lower scores on both parts A and B (part A: 21.5 versus 11.8, p &lt; 0.001; part B: 17.5 versus 13.2, p &lt; 0.001). Linear regression demonstrates a significant direct relationship between letter acuity and score A only (p = 0.03, r(2) = 0.179). Neither length of hospital stay, number of days ventilated, nor a history of IVH were associated with score A or B. However, the presence of ROP zone 1 was associated with a lower score A (p = 0.03). In this ELBW cohort VA and ophthalmic factors were the only factors associated with scores of development, particularly fine motor development.

Retrospectively, the records of patients who were diagnosed as anisometropic amblyopes were reviewed and 132 subjects who were between the ages of 5 to 8 at the time of diagnosis, with minimum follow-up of 3 years, were included in the study. Full ophthalmological examination was performed in every subjects and the information from every visit was retrieved for evaluation. Patients were divided into two groups according to the treatment they applied: patching and spectacle alone. The emmetropization process was similar to normal subjects after 3 years of follow-up, with a change of -0.71 D from the baseline spheric retinoscopy measurement in the spectacle group and -0.53 D in patching group (p &gt; 0.809). Patching and spectacle use did not change the decrease in hypermetropia. Astigmatism and anisometropia scores did not show any difference in two groups in the 3-year follow-up period. The emmetropization process is similar to normal population in anisometropic subjects and spectacle use and patching therapy have no effects on this process. The anisometropia score does not change with patching and stays relatively the same during the follow-up in childhood. ","470":"Binocular disparity, blur, and proximal cues drive convergence and accommodation. Disparity is considered to be the main vergence cue and blur the main accommodation cue. We have developed a remote haploscopic photorefractor to measure simultaneous vergence and accommodation objectively in a wide range of participants of all ages while fixating targets at between 0.3 and 2 m. By separating the three main near cues, we can explore their relative weighting in three-, two-, one-, and zero-cue conditions. Disparity can be manipulated by remote occlusion; blur cues manipulated by using either a Gabor patch or a detailed picture target; looming cues by either scaling or not scaling target size with distance. In normal orthophoric, emmetropic, symptom-free, naive visually mature participants, disparity was by far the most significant cue to both vergence and accommodation. Accommodation responses dropped dramatically if disparity was not available. Blur only had a clinically significant effect when disparity was absent. Proximity had very little effect. There was considerable interparticipant variation. We predict that relative weighting of near cue use is likely to vary between clinical groups and present some individual cases as examples. We are using this naturalistic tool to research strabismus, vergence and accommodation development, and emmetropization.","471":"The vergence system is an important element in human eye movement control. It comprises horizontal, vertical, and torsional components, the largest of which is convergence. Vergence performance is largely involuntary, although voluntary effort can influence convergence. Vergence function can be damaged by trauma or organic disease and, because convergence can be exerted voluntarily, it is susceptible to purposeful subjective disturbances. Vergence function is important in the maintenance of binocular control, being synonymous with motor fusion. The most common vergence dysfunction affects convergence and may be exhibited as an excess or weakness such as convergence spasm or paralysis. Divergence dysfunction generally presents with diminished function such as divergence weakness; vertical and cyclovergence disturbances are rare. An update is given on the neuroanatomical areas that subserve the vergence system. Clinical examples of the most common vergence disorders are presented. The influence of the vergence system on the diagnosis and management in common and less well-known clinical entities is described and discussed.","472":"","473":"","474":"","475":"","476":"","477":"Latest measurements of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) allowed the integration of the simulation of the Bielschowsky head-tilt test (BHTT) into the SEE++ software system. SEE++ realizes a biomechanical model of the human eye in order to simulate eye motility disorders and strabismus surgeries. With the addition of the BHTT it can now also be used for differential-diagnostic simulations of complex disorders (e.g., superior oblique palsies). In order to simulate the BHTT in SEE++, the user can freely choose the desired head-tilt angle from -45 degrees to +45 degrees. The chosen angle is shown in the 3D view with a human body model and is also used in the calculation of the Hess-Lancaster test. The integration of the BHTT offers an additional improvement of the possibilities for simulating eye motility disorders. Moreover, SEE++ allows the creation of a video of the \"virtual patient\" while tilting the head from one side to the other, which shows dynamic changes in the simulated Hess-diagrams. Comparisons of simulation results with patient-measured data showed a good correlation between the simulated and the measured data. Further comparisons with patient data are planned. ","478":"Many observers perceive a horizontal offset between a stereoscopically viewed object and a reference object in the fixation plane, although both objects are presented along a single line that projects through the midpoint between both eyes. These observers weigh one eye more than the other when determining the visual directions of stereo objects. This unequal weighting has been called ocular prevalence. We considered that ocular prevalence might be asymmetric, that is, different for crossed and uncrossed stereo disparities. We examined 11 subjects with normal eyes and a stereo resolution of less than 100 sec arc. A vertical line was dichoptically presented for 100 ms at crossed or uncrossed stereo disparities of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 min arc; this stereo object was judged in relation to a reference line in the fixation plane. Ten of the 11 subjects had ocular prevalence, but only 3 of the 10 showed a significant difference between crossed and uncrossed disparities. Ocular prevalence occurs frequently among observers with normal binocular vision, but only a minority of these observers show a difference between crossed and uncrossed disparities of the stereo object. It is unclear whether this difference bears clinical importance. ","479":"The paper presents selected results of a prospective multicenter study. The reported study was aimed at the evaluation of a software-based stimulation method of computer training applied in addition to occlusion as a complementary treatment for therapy-resistant cases of amblyopia. The stimulus was a drifting sinusoidal grating of a spatial frequency of 0.3 cyc\/deg and a temporal frequency of 1 cyc\/sec, reciprocally coordinated with each other to a drift of 0.33 deg\/sec. This pattern was implemented as a background stimulus into simple computer games to bind attention by sensory-motor coordination tasks. According to an earlier proposed hypothesis, the stimulation aims at the provocation of stimulus-induced phase-coupling in order to contribute to the refreshment of synchronization and coordination processes in the visual transmission channels. To assess the outcome of the therapy, we studied the development of the visual acuity during a period of 6 months. Our cooperating partners of this prospective multicenter study were strabologic departments in ophthalmic clinics and private practices as well. For the issue of therapy control, a partial sample of 55 patients from an overall sample of 198 patients was selected, according to the criterion of strong therapy resistance. The visual acuity was increased about two logarithmic steps by an occlusion combined with computer training in addition to the earlier obtained gain of the same amount by occlusion alone. Recalculated relatively to the duration of the therapy periods, the computer training combined with occlusion was found to be about twice as effective as the preceding occlusion alone. The results of combined computer training and occlusion show an additional increase of the same amount as the preceding occlusion alone, which yielded at its end no further advantage to the development of visual acuity in the selected sample of our 55 therapy-resistant patients. In a concluding theoretical note, a preliminary hypothesis about the neuronal mechanisms of the stimulus-induced treatment effect is discussed.

A custom slide was designed to quantify vertical angle kappa using the synoptophore. The measurement of the vertical angle kappa was performed in the eye that had the MT360, after the macular translocation surgery, extraocular muscle surgery (to correct torsion), and silicone oil removal, all in the same translocated eye. Information gathered included demographic, visual acuity, ocular motility, torsion, past ocular history, and synoptophore examination. Fifty-three subjects met the inclusion criteria (patients who underwent upward MT360, with silicone oil tamponade and extraocular muscle surgery from 3\/1999 to 6\/2003, and who had visual acuity better than 20\/200). Twenty-nine of these subjects were able to complete angle kappa measurement. The mean vertical angle kappa was 4.6 +\/- 1.4 degrees (n = 29) measured after MT360 and extraocular muscle surgery. The magnitude of vertical angle kappa did not correlate with either the amount of torsion after MT360, or the limitation of eye movement after both MT360 and extraocular muscle surgery. Vertical angle kappa can be measured using the synoptophore, and is increased above normal in eyes after MT360 and extraocular muscle surgery. ","482":"Fadenoperation has been proven to be an efficient method to treat convergence excess because it treats medial rectus (MR) overaction. We wanted to evaluate its efficiency in esotropias that totally disappear under anesthesia, regardless of the amount of deviation in waking hours. Included were 122 successive cases of children of ages 3 to 16 years with esotropia that completely disappears under general anesthesia (GA), representing 26.25% of all patients with esotropia that had surgery between August 2002 and July 2004. They all received a fadenoperation (retroequatorial strapping) of both MR without recession with a 5\/0 nylon suture. Patients were evaluated between 27 and 51 months postoperatively. Mean initial deviation was 21 prism dioptres (PD) at distance and 31 PD at near fixation. Of the 122 cases, 102 (83.6%) showed stable postoperative deviation between +8 and -8 PD, 7 showed exotropias (&lt; 20 PD), and 13 showed esotropias (&lt; 20 PD). These results were found without correlation to preoperative angle of deviation, ametropia, age at surgery, or association with vertical surgery. Our results suggest that fadenoperation of MR is an option to treat esotropias that disappear under anesthesia. The retroequatorial strapping we use seems safer than classical fadenoperation. We believe that the position of the eyes under GA should be considered for the surgical approach of esotropias.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first pathological report in an affected extraocular muscle of a patient with Parry-Romberg syndrome (PRS).

The author presents a successful treatment with botulinum toxin A injection in a case of diplopia following orbital decompression. Treatment with botulinum toxin A in the management of new-onset diplopia following orbital decompression has been suggested in a case that is not amenable to prism treatment and may eliminate strabismus surgery in some cases.","488":"The surgical management of decompensated strabismus is well described. Conservative treatment may employ the use of lenses and prisms. However, the use of botulinum toxin in decompensated squint is poorly documented. In these patients, with the potential for fusion, botulinum toxin may serve to stabilize the ocular alignment by bringing the images within the fusion range. The aim of this study was to assess the role of botulinum toxin in the treatment of decompensated squints. A retrospective case series involving 92 patients with decompensated squints between December 1990 and July 2005. Botulinum toxin was injected into the lateral rectus in 45 cases and into the medial rectus in 47. This was performed under local anesthesia in 74 cases, the remainder with ketamine anesthesia. Patients were assessed preoperatively at 2 weeks, 4 months, and a minimum of 12 months postoperatively. We defined successful treatment where the resultant stabilized deviation was less than or equal to 10 prism diopters with resolution of diplopia. In this study, 47 patients had a decompensated microesotropia and 45 had a decompensated exophoria. We found that 27 (29.3%) patients were asymptomatic following injection of botulinum toxin. Fourteen (15.2%) patients were better controlled and did not require further intervention. Subsequent surgery was performed in 45 patients (48.9%). Our results suggest almost half of those patients requiring treatment for decompensated squint benefit from botulinum toxin, without requiring surgical intervention.

A tailored approach to therapy using a combination of albendazole and steroids has been proposed. In this study, we have evaluated the clinical features and response of \"viable\" extraocular muscle cysticercosis to a tailored therapy with oral albendazole and steroids. A retrospective review of 32 patients with viable extraocular muscle cysticercosis was performed over a 3-year period. Ultrasound examination was performed at 3 weeks and 6 weeks for resolution of the cyst and clinical signs following treatment with oral albendazole and prednisolone. The clinical presentation, ocular alignment, motility restriction, and ultrasound examination details were recorded on serial visits. The mean age was 19.5 years. The most common presenting signs included limitation of ocular motility in 75%, conjunctival mass in 37.5%, diplopia in 28.1%, and proptosis in 28.1% of the patients, respectively. Ocular alignment evaluation revealed esotropia in 3.1%, exotropia in 12.5%, and hypertropia in 6.25%. Restriction of abduction and abduction in elevation was present in two patients each. The average time for complete resolution was 65.9 days. All the patients had resolution, except four, who had residual motility limitation but were asymptomatic.

A retrospective review of patients with long-standing exotropia secondary to third nerve palsy between 1996 and 2006 was carried out. Patients underwent large lateral rectus recession and medial rectus resection, combined with muscle traction sutures left in situ for 6 weeks. Thirty-three patients were treated, with a mean follow up of 16 months, ranging from 3 to 108 months; the age range was 3 to 66 years with a mean of 28.8 years. The cause of third nerve palsy was congenital in 39%, orbital or intracranial tumour 21%, trauma 15%, microvascular 9%, complication of neurosurgery 9%, and unknown in 6%. Pre-operative angle measurements ranged from 25 to 95PD exotropia, mean 60PD exotropia. After removal of the traction sutures, the eye maintained a good cosmetic position in all but 3 patients. Final angle measurement ranged from 16 to 40PD exotropia, mean: 14.5PD exotropia. Post-operative motility was extremely limited; very limited abduction was a good indicator of the final eye position. Complications included conjunctival hypertrophy, suture infection, and \"cheese wiring\" of sutures. Adducting traction sutures combined with large recess-resect of the horizontal rectus muscles are safe and effective in the management of long-standing strabismus due to third nerve palsy. ","495":"Monocular outcomes following severe ocular trauma are well described, but little is known about the effect of such injuries on binocular visual outcomes. We therefore report the binocular outcomes in a series of patients with such injuries. A retrospective analysis was undertaken of 6 patients with binocular problems following ocular injuries that were severe enough to warrant referral to the regional centre for vitreoretinal surgery. Mean age: 24 years. Mean follow-up: 2.9 years. All patients had 1 to 5 vitreoretinal procedures and the final visual acuities ranged from 6\/9 to 1\/60. Three patients regained some binocularity, 2 had intractable diplopia and 1 was 'suppressing' with prisms. The final visual acuity did not predict the binocular outcome. The time delay between the original injury and presentation at the motility service was between 3 months and 2.25 years. A good monocular visual outcome does not necessarily result in a satisfactory binocular visual outcome and a poor monocular visual outcome does not prevent severe binocular symptoms. Patients need to be counselled regarding this risk, which is an under-recognised problem. We also recommend that all such patients be referred promptly for a thorough orthoptic assessment.

There was a statistically significant improvement in the accommodative amplitude with both regimes of treatment [F(1, 17) = 18.84, p = 0.0004). Spherical flipper treatment was found to have an overall larger effect on accommodative function as compared with PLRA treatment. However, accommodation did not reach normal values after only 8 weeks of treatment.

While such patterns have been proposed to result from abnormal locations of the rectus muscle pulleys, others have suggested that A and V patterns may result from the disruption of fusion arising from exotropia itself. We prospectively performed Hess screen analysis in 20 exotropic patients (mean age 42 +\/- 16 yrs) before and two to six times after strabismus surgery, with a post-operative follow-up of 2-108 weeks. Primary surgery cases included medial rectus resection (2) and lateral rectus recession (10), combined resection\/recession (6), and superior oblique tenectomy (2). Alignment trends in primary and secondary gazes were analyzed for concomitant, pattern, and re-operated subgroups. Results were also analyzed by type of surgery performed. Mean pre-operative central gaze exotropia was 8.6 +\/- 7.1 degrees . Twelve cases were concomitant, while 8 exhibited A or V patterns. Twelve cases were re-operations. In initial surgery for concomitant exotropia, there was a well-defined exotropic drift approaching 5 degrees by 30 weeks post-operatively (linear regression, r = 0.43, p = 0.01). There was similar exo drift in re-operations. However, in pattern exotropia, post-operative drift was more variable, with mean esotropic drift of approximately 5 degrees (r = 0.18, p = 0.43). For all patients, final post-operative central gaze exotropia was 1.9 +\/- 5.8 degrees , with significant pattern collapse (p &lt; 0.01). Post-operative exo-shift of about 5 degrees occurs in initial and re-operated concomitant exotropia. However, in A and V patterns, there is no definitive direction of post-operative drift, suggesting that pattern strabismus may be more likely due to mechanical factors in the orbit than to neural factors associated with fusion disruption. Alignment following strabismus surgery differs in concomitant vs. pattern exotropia. Initial over-correction of about 5 degrees is advisable for concomitant exotropia, but should be avoided in A and V patterns.

The patient reported persistent diplopia. During the examination, exotropia and total absence of adduction were observed. Computerized tomography (CT) revealed a discontinuity at the left medial rectus. No orbital fractures were identifiable. The medial rectus was still attached to its anatomic insertion at the globe. The discontinuity was suggestive of laceration or rupture of this muscle at approximately 10-12 mm from its insertion. Surgical exploration revealed total rupture of the medial rectus at approximately 12 mm from its insertion. The posterior edge of the damaged muscle was found and sutured to its anterior edge with 6-0 polyglactin. The following day, the eyes were completely straight and the patient did not mention any signs of diplopia. Botulinum toxin injection into the ipsilateral lateral rectus was not necessary. After six months of follow-up, the patient still reported no diplopia. When muscular laceration is suspected after an orbital trauma, early CT is recommended.

Cases referred to one consultant neurologist (RAM) between 1991 and 2001 were reviewed. EOM weaknesses were quantified using an established scoring method in 49 patients with OMG and 49 age- and sex-matched controls, to differentiate age-related changes from those secondary to myasthenia. Bilateral and multiple EOM weaknesses were typical. Only 6 cases mimicked isolated cranial nerve palsy. Weakness of the elevator muscles (superior rectus and inferior oblique) was common in both the OMG and control groups, but the amount of weakness was significantly greater for the myasthenia group (p = 0.003). All control subjects had a normal range of depression. EOM weaknesses for the control group were not confined to the older subjects.

Motor alignment (less than 10 prism diopters) was achieved in 35.3% in group 1 and 75.8% in group 2. Visual success (20\/40 or better) was attained in 70.6% in group 1 and 57.6% in group 2. In group 1, when the angle of deviation was more than 80 prism diopters, poor motor alignment was achieved (25%).

A retrospective chart review of 119 patients treated during 1995-2004 was carried out. All patients had undergone a full ophthalmological examination. Inclusion criteria were: anisometropia &gt;1 diopter (spherical and\/or cylindrical), age at first examination between 2 and 8 years, no previous optical correction, absence of ocular and neurological disorders, absence of ocular motility disorders, and minimum follow-up of 2 years (mean 7.9 +\/- 4.3). Optical correction was prescribed at first visit and, at a second visit, the need for patching or penalization was evaluated. The results show a correlation between the degree of anisometropia and visual acuity at first visit (p &lt; 0.001). There were, however, several subjects with good levels of visual acuity despite considerable anisometropia, and also subjects where mild or moderate anisometropia was sufficient to induce a severe amblyopia. Compared to other types of anisometropia, anisomyopic patients appeared to have a higher degree of binocular vision recovery when corrected optically. First evaluation with the presence of good stereoacuity seems to be a prognostic indicator for amblyopic recovery. This study demonstrates the difficulty of developing a guideline for screening and treatment of anisometropia. Even though there seems to be a correlation between type and degree of anisometropia in a majority of patients, there is also a significant number of cases that do not follow this pattern. Another important observation is the presence of binocular vision at the first evaluation as a good prognostic indicator for visual recovery with optical correction alone, even without penalization therapy. ","512":"To describe the clinical features of patients from the Arabian Peninsula with Duane retraction syndrome (DRS). Retrospective chart review of patients referred to the King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia from 1982 to 2003 with a diagnosis of DRS. Patients having had prior strabismus surgery were excluded. Of 404 DRS patients, 347 (86%) were unilateral, 57 (14%) were bilateral, and 111 (27%) had amblyopia. There were 221 (55%) females and 182 (45%) males. The Huber classification was as follows: 315 (78%) Type I, 16 (4%) Type II, and 77 (19%) Type III. Of the 57 bilateral cases, 25 (44%) were female and 32 (56%) were male. Overall, the clinical features of DRS patients referred to a Riyadh eye hospital are similar to those reported in series throughout the world. However, our referred bilateral DRS patients are more commonly male. The clinical features of bilateral DRS deserve further worldwide study. ","513":"The aim of this study was to investigate the amblyopia treatment trends of Australian orthoptists and to identify variations or consistencies amongst treatment patterns. A questionnaire was distributed to all orthoptists who attended an annual national scientific conference. This questionnaire consisted of four case vignettes of amblyopic patients. Each was presented with a series of multiple-choice questions that orthoptists were required to answer. The questionnaire was completed by 46 orthoptists. Large diversity between orthoptists in their treatment application was found. This related mostly to the intensity of occlusion treatment. Treatment variability continues to exist between orthoptists. Further investigations evaluating the clinical decision making processes of clinicians in prescribing amblyopia treatment may help us to better understand the determinants that are considered when prescribing treatment. This would be useful in establishing best-practice guidelines. ","514":"To determine angle kappa values in strabismic individuals by means of a synoptophore. One hundred-and-eight strabismic subjects and 102 healthy subjects who served as a control group were enrolled in the study. A complete ophthalmologic examination, including determination of refractive status, best-corrected visual acuity measurement, slit-lamp biomicroscopic anterior segment evaluation, intraocular pressure measurements with a Goldmann applanation tonometer, and dilated fundus examination, was done on all study participants. Orthoptic examination included Krimsky prism reflex test, prism cover test, and duction tests. Strabismic patients were grouped into two categories according to their deviation types: exotropic and esotropic. A synoptophore (Clement Clarke, London, England) with a specially designed slide (Maddox test slide series A White Binding No: 16; Clement Clarke, London, England) was used to measure angle kappa. Of the 108 strabismic patients, 62 were males and 46 were females with a mean age of 23.38 +\/- 3.68 years (range: 8 to 82 years). There were 54 males and 48 females with a mean age of 32.74 +\/- 1.63 years (range: 7 to 68 years) in the control group. The exotropic group had significantly higher angle kappa values than either the controls or the esotropic group (independent sample t-test, p &lt; 0.001). None of the study participants had negative angle kappa values. Higher average kappa values were obtained in left eyes than in right eyes in all three groups (student t-test, p &lt; 0.01 for all groups). This study showed that exotropic patients have higher angle kappa values when compared to esotropic patients. Ophthalmologists must take the kappa angle into account when performing a Hirschberg or Krimsky test in young and uncooperative patients in order to improve surgical results. ","515":"To analyze the hypothesis that a reduction in sensitivity of the nasal visual hemifield would lead to an increase in the nasotemporal asymmetry of the visual field in patients under two years of age with early-onset convergent strabismus in comparison with normal patients. Both eyes of 66 patients - 33 esotropes and 33 normals - were studied. Patients' age ranged from 7 to 30 years. The examination consisted of a static perimetry using the Humphrey field analyzer 700 Series' Sita Standard program. An accentuation of the nasotemporal asymmetry was seen in the 33 esotropes and was related to an evident decrease of sensitivity in the most peripheral of the points studied along the horizontal meridian of the visual field. The quantitative sum of values of sensitivity of these points showed an average reduction of -15.71% in relation to the normal patients. There was a clear accentuation of the nasotemporal asymmetry of sensitivity in esotropes when compared to normal patients. There was no difference in sensitivity between the two eyes in either normals or esotropes. ","516":"Assessment of changes in saccade velocity may be useful in the early detection of thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO). Two eye-tracking systems were used to measure the velocity of saccadic eye movements in patients with TAO. Fourteen patients with active TAO and 14 healthy controls were enrolled for recordings with two eye-tracking systems: the magnetic scleral search coil (MSC; Skalar Medical) and the infrared reflection systems (IR; Orbit XY-1000). The MSC is generally considered the \"gold standard\" method for tracking of rapid eye movements. The IR system uses novel computer technology and is based on sampling of reflected infrared light from the surface of the eyes. Main sequence plots constructed from the recorded saccadic peak velocity and amplitude were analyzed for differences between patients and healthy controls. There were no significant differences between patients with TAO and healthy controls in the constructed main sequence plots of maximum velocity (V(MAX)) and the slope constant (C). Main sequence analysis of saccadic eye movements was not useful for detecting TAO in this experimental setting with either of the two eye-tracking methods. This is hypothesized to be due to compensation for the early orbital changes in TAO by neural adaptation of the saccades in the brain stem. The contradictory results between this and previous studies cannot be easily explained. We assume that there is a large heterogeneity in the saccadic eye movement performance in both the normal population and the TAO-population. Also, differences in the study design may cause dissimilar outcomes and hence incoherent conclusions. A non-invasive recording system that is able to generate a minimum amount of intra- and inter-individual variability and a study design where normal variability can be reduced to a minimum may be useful for future identification of early eye muscle changes in TAO. ","517":"Botulinum toxin has been used extensively in strabismus management. However, less is published regarding its use in small-angled manifest deviations or decompensating heterophorias, where an alternative to surgery is required. The aim of this review is to look at the use and effectiveness of botulinum toxin in managing small-angled manifest deviations, both constant and intermittent, and decompensating heterophorias. These types of strabismus can prove difficult to manage, as the angle present is often too small for surgery to be advised, but it may still cause a cosmetic or symptom-producing problem. A search of the English speaking literature was undertaken using Medline facilities as well as a limited manual search of non-Medline journals and transactions. A brief overview is provided for mechanisms of action, complications and dose effects, and diagnostic and therapeutic uses of botulinum toxin. The main reported complications are those of ptosis, induced vertical deviation and subconjunctival haemorrhage. The higher the dose, the greater the risk of complications. In small-angle strabismus, botulinum toxin is reported as particularly useful in cases of acquired and acute-onset esotropia in aiding maintenance of binocular vision. It is useful for additional management of surgically under- or over-corrected esotropia, particularly for those with potential for binocular vision. Less effect is reported in primary exotropia versus primary esotropia. It is the management of choice for consecutive exotropia, particularly when patients have had previous multiple surgery and where there is a risk for postoperative diplopia. Botulinum toxin has a specific role in decompensated heterophoria, allowing the visual axes a chance to 'lock on' and subsequently maintain binocular vision. Successful outcomes are reported after 1-2 injections only but the results are best in cases of heterophoria with little near-distance angle disparity.","518":"Congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles includes a wide spectrum of phenotypically heterogeneous disorders involving a single or multiple muscles. We present a case of congenital fibrosis of the inferior rectus associated with ipsilateral high myopia. First we tried to treat the hypotropia with inferior rectus weakening and superior rectus strengthening procedures, but this failed, so we proceeded with an ocular sling with fascia lata and a vertical Hummelsheim procedure. Hypotropia improved completely after the last operation and some degree of upward movement appeared. It seems that in a highly myopic globe with fibrotic muscles, classical methods for the correction of deviation may have poor response and more innovative procedures may be required to correct the deviation. ","519":"Amyloidosis is a multi-system disease characterised by the intracellular deposition of beta-pleated sheets of amyloid. It can involve the eye, orbit and ocular adnexae. We describe a case of a 58-year-old woman presenting to the eye department with external ophthalmoplegia, including the findings of various investigations. The spectrum of ocular amyloidosis is discussed. Amyloidosis may be the underlying diagnosis in some cases of external ophthalmoplegia with findings atypical to other systemic disease. ","520":"Ocular neuromyotonia is an uncommon disorder resulting from episodic involuntary discharge of ocular motor nerves producing sustained contraction of their respective ocular muscles. Ocular neuromyotonia manifests in brief spells of diplopia occurring spontaneously or after eccentric gaze holding. In most cases, ocular neuromyotonia follows months or years after radiotherapy to the sellar and parasellar region and involves the oculomotor nerve. We report two unusual cases of abducens nerve ocular neuromyotonia that followed radiation therapy of tumors in areas other than the sellar or parasellar region.","521":"We examined the effects of the Harada-Ito procedure on static and dynamic alignment in an adult with acquired bilateral superior oblique palsy (SOP). 3D eye movements were recorded before and six weeks after a bilateral Harada-Ito procedure. Superior oblique muscle (SOM) size and contractility were assessed with orbital imaging. On MRI, the left SOM was smaller than the right. Little contractile thickening was present in down gaze for either eye. Preoperatively, the patient had a hypertropia: 1.9 degrees right hypertropia (at down 20 degrees , left 20 degrees ) and 6.4 degrees left hypertropia (at down 20 degrees , right 20 degrees ). Postoperatively, the vertical tropia in all positions was &lt; 1 degrees . Listing's primary position rotated toward straight ahead for the RE but was unchanged for the LE. Postoperatively, for 40 degrees upward saccades peak dynamic intrasaccadic extorsion decreased by 2.2-3.2 degrees for both eyes and for 40 degrees downward saccades by 2.3-3.6 degrees for the RE but was unchanged for the LE. Saccade conjugacy improved and post-saccadic drift lessened for all vertical saccades. The Harada-Ito procedure produced striking improvements in static and dynamic alignment in bilateral SOP. Some changes were binocular (decreased post-saccadic drift, improved saccade conjugacy, less dynamic extorsion for upward saccades) but others were much greater in the less paretic eye (torsional gradients from up to down gaze, less dynamic extorsion for downward saccades). Both central adaptive and peripheral mechanical changes explain these findings. Our results also imply that the Harada-Ito procedure has more effect when there is residual function of the SOM. ","522":"The authors report the results of a retrospective review of patients who underwent nasal transposition of the vertical rectus muscles between 1997 and 2004. Eight patients were identified, 4 males and 4 females. There was an average age at surgery of 37 years, with a range from 8 to 79 years. The aetiologies included 6 patients with trauma to their medial rectus (4 following endoscopic sinus surgery) and 2 patients with paralytic medial rectus muscles secondary to 3rd nerve palsy. All patients underwent whole tendon transposition of the superior and inferior rectus muscles, with resection of both muscles in 7 cases, before reattachment adjacent to the upper and lower borders of the medial rectus, respectively. One patient had a reduced amount of resection and this was combined with inferior oblique disinsertion and traction sutures. All patients had a reduction in deviation in the primary position and in 5 patients there was some improvement in adduction. A consequence of surgery was a degree of limitation of abduction, elevation and depression in some patients. Overall, patients were satisfied with the improvement in their appearance.","523":"To identify the predictors for motor outcome and response to surgical treatment of primary exotropia. Taunton and Somerset Hospital, Somerset, United Kingdom. Retrospective analysis of the surgical treatment of primary exotropia performed in our department over a period of 12 years from April 1991 to May 2003. Case-notes of the patients who had surgical treatment for primary exotropia for the specified period were identified by a hospital computer database (MDI coding). All case-notes were reviewed and the following data were recorded and used for statistical analysis: age at the time of surgery, type and severity of exotropia, presence of amblyopia, AV pattern and vertical deviation, the level of stereopsis, type of surgery, and motor and cosmetic results. The surgical outcome was determined as good motor outcome if tropia was within 10 PD of orthotropia. The response to surgery was derived from the difference between the preoperative and postoperative angle of deviation for distance per amount of muscle surgery in millimetres. A total of 124 cases were included in the study. Good motor outcome was achieved in 83 (67%) cases. There was a positive correlation between the preoperative angle of deviation at distance and dose response to surgery (r = 0.6 and p &lt; 0.001) and a negative correlation between average corrected visual acuity and response (r = -0.21 and p = 0.025). There was a statistically significant negative relationship between preoperative stereopsis and response to surgery (p = 0.02). Surgical treatment for exotropia is effective and the dose response is correlated to the preoperative angle of deviation and average visual acuity. Poor or no preoperative stereopsis was associated with better response to surgery.

Abduction limitation as well as narrowing of the palpebral fissure and globe retraction during attempted adduction (type I DURS) was demonstrated in the left eye. Additionally, a retinal coloboma was observed in the nasal inferior quadrant of the left eye. No other somatic or developmental abnormalities were observed and karyotypic analysis was normal. This is the first case of non-syndromic unilateral DURS associated with a contralateral major ocular malformation. This unusual clinical combination probably arose from the embryonic action of an eye-specific disruptor.","526":"We report the case of a 20-year-old female who developed progressive esotropia, which was associated with low myopia and restricted extraocular movements.","527":"This study investigated the ultrastructural changes in extraocular muscles under which radioactive plaques had been placed for the treatment of uveal melanoma. At the time of plaque removal, biopsies were taken from four horizontal recti that had been left in situ over plaques and from one lateral rectus muscle that had been disinserted before brachytherapy. Normal lateral recti from enucleated eyes were used as controls. Iodine-125 seeds were used with a mean total activity of 54.04 mCi, remaining for an average of 149.62 hours over the sclera. Muscles that had been left in situ over the radioactive plaques demonstrated a focal decrease in muscular tissue and increased fibroblasts and collagen. Electron microscopy showed increased collagen, loss of sarcoplasmic reticulum and swollen mitochondria. The disinserted muscle in the plaque group appeared unaffected. Despite the theoretical shielding properties of plaques, leaving an extraocular muscle over the plaque may lead to several non-specific ultrastructural changes. ","528":"To compare the postoperative alignment and sensory functions in patients with primary exotropia who had been operated at an early age (&lt; 7 years) with those in patients who had been operated at an older age (&gt; 7 years). In a consecutive retrospective cohort study, 112 patients who had had a surgical intervention for primary exotropia between 1997 and 2003 were evaluated for postoperative results. After applying criteria for eligibility, the group of patients was divided into two groups: those who had had surgery before the age of seven years (n = 24) and those who had had surgery after the age of seven years (n = 36). Age at surgery, preoperative alignment and sensory functions were correlated with the postoperative status. The follow-up was at least one year (1.0 year to 7 years; median: 2.3 and 3.5 years, respectively). Patients who had had surgery before the age of seven had significantly better alignment and sensory functions. The univariate logistic regression model confirmed a statistically significant association between motor outcome (exodeviation less than 10 diopters) and age at the time of surgery (before or after the age of seven; p = 0.002). In the multivariate model, the association between age at time of surgery and motor outcome was even stronger. The number of re-operations in the group operated before the age of 7 years was significantly less than in the group operated after the age of seven (2 versus 12, p = 0.023). The postoperative alignment and sensory functions for patients with primary exotropia who had had a surgical intervention before the age of seven years were, in this study, better than those in patients who had had surgery after the age of seven years. ","529":"Suturing is a time-consuming process and patients may suffer from sutures because of discomfort and tearing. This prospective study was done to determine the efficacy of an available commercial fibrin sealant for conjunctival wound closure following extraocular muscle surgery for strabismus. Fibrin sealant (Beriplast) was used in 48 conjunctival wounds of 25 patients with strabismus during the period February 2004 to May 2005. There were 12 males and 13 females, whose mean age was 9.3 years. No allergic reactions, chemosis or infections were seen, but suturing was necessary a day after surgery in 3 wounds of 2 cases (3\/48 eyes, 6%). All conjunctival wounds were healed at the end of the second week. The use of Beriplast for conjunctival wound closure is an effective method that is easy to apply and should be considered a solution in strabismus surgical practice. ","530":"To investigate heterotropia, heterophoria, head posture, nystagmus, stereo acuity, ocular motility and near point of convergence (NPC) in children with hydrocephalus treated surgically before 1 year of age. In addition, the effects of being born with hydrocephalus, the effect of the etiology of hydrocephalus, number of shunt revisions and the size of the ventricles on these variables were studied. A population-based study was performed in 75 children and the results were compared with the results of an age- and sex-matched group (comp group) (n = 140). Heterotropia 68.9% (comp group 3.6%; p &lt; 0.001), abnormal head posture 41.3% (comp group 0; p &lt; 0.001), nystagmus 44.0% (comp group 0; p &lt; 0.001), stereo acuity &lt; or =60'' 33.8% (comp group 97.1%; p &lt; 0.001) and ocular motility defects 69.7% (comp group 0.7%; p &lt; 0.001) were more common among children with hydrocephalus than in the comparison group. Children with overt hydrocephalus at birth had significantly more heterotropia (p = 0.0006), esotropia (p = 0.002), abnormal head posture (p = 0.02) and motility defects (p = 0.003) compared to those with hydrocephalus developing during the first year of life. The etiology, number of shunt revisions and the size of the ventricles had no significant effect on any of the investigated variables. Children with hydrocephalus surgically treated before the age of one year commonly present orthoptic abnormalities. The etiology of hydrocephalus, number of shunt revisions and ventricle size seem to be of minor importance compared with the age of onset of hydrocephalus with regard to the risk for orthoptic abnormalities. ","531":"To determine the outcome of patients treated for residual symptomatic hyperdeviations, in a tertiary referral centre, following a previous weakening procedure of the ipsilateral Inferior Oblique (IO) muscle in Superior Oblique (SO) palsy. A retrospective review of 37 patients seen over 6 years at one institution who had remained symptomatic from a SO palsy despite having had an initial weakening procedure to their ipsilateral IO (myectomy or recession). Median age was 19 years (range 3 to 56 years). Information recorded included pre- and postoperative deviation and ocular motility findings, preoperative symptoms, findings at the time of surgery, and outcome. Nine patients underwent repeat weakening surgery (disinsertion) on the ipsilateral IO only. Thirteen patients underwent strengthening surgery on the ipsilateral SO only. Nine patients had surgery on both the ipsilateral IO and SO. Six patients had surgery on the ipsilateral IO with either horizontal or vertical rectus surgery. Nine (24%) patients remained symptomatic after their initial procedure and are regarded as initial failures. Four of these patients had masked bilateral IO weakness. Five patients required additional surgery. At final outcome, 84% were discharged with resolution of their symptoms. In the light of these findings we suggest an approach for the management of these patients. This should always include exploring a previously operated ipsilateral IO. Despite this, patients should be warned that they have a 1 in 4 chance of needing further surgery to achieve adequate ocular motility.

Black icons of high contrast are superimposed on a scenic background of low contrast in one of 11 positions in random order. The subject's task is to find the search icon on the CRT screen as rapidly as possible. This test was administered binocularly in 38 patients with homonymous visual field defects. The aim of the test was to identify those patients who had not adapted themselves to their visual handicap, and to quantify the effect, in these patients, of training of compensational search saccades (Meienberg et al., 1981; Nelles et al., 2001; Trauzettel-Klosinski, 2004). The results show that the visual performance test reflects the practical abilities of these patients and that it may monitor the benefit of visual rehabilitation training in patients with functional restrictions in daily life.","533":"The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of single ocular muscle weakness on smooth pursuit eye movements. Infrared video recordings of horizontal and vertical eye movements were obtained from 14 adult patients with either unilateral abducens nerve palsy or trochlear nerve palsy. During the recordings, subsequent series of horizontal, vertical and oblique ramp stimuli of 10 degrees\/s constant target velocity and +\/-10 degrees amplitude were presented under monocular viewing conditions. In both forms of ocular nerve palsies, similar changes of pursuit eye movements were observed in the pulling plane of the paretic muscles. The movements of the covered paretic eye showed the lowest amplitude and gain values as well as the lowest numbers of catch-up saccades. The highest amplitude and gain values were calculated from the movements of the covered sound eye. The highest numbers of saccades, however, were produced by the fixating paretic eye. We conclude that the fixating paretic eye compensates for the paresis by raising the pursuit gain and the number of catch-up saccades. In the covered paretic eye, however, monocular adaptation is connected with a symmetric low pursuit gain and a reduced number of saccades in the pulling plane of the paretic muscle. ","534":"The aim of this study was to investigate the spatial and temporal distortions that occur in strabismic and anisometropic amblyopic vision. Twelve subjects with strabismic (n = 4), anisometropic (n = 4), mixed amblyopia (n = 3) and bilateral refractive amblyopia (n = 1) were asked to describe and sketch their subjective percept of different geometrical patterns, as seen with their amblyopic eye. Based on their descriptions, computer-animated patterns were generated, which were then validated by the subjects. Both spatial distortions and temporal instability were perceived mainly by strabismic and strabismic-anisometropic amblyopes. Temporal instability occurred mainly at high spatial frequencies. Our data suggest that strabismus, in addition to amblyopia, is needed to elicit significant spatial and temporal distortions. The occurrence of these distortions may be related to the early history of each subject.","535":"To evaluate the usability and reliability of three different visual acuity (VA) testing procedures using Landolt C's in 8 positions with a semi-automated computer program in school children. 100 school children (median 7 years, 59 boys and 41 girls) were included; only the better eye was tested. We used the semi-automated computer program CORVIS.VT in a forced choice method. Three different test strategies were employed, each two times: A) DIN, B) Standard-Staircase and C) Best-PEST procedure with sequences A, B, C or A, C, B. Average testing time was 100 s +\/- 45 (DIN), 59 s +\/- 36 (Staircase) and 77 s +\/- 25 (Best-PEST). The mean VA estimated with DIN was equivalent to that with the Best-PEST procedure. However, the mean VA with Standard-Staircase was one line less. In DIN, 76% of the retest scores were within 0.1 logMAR unit of the initial test score (Staircase: 72%, Best-PEST 73%). The 95% confidence interval of test-retest reliability was calculated to be -0.05 +\/- 0.24 logMAR in DIN, +0.02 +\/- 0.32 logMAR in Staircase, and 0.00 +\/- 0.29 logMAR in Best-PEST. A high percentage of children aged 6 to 9 years (98%) can be tested with Landolt C's (8 positions). We found a decreasing test-retest reliability starting from DIN via Best-PEST to Staircase in this configuration. ","536":"Disrupted stereovision is a feature that accompanies strabismus. This study uses an fMRI adaptation paradigm to assess the amount of cortical binocularity in subjects with normal or impaired stereopsis. We present data from a pilot study of two normally-sighted and one stereodeficient subject with alternating fixation. We adapted one eye to diagonally oriented sinusoidal gratings and tested either the same (monocular test) or the other eye (interocular transfer), using either the same or an orthogonal orientation. In normally-sighted subjects, we observed monocular adaptation but only weak interocular transfer in the striate cortex, whereas in the extrastriate cortex we found strong monocular as well as interocular adaptation. In the stereodeficient subject, monocular adaptation but no interocular transfer was obtained in the extrastriate cortex. These results suggest that impaired stereopsis is related to reduced interocular transfer of adaptation at higher levels of the cortical visual pathway.","537":"Dark vergence is a resting position of vergence, measured in a dark visual field to eliminate fusional, accommodative, and proximal stimuli. Dark vergence differs among subjects: the average subject converges to a viewing distance of about 1 m, while the inter-individual range is from infinity to about 40 cm. This paper reviews previous ergonomic studies on dark vergence in relation to asthenopic complaints that occur when working at near computer screens: subjects with distant dark vergence exert more convergence and experience stronger asthenopic complaints than subjects with near dark vergence. The dissociated phoria, a common clinical measure of resting vergence, is only weakly correlated with asthenopic complaints, probably because of accommodative influences that cause the difference between dark vergence and dissociated phoria.","538":"Spatial distortions in amblyopic vision can be captured by subjective reports or by a point-by-point mapping of the central part of the visual field. In this study, we developed a series of algorithms that provide a fine-grain mapping of the amblyopic percept. These algorithms can be applied to any real-world image. The images created based on these algorithms can be compared with the subjective percept of each amblyope.","539":"The Vision Screener is a new, commercial version of the Power Refractor, an off-axis, hand-held video refractor to screen for amblyogenic refractive errors. The aim of our study was to determine the reproducibility of the measurements, compare them to cycloplegic refraction, and evaluate the sensitivity and specificity for the detection of amblyogenic refractive errors. Included in the study were 161 preschool children, age 0.5-7.2 years without manifest strabismus &gt; 10 degrees , who attended the outpatient clinic. After three measurements with the Vision Screener (version 4.3.15) and one measurement with +3 dpt glasses, the child underwent cycloplegic refraction. The reproducibility of the three non-cycloplegic measurements was +\/- 0.5 dpt in 85% and +\/- 1 dpt in more than 95% of the children. Accommodation reduced the manifest hyperopia that could be measured with the Vision Screener by up to 3 dpt in some children. Compliance with the +3 dpt glasses increased from 20% in those under one year of age to &gt; 75 % in those over three. The glasses did increase the sensitivity from 70% to 80% but decreased the specificity from 80% to 65%. The Vision Screener is easy to handle and gives reproducible results. The sensitivity and specificity are between 70 and 80%. The +3 dpt glasses are only helpful in a few patients. The latest software version with a new algorithm is now under evaluation.

Reaction times were recorded. We examined 24 patients aged 26-83, with lesions of the visual pathways and homonymous visual field defects, and 18 normal subjects aged 23-79. This simple test takes about 1 minute in normal subjects and four or more minutes in neurological patients. The test may be used to quantify saccadic adaptation to disability from homonymous field defects and to monitor the training effects of visual rehabilitation.","541":"To assess the reproducibility of measurements of visual acuity in both the upper and lower range of visual acuity. The retroilluminated ETDRS 1 and ETDRS 2 charts (Precision Vision) were used for measurement of visual acuity. Both charts use the same letters. The sequence of the charts followed a pseudorandomized protocol. The examination distance was 4.0 m. When the visual acuity was below 0.16 or 0.03, then the examination distance was reduced to 1 m or 0.4 m, respectively, using an appropriate near correction. Visual acuity measurements obtained during the same session with both charts were compared. A total of 100 patients (age 8-90 years; median 60.5) with various eye disorders, including 39 with amblyopia due to strabismus, were tested in addition to 13 healthy volunteers (age 18-33 years; median 24). At least 3 out of 5 optotypes per line had to be correctly identified to pass this line. Wrong answers were monitored. The interpolated logMAR score was calculated. In the patients, the eye with the lower visual acuity was assessed, and for the healthy subjects the right eye. Differences between ETDRS 1 and ETDRS 2-acuity were compared. The mean logMAR values for ETDRS 1 and ETDRS 2 were -0.17 and -0.14 in the healthy eyes and 0.55 and 0.57 in the entire group. The absolute difference between ETDRS 1 and ETDRS 2 was (mean +\/- standard deviation) 0.051 +\/- 0.04 for the healthy eyes and 0.063 +\/- 0.05 in the entire group. In the acuity range below 0.1 (logMAR &gt; 1.0), the absolute difference (mean +\/- standard deviation) between ETDRS 1 and ETDRS 2 of 0.072 +\/- 0.04 did not significantly exceed the mean absolute difference in healthy eyes (p = 0.17). Regression analysis (|ETDRS 1 - ETDRS 2| vs. ETDRS 1) showed a slight increase of the difference between the two values with lower visual acuity (p = 0.0505; r = 0.18). Assuming correct measurement, the reproducibilty of visual acuity measurements in the lower acuity range is not significantly worse than in normals.

A retrospective review of case notes was carried out of all patients with congenital periodic alternating nystagmus (PAN) treated with baclofen between 1999 and 2004. Eight patients were identified, 6 males and 2 females with a mean age of 21 years (range 9 to 34 years). Clinical data were recorded for all patients pre- and post-treatment with the GABA agonist baclofen. Adverse effects of the treatment were recorded and a questionnaire was constructed to evaluate patient satisfaction with the treatment. All 8 patients had an abnormal head posture (AHP) before treatment which improved following treatment in 4 patients, one of whom had recurrence following treatment withdrawal. Binocular Snellen visual acuity (VA) improved by one line in 4 cases, while none of the other 4 patients suffered any loss of vision from the treatment. Three of the eight patients have continued on treatment long-term, in one case for 6 years. In the other five, treatment was withdrawn due to side effects in 4 cases, and in the fifth due to a lack of effect. The most commonly reported side effect was drowsiness, which occurred in 3 patients. Using a patient-centered survey, complete responses were obtained from 6 of the 8 patients treated. Five patients were either pleased or very pleased that they had tried the treatment. The reasons given were: improved vision or head posture, an appreciation of slowing of ocular movements, improved cosmesis and improved confidence. Baclofen may be effective in a select group of patients with congenital PAN and a trial of treatment may be worthwhile, prior to considering surgical intervention in this condition. ","545":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether asthenopic symptoms in schoolchildren diagnosed with accommodative insufficiency (AI) and graded with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) could be correlated with the degree of accommodative deficiency in these children, and to investigate if VAS grading of the asthenopic symptoms could be used as an instrument to indicate the level of improvement of AI. Forty-nine children (mean age 10.2 years +\/- 2.7) diagnosed with AI graded their degree of asthenopia on the VAS before and after a 12-week treatment period wearing individually dispensed reading glasses. The improvement in accommodation after treatment was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001) and 83.7% of the children obtained normal accommodative amplitude in relation to age. The reduction in asthenopic symptoms as graded with the VAS was also statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001) after treatment and 89.9% of the children obtained a normal VAS score. However, no correlation between the degree of accommodative deficiency and the VAS grading could be found, neither before nor after treatment. Based on these results we conclude that the visual analogue scale (VAS) cannot be used as an instrument to indicate the degree of accommodative deficiency nor can it be used to indicate the level of improvement during the course of treatment. However, the VAS can be used as an instrument to verify and document whether or not asthenopic symptoms are present, and therefore also to indicate when symptoms have been relieved. ","546":"To compare postoperative alignment and sensory functions in children with primary exotropia who were operated at an early age (&lt; 7 years) with patients who were operated at an older age (&gt; 7 years). In a consecutive retrospective cohort study, 112 patients who had a surgical intervention for primary exotropia between 1997 and 2003 were evaluated for postoperative results. After applying criteria for eligibility, the group of patients was divided into two groups: those who had surgical intervention before the age of seven years (n = 24) and those who had surgery after the age of seven years (n = 36). Age at surgery, preoperative alignment and sensory functions were correlated with the postoperative status. The follow-up was at least one year (1.0 year to 7 years; median: 2.3 and 3.5 years, respectively). Children who had surgery before the age of seven had significantly better alignment and sensory functions. The univariate logistic regression model confirmed a statistically significant association between motor outcome (exodeviation less than 10 prism-diopters) and age at the time of surgery (before or after the age of seven; p = 0.002). In the multivariate model, the association between age at time of surgery and motor outcome was even stronger. The number of reoperations in the group operated before the age of 7 years was significantly less than in the group operated after the age of seven (2 versus 12, p = 0.023). The postoperative alignment and sensory functions in patients with primary exotropia who had surgical intervention before the age of seven years were, in this study, better than in patients who had surgery after the age of seven years. ","547":"To investigate whether orthoptic exercises are an effective way to influence the near point of convergence, fusion range and asthenopic symptoms. Seventy-eight patients met the inclusion criteria of visual acuity 6\/9 or better, no history of orthoptic treatment, squint surgery or Meares Irlen syndrome\/dyslexia. Information was collected from case records related to diagnosis, near point of convergence, fusion range, prism and cover test measurements and symptoms. Type, duration and frequency of exercises were also recorded. Non-parametric statistics were applied. Patients ranged in age from 5 to 73 years (mean 11.9). Females outnumbered males (46:32). The diagnoses were: decompensating heterophoria (n = 50) or convergence insufficiency (n = 28: primary 27; secondary 1). Exophoria was more common (n = 65), than esophoria (n = 11) or orthophoria (n = 1). Treatments were aimed at improving near point of convergence and\/or reduced fusional reserves. The mean treatment period was 8.2 months. Reduced near point of convergence normalized following treatment in 47\/55 cases, and mean near point of convergence improved from 16.6 to 8.4 cm (p = 0.0001). Fusional reserves normalized in 29\/50. Fusional convergence improved significantly for those with exodeviation (p &gt; 0.0006). Asthenopic symptoms improved in 65 patients. A reduction in deviation of 5 pd or more occurred in 20 patients. Orthoptic exercises are an effective means of reducing symptoms in patients with convergence insufficiency and decompensating exophoria, and appear to target the proximal and fusional components of convergence. Their role in esophoria is unclear and needs further study. ","548":"Chronic sixth nerve palsy can cause incapacitating diplopia requiring vertical muscle transposition surgery. Augmentation of surgery, with lateral fixation sutures, medial rectus recession or botulinum toxin injection, is associated with an increased risk of complications. Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of unaugmented full-tendon vertical rectus transposition in chronic sixth nerve paralysis. Longitudinal study of 21 patients with chronic sixth nerve paralysis of longer than 6 months duration, who underwent superior and inferior recti transposition surgery without medial rectus recession or botulinum toxin injection. Details of surgery, preoperative and postoperative examinations including full orthoptic examination were obtained from an electronic database. Outcomes included the change in angle of deviation, the requirement for further surgery to the medial rectus and postoperative improvement in diplopia. SPSS software (Version 12.0.1, SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL) was used to summarize baseline characteristics and outcomes and to compare preoperative and postoperative deviation (paired t-test). Twenty-one patients (10 (47.6%) men and 11 (52.4%) women) with a mean age of 41 years (range 4 to 74 years) were operated in the period between April 1998 and November 2000. Eighteen patients had unilateral and three had bilateral acquired sixth nerve palsy. Nineteen patients required unilateral surgery and two had bilateral transposition procedures. In patients with unilateral sixth nerve palsy, mean esotropia in primary position before surgery was 46.7 prism-diopters (PD) (95% CI 35.9-57.4 PD) and improved to 14.6 PD after surgery (95% CI 6.4-22.7 PD). The angle of deviation was significantly reduced by an average of 32.1 PD (p &lt; 0.001, paired t-test; 95% CI 22.6-41.6 PD). Over all, 10 patients (55.6%) had a well-controlled esophoria with a postoperative alignment of within 10 PD of orthophoria without diplopia in the primary position, for distance and near. A further six patients (28.6%) required additional medial rectus recessions to achieve success. The only complication observed was slippage of the inferior rectus in one patient (4.2%), who consequently required further surgery. Botulinum toxin infiltration of the medial rectus in vertical rectus transposition surgery may be unnecessary, incurring cost, additional attendances and interventions for patients. Less than a third of all patients in our series required additional medial rectus recession later.

If these operations are performed by the same surgeon, it is unknown which of these procedures has a higher risk of scleral perforation. In the period from 1999 until 2004, 427 eyes of 317 patients were operated using eye muscle surgery and 81 eyes of 80 patients with retinal detachment buckle surgery. All operations were performed by the same surgeon (JK). In a retrospective, single-center, comparative, observational study, the records of these patients were assessed to determine the number of scleral perforations with retinal damage or drainage of subretinal fluid. In the group receiving retinal detachment buckle surgery there were two cases of scleral perforation. In one case, scleral perforation occurred during buckle installation and in the other case during placement of a cerclage. The rate of scleral perforation was 2.5 % per patient and per eye in this group. In the group receiving eye muscle surgery no scleral perforations occurred. The number of scleral perforations was higher in retinal detachment buckle surgery than in eye muscle surgery, with all procedures having been performed by the same surgeon. ","552":"Macular translocation is an optional surgical treatment for age-related macular degeneration. However, this technique induces postoperative torsional complaints and surgical counterrotation of the globe is mandatory. The purpose of this study is to report the effect of compensatory extraocular muscle surgery upon the torsional complaints in patients who underwent a macular translocation procedure. The pre- and postoperative data on the first 35 patients in our department who underwent a counterrotation procedure after macular translocation surgery are reviewed. From November 2001 to January 2005, 35 patients underwent a macular translocation procedure, with subsequent extraocular muscle surgery to counterrotate the eye. Three types of rectus muscle transposition procedures were used: full-tendon transposition of two opposite rectus muscles, \"crossed\" half-tendon transposition of all rectus muscles ('split &amp; cross' procedure), and \"uncrossed\" half-tendon transposition of all rectus muscles ('split &amp; neighbor cross' procedure). In the majority of patients these procedures were associated with oblique muscle surgery. With the selected procedures, retinal excyclodeviations are easier to correct then retinal incyclodeviations. In our hands, full-tendon transposition of two opposite rectus muscles with or without associated oblique muscle surgery, never corrects more than 30 degrees. 'Split &amp; cross' procedures combined with oblique muscle surgery are sufficient for retinal excyclodeviations of 30-45 degrees and for incyclodeviations of up to 30 degrees; 'split &amp; neighbor cross' procedures combined with oblique muscle surgery are sufficient for retinal excyclodeviations of 45-65 degrees and for incyclodeviations of up to 40 degrees . The effect of the various procedures appears to be predictable. It is possible to select a surgical procedure as a function of the amount of retinal cyclodeviation. ","553":"Although intermittent exotropia may deteriorate with time, there are no widely accepted criteria for measuring progression in this disorder. The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate a new scale for assessing the level of control in children with intermittent exotropia. Thirty consecutive pediatric patients (&lt; 14 years) with intermittent exotropia were prospectively evaluated from July 1, 2004 through June 30, 2005 using a new scale to assess the level of control for both distance and near fixation. The distance score (0 to 5) was combined with the near score (0 to 5) to yield an overall control score from 0 to 10. The 30 patients were examined at a median age of 72 months (range, 15 months to 13 years). The level of control at distance was worse than or equal to the near level of control in all 30 patients. The control scores ranged from 0 to 5 for distance and 0 to 4 for near, with an overall control score ranging from 0 to 8 (median of 3). This new scale for assessing control in children with intermittent exotropia can be easily applied in the office setting and characterizes the wide range of control in this disorder. ","554":"The infrared (IR) and the magnetic scleral search coil (MSC) systems for eye tracking were studied with regard to the intra-individual variability in saccadic eye movement recordings. Three healthy subjects performed similar saccadic eye movement tasks at five different occasions with both the IR (Orbit XY-1000) and the MSC (Skalar Medical) techniques. The maximum velocity (VMAX) and slope constant (C) of the main sequence plots were analyzed with regard to the coefficient of variation (CV) and the intraclass correlation coefficient (Ricc). In addition, the possible reasons for variability in the IR recordings, especially different causes for noise, were analyzed and discussed. The main sequence data showed intra-individual variation with both recording systems, but the coefficient of variation was higher for VMAX with the IR compared to the MSC method. Ricc analysis showed that 36% of the variance of VMAX and 49% of the variance of C resulted from intra-individual variability in recordings of the IR system. The corresponding results for the MSC recordings regarding VMAX and C were 48% and 88%. Saccadic eye movement recordings yielded a larger intra-individual variability with the IR system than with the MSC system. The effect that the MSC annulus may have on the ocular motor command signal and the possible low pass filter caused by the coil slipping on the surface of the eye may partly explain the relatively lower velocity in the MSC recordings. Also, noise in the IR recordings induces peaks of eye velocity, which can be reduced considerably by filtering. However, the variability in the recordings, which was larger in the IR than in the MSC recordings, did not seem to be decreased by filtering. The basic level of noise in the recordings was not clearly associated with the amount of reduction of VMAX when the IR recordings were filtered. We suggest that artefacts of the saccadic signal, which can be related to changes in the reflecting surface of the eyes and eyelids, are important factors for explaining the variability and high-velocity peaks in the IR recordings. Lighting conditions was confirmed as a cause for noise, but temperature and air humidity changes in the goggles were not suspected to influence data in the normal experimental setting. Although noise, shortcomings of the recording technique and procedure may offer explanations for the intra-individual variability, the calibration procedure and changes in attention and fatigue of the subject should also be considered. ","555":"To investigate changes in visual motion perception after treatment with botulinum toxin in patients with unilateral chronic lateral rectus muscle palsy. Five patients and control subjects were asked to report the perceived drift direction of a sinusoidal grating that was initially stationary and then began to accelerate at 0.09 degrees \/sec2 in a horizontal direction. The grating had a field size of 18.5 degrees and was presented monocularly with a contrast just above threshold for visibility for central vision. Both the paretic and non-affected eyes were tested. Psychophysical testing was performed under the following conditions: 1) before treatment and testing, patients occluded their paretic eye for at least three days to avoid diplopia. 2) After treatment with botulinum toxin, alignment was corrected and patients stopped occluding their paretic eye for at least three days before testing. The control subjects occluded their non-dominant eye for three days before testing. In condition 1, no differences in motion detection values between patients and control subjects were found. In condition 2, motion detection thresholds were raised approximately 0.15 degrees \/sec as compared to pre-treatment values and compared to the control group. After treatment, a raised threshold for motion detection is one mechanism used to avoid oscillopsia and visuo-vestibular disorientation during head movements in patients with chronic paralytic squint. This study lends evidence that perceptual-adaptive, compensatory mechanisms develop to reduce oscillopsia and disorientation rather than being caused by abnormal cortical motion processing or defective eye muscle action. ","556":"Favorable results in the management of PHPV, made possible by improved surgical techniques, are described in the literature. However, the functional results are in general in the low-vision sector (rarely better than 0.025-0.1 maximum). To introduce long-term acuity results and estimate the relative amblyopia in early operated PHPV. Six patients suffering from PHPV of varying degrees (posterior polar cataract, posterior lenticonus, traction and malformation of the optic nerve head and macula region, persistent vitreous vessels) underwent pleoptic treatment after surgery (lentectomy in all, additional stalk-cutting in three cases) at the age of 3 to 7 months. The patients were followed up to age 7 to 12 years. Visual acuity was assessed by Landolt ring single and closely interspaced linear optotypes (C-Test developed by Haase\/Hohmann). Compliance with the amblyopia treatment was good in five patients. Visual acuity (VA) improvement in the affected eye could be seen up to early school age (6-8 years). Final VA outcome was 0.1 (minimum) to 0.7 (maximum) with single optotypes. VA for crowded optotypes was maximum 1 octave below single optotype VA. The visual development of the phakic eye was not delayed, i.e. not disturbed by long-term patching. Compliance with amblyopia treatment and long-term visual acuity in the cases presented here are even more favorable than described in the literature. As the amount of crowding is small, we conclude that there is little relative (additional) amblyopia and that the functional outcome is limited only by the degree of ocular malformation. Surgical treatment in comparable cases is encouraged. ","557":"To examine the pathological significance and familial occurrence of voluntary nystagmus. We examined two families orthoptically as well as with video and search-coil techniques or electronystagmography (ENG). Three members of three generations of the first family and a 9-year-old boy from a second family not related to the first were able to generate a voluntary horizontal nystagmus. The characteristics of the nystagmus of our original patient, his daughter and 8-year-old grandson (1st family) were remarkably similar: duration of 2-5 seconds, amplitudes of 1-4 degrees and frequencies around 15 cycles\/second. In the second family, our patient with a congenital esotropia and hyperopia was the only one of his family who could voluntarily produce a nystagmus of about 5 degrees and 10 cycles\/second for maximum of 20 seconds. During prolonged reading, the same nystagmus with disturbing oscillopsia developed involuntarily and was not suppressible. We added +0.75 diopters to both lenses of his spectacles to account for the result of our cycloplegic refraction. This stopped the involuntary nystagmus during near fixation. To avoid unintentional \"bouts\" of voluntary nystagmus, a reduction of the convergence impulse by plus-lenses may be effective. The parameters of voluntary nystagmus can be considered family-specific. ","558":"The diagnosis of mitochondrial myopathy depends upon a constellation of findings, family history, type of muscle involvement, specific laboratory abnormalities, and the results of histological, pathobiochemical and genetic analysis. In the present paper, the authors describe the diagnostic approach to mitochondrial myopathies manifesting as extraocular muscle disease. The most common ocular manifestation of mitochondrial myopathy is progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO). To exclude myasthenia gravis, ocular myositis, thyroid associated orbitopathy, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, and congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles in patients with an early onset or long-lasting very slowly progressive ptosis and external ophthalmoplegia, almost without any diplopia, and normal to mildly elevated serum creatine kinase and lactate, electromyography, nerve conduction studies and MRI of the orbits should be performed. A PEO phenotype forces one to look comprehensively for other multisystemic mitochondrial features (e.g., exercise induced weakness, encephalopathy, polyneuropathy, diabetes, heart disease). Thereafter, and presently even in familiar PEO, a diagnostic muscle biopsy should be taken. Histological and ultrastructural hallmarks are mitochondrial proliferations and structural abnormalities, lipid storage, ragged-red fibers, or cytochrome-C negative myofibers. In addition, Southern blotting may reveal the common deletion, or molecular analysis may verify specific mutations of distinct mitochondrial or nuclear genes.","559":"This article summarizes the authors' previous studies on proprioceptors in extraocular muscles (EOMs) of mammals and man. They report on muscle spindles in the EOMs of man, Golgi tendon organs in the EOMs of even-toed ungulates, and palisade endings in the EOMs of the cat. Muscle spindles: Muscle spindles are present in the EOMs of some mammals and in the EOMs of man. Compared with muscle spindles in other skeletal muscles, those in human EOMs exhibit structural differences. These structural differences may indicate a special function. Golgi tendon organs: Golgi tendon organs are absent in human EOMs. Golgi tendon organs exhibiting a specific morphology are present in the EOMs of even-toed ungulates. Their high number and rich innervation indicate functional importance. Palisade endings: Palisade endings are nervous end organs confined to the EOMs of mammals and man. It is assumed that these organs have a proprioceptive function. The authors show that palisade endings are immunoreactive for antibodies against choline acetyltransferase. Neuromuscular contacts, if present in palisade endings, are alpha -bungarotoxin positive as well. Taken together, these results show that palisade endings exhibit molecular characteristics of effector organs.","560":"Congenital syndromes of altered nervous system connectivity are reviewed along with recent findings on axonal growth: achiasma, congenital nystagmus, congenital horizontal gaze palsy, mirror movements and the syndromes of Kallmann, Wildervanck, Duane and Marcus Gunn. Identical guidance molecules are most likely involved in making axonal connections after injury and during development. Thus, investigations into variants of connectivity may help develop strategies to treat disconnections of axons in the adult.","561":"The authors investigated the performance of children with developmental dyslexia on a number of visual tasks requiring selective visual attention. Dyslexic children did not show the overestimation of the left visual field (pseudo-neglect) characteristic of normal adult vision. The performance of dyslexic children in texture segmentation and feature search tasks was identical to that of control children matched for age, gender and intelligence. However, when tested on conjunction tasks for orientation and form, dyslexic children showed shorter reaction times and a dramatically increased number of errors. Differences between the two groups decreased with increasing age. These results suggest that children with developmental dyslexia present selective deficits in visual attention.","562":"With dichoptic nonius lines presented repetitively on a computer monitor for only short moments in time (e.g., 80 ms), temporal aspects of vergence can be assessed: the variability of fixation disparity with a stationary central fusion stimulus and the velocity of convergence or divergence changes.

In most children older than about 7 years, the estimation of vergence velocity turned out as well as in adults in terms of amount and reliability.","563":"We recently reported acuity development in the amblyopic eye of a 60-year-old patient after loss of vision in her non-amblyopic eye. Here, we focus on the training that we implemented, based on new insights from psychophysical procedures aiming at functional visual improvement of adults (\"perceptual learning\"). We alternately used the following procedures: grating acuity (Teller-Cards); contrast sensitivity (Vistech-Charts); two spatial localization tests (vertical alignment, pointing); and labyrinth patterns for a eye-hand coordination exercise. One month without intervention was followed by six months of training and two blocks of pleoptic treatment. Clinical parameters were assessed monthly. Besides acuity gain, we observed enhanced grating resolution and contrast sensitivity, decreased alignment distortions, pointing shifts, mainly after pleoptics, and more efficient labyrinth tracing. A questionnaire reflected the patient's perception of the changes. These data confirm the plasticity of the adult amblyopic system, be it spontaneous due to the loss of the non-amblyopic eye or caused by the intervention or both. Further experience is necessary to isolate the role of the intervention. Our results also underline the limitation of adult plasticity, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of amblyopia.","564":"A brief review is provided on the role of experimental modulation of the visual system during its plastic period. The importance of several substances has been demonstrated. Potential clinical applications of available studies on the treatment of amblyopia are summarized. The role of the dopaminergic system and particularly of dopamine in amblyopia are also discussed. The results of the use of cytidine-5'-diphosphocholine (citicoline) in amblyopia are evaluated in detail. The advantages of and indications for an association of citicoline with part-time occlusion are also discussed. Finally, new administration modalities of citicoline, more detailed evaluation of its efficacy, and the use of new substances are briefly analyzed.","565":"Electronic Occlusion Dose Monitors (ODMs) are a fairly recent development. As part of the international Electronic Recording of Patching for Amblyopia Group (ERPAG), we are the first center in Germany to apply these devices. The aim of our independent study was a further assessment of their potential, including technical features and the practicability of long-term use under near-clinical conditions. The ODMs, taped to the occlusion patch, measure the temperature difference between the surface of the eye and the surroundings. Investigators and patients' families kept occlusion diaries while using ODMs. Measurements were performed on the eye (patch tight or detached), forehead, arm and in trouser pockets, and while varying the room temperature. Patients' occlusion was monitored for several months together with acuity development. ODM acceptance was assessed by questionnaire. Written and monitored occlusion times corresponded excellently. Proper measurements on the eye could be distinguished more readily from those with the patch detached or in the pocket than from measurements on the arm and forehead. Very high temperatures (33-37 degrees C) prevented reliable measurements. Using ODMs was convenient for parents but time-consuming for researchers. Despite occasional data loss (incomplete diaries, ODM failure), acuity development could be followed as a function of monitored occlusion dose. This study contributes to the specification of the ODM features and their refinement for clinical use.","566":"Amblyopia is a developmental disorder of spatial vision resulting from an abnormal visual stimulation in early childhood. The aim of our study was to investigate the spatial and temporal distortions that occur in strabismic and anisometropic amblyopic vision. The main focus was on the temporal instability of amblyopic perception of low and high spatial frequencies. Our results indicate that temporal instability is perceived mainly by strabismic and strabismic-anisometropic amblyopes and occurs only at high spatial frequencies. We found two categories of temporal distortions in high spatial frequency patterns: a) the whole pattern is perceived as jittering, b) single lines or parts in a pattern are perceived as moving. Our data suggest that strabismus, in addition to amblyopia, is needed to elicit significant temporal distortions.","567":null,"568":"Research into the clinical management of amblyopia has, most recently, focussed on the effectiveness of amblyopia treatment. Given the mounting evidence that the condition is treatable, an important priority is the detection of individuals with the condition. Here, we review critically the means by which this can be achieved. We conclude that intensive early screening can produce improved outcomes but that the effectiveness of real-life screening programmes is very dependent on the coverage they obtain. An almost entirely neglected subfield of amblyopia treatment research is the identification of reasons why parents and children often fail to comply with occlusion therapy. Here, we examine a psychological approach to this problem and find it to be informative in predicting compliance. Lastly, we consider the disability arising from strabismus, again from a psychological perspective, and find that on a range of psychosocial well-being indicators, strabismus surgery results in significant gains.","569":"Recent studies suggest that children with amblyopia associated with anisometropia, strabismus, or both should be treated initially with best refractive correction until visual acuity is stable. This may take several months, and a proportion of children will achieve equal visual acuity with glasses alone. For residual anisometropic and strabismic amblyopia, the initial choice of patching or atropine should involve the parent and the child. The dose of prescribed patching or atropine may initially be quite modest, such as 2 hours of patching a day or twice weekly atropine. Treatment should be offered to children until at least 12 years of age and possibly to teenagers. Ongoing studies are addressing the role of undertaking near activities while patched and the role of atropine for severe amblyopia and for older amblyopic children. Future studies are needed to investigate the best treatment strategies for residual amblyopia, whether weaning treatment is needed at the end of a course, and how compliance can be enhanced.","570":"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) have been the principal neuroimaging tools used to assess the site and nature of cortical deficits in human amblyopia. A review of this growing body of work is presented here with particular reference to various controversial issues, including whether or not the primary visual cortex is dysfunctional, the involvement of higher-order visual areas, neural differences between strabismic and anisometropic amblyopes, and the effects of modern-day drug treatments. We also present our own recent MEG work in which we used the analysis technique of synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM) to examine the effects of strabismic amblyopia on cortical function. Our results provide evidence that the neuronal assembly associated with form perception in the extrastriate cortex may be dysfunctional in amblyopia, and that the nature of this dysfunction may relate to a change in the normal temporal pattern of neuronal discharges. Based on these results and existing literature, we conclude that a number of cortical areas show reduced levels of activation in amblyopia, including primary and secondary visual areas and regions within the parieto-occipital cortex and ventral temporal cortex.","571":"Within the last five years, there have been a number of exciting new advances in our knowledge and understanding of amblyopia. This article reviews recent psychophysical studies of naturally occurring amblyopia in humans. These studies suggest that: 1) There are significant differences in the patterns of visual loss among the clinically defined categories of amblyopes. A key factor in determining the nature of the loss is the presence or absence of binocularity. 2) Dysfunction within the amblyopic visual system first occurs in area V1, and the effects of amblyopia may be amplified downstream. 3) There appears to be substantial neural plasticity in the amblyopic brain beyond the \"critical period.\"","572":"In the past five years, substantial progress has been made in our knowledge of the neural basis of amblyopia. Recent advances based on animal models are described, along with new psychophysical data showing perceptual deficits in amblyopic animals that are not explained by simple losses in contrast sensitivity. Studies of contour integration and integration of motion and form signals in the presence of noise show that 1) there are fundamental losses in temporal as well as spatial vision, 2) the losses extend to the fellow eye in many cases, 3) amblyopic animals are especially impaired in the presence of background noise, and 4) these losses must depend on a process downstream from area V1 in the extrastriate cortex.","573":"","574":"","575":"","576":"","577":"The optimal age for surgery for infantile esotropia is controversial. Proponents of early surgery believe that further loss of binocular vision can be prevented by early surgery, a minority believes that binocular vision can even be restored by early surgery. The ELISSS compared early with late surgery in a prospective, controlled, non-randomized, multicenter trial. Fifty-eight clinics recruited children aged 6-18 months for the study. Each clinic operated all eligible children either 'early', i.e. at age 6-24 months, or 'late', i.e. at age 32-60 months. At baseline the angle of strabismus, refraction, degree of amblyopia and limitation of abduction were assessed. Intermediate examinations took place every six months. Children were evaluated at age six in the presence of independent observers. Primary endpoints were (i) level of binocular vision, (ii) manifest angle of strabismus at distance and (iii) remaining amblyopia. Secondary endpoints were number of operations, vertical strabismus, angle at near and the influence of surgical technique. A total of 231 children were recruited for early and 301 for late surgery. Age at entry examination was 11.1 months (SD 3.7 months) in the early group and 10.9 (SD 3.7) months in the late group. Refraction, amblyopia and limitation of abduction were distributed equally in the early and late groups, but the angle of strabismus was slightly larger in the early group. Dropout-rates were 26.0% in the early and 22.3% in the late group. At age six, 13.5% of the early vs. 3.9% of the late group recognized the Titmus Housefly; 3.0% of the early and 3.9% of the late group had stereopsis beyond Titmus Housefly. No significant difference was found for angle of strabismus. 35.1% of the early group and 34.8% of the late group did not have an angle between 0 degrees and 10 degrees , the thresholds set for re-operation. For ratio of the visual acuities (remaining amblyopia) there was a small but significant advantage for the early group. There was hardly any correlation between the baseline parameters and the primary endpoints. Children scheduled for early surgery had first been operated at 20 (SD 8.4) months, but 8.2% had not been operated at age six. Children scheduled for late surgery had been operated at 49.1 (SD 12.7) months, but 20.1% had not been operated at age six. The number of operations per child was 1.18 (SD 0.67) in the early and 0.99 (SD 0.64) in the late group. Age at recruitment, age that strabismus reportedly had started and refraction at entry examination were similar among operated and non-operated children. Only the angle of strabismus at entry predicted, to some extent, whether a child had been operated at age six. Children operated early had better gross stereopsis at age six as compared to children operated late. They had been operated more frequently, however, and a substantial number of children in both groups had not been operated at all. ","578":"Children being evaluated for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often have an eye exam as part of their evaluation. The symptoms of convergence insufficiency (CI) can make it difficult for a student to concentrate on extended reading and overlap with those of ADHD. A retrospective review of 266 patients with CI presenting to an academic pediatric ophthalmology practice was performed. All patients included were diagnosed with CI by one author (DBG) and evaluated for the diagnosis of ADHD. A computerized review was also performed looking at the converse incidence of CI in patients carrying the diagnosis of ADHD. We reviewed 266 charts of patients with CI. Twenty-six patients (9.8%) were diagnosed with ADHD at some time in their clinical course. Of the patients with ADHD and CI, 20 (76.9%) were on medication for ADHD at the time of diagnosis for CI while 6 (23.1%) were either not on medication or the medication was discontinued several months before the diagnosis of CI. The review of computer records showed a 15.9% incidence of CI in the ADHD population. We report an apparent three-fold greater incidence of ADHD among patients with CI when compared with the incidence of ADHD in the general US population (1.8-3.3%). We also note a seeming three-fold greater incidence of CI in the ADHD population. This may simply represent an association and not be a causative relationship. Until further studies are performed, however, patients diagnosed with ADHD should be evaluated to identify the small subset that may have CI -- a condition that responds well to treatment at home. ","579":"To present our experience with single-stage adjustable strabismus surgery (SSASS) under topical anesthesia and propofol. Sixteen patients who either had diplopia before the surgery or were at risk of developing diplopia after the surgery were selected for this operation after evaluating their tolerance for an eyelid speculum. Recession of the lateral recti, recession, resection and advancement of the medial recti, anteriorization of the inferior oblique and marginal myotomy to the superior rectus were the procedures done under topical anesthesia and propofol. The operations were done in two phases; in the first phase, the patients were sedated for 10 minutes with intravenous propofol (2 mg\/kg) and the operation was done under topical anesthesia with 2% lidocaine. In the second phase, the patients were conscious and the adjustments were made. None of the patients complained of significant pain during the surgery. No complications occurred during and after the procedure and no patients had diplopia during the postoperative follow-up. Single-stage adjustable surgery is practical and avoids the risks of regional and general anesthesia. The only disadvantage is the pain that some patients experience. We found that it is feasible to use propofol for this surgery; it provides deep sedation and prevents pain from being felt during the operation, and its short elimination half-life provides rapid awakening for the adjustment phase. ","580":"The milder form of posterior polar cataract is often discovered late in preschool children if secondary symptoms like strabismus are not present. The question addressed in this paper is: do such children still profit from orthoptic and surgical treatment? This was a retrospective study of the data from 13 patients, median age 4 years (range: 1 month to 12 years), with a mean follow-up of 4 years. Four changes to the red reflex were introduced. Surgery followed from two weeks to three years after starting occlusion therapy. Before therapy, the best visual acuity was 0.3 and the worst 0.06 (median 0.16). A median of four years after starting therapy, the visual acuity ranged from 0.9 to 0.4 (median 0.6). All milder cases profited from the treatment despite its late start. An earlier discovery would improve the prognosis. In any case, however, ophthalmologists should be encouraged to try patching before resorting to surgery.

Here, the authors report the case of a 23-year-old female with isolated left abducens nerve palsy after long-term retinoic acid therapy. The association is based on the temporal relationship and the exclusion of other possible etiologic factors following extensive laboratory and imaging diagnostics. The authors suggest that isolated abducens nerve palsy may be a presenting sign of a toxic neuropathy associated with retinoic acid therapy. After the exclusion of other organic lesions, especially idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and an assessment of the risk-benefit ratio, discontinuation of treatment must be considered in such cases.","587":"One goal of this investigation was to determine whether asymmetrical vertical hetereophorias, which are qualitatively similar to a dissociated vertical deviation (DVD), occur commonly in normal people. A second goal was to establish whether the magnitude or direction of vertical phoria depends on the illumination of the occluded eye, as would be expected if vertical eye position were influenced by a dorsal light reflex. Vertical phorias were estimated in 30 normal subjects using a Maddox rod in conjunction with a dark and an illuminated occluder. On average, subjects exhibited a hypophoria of less than 1 min arc with both the dark and the illuminated occluder. Asymmetrical vertical phorias that were consistent with previously published criteria for a minute DVD were found in eight subjects when a dark occluder was used and in four subjects when an illuminated occluder was used. The proportions of subjects whose vertical phorias were consistent with a DVD did not differ significantly under the two conditions of occlusion. Asymmetrical vertical phorias that mimic a minute DVD do not occur commonly in normal people. Our finding that vertical phorias do not change systematically when an illuminated instead of a dark occluder is used suggests that normal subjects exhibit little or no vestige of the dorsal light reflex. ","588":"A head tilt towards the shoulder (roll) induces an ocular counter-roll (OCR), i.e. torsion in the opposite direction to the head. How this counter-rolled position is maintained during a static head tilt is in debate. In a previous study, we reported an OCR-increasing drift subsequent to the head tilt. This finding is in contrast to other reports where no such response was found. The primary aim of this study was to repeat the experiment during a prolonged head-tilt test and to describe the OCR characteristics. A secondary aim was to investigate the influence of spatial visual cues on OCR. Five male subjects performed a head tilt (30 degrees ) towards the right shoulder while the eye position was recorded during a 10-minute interval. In test 1, the subjects viewed a target with no cues for spatial orientation. The same head-tilt paradigm was repeated in test 2 with a visual target with spatial cues. Two samples of data were extracted from the start and the end of the recordings for statistical analysis. Subsequent to the head tilt, a slow OCR-increasing drift in the opposite direction to the head roll was found in all subjects. On average, this drift lasted for 30 sec (+\/- 5) in test 1 and for 55 sec (+\/- 18) in test 2. The drift was then found to change its direction, i.e. the eyes were rotated in the same direction as the head roll. When measured after 10 minutes, the OCR was significantly decreased. The OCR during static head tilt is not constant. During the first minute there is a gradually increasing OCR. Thereafter, the amplitude of the OCR decreases gradually. These changes are influenced to some extent by spatial visual cues. Possible mechanisms are adaptive responses in otolithic afferents as well as central nervous memory functions related to the semicircular canal system. ","589":"Information on the management of acquired nonaccommodative esotropia (ANAET) of childhood is incomplete. Most prior reports combine the results of patients with both accommodative and nonaccommodative esodeviations. The primary objective of this study was to describe the early postoperative motor and sensory results of children with acquired nonaccommodative esotropia. The medical records of 72 consecutive children with ANAET who underwent surgical correction at East Tennessee State University College of Medicine from August 1, 1995 through October 1, 2001 were retrospectively reviewed. The median age at surgery for the 72 study patients was 43.8 months with a median angle of deviation of 30 prism diopters (PD) at both distance and near. Ten patients (13.9%) required a second surgical procedure while one patient (1.4%) required a third. The cumulative probability of a second surgery within two years of the first procedure was 24% (95% CI 4-43%). During a median postoperative follow-up period of 7.1 months, 64 (88.9%) patients were within 8 PD of orthotropia on the last postoperative examination. Normal postoperative stereoacuity was achieved in several children whose deviation began after 30 months of age, as well as in one child who was misaligned for at least two years prior to surgery. Although the postoperative follow-up on these patients with acquired nonaccommodative esotropia managed without prism adaptation is short, the motor results are similar to other studies on patients with acquired esotropia, with sensory outcomes superior to those obtained in children with congenital esotropia.","590":"","591":"Abnormal insertions are the commonest cause of congenital defects in ocular motility.

The medical charts of 19 Japanese patients (8 boys and 11 girls) with pure accommodative esotropia who were followed for 10 years or more at Okayama University Hospital were reviewed retrospectively. Refractive accommodative esotropia was diagnosed in 8 patients while nonrefractive accommodative esotropia was diagnosed in 11 patients. The patients were divided into two groups, based on a stereoacuity of 120 seconds of arc or better versus 240 seconds of arc or worse as measured by the TNO test at the final visit, and the clinical factors were compared between the two groups. Clinical factors related to a stereoacuity of 240 seconds of arc or worse at the final visit were higher accommodative convergence to accommodation (AC\/A) ratios at 6 years of age (p = 0.05), larger residual esodeviations at distance under full correction with glasses at 8 years of age (p = 0.03), and larger residual esodeviations at near at 6 years of age (p = 0.01, Mann-Whitney U-test). Overall, patients with nonrefractive accommodative esotropia tended to show poor levels of stereoacuity at the final visit compared to those with refractive accommodative esotropia (p = 0.059, Fisher exact probability test). This is the first study of the long-term visual outcome in Japanese patients with pure accommodative esotropia including both refractive and nonrefractive types. To obtain better levels of stereoacuity, the residual esodeviations at near and at distance should be kept as small as possible under full correction with glasses, including bifocals, especially at the ages of 6 and 8 years. ","594":"Delayed visual maturation (DVM) is usually a retrospective diagnosis given to infants who are born with no or poor visually-directed behavior, despite normal acuity on objective testing, but who recover months later. This condition can be organized into several types based on associated neurodevelopmental or ocular findings, but the etiology of DVM is probably complex and involves multiple possible origins. Here we report two infants who presented with delayed visual maturation (attention). They were visually unresponsive at birth but were later found to have high myopic errors. Patient 1 had -4 D right eye, -5 D left eye. Patient 2 had -9 D o.u. Upon spectacle correction at 5 and 4 months, respectively, both infants immediately displayed visually-directed behavior, suggesting that a high refractive error was the cause of inattention in these patients. These findings could add to knowledge surrounding DVM and the diagnosis of apparently blind infants. Findings presented here also indicate the importance of prompt refractive error measurement in such cases.","595":"We reviewed the Toxin Clinic database over a 20-year period, identifying patients with strabismus secondary to permanent or temporary impairment of vision. Five hundred-and-three patients who fulfilled our criteria were treated with Botulinum toxin. There were 301 males and 202 females, with a mean age at treatment of 35 years (range 6-86). Three hundred-and-eighty-three patients (76%) had exotropia, 114 (22.5%) had esotropia and 6 (1.5%) had vertical strabismus. Reduced vision secondary to trauma accounted for 45% (227) of patients. Other causes were congenital anomalies 121 (24%), refractive error 30 (6%), retinal detachment 20 (4%), senile cataract 24 (5%), corneal problems 19 (4%), glaucoma 10 (2%) and other 52 (10%). One hundred-and-ninety-three (38%) were aphakic. One thousand-four-hundred-and-fifty-seven injections were given, with a range of 1-50 per patient. Ninety-nine (20%) patients were managed with continued toxin treatment. Two hundred-and-eighteen patients (43%) proceeded to surgery. Forty patients (8%) required no further treatment as they regained binocularity by injection alone. Botulinum toxin appears to have a role in the treatment of secondary strabismus, since only 3% (14) failed to obtain any reduction in their angle. It was well tolerated, with no permanent side effects. Only 22 (4%) patients developed ptosis.

Records of 128 pediatric patients who had been treated for amblyopia by occlusion of the fellow eye between March 1992 and March 2003 were reviewed retrospectively. Age and level of visual acuity at initiation of treatment, occlusion time (full-time, part-time or minimal) and type of amblyopia were analyzed for the effect on visual outcome. The mean age of the patients was 5.69 +\/- 2.01 years (3 to 12 years). Mean follow-up time was 3 years 2 months (6 months to 10 years). Mean visual acuity improvements were similar for the subtypes of amblyopia (strabismic amblyopia 0.38 +\/- 0.29 logMAR units, strabismic-anisometropic amblyopia 0.46 +\/- 0.40 logMAR units, anisometropic amblyopia 0.35 +\/- 0.24 logMAR units). Level of initial visual acuity, age at initiation of treatment and type of occlusion correlated with the final visual acuity (p = 0.000, p = 0.035, p = 0.012, respectively). When the analysis was performed according to the subtypes of amblyopia, initial visual acuity was the only factor associated with the final visual acuity in all types of amblyopia (p &lt; 0.05). The level of initial visual acuity is the most significant factor determining the success of treatment in amblyopia.

A prospective cross-sectional study was carried out on 143 children, 4-15 years of age. Heterotropia was found in five children (3.5%), four with esotropia and one with exotropia. One child with esotropia had a slight overaction of both inferior oblique muscles. Heterophoria was found in 37 children (26%) at near and\/or distance fixation and it was four times more common at near than at distance. In 29 children, heterophoria was found at one distance only and orthophoria at the other. Orthophoria at both near and distance fixation was noted in 101 children (70.5%). The near point of convergence was &lt; or =6 cm in 97% of the children and 97% had stereoacuity of 60\" or better. In the whole group, the median AC\/A ratio calculated with the heterophoria method was 5.6\/1 prism diopters\/diopters (PD\/D) and with the gradient method, 1.3\/1 PD\/D. No anomalous head postures or nystagmus were observed and all children had normal versions. In this study, 143 well-defined children were investigated with a battery of accurately described tests, commonly used in clinical practice.

Eye movements were recorded during fixation, smooth-pursuit and saccades using binocular search coils in one monkey with esotropia, three monkeys with exotropia and one normal monkey. 1) Monkeys reared with Alternating Monocular Occlusion or Binocular deprivation (tarsal plates intact) showed both horizontal and vertical misalignment during monocular and binocular viewing. 2) Large 'A' patterns were evident in 2 out of 3 exotropes while a 'V' pattern was observed in the esotrope. 3) Similar 'A\/V' patterns were observed with either eye viewing and during fixation or eye movements. 4) The vertical misalignment, which consisted of the non-viewing eye being higher than the fixating eye, appeared to constitute a DVD. Visual sensory deprivation methods that induce large strabismus also induce 'A\/V' patterns and DVD similar to certain types of human strabismus.

Fifty seven children without any refractive anomaly were tested with the VA child chart if the Nidek SCP 670 projector; 47 children presenting with the refractive anomalies were tested with the same chart. A Kruskal Wallis exact test for singly ordered tables were used to compare VA between those groups and a non-parametric Wilcoxon test for paired samples was used to compare pre- and post-treatment VA in 27 children of the positive group. The mean time necessary to achieve the post-treatment VA was calculated. Median VA: 20\/20 in the control group, 20\/33 in the positive group. The VA difference between the two pre- and post-treatment VA are highly significant. Among the 27 treated children, pre-treatment median VA was 20\/50, post-treatment 20\/20. The differences between the pre- and post-treatment VA was 9 months. The positive group had a significantly lower VA than the control group. In the treated group, treatment initiated at a mean age of 4 years resulted in an increase in VA to that of the control group after an average time of 9 months, encouraging early screening and treatment before VA is measureable in order to shorten this delay.

A calibrated arc perimeter was modified to display one of six randomly presented targets (high contrast Snellen equivalent letters), in both vertical (supra\/infraduction) and horizontal (ab\/adduction) gaze to the dominant eye of 204 healthy volunteers with best-corrected visual acuity. A bite-bar and headrest were employed to prevent head movement. Using a modified method of limits for discrimination threshold, a maximum mean angle of ocular duction was determined by stepping a target out in 5 degrees steps until an error was reported and thereafter bracketing around the limits of the target identification in 1 degrees steps. A mean threshold value was determined as the angle at which a subject obtained a correct response 75% of the time in two and as many as the trails in each of the four randomly presented directions of gaze (abduction, adduction, supraduction and infraduction). A decrease in mean maximum duction angle was found over all age groups in al four directions (p &lt; 0.001), with a step decline beginning in the sixth decade and almost doubling in the oldest age group tested (80-95 years-olds). The percent change in mean maximum angle of duction due to age from the 14-19 to the 80-95 year-olds was: abduction 21%, adduction 24%, supraduction 35%, infraduction 26%. Baseline data are useful to differentiate normal changes occurring with age from early signs of disease. AdditIonally, disease progression and effects of treatment can be monitored.

Records of 17 patients who underwent this surgery between June 2000 and January 2003 were reviewed and analyzed for outcome. Seventeen patients, 18 eyes, mean age 43.7 years (range 5.9 to 71 years) had SO surgery with postoperatively adjustable sutures. Twelve eyes of 11 patients had a loosening procedure, and six eyes had a tightening procedure. Seven of the patients had had precious eye muscle surgery, four having had previous surgery on the same SO tendon. All but one patient returned for the follow-up examination, ranging from 1.5 to 7 months postoperatively. Torsional imbalances in 12 patients improved in all but two. In four patients with a preoperative A pattern, the A pattern improved from 16 PD to 0 PD on average.

The first symptom was sudden occurrence of esotropia at the age of 3 3\/4 years. An accommodative esotropia could be ruled out after the prescription of glasses. The squint angle showed significant variations at distance and near fixation. Eight months after the first examination intense headache appeared. The neuroophthalmologic examination and organic findings were inconspicuous, except for smooth pursuit which showed high latency of the abducting eye on both sides. MRI was performed and showed a 2-cm mass in the upper dorsal vermis diagnosed as pilocyte astrocytoma grade 1. After neurosurgery, the esotropia showed no tendency towards reduction. Four months later, a Faden operation was performed on the internal recti of both eyes, resulting in micro-esotropia. Immediately after eye muscle surgery only the Bagolini-test was positive. Currently, the patient is able to recognize the rings 1-7 in the Titmus-test and the Lang I test.

Of these, 56 had a cycloplegic retinoscopy as a reference measurement. Hyperopia &gt; or =3 dpt, myopia &gt; or =1 dpt, astigmatism &gt; or =1 dpt and anisometropia &gt; or =1 dpt were considered amblyogenic ametropia. Testability was 99.4%. Accuracy was high for cylinder power and axis but poor for the spherical equivalent. Sensitivity was 41% for the detection of amblyogenic hyperopia, 95% for astigmatism and 75% for anisometropia, with specificity values of 92, 79 and 73%. The high testability and accuracy for cylinder power and axis are the strong points. The poor accuracy for the spherical equivalent is probably caused by the lack of cycloplegia. At present, non-cycloplegic autorefractor screening cannot be recommended due to the low specificity. Our findings support the advice that objective refraction in childhood must be performed with cycloplegia. ","610":"Hemangiomas are the most common tumors of the eyelids and orbit in childhood. These tumors can produce ptosis, strabismus and anisometropia, resulting in amblyopia. The treatment of hemangiomas is a challenge with respect to the functional results (prevention of amblyopia) and cosmetic outcome. The history, clinical findings, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), management and outcome of 15 children (3-9 months old) with hemangiomas of the eyelids and\/or orbital involvement are reviewed. Seven patients with small superficial hemangiomas were merely kept under clinical observation. In seven other patients with threatened or existing occlusion of the visual axis or refractive errors, treatment was indicated. Four children were given local Neodymium: YAG-laser therapy. In patients with large subcutaneous eyelid hemangiomas and involvement of the orbita we decided to treat with interstitial Neodymium: YAG-laser therapy in combination with systemic corticosteroids. One patient with an unknown tumor in the medial canthus was diagnosed by biopsy. During the follow-up period of 12-24 months, all untreated patients and 6 of 7 treated children showed involution of their tumors. One patient with a large eyelid and orbital hemangioma with occlusion of the visual axis did not respond to laser therapy and systemic corticosteroids; excision of the tumor was necessary. All children with eyelid hemangiomas with orbital involvement (n = 3) suffered from anisometropia with astigmatism and were treated for amblyopia. During 24 months of amblyopia treatment, the visual acuity improved in two of three cases to 0.4 and 1.0.

Today, the number of visual function tests on the Internet is increasing constantly. Options and limitations of visual function tests using the Internet and the authors' own test results are described. Several visual function tests, such as visual acuity tests, the Amsler-Grid, stereo and color vision tests, can already be given via Internet. The variability of the tests ranges from the simple presentation of graphic elements to the laboriously programmed interactive input by the user to specify the test result. Under standardized examination conditions, there was a very high correspondence between the results of the authors' own web-based color vision test and those of luminescence color test plates and conventional pigment color plates. However, the interpretation of the test results is difficult due to the absence of controls during the test as well as the heterogeneity of the hardware. In order to obtain comparable test results, differences in size and resolution as well as in brightness, contrast and color of computer monitors must be taken into consideration. Due to the deficits described in the tests, the value of visual function tests on the Internet is rather limited. Currently, the data of test distributers with respect to the test conditions are all still insufficient. Standards need to be defined for Internet-based visual function tests. However, visual function tests on the Internet can achieve test results comparable to those of conventional visual function tests under standardized examination conditions in clinical practice.

In MR images of normal subjects, it is demonstrated that the oculomotor nerve, the trochlear nerve and the abducens nerve can be identified not only in the subarachnoid space and cavernous sinus, but also in the orbit. However, a precondition is the use of appropriate imaging sequences and planes (e.g., subarachnoid cisterns: T2-weighted fast spin-echo or T2*-weighted three-dimensional sequences in oblique-axial and sagittal planes; cavernous sinus: contrast-enhanced T1-weighted coronal images; orbit: T1-weighted images without contrast agent in the coronal plane obtained using surface coils). The capability of imaging cranial nerves is clinically important not only for diagnostic purposes in eye muscle palsies but also for planning surgical procedures at the cranio-orbital junction.","613":"The outstanding clinical symptom of acquired uni- and bilateral trochlear palsy is excyclotropia which increases in down-gaze.

The anterior part of the tendon is pulled anteriorly and laterally by a loop of unresorbable suture. This not only increases incyclotorsion but also depression in adduction and reduces the V-pattern. In cases with more than 5 degrees vertical deviation, we performed an additional tuck of the posterior part of the tendon. Our results are compared with those of either superior oblique tuck or combined operations on the oblique muscles published by other authors. They have also used the Harms' tangent screen for quantification of the effect of the operations. In down-gaze, similar results have been obtained but less postoperative Brown's syndrome was found with our modified Harada-Ito procedure. Thus, our modification of the Harada-Ito procedure is an effective and safe approach to the surgical treatment of trochlear palsy with less postoperative limitation of elevation and less torsional overcorrection in up-gaze.","614":"Vision screening was performed on 268 pre-school children: 170 from a private pre-school, 33 from a Caribbean-American parochial pre-school and 65 pre-school children from a clinic serving indigent Spanish farm-workers. Using a multi-station format, a stereoacuity test and two visual acuity tests were performed during a single screening session. The time it took to complete a test was recorded. To pass the screening, children were required to pass one visual acuity test and the stereoacuity test. Children who could not complete the protocol were retested at a later date. Children who failed the screening and every fourth child who passed the screening were referred for a full eye examination. The parents and teachers were masked to the results of the screening as well as the optometrists who performed the eye examination. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy scores were 100%, 79% and 80%, respectively. Three-year-old children completed the Lea Symbol Chart more often than the HOTV. No differences in time required to complete a visual acuity test were found. The Lea Symbol chart is more likely to be completed by young children. Testability changes significantly with age rather than with the instrument when socio-ethnic factors are held constant. Differences among groups and the sensitivity of the screening are discussed.","615":"","616":"To compare the results of manifest refraction obtained with two different hand-held autorefractors (Sure-Sight, Welch Allyn Co. and Retinomax 1, Nikon Inc.) and with the Topcon RMA 6000 on-table autorefractor in order to estimate any potential bias between these refractometers and to compare the diagnostic performances of these two hand-held autorefractors as screening devices. Ninety-eight children were refracted under manifest conditions with the three above-mentioned refractometers and under cycloplegic conditions with the Topcon on-table autorefractor, or by means of retinoscopy. The agreement between the manifest measurements obtained with the three different autorefractors was studied using the method of Bland and Altman. The validity of several thresholds of manifest refractive anomalies as measured with the Sure-Sight and with the Retinomax was estimated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves using cycloplegic measures as reference. results There is a spherical positive bias of 1 D between the Sure-Sight and the Retinomax and better agreement between the Topcon and the Retinomax. The surface area indexes of the ROC curves and the diagnostic performances in term of sensitivity and specificity are better with the Retinomax in cases of hyperopia, astigmatism and anisometropia. For myopia, the Sure-Sight has better performance. The results suggest that either device may be sufficient for assessing refractive errors in children in a screening setting. However, because of a bias between both refractometers in measuring the sphere, distinctive referral criteria must be chosen for the detection of hyperopia and myopia. The diagnostic performance is slightly in favor of the Retinomax. ","617":"A retrospective review of the Toxin Clinic database was carried out over an 18-year period. We identified 68 patients with esotropia of 20 prism dioptres and under who were treated with Botulinum toxin. There were 47 females and 21 males, with a mean age of 34 years (range 11-78 years). Thirty-two (47%) patients had residual esotropia, 20 (29%) had primary esotropia, 11 (16%) had consecutive esotropia, 4 (6%) had secondary esotropia and 1 (1.5%) had a decompensating esophoria. The mean pre-toxin angle was 16 prism dioptres (range 6-20). A total of 434 injections were given, with an average of 6 per patient (range 1-36). Forty-five (66%) patients underwent continued toxin treatment with an interval of 3 to 31 months. Thirteen (19%) patients achieved long-term benefit from only one injection. Seven were unable to demonstrate binocular vision pre-injection but demonstrated it post-injection. Following an initial injection, nine (13%) patients proceeded to surgery. Botulinum toxin was a successful treatment for these patients and was well tolerated, with no side effects. It appears to have a definite role in the treatment of small-angle esotropia.","618":"To study the different ways of expressing the force-elongation relationship in medial rectus muscles in esotropia with and without muscular restriction. Twenty-nine passive force-elongation curves were obtained without restriction (group I, n = 13) and with restriction (group II, n = 10) by means of a manual pachymeter and a digital dynamometer. In group I, the mean age was 14 years and 7 days and the mean esotropia was 53.88(Delta) while in group II the mean age was 35 years and 5 days and the mean esotropia was 60.5(Delta). Comparisons of structural muscular parameters between groups I and II were made for length (38.69 +\/- 0.75 vs. 32.48 +\/- 1.84 mm, p &lt; 0.05), width (8.64 +\/- 0.75 vs. 7.95 +\/- 0.68 mm), thickness (0.67 +\/- 0.07 vs. 0.71 +\/- 0.14 mm), and area (5.79 +\/- 0.73 vs. 5.62 +\/- 1.23 mm2). The differences in width were statistically significant between both groups. As expected, the force-elongation relationship, whether normalized or not, followed an exponential curve. The constant c, which represents force when the elongation is zero, remained the same in all curves. In contrast, the constant b, which represents the slope of the curve, showed a significant difference between the two groups only for the curves of force-absolute elongation and tension-absolute elongation. The results imply that the constant b is better for characterizing the difference between the behavior of the medial rectus in esotropia with and without restriction. In addition, the elongation normalization showed that the contractile component is similar between the two groups and, therefore, the classical way of analysis, which does not employ normalization, is appropriate to correlate muscle properties with clinical findings. ","619":"The Second Cambridge Population Infant Vision Screening Programme using the VPR-1 videorefractor without cycloplegia was undertaken in order to identify those infants with refractive errors who were potentially amblyogenic or strabismogenic. Infants identified at eight months were entered into a control trial of treatment with partial spectacle correction and underwent a long-term follow-up that monitored a wide range of visual, visuoperceptual, visuocognitive, visuomotor, linguistic and social development. In the present paper, the authors report on the outcome measures of visual acuity and strabismus. Poor acuity was defined as a best-corrected acuity of 6\/12 or worse on crowded letters or 6\/9 or worse on single letters, at age 4 years. Acuity was measured in 79 infants who were significantly hyperopic and\/or anisometropic at 11-12 months of age, 23 who showed hyperopia of +3D but less than +3.5D, 196 control subjects, 14 controls with refractive errors, and 126 others who showed an accommodative lag on screening but were not significantly hyperopic on first retinoscopy. There was a poorer acuity outcome in the untreated group of hyperopes compared to controls (p &lt; 0.0001) and to the children who were compliant in spectacle wear (p &lt; 0.001) or who were prescribed spectacles (p &lt; 0.05). Children who were significantly hyperopic at eight months were also more likely to be strabismic by 5.5 years compared to the emmetropic control group (p &lt; 0.001). However, the present study did not find a significant difference in the incidence of strabismus between corrected and uncorrected hyperopic infants. Children who were not refractively corrected for significant hyperopia were four times more likely to have poor acuity at 5.5 years than infants who wore their hyperopic correction, supporting the findings of the First Cambridge Population Infant Vision Screening Programme.","620":"To compare the efficacy of anterior transposition (AT) and graded recession (GR) in the treatment of V- pattern strabismus caused by overaction of the inferior oblique muscle.

However, patients with insufficiently treated amblyopia and strabismus who do not lose their better eye only experience a slight decrease in their quality of life, and such patients occur more frequently. We designed and validated a questionnaire for amblyopia and strabismus in order to assess the decrease in quality of life of such patients. Complaints were collected from outpatients and reduced to five domains, pertaining to distance estimation, visual disorientation, problems with social contacts and cosmetic problems, diplopia, and fear of losing the better eye. For these domains 26 questions were formulated that constitute the Amblyopia &amp; Strabismus Questionnaire (A&amp;SQ). The A&amp;SQ, the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (VFQ-25) and the Short Form-12 Health Survey (SF-12) were presented to 53 healthy controls, 68 outpatients and a cohort of 174 outpatients born between 1962 and 1972 and treated between 1968 and 1974 for amblyopia and strabismus. The quality of life was best in healthy controls and worst in current outpatients, not only on the SF-12 and the VFQ-25 but also on the A&amp;SQ, demonstrating an acceptable construct validity of the A&amp;SQ. The decrease in the quality of life as measured by the A&amp;SQ was most outspoken in our outpatient group of amblyopia and strabismus patients, less in the cohort that had been treated 30 years previously and least in the healthy controls, demonstrating an acceptable discriminatory validity of the A&amp;SQ.","625":"Neurofibromatosis type II (NF II) is rare and most commonly presents with hearing loss, tinnitus and\/or vestibular disturbance in the third decade of life.

There is also a positive forced duction test. A retrospective review of patients diagnosed with sdherence syndrome following strabismus surgery under the care of a single ophthalmologist between 1989 and 2001 was performed. Fourteen patients were identified. All patients were thought to have undergone previous ipsilateral inferior oblique surgery, which was felt to be the cause of the restriction. We usually performed an extensive conjunctival peritomy over nearly 180 degrees, recessing the conjunctiva while leaving the sclera to re-epithelialise, and in addition recessed the inferior rectus by 2.5-3 mm. Only one patient required an additional operation. Of the 11 patients who had undergone surgery at our institution all showed a significant improvement in their symptoms. five were discharged happy, three continue to be followed and three failed to attend further appointments after their initial visit two weeks post-operation. It is not possible to restore normal eye movements in these patients. Our results show that one can improve the appearance in primary position with single vision. Patients should be given realistic expectations before surgery and the limited aims of surgery must be explained. ","627":"To study eye movements in 3D space - saccades, vergence and combined eye movements - in a subject with Manifest Latent Nystagmus (MLN). A 13-year-old girl diagnosed with MLN participated in this study. Saccades, pure vergence along the median plane and combined saccade-vergence movements were recorded under both binocular and monocular viewing. Horizontal eye movements from both eyes were recorded simultaneously with a photoelectric device (Bouis Oculometer). The recordings of saccades, vergence or both components of combined movements show that such movements have a staircase trajectory. The consequence of this staircase behavior is that the time for approaching the target is prolonged. The latency of all types of eye movements is extended when the subject is viewing binocularly, while latency values are normal when viewing monocularly; the difference between the viewing conditions is significant for vergence. The normal latency values under monocular viewing are attributed to facilitation of eye movement initiation by the increased nystagmus.

This is unlike the esotropia seen in patients with high myopia. We reviewed our patient records, finding 26 cases: 14 were female, 12 male. Age range at first presentation was 37-74 with a mean of 55.5. The myopia was from -0.75 to -10.00, with a mean of -5.50 in each eye. Eighteen patients mostly wore glasses, eight mainly wore contact lenses. All complained of horizontal diplopia. Seventeen (65%) had been treated with prisms with a gradual increase in power. Six patients (23%) continued with prisms although surgery has been offered in three cases. Seven patients (27%) had botulinum toxin to one medial rectus muscle. In two cases this proved to be successful maintenance therapy, the remaining five have gone on to have surgery. Seventeen (65%) have undergone surgery (mainly unilateral medial rectus recession and lateral rectus resection) with relief of diplopia and discarding of prisms. Three patients required further surgery for a recurrence after 10-12 years and another is using prisms for a recurrence after 11 years. One patient has suffered an early recurrence 6 months following surgery and is having his neurological work-up repeated.

Twenty-one New Zealand white rabbits were used in this prospective, masked, controlled trial. Both eyes of 20 animals underwent 3-mm recession of the superior rectus muscle (SRM). In group I (io animals), one eye of each animal received topical application of MMC (0.2 mg\/ml) for 5 minutes and the other eye (control eye) was treated with balanced salt solution (BSS) using an intraoperative sponge. In group II (10 animals), a randomly chosen eye of each animal was treated with 5-FU soaked sponges (50 mg\/ml) for 5 minutes and the fellow eye (control eye) with BSS. Two eyes of a rabbit were included as unoperated controls. Four weeks after the surgery, conjunctival vascularity and postoperative adhesions between the SRM Tenon's capsule (TC) and SRM sclera (scl) were assessed. Additionally, eyes were enucleated and evaluated histopathologically for evidence of scarring, granuloma formation, and muscle tissue changes under a light microscope. MMC-treated eyes had a higher rate of avascular conjunctiva compared to both controls and 5-FU-treated eyes. Mean adhesion scores, particularly between the SRM-scl, were lower in eyes treated with antiproliferative agents compared to controls. The difference was statistically significant in MMC-treated eyes for the adhesions between SRM-scl (p = 0.03). Histopathological examination revealed less scarring and granuloma formation in MMC- and 5-FU-treated eyes compared to their control eyes. MMC, and to a lesser extent 5-FU, are shown to be effective in reducing postoperative scarring following strabismus surgery in rabbits. It seems reasonable to suggest that antimetabolites should be used for cases having an increased risk of postoperative adhesions.

In 67 cases of StS, angles of strabismus were measured before and after patching the affected eye for three days. Horizontal, vertical and torsional deviations were measured in front of the tangent screen of Harms in nine directions of gaze. After OT, most cases of StS showed the following distribution of vertical deviation (VD) on horizontal versions: setting the VD in 30 degrees adduction to 100%, VD in primary position (PP) was 50%, VD in abduction 14%, excyclotropia in PP about 40% of the amount of VD. Those StS-cases showing the same distribution of VD on horizontal versions before and after OT were called 'typical' ones (27% of the patients). However, 73% of the patients showed a different distribution before OT: 68% VD in PP, 36% VD in abduction, excyclotropia of 20% in PP. After OT these cases converted to the normal pattern described above: VD in PP was 53 % and VD in 30 degrees abduction was 19%, excyclotropia in PP was 36%. In 'typical' StS-cases, OT is not necessary. 'Atypical' cases, however, can be converted into 'typical' ones: they get more incomitant VD on horizontal versions and greater excyclotropia in PP. As VD in adduction remains almost the same in both groups after OT, surgery can be based on the angle in adduction. In individual 'atypical' patients the amount of oblique muscle surgery has to be modified after OT. ","632":"The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the retroequatorial recession technique in the surgical treatment of nystagmus and associated strabismus. The effect of large recessions of four horizontal extraocular muscles was analyzed qualitatively in seven patients with congenital nystagmus. The ages of the patients ranged between 12 and 42 years (mean, 21.5 years). Of the seven patients, four had motor and three had sensory nystagmus. Visual acuity increased in five (71.4%) patients. Planned recovery of associated strabismus was attained in six patients (85.7%). In five patients who had abnormal head position, the head positions and nystagmus intensities were found to be decreased. No postoperative complication, such as diplopia, was encountered. The retroequatorial recession technique is preferable in patients who have congenital nystagmus, especially in the presence of horizontal squint associated with low visual acuity, because of its success in increasing visual acuity and decreasing the amplitude of nystagmus, its reversibility, making posssible new operations in the future, as well as the absence of any significant complications.

In this prospective study, we evaluated 78 patients undergoing medial rectus recession surgery. Thirty-eight patients were operated by a one-stage technique in which the whole operation was done under topical anesthesia and adjustment was done on the operating table, while 40 patients were operated by a two-stage technique in which the operation was done under general anesthesia and adjustment was done the following day at the patient's bedside. The results were recorded and compared according to the parameters given above. A scoring system was used to assess all these parameters except for stability. The stability of the procedures was evaluated according to the degrees of squint immediately after the adjustment and at least three months thereafter. There was no significant difference between the procedures with regard to stability and ocular pain. During the early postoperative period, the level of consciousness was better and nausea and vomiting occurred less frequently in the patients operated by the one-stage procedure. Postoperative activity and oral intake returned to normal status more quickly in the one-stage group and the one-stage procedure was cost-effective. We conclude that although both procedures provide satisfactory and stable results, the one-stage procedure has significant advantages over the two-stage procedure for medial rectus recession surgery in suitable cases.

Seven hundred eyes of patients that had undergone strabismus surgery (1121 procedures) were examined postoperatively by indirect ophthalmoscopy. In the experimental component, 20 rabbit eyes were perforated with a 6-0 polyglactin suture. In each rabbit, one eye acted as a control while the other eye received a 20 seconds application of prophylactic cryo at the perforation site. They were then monitored for 6 weeks before subjecting some to histopathological examination by light and electron microscopy. Ten scleral perforations were detected in 9 of the patients (incidence of 1.42% of the eyes and 0.89% of the strabismus procedures). In the rabbits, a chorioretinal scar was seen in all perforated eyes. A mild cryo reaction was observed in the cryoed eyes. No other sequelae were seen. Histopathologic studies showed changes consistent with the normal healing process. Of the human eyes screened, 1.42% showed evidence of scleral perforation following strabismus surgery. In no case were sequelae leading to visual loss observed. In the rabbits no sequelae were observed at 6 weeks of follow-up apart from a chorioretinal scar and a cryoreaction in those eyes in which cryoprophylaxis had been given. Mild cryoprophylaxis did not exert any positive or negative influence on the natural course of scleral perforation in our short-term animal study.

However, its usage is increasing and in some centres is routine. The present authors propose that the routine use of the adjustable suture technique can only be justified if it can be shown to confer an advantage to the patient. In a retrospective analysis of matched data, they compared the results of their adjustable with non-adjustable strabismus surgery. The adjustable suture procedures performed during a 5-year period, on non-thyroid eye disease patients, were matched to non-adjustable cases according to the type and aetiology of strabismus and the magnitude of deviation. Pairs were matched as closely as possible according to age and strabismus surgery history. All cases were incomitant. The surgical results of the two groups were analysed with regard to the pre-operative and post-operative angles of deviation, the post-operative drift, and a successful outcome, pre-defined by carefully selected criteria. Twenty-six cases were analysed in each of the two groups. Mean pre- and post-operative angles of deviation showed no significant difference between the two groups. 'Success' rates were 81% in the adjustable group and 88% in the non-adjustable group. Given that the success rate of the two techniques is similarly high, a much larger study is required to detect a difference in results, with statistical significance. The authors conclude that there is currently insufficient evidence that patients, without thyroid eye disease, benefit from the longer and potentially uncomfortable procedure of adjustable suture strabismus surgery to support its rapidly growing use and that a prospective randomised controlled trial is indicated.","637":"","638":"","639":"Craniosynostosis syndromes can be associated with missing extraocular muscles, or muscles with abnormal insertions, and so provide useful test cases for assessing our understanding of the mechanics of the extraocular muscles. Patient with craniosynostosis syndromes often show eye movements in which a horizontal movement by one eye is accompanied by upshoot or downshoot in the other eye. An hypothesis which has been put forward to explain these movements is that the muscles in the patients are excyclorotated and that the upshoots and downshoots follow directly from the application of Hering's law of equal innervation. We modelled the mechanics of the excyclorotated muscles and verified this hypothesis. However, excyclorotation of the orbit often occurs in combination with anomalous muscle anatomy in craniosynostosis syndromes. In keeping with this finding, we have found that surgical transposition of the rectus muscles is insufficient by itself to correct the anomalous eye movements, but that transposition in combination with weakening of the obliques is effective.","640":"The purpose of this paper is to give a brief overview on the application of multifocal stimulation techniques in ophthalmology. The use of m-sequences as a stimulus sequence allows a high-resolution topographic mapping of sensory function. Outer retinal dysfunction can readily be detected with the multifocal ERG (mfERG). When the inner retinal contribution to the mfERG response is enhanced through adapting the stimulation sequence, the sensitivity of the mfERG to detect retinal dysfunction in glaucoma can be increased. Testing of the entire visual pathway with multifocal cortical evoked visual potentials is also possible and recent studies have focused on reducing interindividual variability. The use of m-sequence stimulation in magnetic encephalography offers new ways to study visual processing without the need to apply electrodes.","641":"In this paper, the authors investigate whether the idea of independent control of version and vergence eye movements is compatible with the mechanics of the eye plant. By computing the change in the axes of action of the eye muscles as a function of ocular vergence, they prove that, regardless of the muscle pulley locations, the required muscle activity for vertical version depends on the initial vergence angle. The binocular extension of Listing's law ('L2') describes how the torsional orientation of the eye depends on both gaze direction and ocular convergence. The authors show that for each vergence angle there is a range of possible muscle pulley locations that would cause independent control of version and vergence to result in L2. They also show that this mechanical explanation of L2 requires that the muscle pulleys move as a function of vergence.","642":"To elucidate the etiology of an acquired, restrictive motility disorder in patients with high myopia. Thirty-three orbits were imaged using a Siemens Magnetom or Siemens Vision (both 1.5 Tesla) MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scanner, applying a head coil. Coronal T1-weighted, spin-echo images were obtained. Orbits of three different patient groups were analyzed. Group 1 (n = 14): patients with high axial myopia and restricted eye motility (average axial length = 31.4 mm; refractive error more than -15 D). Group 2 (n = 8): subjects with high axial myopia and normal eye motility (average axial length = 29.2 mm). Controls (n = 11): emmetropic subjects with normal eye motility. Highly myopic patients showed significant displacements of recti EOMs in comparison to the controls. Mean displacements as measured in the plane 3 mm anterior to the globe-optic nerve junction in primary gaze were, in group 1: lateral rectus (LR) 2.9 mm (2.5 downward, 1.4 medial), medial rectus (MR) 1.3 mm downward. In group 2: LR 1.4 mm (1.3 downward, 0.6 medial) and MR 1.2 mm downward. In both groups 1 and 2, the inferior rectus (IR) was displaced 1.3 mm medially and upwards. In both groups of myopic patients the superior rectus (SR) was displaced 1.5 mm medially and downwards. In patients with high axial myopia, displacements of all recti EOMs can be detected by MRI. However, displacement of the LR into the lateral and inferior quadrant of the orbit is significantly greatest. We therefore assume LR displacement to be a major pathophysiological factor for the restrictive motility disorder in high myopia. EOM dislocations can be explained by myopia-associated alterations in the orbital connective tissues confining EOM positions in relation to the orbital wall. ","643":"The assumption that there is an oculomotor plant, a fixed relationship between motoneuron firing rate and eye position, is disproved by brainstem recording studies showing that this relationship depends on which supernuclear subsystem determines firing rate. But it remains possible that there is a final common path (FCP), a fixed relationship between firing rate and muscle force. But then, brainstem recording studies predict that lateral rectus (LR) forces (and probably medial rectus (MR) forces, as well) will be higher in converged than in unconverged gaze for a given eye position. We recently measured these forces and found that they are slightly lower in convergence, disproving the FCP hypothesis. Thus, even the relationship between motoneuron firing rate and muscle force is under supernuclear control. What peripheral oculomotor articulations could vary the relationship of firing rate to muscle force?: (1) Actively movable EOM pulleys could alter oculorotary muscle force for a given oculorotory innervation by altering muscle lengths. (2) 'Outer' motoneurons may function as gamma efferents in conjunction with palisade endings and non-twitch global EOM fibers. (3) Complex nonlinear interactions likely arise among both parallel and serially connected muscle fibers.","644":"The purpose of this study was to retrospectively address the referral patterns of patients with orbital injuries presenting to the Orthoptic Clinic, to document the types of injury sustained and corresponding ocular motility defects, and to evaluate the eventual ocular motility outcome of these patients. This study documented the findings of orthoptic and ophthalmic investigations, history of orbital injury and surgical details where applicable. Case notes of 30 patients were reviewed, of which 22 had an orbital fracture and eight a soft tissue injury. The severity of injury, referral pattern to either maxillofacial or ophthalmology units, and age at time of injury were compared to eventual ocular motility outcome. Despite there being more patients referred initially to the maxillofacial unit, there was no significant difference in outcome regardless of route of referral, type of injury or age at time of injury.

Strabismus is common in thyroid eye disease and frequently follows decompression surgery. We retrospectively reviewed patients undergoing endoscopic decompression for thyroid eye disease, by a single surgeon, from 1994 to 2000. Twenty-three patients (21 female, 2 male) were identified with a mean age of 47.5 years. At presentation, 21 patients had proptosis, 8 optic nerve compression (2 without proptosis) and 11 strabismus (9 complained of diplopia) with a mean BSV score of 24.5 before decompression. Forty orbits were decompressed with a mean decrease in proptosis of 3.3 mm. Following decompression, the mean BSV score was 25, and 17 patients had manifest strabismus in primary gaze (3 at near only) of whom 10 had pre-existing strabismus. Five patients had new diplopia (22%). Eleven patients ultimately required strabismus surgery of whom 8 had manifest strabismus before decompression. Following strabismus surgery, the mean BSV score was 37. The final BSV score for those not requiring strabismus surgery was 29. Mean follow-up was 28 months. Endoscopic orbital decompression can effectively treat disfiguring proptosis. Diplopia is a common complication, but pre-existing diplopia may improve.","647":"Duane retraction syndrome is an ocular motility disorder with which an increasing number of congenital abnormalities appear to be associated. In the present paper the authors report a case of bilateral Duane retraction syndrome with an extraordinary hand abnormality. Numerous theories concerning the etiology and pathogenesis of Duane retraction syndrome and its relationship to the associated findings have been proposed, but the exact mechanism is still under investigation. Further multi-centered studies and the classification of the associated clinical findings in an organized manner may help to explain this mechanism.","648":"To arrive at an understanding of the differences in gene and protein expression between human lateral and medial rectus muscle tissue excised from strabismic patients. Resected fragments of the lateral and medial rectus muscles obtained during strabismus surgery were frozen under liquid nitrogen and pulverized by a Freezer\/Mill system. Radiolabelled cDNA was synthesized from polyA+ RNA and hybridized with a gene array nylon membrane (Atlas Human 1.2 Array) to detect the difference in gene expression between the lateral and medial rectus muscles. Based on the gene array results, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1 and 2, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-4 were measured in solubilized muscle tissues by enzyme immunoassay and normalized by unit length of resection. The resected lateral rectus muscle had significantly smaller amounts of TIMP-1, TIMP-2 and BMP-4 but larger amounts of MMP-2 compared to the medial rectus muscle (P &lt; 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test). The amounts of TIMP-1 in the muscle when the lateral and medial rectus were combined were positively correlated with TIMP-2 and BMP-4, while the amounts of TIMP-2 positively correlated with BMP-4 (P &lt; 0.001, Spearman rank correlation test). The amounts of BMP-4 in both muscles increased significantly with age (P = 0.0003). Resected tissue from the lateral and medial rectus muscles had different levels of expression of TIMP-1 and 2, MMP-2, and BMP-4. These molecular differences may underlie different characteristics of the two extraocular muscles and may also influence the process of wound healing after strabismus surgery. ","649":"For many years, attempts have been made to find an easy, efficient and inexpensive method to screen children for amblyogenic ametropia. Wave-front analysis is a new way to determine the refractive state of the eye from a distance. This technique could be a useful tool for infant screening. The purpose of the study was the evaluation of the efficacy of a commercially available wave-front analyzing autorefractometer (SureSight, software version 2.0, Welch Allyn, Skaneateles Falls, NY 13153, U.S.A.) in detecting amblyogenic ametropia in patients with and without cycloplegia. 256 eyes (-28.25 D to +7.88 D spherical equivalent) of 128 patients (1-81 years) were examined with the wave-front autorefractometer under cycloplegia. Prior to this investigation, 108 eyes (-21.38 D to 75 D) of 54 of these patients (1-76 years) were refracted without cycloplegia. The readings of the wave-front autorefractometer were compared with the results of retinoscopy under cycloplegia. Without cycloplegia, the sensitivity in detecting any amblyogenic ametropia such as anisometropia, astigmatism, myopia or hyperopia was 94%, while the specificity was 63%. Following cycloplegia, the sensitivity decreased to 87% and the specificity increased to 80%. Wave-front analyzing refractometry is highly applicable for infant screening. At the present state of development, the efficacy in detecting amblyogenic ametropia is similar to that of other screening techniques and instruments that operate from distance. Cycloplegia enhances the sensitivity in detecting hyperopia and decreases the sensitivity in detecting astigmatism. ","650":"","651":"The authors wished to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of retroequatorial recession of all four horizontal recti using loop sutures for the treatment of congenital nystagmus Twelve patients with congenital nystagmus were enrolled in this prospective study. All patients underwent retroequatorial recession of horizontal recti with loop sutures. All recti were recessed 8 mm measuring from the insertion, then the amount of loop suture was determined according to the preoperative ocular alignment of the patients. Electronystagmographic recordings were made in every patient preoperatively and postoperatively as well as an ophthalmological examination. The follow-up period ranged from 6 to 26 months. All four horizontal recti were recessed 9 to 12 mm including the loop suture (range 1-4 mm). Compared to preoperative values, postoperative amplitude and intensity of nystagmus decreased statistically significantly in all patients (p = 0.002). The postoperative decrease in the frequency of nystagmus was not statistically significant (p = 0.173). Improvement of both distance and near visual acuity was achieved in 10 patients. Five of seven patients who had ocular misalignment preoperatively were aligned within 10 PD postoperatively. Improvement in head posture was seen in two of three patients. The authors determined that the improvement in the nystagmus characteristics was most prominent in the immediate postoperative period. Retroequatorial recession of all four horizontal recti using loop sutures is a safe and effective procedure for the management of congenital nystagmus. ","652":"It is generally agreed that vertical prism bar training can increase vertical fusion amplitude. However, little is known as to whether the increased vertical fusion amplitude following vergence exercise is due to improvement of the sensory or the motor system or both. The main aim of the present study was to determine the effect of vertical prism bar training on the motor and sensory components of vertical fusion. Fifty normal subjects between 17 and 25 years of age were given vertical prism bar training to improve their vertical fusion amplitude. Vertical vergence eye movements were recorded using an infrared reflectance eye tracker system. The sensory component was assessed using a Sheedy disparometer. The findings of the present study showed that the average increase in vertical motor fusion was approximately 30% following vertical prism bar training. The maximum magnitude of VFD remained unchanged in the majority (73%) of subjects. The increase in the vertical fusion amplitude following vertical prism bar training is largely due to improvements in the vertical motor fusion. The prism training has little effect on the sensory component. ","653":"To study saccades, vergence and combined eye movements in a case of Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome. A 16-year-old girl with congenital partial third cranial nerve palsy, with ptosis and divergent strabismus dependent on viewing distance, participated in this study. A first operation for her ptosis was done seven years ago and an operation for her strabismus was done four years ago. The day of our oculomotor test, the patient had a residual exotropia of 12 prism diopters, mild amblyopia of the left eye and no binocular vision. LEDs on a table placed at eye level were used to stimulate saccades, pure vergence along the median plane and combined saccade-vergence movements. Horizontal eye movements from both eyes were recorded simultaneously with a photoelectric device (Bouis Oculometer). The binocular coordination of saccades in this subject was unstable and more variable than normal, and there was divergent post-saccadic drift, i.e., in the direction of her residual deviation. The patient had difficulty making movements in space, particularly vergence eye movements. Pure saccades and combined movements showed abnormally long latencies and marked hypometrias. The velocity of pure saccades was normal. In contrast, the velocity of saccades in the combined movements was abnormally slow. The long latency and the low accuracy of the eye movements in natural space indicate a general deficit in the central circuitry that controls the initiation and programming of all these types of eye movements. The absence of pure vergence and the slowness of the saccades in the combined movements could be due to a brainstem deficit specific to the vergence oculomotor system. ","654":"The aim of this study was to compare the visual acuity measured by visual tracking and by preferential looking. We examined 51 healthy full-term infants between three and 93 days of age. Visual acuity was tested with two different methods. One method was visual tracking (smooth and saccadic pursuit), recorded with an infrared photo-oculographic technique. For stimulation of visual tracking a square of 9.4 degrees of visual angle with vertical gratings (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 cycles per degree) moved at a constant velocity of 7.5 degrees\/sec. for 38 sec. on a surface of equal luminance. The other method was preferential looking, determined by a second examiner, where we used plates with vertical gratings (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2 and 6.4 cycles per degree). The comparison of the two methods shows a significant correlation (p &lt; 0.05). Visual acuity determined by visual tracking is lower than the acuity determined by preferential looking in the first 14 weeks of age. Our study shows that visual tracking is a valid method for visual acuity testing in infants. The need of sustained attention is a possible reason for the lower values in comparison with the acuity determined by preferential looking. ","655":"The purpose of this study was to measure whether emmetropisation failed in children who had strabismus irrespective of their refraction in infancy, and to record simultaneous changes in anisometropia. We also report how often hypermetropia increased before these children presented with esotropia. A total of 2920 infants had a cycloplegic retinoscopy at age 5-7 months and again at 42 months or when defective vision was identified. Changes of refraction in 210 children with strabismus are compared with the remaining 2710 who did not. When the spherical equivalent of the fixing eyes was &gt; +2.75 D in infancy, hypermetropia decreased less in both eyes of those who had microtropia (p &lt;.001) and heterotropia (p &lt;.001) than in normal children. When it was &lt; +2.75 D, the spherical and\/or cylindrical refraction more often remained outside the 'normal' range in both eyes of those who had microtropia and heterotropia (p &lt;.05). Emmetropisation was deficient in both eyes of at least 80% of these strabismic children irrespective of their refraction in infancy. Furthermore, in the strabismic children, the mean change of refraction was less (p &lt;.05) in their fellow eyes than in their fixing eyes, the difference between the two eyes being on average three times greater than that in those who had normal vision. Thus, anisometropia increased in 53% of those who had strabismus but remained within normal limits (&lt; ca. 0.75 D spherical equivalent) in 94 % of those who did not. 'Abnormal' anisometropia in infancy did not, per se, permanently affect vision because 72% of all those who had it did not have strabismus. Finally, the spherical hypermetropia of fixing eyes increased in only 35% of the children with esotropia - similar to the incidence in those who had a microtropia (p =.36). This does not obviously support the concept that increasing hypermetropia causes accommodation to increase before convergence.","656":"","657":"","658":"Important aspects of ocular kinematics relate to the geometric configuration of extraocular muscles (EOMs). The orbital layer of each rectus EOM inserts on a connective tissue ring called a pulley that deflects the EOM path. Global layer fibers of each EOM pass through the pulley to insert on the sclera. The orbital layer thus controls linear translation of the pulley, regulating the EOM's pulling direction, while the global layer rotates the eye. The active pulley hypothesis (APH) states that pulleys are actively positioned to regulate ocular kinematics. The coordinated control postulate of the APH proposes that during conjugate visually guided eye movements, rectus pulleys move the same anteroposterior distance as their insertions, but the inferior oblique pulley moves with vertical gaze by half the amount as the inferior rectus insertion. These motions, observable by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), shift the pulling directions of these EOMs by half the ocular angle, mechanically implementing a 'linear oculomotor plant' appearing mathematically commutative to the brain and consistent with Listing's Law of ocular torsion. In the non-converged state with the head upright and stationary, rectus pulleys move little transverse to the EOM axes. During convergence and during the static torsional vestibulo-ocular reflex, MRI shows that the rectus pulley array rotates around the line of sight. Oblique EOM orbital layers may implement this shift.","659":"Eye-hand coordination is complicated by the fact that the eyes are constantly in motion relative to the head. This poses problems in interpreting the spatial information gathered from the retinas and using this to guide hand motion. In particular, eye-centered visual information must somehow be spatially updated across eye movements to be useful for future actions, and these representations must then be transformed into commands appropriate for arm motion. In this review, we present evidence that early visuomotor representations for arm movement are remapped relative to the gaze direction during each saccade. We find that this mechanism holds for targets in both far and near visual space. We then show how the brain incorporates the three-dimensional, rotary geometry of the eyes when interpreting retinal images and transforming these into commands for arm movement. Next, we explore the possibility that hand-eye alignment is optimized for the eye with the best field of view. Finally, we describe how head orientation influences the linkage between oculocentric visual frames and bodycentric motor frames. These findings are framed in terms of our 'conversion-on-demand' model, in which only those representations selected for action are put through the complex visuomotor transformations required for interaction with objects in personal space, thus providing a virtual on-line map of visuomotor space.","660":"Models of the oculomotor plant (globe, muscles, pulleys, and orbital tissues) fall into three categories: 1). one-dimensional dynamic with lumped plant elements, 2). three-dimensional dynamic with lumped plant elements, or 3). three-dimensional static with distinct plant elements. The second class of models is most often used when studying the neural control of 3-D eye movement, because they best represent the plant dynamics. However, they are often faulted because they make two unrealistic assumptions: 1). muscle pairs act along the three orthogonal axes (symmetry assumption); and 2). the force generated by the muscles depends only on their innervation (force assumption). It turns out that the symmetry assumption is quite benign, because in a realistic model of the plant the deviations from orthogonal axes can be easily accounted for by simple adjustments to the innervation. In contrast, the force assumption introduces some serious problems. In the present paper, the authors show that a realistic, dynamic model of the geometry of the orbit, with independent muscles, makes different predictions than a similar model with lumped muscles. This difference arises because muscle force is a function of both innervation and muscle length.","661":"In animals with binocular depth vision, or stereopsis, the visual fields of the two eyes overlap, shrinking the overall field of view. Eye movements increase the field of view, but they also complicate the first stage of stereopsis: the search for corresponding images on the two retinas. If the eyes were stationary in the head, corresponding images would always lie on retina-fixed bands called epipolar lines. Because the eyes rotate, the epipolar lines move on the retinas. Therefore, the stereoptic system has a choice: it may monitor eye position to keep track of the epipolar lines, or it may give up on tracking epipolar lines and instead search for matches over retina-fixed regions, but in that case the search regions must be 2-D patches, large enough to encompass all possible locations of the epipolar lines in all usual eye positions. We use a new type of random-dot stereogram to show that human stereopsis uses large, retina-fixed search zones. We show that the brain somewhat reduces the size of these search zones by rotating the eyes about their lines of sight in a way that reduces the motion of the epipolar lines. These findings show the link between sensory and motor processes: by considering eye motion we can understand why the brain searches for matching images over 2-D retinal regions rather than along epipolar lines; and by considering retinal correspondence we appreciate why the eyes rotate as they do about their lines of sight.","662":"To compare the retinal nerve fiber layer [RNFL] thickness of the amblyopic eye with that of the normal eye in patients with anisometropic and strabismic amblyopia. Scanning laser polarimetry was performed with the GDx Nerve Fiber Analyzer (NFA), a scanning laser ophthalmoscope that measures the thickness of the peripapillary RNFL quantitatively and objectively, in vivo, based on the birefringence of the RNFL. Eighteen anisometropic, two strabismic and four combined amblyopic (both anisometropia and strabismus) patients were enrolled in the study. There were 9 male and 15 female patients, age range 7-66 years. Using Student's t-test, 14 GDx parameters in the amblyopic eyes and sound eyes were compared. The GDx parameters showed no significant differences between the two groups [p &gt; 0.5]. The superior average and inferior average values were 79.50 microm and 80.41 microm, respectively, in the amblyopic group, and 80.75 microm and 82.75 microm, respectively, in the healthy eyes. The average thickness did not differ between amblyopic and sound eyes (65.50 microm and 66.45 microm, respectively). Assessment of RNFL thickness by means of scanning laser polarimetry revealed no difference between the two eyes in patients with unilateral amblyopia. ","663":"","664":"Patients with skull defects sometimes develop neurological deficits, which have been grouped under \"the syndrome of the trephined\". The deficits are usually nonspecific or nonlocalizing, such as apathy or diffuse headaches. We report, to our knowledge, a first case of severe midbrain syndrome associated with a skull defect. Cranioplasty dramatically resolved the patient's symptoms. A midbrain syndrome represents the main manifestation of the syndrome of the trephined and can be corrected by cranioplasty. A 38-year-old man with head trauma and epidural hematoma initially had normal eye motility. He developed a skull defect after infection following cranioplasty. He presented with onset of neurological symptoms one year after head trauma with a skull defect, a small divergent and vertical strabismus, elevation deficit of both eyes, headaches and fatigue. Over several months he developed severe bilateral deficit of adduction, elevation, depression and convergence. He had neuropsychological deficits, fatigue, headaches and impaired coordination. Neuroimaging and lumbar puncture did not show evidence of increased intracranial pressure or hydrocephalus. Cranioplasty using Palacos was performed one-and-a-half years after trauma. Immediately after surgery, the patient noted remarkable improvement in his symptoms. Headaches and fatigue disappeared within two days. Two weeks after cranioplasty the patient had orthotropia and virtually normal ocular motility. Neurological symptoms completely disappeared. Recovery remained sustained for over 5 years after cranioplasty. To our knowledge, this represents the first case of the syndrome of the trephined in which the neurological deficits map primarily to the brainstem and show rapid improvement following cranioplasty. We show that cranioplasty in patients with large skull defects is indicated for more then cosmetic reasons and should be considered even after longer periods following a trauma. ","665":"A battery of 22 tests is described, intended to give an integrated assessment of children's functional visual capacities between birth and four years of age. As well as sensory visual measures such as acuity, visual fields and stereopsis, the battery is intended to tap a range of perceptual, motor, spatial and cognitive aspects of visual function. Tests have been drawn from practice in ophthalmology and orthoptics, vision research, paediatric neurology, and developmental psychology to give an overall view of children's visual competences for guidance in diagnosis, further investigation, management and rehabilitation of children with developmental disorders. 'Core vision tests' require no motoric capacities beyond saccadic eye movements or linguistic skills and so assess basic visual capacities in children of any age. 'Additional tests' have age-specific requirements and are designed to pinpoint specific deficits in the perceptual, visuo-motor and spatio-cognitive domains. Normative data are reported on nine age groups between 0-6 weeks and 31-36 months, each including 32-43 typically developing children. Pass\/fail criteria for each test are defined. These data allow the selection of a subset of tests for each age group which are passed by at least 85% of normally developing children, and so are appropriate for defining normal development. The normalized battery has been applied to a range of at-risk and clinical groups. Aspects of children's visual performance are discussed in relation to neurobiological models of visual development.","666":"A 7-week-old infant with sudden onset adduction deficit and proptosis is reported. The main differential diagnoses included orbital myositis, orbital cellulitis, capillary haemangioma and rhabdomyosarcoma. A CT scan revealed a postseptal cellulitis-like picture with thickening of the medial rectus muscle. He was given a course of antibiotics, withholding steroids and biopsy. His condition resolved completely on high-dose antibiotics alone. To our knowledge this is the youngest patient with infectious orbital myositis and postseptal cellulitis described in the literature. The clinical course emphasizes the importance of administering sufficiently high doses of antibiotics.","667":"","668":"Our aim was to evaluate the binocular visual function in congenital esotropia after bimedial rectus recession with loop suture and to address the factors that could take part in the attainment of binocular function. Forty children with congenital esotropia who were operated on between 12 and 48 months of age were included in the study group. Postoperative follow-up ranged from 2 to 10 years. In order to determine the factors affecting the sensory results in congenital esotropia, we classified our patients into two groups according to their fusion status. We compared the preoperative and postoperative characteristics of patients in these two groups. Twenty-one of 40 patients (52.5%) fused the Worth four-dot at near (Group 1), 19 patients (47.5%) did not (Group 2) at the final examination. No patient showed evidence of stereopsis. We found significant differences between these two groups in respect to the final angle of vertical deviation, the age at surgery, the presence of postoperative inferior oblique overaction, dissociated vertical deviation and abnormal head position. Correlation analysis revealed that early alignment of the eyes and the absence of postoperative vertical deviation were associated with increased incidence of achieving some degree of binocular vision. In congenital esotropia, not all infants may have the potential for normal binocular function owing to yet unknown constitutional factors. We determined that achieving some degree of binocular function may be related to early alignment of the eyes. Additionally, close follow-up and precise treatment of the accompanying vertical deviation, especially inferior oblique overaction and dissociated vertical deviation, in a timely manner may enhance the attainment of binocular sensory function. ","669":"Patients with bilateral superior oblique palsies may complain of diplopia and torsion, especially in downgaze. They are difficult to manage surgically, although bilateral modified Harada-Ito procedures may be of value. A retrospective review was carried out of patients treated with bilateral Fells' modified Harada-Ito procedures for bilateral superior oblique palsy between 1989 and March 2000, the patients being identified from operating records. Twenty-three patients were identified (9 females and 14 males) with a mean age at presentation of 37 years (range 19 to 75). In 20 cases (87%) the aetiology was trauma (14 due to traffic accidents). All patients had diplopia at presentation (3 specifically mentioned torsion) with a mean duration of 22.5 months. Eleven patients had abnormal head postures and 13 were binocular. Mean vertical deviation was 3.2(delta)for distance and 4(delta)for near. Maximum torsion ranged from 5 degrees (previous surgery) to 24 degrees excylotorsion with a mean of 13 degrees. Thirteen patients had a V pattern. After surgery the mean vertical deviation was 1.5(delta )for distance and 1(delta)for near. Ten patients were symptom free, 8 had reduced diplopia and 5 were unchanged. The worst torsion post-op ranged from 1 degrees of intorsion to 11 degrees of excyclotorsion (mean 4 degrees ). Further vertical muscle surgery was required in 10 (43%) patients. Mean follow-up was 13.5 months. In these patients bilateral modified Harada-Ito procedures successfully reduced torsion and decreased symptoms. Many patients require subsequent surgery to improve other aspects of their motility problem. ","670":"Is Listing's law a consequence of 2D control of eye positioning, where eye torsion is determined by the biomechanical properties of the orbit, or is it a reflection of full 3D neuronal control? This was investigated by observing the influence of a change in mechanical properties of the eye socket on 3D eye movements. The shape and relative orientation of displacement planes were measured using scleral search coils before and after operation of five patients with strabismus. The operation influenced the shape of displacement planes in both eyes of all patients. After the operation, most patients obeyed Listing's law more accurately: a monocular, surgically induced, orbital change caused binocular improvements of torsional control. The relative orientation of planes also changed, but no clear relationship was found between the type of operation and the direction of rotation. The results suggest that Listing's law is not just a result of the biomechanical properties of the eye socket, but has a neural basis.","671":"In a population-based infant vision screening programme, 5295 infants were screened and those with significant refractive errors were followed up. To assess the relationship between the development of vision and other domains, we report a longitudinal study comparing infants with significant hyperopia, identified at age 9 months ('hyperopes') with infants with normal refractions ('controls'). Children are included who completed at each age a broad set of visual, cognitive, motor and language measures taken over a series of follow-up visits up to age 5.5 years. Hyperopes performed significantly worse than controls on the Atkinson Battery of Child Development for Examining Functional Vision at 14 months and 3.5 years and the Henderson Movement Assessment Battery for Children at 3.5 and 5.5 years. The Griffiths Child Development Scales, MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory and British Picture Vocabulary Scales showed no significant differences. Exclusion of those infants who became amblyopic and strabismic did not substantially alter these results, suggesting that the differences between groups were not a consequence of these disorders. These results indicate that early hyperopia is associated with a range of developmental deficits that persist at least to age 5.5 years. These effects are concentrated in visuocognitive and visuomotor domains rather than the linguistic domain.","672":"The immature visual system is vulnerable to adverse events. Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), an end-stage lesion after hypoxia-ischemia at gestational age 24-34 weeks affecting the visual radiation, has become a principal cause of visual impairment in children. Cerebral visual dysfunction caused by PVL is characterized by delayed visual maturation, subnormal visual acuity, crowding, visual field defects, and visual perceptual-cognitive problems. Magnetic resonance imaging is the method of choice for diagnosing this brain lesion, which is associated with optic disk abnormalities, strabismus, nystagmus, and deficient visually guided eye movements. Children with PVL may present to the ophthalmologist within a clinical spectrum from severe visual impairment in combination with cerebral palsy to only early-onset esotropia, normal intellectual level and no cerebral palsy. Optimal educational and habilitational strategies need to be developed to meet the needs for this group of children.","673":"Congenital and acquired nystagmus, particularly pendular and jerk nystagmus, see-saw nystagmus and spasmus nutans, may be the presenting sign of a suprasellar mass lesion.(1) The large variety of different suprasellar mass lesions requiring quite different therapeutic measures necessitates exact histological diagnosis for optimal therapeutic strategy planning.(2) Stereotactic tumor biopsy has become a well-established diagnostic approach, combining minimal surgical trauma with a high degree of diagnostic safety. Particularly in the two most frequent suprasellar mass lesions - craniopharyngiomas and pilocytic astrocytomas - accurately planned stereotactic drainage of tumor cysts combined with radiotherapy and\/or stereotactic radiosurgery allows successful decompression and tumor control as well as maximum preservation of visual and endocrinological functions when compared with conventional surgical procedures.(2-11)","674":"To investigate the effect of field size on grating acuity assessment in normal children and pediatric ophthalmological patients. A prototype set of acuity cards was produced with three acuity steps per octave and a card size of 26 x 70 cm, bearing a grating field of 26 x 35 cm. Field size reduction was achieved by masking. Large fields of the prototype versus TAC-sized fields were tested in normal infants and ophthalmological patients. Teller acuity cards (TAC) and masked prototype cards of equal field size gave identical results in normal controls and pediatric ophthalmological patients. A better response to large fields was found in all normal infants up to 7 months of age and in none older than 15 months. In patients, an effect of field size was found in decreasing numbers up to 5 years of age. The interocular acuity difference was larger when small fields were presented. The effect of field size in patients is considered to be a developmental delay due to the individual history of disease. It may possibly have prognostic value for treatment. ","675":"This study was intended to identify communities with an increased prevalence rate of inherited eye diseases (different forms of strabismus, juvenile maculopathy, AMD, myopia magna, etc.) in the districts Oberpfalz (Opf.) and Niederbayern (Ndb.). The data obtained in this study will serve to identify larger families and inbred populations for genetic testing to identify the cause of eye diseases with autosomal recessive and multifactorial inheritance. In cooperation with the local ophthalmologists in two Bavarian districts anonymized lists were compiled correlating diagnosis, postal code, and municipality of strabismus patients. The office software used in the participating practices was a limiting factor as well as the hand-written records used in most of these. The collected data were correlated with the published prevalence rates in the general population. Of the 104 local ophthalmologists who were invited to participate, only 17 provided information. The results indicate an increased prevalence rate of strabismus and microstrabismus patients from Neumarkt (Opf.) \/ Postbauer-Heng, Amberg, Hauzenberg and Pocking. Documentation as it is currently done - local ophthalmologist generally have written records and computer systems that are unsuitable for detailed surveys - restricts the possibility of completing the survey in the whole area. Nevertheless, regional accumulations of strabismus\/microstrabismus could be described, providing populations for further investigations to uncover the genetic causes. ","676":"Strabismus, as an inherited disease, is a new challenge to the geneticist. Various forms of strabismus can be found in distantly related members of the same family, who usually report to local ophthalmologists and orthoptic centers very rarely. In addition, local ophthalmologists and orthoptic centers very rarely pay attention to the genetic aspects of strabismus. Therefore, the recruitment of suitable families to identify the underlying genes is the major drawback in this effort. Further problems arise from the mode of inheritance, which can formally be characterized as autosomal dominant with reduced penetrance in most families, but should be considered as multifactorial inheritance with a threshold combination of mutated alleles. The present paper deals with a method for using local accumulations of strabismus patients to circumvent the problems of small families and rare numbers of affected persons. The steps on the way to the identification of strabismus genes will be described.","677":"Family studies have demonstrated the genetic etiology of concomitant strabismus (prevalence in different populations 1-5%, positive family history in 37% on average), as have twin studies (mean concordance in monozygous twins 73% compared to 35% in dizygous twins). In Duane's syndrome, three chromosomal loci have been identified to date: 2q31, 8q13, and 22q11; loci have also been identified in Moebius syndrome (various inheritance patterns): 13q12.2-q13, 3q21-q22, and 10q21.3-q22, as well as in congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles (CFEOM; 3 loci, 1 gene).(1) Already identified are the genes for a number of rarer muscular dystrophy syndromes with ocular involvement, various forms of congenital myasthenia, and mitochondrial diseases (with the primary defect located either in the mtDNA, resulting in a mitochondrial inheritance pattern, or in the nuclear DNA with Mendelian inheritance). A number of hereditary retinal diseases (Mendelian inheritance) may also be associated with strabismus. More than one gene is likely to be involved in the frequently occurring concomitant strabismus, making the analysis more difficult. Patients with chromosomal rearrangements, large families and isolated populations (see also the contributions by Preising and Zitzlsperger et al. in this issue)(2,3) will be instrumental in gene identification. In view of the high prevalence of concomitant strabismus, the disclosure of its etiology will have considerable medical, psychosocial and health-cost impact.","678":"Evidence is presented for a clinical classification of central vestibular syndromes according to the three major planes of action of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR): yaw, pitch, and roll. The plane-specific vestibular syndromes are determined by ocular motor, postural, and perceptual signs. Yaw plane signs are horizontal nystagmus, horizontal past pointing, rotational and lateral body falls to the right or to the left, and horizontal deviation of perceived straight-ahead. Pitch plane signs are upbeat\/downbeat nystagmus, forward\/backward tilts and falls, and upward or downward deviations of the perceived horizontal. Roll plane signs are torsional nystagmus, skew deviation, ocular torsion, tilts of head, body, and perceived subjective visual vertical. The VOR syndromes defined in this way allow a precise topographic analysis of brainstem lesions according to their level and side. The lesional sites of yaw syndromes are restricted to the pontomedullary level (vestibular nucleus). A tone imbalance in pitch indicates bilateral (paramedian) lesions of the medullary or pontomesencephalic brainstem or bilateral dysfunction of the flocculus. A tone imbalance in roll indicates unilateral lesions, ipsiversive at the pontomedullary level (vestibular nuclei) and contraversive at the pontomesencephalic level (MLF and INC). A unilateral lesion (or stimulation) of the graviceptive pathways, which transduce input from vertical semicircular canals and otolith, affects function in roll, whereas bilateral lesions affect function in pitch.","679":"Non-human primate models suggest that amblyopia has a neural basis in the form of a massive reduction in binocular neurons, and in some cases, a shift in ocular dominance of neural activity toward the unaffected eye. To date, the resolution of neuroimaging has been insufficient to investigate the neural basis of ocular dominance in human amblyopia. We used high spatial resolution (0.5 x 0.5 x 3 mm) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to obtain maps of ocular dominance within the visual cortex of adult human amblyopes. fMRI maps of ocular dominance were similar in appearance to maps reported in the literature. For each of six adults with early-onset amblyopia, the number of map pixels corresponding to the unaffected eye was greater than the number corresponding to the amblyopic eye. This shift in ocular dominance was not seen for the two adults with later-onset amblyopia, suggesting that a shift in ocular dominance of neural activity occurs only if amblyopia onset is within the critical period of brain development. Our findings demonstrate how fMRI can non-invasively investigate the neural substrates underlying human amblyopia at the cortical column level.","680":"The congenital fibrosis syndromes (CFS) are rare inherited strabismus syndromes that present as congenital, nonprogressive ophthalmoplegias with active and passive restriction of globe movement, and include classic and atypical forms of congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles (CFEOM) and Duane syndrome (DS). Although historically believed to result from primary extraocular muscle fibrosis, both neuropathologic and genetic studies support the hypothesis that these disorders result from aberrant development of motor nuclei in the midbrain and pons.","681":"Ocular neuromyotonia is a rare motility disorder occurring after tumor irradiation near the skull base or as a consequence of vascular abnormalities. Ocular myasthenia, convergence spasm and a cyclic third nerve palsy must be considered as differential diagnoses. The case of a 32-year-old woman suffering from intermittent diplopia six months after radiation therapy of a recurrent pituary gland adenoma is presented.","682":"Age-related macular degeneration is the most common cause of irreversible loss of visual acuity, including the ability to read, in elderly patients. One of the surgical treatment options is macular translocation with 360 degrees retinotomy. The orthoptic results of torsional muscle surgery as a second procedure are demonstrated. Between January 1999 and December 2000, the macula was rotated upward by 12-45 degrees in 10 eyes following complete artificial detachment and a 360 degrees retinotomy. In these patients, torsional surgery was carried out as a second procedure. Depending on the resulting cyclotorsion, we performed surgery on the oblique muscles only in four patients with a cyclotropia of 12-20 degrees and a combination of oblique muscle surgery with surgery of two or four rectus muscles in the remaining six eyes (cyclotropia over 21 degrees ). The pre- and postoperative diagnostic techniques included visual acuity, reading vision and the orthoptic status. Due to the unilateral ectopia of the macula, all patients presented postoperative strabismus with a vertical deviation of 2-10 degrees and a subjective cyclotropia between 12 degrees and 40 degrees. After surgery on the oblique muscles, the patients showed a residual cyclotropia of 0-6 degrees. In patients in whom surgery on the oblique muscles was accompanied by rectus muscle surgery, the remaining cyclotorsion was 5-13 degrees. Four patients excluded the non-operated fellow eye, six patients experienced double vision under binocular conditions and thus required prescription of additional prism glasses. Macular translocation causes diplopia under binocular conditions because of the unilateral ectopia of the macular region with cyclotropia and vertical deviation. These problems can be resolved or reduced by oblique muscle surgery or in combination with additional surgery on the rectus muscles, depending on the range of the cyclotorsion. Performing the torsional surgery as a second procedure after macular rotation with an exact preoperative measurement of the subjective cyclodeviation appears to be useful. ","683":"Eye growth is regulated by a precise, sharp image of a distant object on the photoreceptor layer. A variety of laboratory investigations report that translucent occluders may induce axial eye elongation in animals. This axial growth is also called form deprivation myopia (FDM). In our pediatric ophthalmology clinic we observed the clinical correlate of FDM in a male infant with unilateral corneal ulcer due to a congenital tarsal malformation. Examination in the postnatal period under anesthesia revealed identical axial length in both eyes. Refraction of the affected eye could not be measured due to severe corneal ulcer. During an observation period of two years, the deep corneal opacification of the affected eye induced unilateral disproportionate axial elongation with formation of myopia. Formation of FDM may complicate treatment of amblyopia following unilateral media opacification. Periodic measurements of refraction should be performed to allow appropriate correction.","684":"In recent years, evidence has accumulated indicating that long-ranging neuronal connections within the primary visual cortex (area 17) mediate the influences of context and experience, possibly also those of expectation. After early onset strabismus, the layout of these connections is massively modified: in strabismic but not in normally raised cats, horizontal connections extend primarily between neurons activated by the same eye. As a possible consequence of the modified circuitry, neuronal synchronization between different ocular dominance domains is also massively reduced. Thus, the inability of strabismics to combine the signals arriving from the two eyes into a single percept may be caused by these structural and functional changes. Strabismic amblyopia is also accompanied by significant modifications of intracortical associational interactions: corresponding to the psychophysical deficits, neurons driven by the normal eye displayed stronger synchronization of their responses than neurons dominated by the amblyopic eye.(1) These data demonstrated for the first time a clear neurophysiological correlate of strabismic amblyopia in area 17. They suggest that - similar to our observations in divergent squinters - at least some of the perceptual deficits of amblyopic patients are due to experience-dependent changes in intracortical circuitry. We analyze this question by combining optical imaging of intrinsic signals with 3-D reconstructions of neuronal circuitry.","685":"During the past 150 years, research on amblyopia and nystagmus has developed in five different waves (W1-W5). Amblyopia was initially regarded to be enigmatic and believed to be related to eccentric fixation (W1, after 1850); later, it was ascribed to disorders in refraction or accommodation (W2, around 1900). After 1900 (W3), phylogenetic explanations appeared, and after 1945 (W4) concepts based on successful orthoptic practice came to the fore. Since 1965 (W5), research on amblyopia has been guided by modern insights into neuroanatomy and neurophysiology. In contrast to amblyopia, nystagmus has always been a well-defined symptomatic entity. Even though amblyopia and nystagmus are both symptoms of strabismus, their understanding has therefore developed along different paths. In juvenile strabismus, defects in binocularity lead to monolateral amblyopia, while defects in contour vision lead to bilateral nystagmus. In the present paper, these five waves of amblyopia research are described in more detail, with particular attention to the concepts of adaptation, visual fields, and sensory and motor functions as related to disorders in reading and accommodation.","686":"The aim of this study was to establish a relation between visual acuity increase and compliance in children who have been prescribed patching therapy for their amblyopic eye. In 14 new amblyopic children (mean age 4.3 +\/- 1.9 years) compliance was measured electronically during one week, six months after starting patching therapy, with an Occlusion Dose Monitor (ODM), distributed through house visits. The children were diagnosed with anisometropia (5), strabismus (4) and anisometropia and strabismus (5). The degree of amblyopia was expressed as the ratio between the acuity of the amblyopic eye and the acuity of the good eye. Satisfactory increase in acuity was assessed by means of the following three criteria: acuity amblyopic eye \/ acuity good eye &gt;75%, acuity exceeding 0.5 E-chart, three lines LogMAR acuity increase. Fourteen reliable recordings were obtained, which showed that children who did not patch, or were patched inconsistently, did not reach satisfactory acuity increase. There is indeed a statistically significant relation between acuity increase and measured compliance. ","687":"The trajectories, velocity, and co-ordination of smooth pursuit eye movements were investigated in 30 patients with ocular motor nerve palsies (including palsies of cranial nerves III, IV and VI). The recordings of horizontal and vertical eye movements were obtained by video-oculography under monocular viewing conditions. During the recordings, horizontal, vertical, and oblique target movements of 10 degrees \/s constant velocity were presented to the subjects in succession. In contrast to normal subjects, smooth pursuit eye movements in patients with ocular nerve palsies showed considerable differences in dependence on the fixating eye. The smooth pursuit gain of the paretic eye was reduced for eye movements in the pulling plane of the paretic muscle. When viewing with the paretic eye, the tracking of the target was achieved by a series of refixation saccades, which also occurred in the occluded normal eye. Consequently, the sound eye position overshot the target. The transition from a smooth to a saccadic pursuit pattern was accompanied by a spatial deviation of the eye movement trajectories from the path of the fixation target.","688":"Recommendations concerning the kind and dosage of eye muscle surgery for nystagmus vary in the literature. The present paper is an evaluation of the effects of Kestenbaum and artificial divergence surgery on abnormal head posture in a retrospective study. Exclusively patients with surgery for nystagmus-related horizontal head-turn (HT), with binocular vision and without previous eye muscle surgery were considered. Of the 78 patients, aged 3 to 68 years, 52 had a HT to the left side; 47 patients were male. In the Kestenbaum group (n = 31), the preoperative HT of 30 degrees (20-40) (median, 0.1-0.9 quantile) was reduced to 10 degrees (0-30) by surgery of 14 mm (10-20) on each eye. Four patients received further surgery. In the artificial divergence group (n = 27), the HT of 30 degrees (25-40) was reduced to 5 degrees (0-20) by recess-resect surgery of 10 mm (7-12) on the adducted eye. Seven patients needed further surgery. In the combined Kestenbaum plus artificial divergence group (n = 20), the HT of 30 degrees (25-40) was reduced to 7 degrees (-5-15) by surgery of 29 mm (21-37) on both eyes together. No further surgery was necessary. Kestenbaum surgery had a similar effect\/dose ratio as recess-resect surgery for strabismus. If a test with base-out prisms suggests that artificial divergence is promising, this concept is preferable. It can be integrated into Kestenbaum surgery.","689":"The aim of this retrospective study was a quantitative analysis of the effect of graded inferior oblique recessions (8 mm, 10 mm or maximal) in strabismus sursoadductorius. 234 patients (2-81 years of age) with unilateral strabismus sursoadductorius and stereopsis were operated between 1990 and 1999. Maximal recession (14.6 mm) included an anteroposition to the lateral aspect of the insertion of the inferior rectus. Before and three months after the operation, horizontal and vertical deviations (VD) were assessed by cover testing in five positions of gaze. In 121 patients, additional subjective quantitative assessment, including cyclodeviation measurement, was carried out with Harms' tangent screen. The mean effect of the operation on VD in 25 degrees adduction increased from 6 degrees with 8 mm recession to 10 degrees with maximal recession. It was related more to the amount of preoperative VD in adduction than to the amount of recession. One patient had a limitation of elevation with a hypotropia of &gt;4 degrees, 7% needed further surgery because of undercorrection. Maximal recession of the inferior oblique muscle is a suitable procedure even in patients with marked strabismus sursoadductorius. The rate of functional undercorrection is low and there is no risk from general anesthesia or significant postoperative limitation of elevation. ","690":"","691":"To describe current methodology used to: a) train alert adult macaque monkeys to perform visual fixation tasks, b) implant binocular magnetic scleral search coils and attach a head restraint, and c) precisely record their fixation and pursuit eye movements. Animals are trained to sit in a primate chair and manipulate a lever. The animal turns on a laser spot (&lt; 1 degree of arc) by pulling the lever. The spot dims after a variable, randomized period of time (luminance decrement 30-80%) and if the monkey releases the lever within 150-500 msec of dimming, a small bolus of juice is squirted via a servo into the monkey's mouth as a reward. The small size of the spot, the difficulty of detecting the dimming, and the short reaction time required for reward act in concert to assure attentive foveal fixation. After training, a search coil is implanted subconjunctivally in each eye and a polycarbonate head restraint device is attached to the skull. With the animal at the center of magnetic field coils, eye position is then calibrated precisely by requiring the animal to perform the dimming task at known positions of gaze. Fixation, vergence and pursuit eye movements are recorded by rewarding the animal for positioning the fovea of the eye within a small fixation 'window' encompassing the position of a stationary or moving target. A cover test of binocular eye alignment is performed by having the animal view through liquid crystal shutters that can be switched instantaneously from transparent to opaque. These methods have been used to train and to record eye movements in over 20 monkeys, and a representative sample of our experience in eight animals is reported in the Results. Normal monkeys, and monkeys who had strabismus or amblyopia, required an average of 53 days to learn to fixate steadily for a minimum of 5 sec with a dimming-detection performance of at least 75% correct. Implanted coils provided good signals for durations ranging from 4 months to longer than 3 years (average greater than 1 year) before signs of breakage or extrusion. Head restraints under daily use have lasted an average of 11 months (range 5 months to greater than 2 years) before spontaneous detachment. The training and surgical techniques described provide an efficient, straightforward method for recording precise binocular eye movements in awake monkeys. ","692":"","693":"We treated a 27-year-old man who suffered from a congenital eye movement abnormality. The patient could not adduct the left eye, and showed exotropia, hypertropia and excyclotropia of the left eye. The range of abduction was also limited. The left eye showed marked upshoot on right gaze and eye globe retraction on right down gaze under conditions of right-eye viewing. The superior rectus muscle of the left eye was recessed and transposed nasally. The insertion of the superior oblique muscle was found to be defective. The upshoot and face turn improved after surgery. The globe retraction on right down gaze was no longer evident. We believe that the superior rectus muscle was innervated by an anomalous branch of the oculomotor nerve, which was originally destined to innervate the medial rectus, and that simultaneous contraction of the superior and inferior rectus muscles caused the globe retraction on right down gaze. This case also suggests the possibility that some part of the upshoot in adduction in Duane's syndrome is due to the co-contraction of the superior and medial rectus muscles due to this innervation anomaly.","694":"To describe the investigation and subsequent management of paradoxical diplopia in unsightly exotropia. A 32-year-old lady requested surgical correction of a large manifest consecutive exotropia which, on initial correction with any base-in prism, was accompanied by paradoxical diplopia. Botulinum toxin to the right lateral rectus reduced the deviation to 30 delta over a one-week period. The residual deviation was corrected with base-in Fresnel prisms which the patient wore constantly for another two weeks. Although there was demonstrable diplopia initially, it disappeared after 3-4 days of prism wear. Surgery was carried out comprising right lateral rectus recession (6 mm) and right medial rectus advancement from 12 mm to 6 mm posterior to the limbus. There was no diplopia following the surgery and the residual exodeviation measured 6 delta for near and 16 delta for distance (fixing OD). The patient remains symptom-free and cosmetically excellent. A gradual progressive reduction in the deviation using a combination of Botulinum toxin and prisms allowed a more informative conclusion to be made regarding the potential post-operative sensory status in this patient, by allowing her to slowly adjust to an altered ocular alignment. In patients with non-functional strabismus who may be at risk from post-operative diplopia, a trial with prisms over a few weeks with or without the addition of Botulinum toxin is advocated. ","695":"The success of any specific occlusion regimen is limited by the level of concordance, which is difficult to measure accurately in patching treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate prospectively the concordance rate of a group of children with strabismic and\/or anisometropic amblyopia using a schematic diary based on completing 'smiley' images, filled in by the child under parental supervision, and to assess the effect of correlates such as initial visual acuity, age, and total and daily occlusion time on concordance. We recruited 51 amblyopic children aged 13 months to 12 years (mean 6.57 +\/- 2.82). The median duration of treatment was 16 weeks. Non-concordance was defined as occluding less than 75% of the prescribed time and was analyzed using a concordance index calculated from occlusion time recorded in the diary\/prescribed occlusion time. Of the 51 patients followed prospectively, 12 (23.5%) failed to return their diaries (Group 1); 27 (52.9%) complied with occlusion (Group 2); and 12 (23.5%) failed to comply with occlusion completely (Group 3). The total proportion of non-concordance was 47.1% (Group 1 + Group 3). Concordance was not significantly related to initial visual acuity (r = -0.22, p = 0.19), patient age (F = 1.0787, p = 0.349) or total occlusion time (X2 = 2.779, p = 0.249), but the number of daily occlusion hours showed significant difference in Group 1 (X2 = 15.894, p = 0.000). When the three groups were compared for change in visual acuity, a significant difference was found between group 1 and group 2 (X2 = 6.125, p = 0.047). The substantial proportion of non-concordance in our study suggests that, although useful for recording purposes, parental diaries may not be stimulating enough to increase the overall level of concordance. Therefore, other forms of monitoring need to be explored.

Other clinical findings confirmed this to be a secondary deviation due to a paresis of the contralateral superior oblique. conclusion Patients with a paralysis of the lateral rectus following a severe cranial trauma who demonstrate a marked downshoot of the involved eye should be suspected of having a paresis of the contralateral superior oblique. This diagnosis has helped us effectively to treat this vertical incomitance by a simple weakening procedure of the contralateral inferior oblique.","700":"The authors report two patients with more than 20 diopters of myopia, severely restricted abduction, and more than 90Delta of acquired esotropia.

The aim of this study was to assess its feasibilty\/outcome in a younger age group. A retrospective review of 359 case notes of patients, under the age of 16 years, who underwent squint surgery between 1992 and 1999 was carried out. Of these, 45 (13%) had undergone surgery with the adjustable suture technique. Post-operatively, 34 patients achieved an angle of +\/- 10 pd and required no further treatment. We sought co-operation from the parents and encouraged their active participation during adjustment. It was not necessary for any child to return to the operating theatre to finalise adjustment. We conclude that this is an effective treatment in motivated children, as 76% (34\/45) obtained an excellent result.","702":"We examined the indications for strabismus surgery in patients 60 years of age or older.

There were 59 females and 52 males, ranging in from 60 to 90 years (mean 67.3 years). The diagnoses were varied: the largest groups were cranial nerve palsies and consecutive strabismus. Fifty-six patients demonstrated binocular potential pre-operatively and 60 post-operatively. Twenty-three patients underwent reoperation. Twenty-eight patients also received botulinum toxin. The mean follow-up was 15 months, 54 patients were discharged within 6 months. Elective strabismus surgery in this age group constituted 7% of strabismus surgery activity (single surgeon). There were no complications.

The cycle consists of a left-beating nystagmus, a transition phase, a right-beating nystagmus, and a further transition phase. The purpose of this review is to assist the clinician in the recognition of periodic alternating nystagmus (PAN), either as a type of congenital nystagmus or in its acquired form, and to highlight why such identification is important. Recent studies using eye movement recordings are reviewed to point out the frequency of congenital PAN in samples of patients with congenital nystagmus, and to describe the characteristics of the waveforms and the influence of foveation time on the alternation of head turns. Classical and new surgical alternatives are reported. The identification of congenital PAN is essential when surgical treatment is being considered for the correction of anomalous head postures. Acquired PAN is usually due to cerebellar disease and causes oscillopsia. Unlike other forms of acquired nystagmus, it responds well to drug treatment.","704":"","705":"","706":"The test charts included in the Polatest, designed by H.-J.

To date, the achiasmatic syndrome described has thus far been identified in three unrelated females. A comparable achiasmatic condition has also been identified in a canine breed. The unique, inborn visual pathway malformation in the form of an isolated absence of the optic chiasm was confirmed by metabolic assay, the visual evoked potential (VEP) misrouting paradigm and neuroradiological evaluation, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Horizontal and vertical, left and right eye, oculomotor scleral search coil recordings were measured, in one of the achiasmats, at 15 years of age. Comparable oculomotor recordings were implemented in three controls, including a normal age-matched control, an adult control and an adult with idiopathic congenital nystagmus (CN). In addition to central and eccentric target fixation with binocular and monocular viewing, binocular and monocular pursuit and optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) also were recorded. Following a binocular and monocular fixation paradigm, classic congenital nystagmus (CN) profiles were recorded in the achiasmat in the horizontal planes together with see-saw nystagmus (SSN) in the vertical planes; an alternating esotropia and vertical tropias also were documented. The CN showed interocular conjugacy and waveforms typically exhibited well-defined foveation periods. In general, both achiasmatic horizontal and vertical eye movements as well as corresponding interocular misalignments varied with stimu-lus and recording conditions. Moreover, horizontal eye movements showed sustained interocular conjugacy while vertical eye movements typically showed disconjugacy. Previous oculomotor studies in the achiasmatic canine breed revealed comparable oculomotor instabilities, albeit the latter were reported to present primarily with unyoked eye movements and uniocular saccades. In the present study, in addition to target fixation with binocular and monocular viewing, binocular and monocular pursuit and OKN responses also were recorded. For the achiasmat, high-gain pursuit results, as with eccentric fixation, emphasized a preference for fixation with the adducting eye. Also at eccentric gaze with monocular viewing, the eye under cover showed, relative to the fixating eye, a hypodeviation concomitant with adduction and a hyperdeviation concomitant with abduction. OKN profiles in the achiasmat with stimuli presented under both normal viewing and open-loop, retinal-field locked conditions proved rather complex; however, when an OKN response was identified, reversed OKN tracking was not apparent. In general, the oculomotor results reported herein demonstrate that the non-decussating retinal-fugal fiber syndrome is an afferent visual pathway disorder associated with vertical and horizontal misalignments concurrent with congenital nystagmus and also with the rarer see-saw nystagmus.

The consistent wear of glasses was not associated with change in both meridia of both eyes in the normal children (p &lt; 0.005), but had no significant effect on the changes in astigmatism. Since the changes in the two meridia were proportional to the starting level, hypermetropia decreased more in the meridian which was, initially, the more hypermetropic one, and the difference between them, i.e. astigmatism, tended to disappear whether or not the child eventually had strabismus.","710":"","711":"Congenital third nerve palsy is a rare condition that usually presents with a large-angle incomitant strabismus and is often associated with ptosis and amblyopia.

The mean preoperative primary-position hypertropia was 22.2 +\/- 6.2 prism diopters (Delta) in the DIO group and 23.1 +\/- 6.6 Delta in the ATIO group; the mean preoperative hypertropia in adduction was 31.7 +\/- 6.9 Delta in the DIO group and 31.8 +\/- 8.1 Delta in the ATIO group. The mean follow-up was 18.8 months (SD: 10.2, range: 6-40 months).

Even though the mean reduction of hypertropia in adduction in the ATIO group (mean: 27.7 +\/- 9.6 Delta) was greater than in the DIO group (mean: 20.6 +\/- 6.2 Delta), no statistically significant difference was found (p = 0.067). There was residual hypertropia in three (27.3%) patients who underwent the DIO procedure. No major postoperative complication was encountered in any of the patients. In vertical deviations resulting from superior oblique palsy, ATIO was found to be more effective than DIO in the reduction of primary-position hypertropia.

The results show two different patterns of changes in refraction between the two eyes; in the same patient, the less myopic eye tends to get more myopic, while the more ametropic eye shows a more stable refraction. Furthermore, a recovery of binocular vision and amblyopia can be obtained by occlusion and full-time refractive correction.

Absolute myopia over 3D, absolute astigmatism &gt; or = 2D, absolute anisometropia &gt; or = 1.5D and absolute hyperopia &gt; 3.5D were considered as true positives. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) were calculated within the group of controls for each refractive anomaly. On the basis of Bayes' theorem, these figures were then corrected to yield the true screening results that would be expected in a population without verification and selection bias. To determine the usefulness of this screening technique, the likelihood ratios for positive test results (+LR) were also calculated. The results of this screening in terms of sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were then compared with those of photoscreening. The basic results of screening with the hand-held autorefractor were as follows: -EHyperopia: sensitivity 46%, specificity 97%, PPV 55%, NPV 96%, +LR 15; -EAstigmatism: sensitivity 37%, specificity 99%, PPV 69%, NPV 96%, +LR 37; -EAnisometropia: sensitivity 66%, specificity 93%, PPV 19%, NPV 99%, +LR 9; -EMyopia: sensitivity 87%, specificity 99%, PPV 33%, NPV 100%, +LR 87. The comparison with photoscreening revealed a similar performance when screening for hyperopia, but the hand-held autorefractor yielded much better figures when screening for astigmatism. In the case of myopia and anisometropia, the lack of consistent information concerning photoscreening invalidates any comparison. The hand-held autorefractor Retinomax appears to have potential as a screening device. Our experience with the non-cycloplegic screening of preschool children for refractive anomalies indicates definite usefulness and reasonable accuracy of the Retinomax for detecting myopia, astigmatism and hyperopia. The weak point of this screening technique is the diagnosis of anisometropia, with only moderate utility and poor accuracy. ","716":"","717":"A newborn male presented with complete external third nerve palsy of his right eye immediately at birth. Pediatric examination and MRI of the skull revealed no abnormalities. At the age of six weeks, strabismus surgery was performed to facilitate amblyopia treatment. The muscles appeared small and fibrotic. At the age of ten weeks, a brow suspension of the upper lid and a second strabismus surgery were performed. The amblyopia treatment and patching, applied for half of the waking hours over a period of six weeks, were unsuccessful. At the age of six months, a relative pallor of the right optic nerve head became evident. At the age of three years, at a new examination because of growth deficiency, a second MRI revealed defects involving the pituitary region. We concluded that extraocular muscle abnormality or oculomotor nerve palsy was present together with optic nerve dysplasia and pituitary gland malformation.","718":"A video technique is described to record ocular motions and positions of both eyes simultaneously in all degrees of freedom. This non-invasive method allows a 3-D positional analysis with free gaze directions and head tilts for measuring all ocular degrees of freedom, including torsion.","719":"In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, cross-over study in the Netherlands, the effectiveness of (prism-)glasses prescribed by the Measurement and Correction Method of H.-J. Haase (MKH) was compared to that of glasses prescribed by conventional orthoptic examination. Nine pairs of MKH-optometrists and orthoptists recruited patients who primarily presented with asthenopia, and each prescribed the patient (prism-)glasses. A questionnaire for asthenopia was developed that rated headache and tired eyes as 0-7 days per week and none-light-medium-severe, respectively. Light sensitivity, problems with focusing, near-work problems and burning eyes were each rated as: never-occasionally-often-always. A patient was eligible if he scored 'medium', 'often' or '5 days a week' twice; or 'medium' (etc.) once and 'light' (etc.) twice. Controls, in contrast to the patients, typically answered 'none' or 'never' to half of the complaints, but 37% of them would have passed the admission criteria. Among other criteria were: 18 to 40 years of age, horizontal angle &lt; 4 degrees, vertical &lt; 1.7 degrees, acuity &gt; or = 0.8, stereopsis threshold disparity &lt; 120\". Seventy-two patients fulfilled all criteria and returned sufficient questionnaires. They wore the first glasses for six weeks, were without glasses for two weeks, and then wore the second glasses for six weeks. At the start, halfway and at the end of each 6-week period, questionnaires were filled out; 97% were returned. Only 19 of the orthoptists' glasses contained prisms (14 horizontal, 5 vertical; horizontal average of all glasses 0.49 PD, vertical 0.05 PD). Five of the orthoptists' glasses were plano. All MKH glasses contained prisms, 53 of 72 both horizontal and vertical, 18 only horizontal and one only vertical (horizontal average of all glasses 2.83 PD, vertical 0.79 PD). The starting levels of complaints were high and both glasses improved complaints dramatically. The starting levels were lower, but not significantly, in the second 6-week period and improvement was less outspoken. Because of these differences, the two periods had to be evaluated separately. The primary outcome of the study was defined as the difference between the effect of the MKH glasses and that of the orthoptists' glasses in the first and second 6-week periods. For problems with focusing, in the first 6-week period, and for tired eyes, in the second 6-week period, the difference exceeded the difference that had been defined as clinically significant (one day per week less headache or half the distance light-medium or half the distance occasionally-often), but it did not reach statistical significance. The statistical power was approximately 0.7 for demonstrating this clinically significant difference. Statistical significance was not reached in multivariate repeated measure ANOVA either. Forty-four patients preferred to keep the MKH glasses, 25 the orthoptists' glasses, including one plano. It is striking that 25% of the patients did not prefer the glasses that, according to the questionnaire, improved their complaints the most. A year after the study, the questionnaire was sent again to all patients: The levels of complaints after a year were similar to those at the end of the second 6-week period, whether they had preferred the MKH or the orthoptists' glasses, and were similar to the levels in controls. The most conspicuous finding was that both glasses improved the complaints dramatically. Apart from the prisms, other reasons could be: spherical and cylindrical correction, improved wearing comfort of the frame, placebo effect, Hawthorne effect and regression to the mean.","720":"Under physiological conditions, the pressure in the central retinal vein is equal to or higher than the intracranial pressure (ICP) because the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) passes the sheath of the optic nerve before draining into the cavernous sinus. The optic nerve sheath is where the ICP affects the retinal venous pressure. Ophthalmodynamometry (ODM) is a useful method for determining the central retinal artery pressure. While papilledema and a lack of venous pulsations are commonly used as a vague indication of the ICP, ODM may be advantageous for determining the pressure in the central retinal vein. Until now, however, the venous pressure has never been compared with the intracranial pressure. In the present study, the pressure in the central retinal vein was recorded in 31 patients while the ICP was simultaneously being recorded for various reasons. The results demonstrate a linear correlation (r = 0.968) between the pressure in the central retinal vein and the ICP. This correlation is of great practical value since until now, reliable intracranial pressure monitoring has only been possible by invasive means, by placing a probe either in the brain parenchyma or the ventricle. Ophthalmodynamometry is useful for momentary assessment of the ICP, can easily be repeated, and may be used whenever an elevated ICP is suspected in hydrocephalus, brain tumors and after head injury. However, it is not suitable for continuous ICP monitoring.","721":"We present the case of a 29-year-old woman with generalized myasthenia. Myasthenia with complete external ophthalmoplegia was unmasked by cocaine abuse. It was associated with changes of the pupillary motility, including light-near dissociation and positive 0.1% pilocarpine test. Treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors improved the patient's condition rapidly, and led to complete normalization of extraocular movements and pupillary function. To our knowledge, this is the fourth case of cocaine-related myasthenia, and the first case of myasthenia with pseudotonic pupil.","722":"The goal of the procedure was to keep the eyes of patients with total oculomotor palsy in the straight ahead position by means of surgery on the horizontal and inferior rectus muscles in one session, without involving the superior oblique muscles. Six patients underwent surgery for total oculomotor nerve palsy. All of the surgical procedures were carried out on the muscles of the paralytic eye. We performed hemi-hangback recession of the lateral rectus and resection of the medial rectus for exotropia in all patients. Depending on the magnitude of vertical deviation, the insertions of the horizontal rectus muscles were moved upward, alone or in combination with hemi-hangback recession of the inferior rectus. The mean preoperative horizontal deviation was 66.6 PD. Two years after the operation, the horizontal deviation was measured to be 11.6 PD. Similarly, the mean preoperative vertical deviation of 16 PD decreased to 6.6 PD in two years. This procedure did not disturb normally functioning superior oblique and lateral rectus muscles. Subjectively, all of the patients were satisfied with their alignment two years after the operation. We are of the opinion that this technique is a safe, simple and effective procedure and can be regarded as a first-choice operation in total oculomotor palsy. If one fails to maintain the eye position with this procedure, one can still perform a second operation on the superior oblique muscle, which remains untouched in our procedure.","723":"Five screening strategies for amblyopia in different age groups were compared according to a decision-analytical model from the perspective of the health insurance funds. Our findings indicate that the costs per detected case of amblyopia range from about 1200 DM to 3000 DM (613 Euro to 1534 Euro). The two most cost-effective screening strategies were to screen high-risk children up to the age of one by ophthalmologists and to screen all children up to the age of one by ophthalmologists. The screening of high-risk children identifies only about a third of all affected children in this age group, when compared with the number of cases detected by screening all children up to the age of one. However, the average cost per detected case of amblyopia among high-risk children is lower than the cost of screening all children in this age range.","724":"The authors report a new anesthetic technique that is especially suitable for the surgery of complicated disorders of ocular motility. Analgesia is achieved by an intravenous dose of Remifentanil, an opioid that is normally used together with propophol as a form of total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) for general anesthesia. The advantage of Remifentanil is a rapid increase (1-2 min.) and decrease (3-4 min.) of the effect. Eye muscle surgery can then be performed on a patient who is free of pain and slightly sedated. After the planned eye muscle surgery, while the patient is still under anesthesia, the muscle sutures are tied provisionally. Afterwards, the squint angle can be measured with a cover test and the patient is questioned about the presence of diplopia. If the position of the eye is not satisfactory, the knots can be loosened and the muscle can be fixated in another position.","725":"In most children referred to our department with a diagnosis of dyslexia, we have found an ocular disorder that had not been detected during previous ophthalmologic examinations. Exophoria and\/or hypoaccommodation were the most common cause. Some of these children needed eye muscle surgery to improve the reading problems. However, these patients represent a selection. Therefore, we performed a field study to determine the percentage of children with reading disability caused by ocular disorders and the percentage of children with real dyslexia in a normal population. This was made possible by an examination of most pupils in the 4th grade of the three primary schools in a small German town. The co-author and a very experienced orthoptist performed all of the examinations. Eighty-nine out of 127 children were examined. Of these, 16 (18%) had reading problems (2 girls and 14 boys). Most of them had accommodation problems: six (6.7%) suffered from an uncorrected hypoaccommodation, three children did not wear their prescribed glasses, one child had not been prescribed any glasses yet and one child had the wrong glasses. Two children suffered from pathophoria: one from eso- and the other from exophoria compensated by accommodative convergence. In 3 (3.4%) children no ocular cause could be found. These children may have true dyslexia. Of the 89 children examined, 16 (18%) had reading problems and only 3\/16 had no detectable ophthalmologic explanation. Hypoaccommodation was the most common cause of reading problems (in 6 of 16). In most of the cases it had not been diagnosed before. In all of these children the reading ability improved markedly with the proper refractive correction, bifocals or prisms. ","726":"In this study, 46 strabismic patients aged between 9 and 58 years were tested for dynamic stereopsis in the peripheral visual field with up to 20 degrees eccentricity. Squint angles ranged from +30 to -36 degrees. The effect of surgical realignment of the visual axes on dynamic stereopsis was tested before and after surgery in 40 of these patients. Of the 46 patients, 23 had esotropia and 23 exotropia. A test device was used which presented two projected squares in polarized light (each square being perceived monocularly through a polarization filter) in horizontal motion, thus creating a three-dimensional impression. Patients were tested qualitatively for dynamically stereoactive fields of vision and quantitatively for the threshold value needed to create a three-dimensional impression. We found residual dynamic stereopsis in 30% of patients who had no central static stereopsis. 56% of the patients improved after surgery, either through a significant (p &lt; 0.01) gain of stereoactive fields or through a decrease in threshold values. This emphasizes the necessity of creating a test device suitable for everyday clinical use. Strabismus surgery is especially beneficial in connection with traffic and sports medicine, regardless of the effect on classical tests.","727":"To investigate the frequency of stimulus deprivation amblyopia (SDA) in comparison with other reasons for amblyopia in human congenital ptosis. The frequency and causes of amblyopia were evaluated in the 200 eyes of 100 patients. Congenital ptosis was present in 128 eyes (72 unilateral, 28 bilateral). The age at investigation was one year and older, with an average of 11 years and 10 months. Amblyopia was defined as best corrected visual acuity less than 1.0 or a difference between the two eyes of at least 0.2. The following causes of amblyopia were identified: amblyopiogenic refractive errors: astigmatism &gt; or = 1 dpt, anisometropia &gt; or = 1 dpt (79% cycloplegia) and strabismus. In cases with no other reasons for amblyopia, SDA was assumed. Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-square and the sign tests. The overall incidence of amblyopia in ptotic eyes was 89\/128 (70%). In 3.9% of the cases (5\/128; 2 eyes with unilateral and 3 eyes with bilateral ptosis) we assumed SDA. A comparison of ptotic eyes with (unilateral: n = 35, bilateral: n = 34) and without covered optical axis revealed the following: in the case of unilateral ptosis, amblyopia was found more often in ptotic eyes with covered optical axis: 30 out of 35 vs. 24 out of 37 (p = 0.06); in the case of bilateral ptosis this difference was significant: 27 out of 34 vs. 8 out of 22 (p &lt; 0.05). In the case of SDA, the optical axis was covered in only a single eye, in a patient with bilateral ptosis. There was no difference in the incidence of anisometropia: 19 out of 53 vs. 14 out of 47 (p = 0.52). Astigmatism was found more frequently in ptotic eyes with covered optical axis in unilateral ptosis: 23 out of 35 vs. 16 out of 37 (p = 0.06) but not in bilateral ptosis: 21 out of 34 vs. 13 out of 22 (p &gt; 0.9). Strabismus was found significantly more frequently in ptotic eyes with covered optical axis: 13 out of 35 vs. 4 out of 37 (p &lt; 0.05) in unilateral ptosis and 7 out of 34 vs. 1 out of 22 (p = 0.13) in bilateral ptosis. In contrast to the classical animal models of stimulus deprivation amblyopia, this entity is rare in human congenital ptosis, perhaps because of the counter effect of compensating head posture. Disruption of fusion resulting in strabismus might be an additional indirect cause of amblyopia in congenital ptosis. Prophylactic amblyopia treatment in ptosis cases is important as long as no testing of visual acuity is possible in a child. ","728":"Surgical decompresssion of the orbit may be considered as a suitable form of therapy if, as a result of the increased volume inside the orbit, there are motility disorders such as diplopia or a progressive decrease in visual acuity. In view of the fact that this operation will not cure the underlying disease, the treatment should be as mild as possible. In five subjects with Graves' orbitopathy we managed to extend the volume of the intraconal orbit by microsurgical liposuction. We carried out a lateral canthotomy to approach the orbit behind the globe. After decompression of the soft tissue, the lateral palpebral ligaments were refixed. To assess the scale of the functional rehabilitation we compared preoperative parameters (visual acuity, Hertel's index, visual field, motility) with the postoperative results. In all cases we found a significant improvement of position and motility without signs of diplopia. There was a postoperative increase in the visual field and visual acuity was 0.4 and the protusion of the globe could be decreased by 3-6 mm (Hertel's index). Furthermore, the ocular hypertension we found preoperatively could no longer be detected after the operation. Microsurgical decompression of the soft tissue via an approach from behind the globe proved to be a very gentle alternative to conventional methods of orbital decompression because of the satisfying functional and esthetic rehabilitation in selected cases. ","729":"Defective spatial localization is an important feature of strabismic amblyopia. Based on our experience from testing adult strabismics under various test conditions, we developed a test for assessing vertical alignment in strabismic children. Patients had to align a vertical test line with the apices of two vertically arranged reference triangles, under the control of both the dominant eye and the amblyopic eye. Means and standard deviations of several judgements represent systematic errors and uncertainty of alignment. We tested 27 strabismic and 34 age-matched control children aged 4.5-10 years. Control children showed a scatter of mean systematic alignment around the correct position of up to 7 minarc. In the amblyopic eyes of strabismic children, uncertainty was consistently higher than in the eyes of the control children. Systematic errors outside the normal range frequently occurred. In children tested repeatedly during occlusion therapy, uncertainty decreased as visual acuity improved. In several cases we observed changes of systematic vertical alignment during therapy, sometimes unexpectedly in the sense of a change in the direction of mislocalization or an initial increase and later decrease of errors. Thus, children with strabismic amblyopia show spatial localization deficits which are similar to those of adult strabismic amblyopes. Both spatial uncertainty and systematic distortions are susceptible to change due to enforced use of the amblyopic eye during occlusion therapy.","730":"To determine the optimal stimulus duration as well as the most appropriate luminance profile to elicit suppression in small-angle convergent strabismus. In 10 subjects with small-angle convergent strabismus, using a device allowing binocular viewing and peripheral fusion, we determined what the optimal stimulus would be to elicit suppression. Three control subjects were also included in the study. Stimuli were shown randomly in the central 3 degrees of the visual field of either eye. Stimulus durations were varied in seven steps from 50 to 1000 ms and three luminance-time profiles were used: square wave, triangle and half-sinus, thus yielding 21 different stimuli. The peak light intensity was the same for all stimuli. Suppression, defined as the difference in the threshold sensitivities under monocular vs. binocular viewing, was found with our test device in five of the ten subjects, and ranged between 3 and 33 dB. Suppression was deepest with triangular or half-sinusoidal stimuli of 400 ms duration. Square wave stimuli elicited the smallest amount of suppression. Stimuli with a gradual increment and decrement, like triangular or half-sinusoidal stimuli, with a duration of 400 ms are the most effective to elicit suppression ","731":"","732":"","733":"","734":"","735":"The visual system has a limited capacity to fuse overlapping impressions. It takes advantage of three principles of organization: (1) The mixing of different impressions resulting in a new entity (compensation principle); examples are the mixing of colors, dark and light at the retina, Fechner's paradox. The twelve researchers whose work is reported here analyzed two other unifying principles: (2) Selection by successive contrasts (polarization principle) and (3) subordination in a hierarchy of vision (differentiation principle).","736":"Lea symbols are highly sensitive for detection of amblyopia in cooperative patients. They are favorable for visual acuity assessment in childhood. Therefore, we assessed age-related normal values and interocular differences of Lea symbol visual acuity. We reexamined 50 out of 193 children aged 21 months to 7 years who came for a routine pediatric examination between January and November 1999. Lea symbol acuity (Lea Symbols Single Symbol Book (LS) and Lea 15-Line Folding Distance Chart (CLS)) and Landolt-C acuity (single (LC) and crowded with 2.6' inter-optotype distance (LC(2.6))) were measured. A three out of four criterion was used. Strabismus and any organic eye disease were excluded by orthoptic and ophthalmologic examination, consisting of biomicroscopy, ophthalmoscopy, retinoscopy or refractometry, cover test or Hirschberg test and Lang Stereotest. Only 26% of the parents (50 out of 193) accepted an examination in our hospital. In 35 (32) of the 50 children, visual acuity could be measured in both eyes separately with single (crowded) Lea symbols, while 26 (25) children could be examined in both eyes monocularly with the Landolt-C with single (crowded) optotypes. Except for one 3-year-old boy, all of the children older than 30 months could be tested with single Lea symbols. Lea acuity surpassed Landolt acuity. The difference was about 1.5 lines (1.5 dB) for both the single and the crowded optotypes. In 63% (69%) of the children who could be tested monocularly, LS acuity (CLS acuity) was higher than 0.8 (0.63). 89% (83%) of the children had an interocular difference of maximum 1 line for single (crowded) Lea symbols. The youngest child whose visual acuity could be assessed with Lea symbols was 23 months old. Almost every child older than 30 months could be tested with Lea symbols. Lea acuity higher than 1 and an interocular difference less than 2 lines is not suspect for amblyopia. Children with a difference of more than one line should be reexamined. ","737":null,"738":"To evaluate the intraorbital pressure in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) in relation to the intraocular pressure (IOP) and proptosis and to find out whether optic nerve compression is predictable. The venous outflow pressure (VOP) in the central retinal vein was measured by the perviously described technique of oculodynamometry.1 Since the central retinal vein passes through the orbit, the VOP cannot be lower than the intraorbital pressure if outflow is to be guaranteed. The IOP was measured either in primary position or with slight chin elevation to avoid restriction of the globe. Fifty-seven patients underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination, including VOP measurements, Hertel exophthalmometry and visual fields. The IOP in primary position ranged between 10 and 29 mmHg and in most (n=54) cases the VOP was 0-4 mmHg higher than the IOP. These patients had neither scotomas nor visual deterioration during an observation period of up to 2 years. In those cases (n=3) where the difference between IOP and VOP was 35 mmHg, the patients developed scotomas and visual deterioration and had to be treated (high-dose steroids or orbital decompression). The elevation in VOP did not correlate with the degree of proptosis. In one unilateral case, treatment of high IOP (32 mmHg) with dorzolamide drops led to a decrease in visual acuity of two lines, inferior field depression and relative afferent pupillary defect. The difference between IOP and VOP was 10 mmHg. Stopping treatment normalized visual function, the IOP rose to its original level and the difference between IOP and VOP was 4 mmHg. The increased IOP in GO is not caused by primary glaucoma but by elevated intraorbital pressure. The difference between IOP and VOP must be &lt;5 mmHg to guarantee normal perfusion. We interpret these findings to suggest that loss of visual acuity and visual field defects may not only be caused by optic nerve compression at the apex but also by deterioration of optic nerve head perfusion. ","739":"A prospective study on the saccadic properties of 10 patients with acute Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) compared to 10 healthy individuals was performed using the induction scleral search coil. No significant changes were observed among six patients with moderate disease. In four patients suffering from optic nerve compression, however, a substantial decrease of saccadic velocity and related parameters was detected. The absence of saccadic changes in earlier moderate stages of GO seems to be based on adaptation of the central saccadic generator. The velocity reduction in connection with a marked elevation of intraorbital pressure could be indicative of paretic motoneuron disturbances.","740":"To investigate the frequency of hyperopia and suspected stimulus deprivation myopia in human congenital ptosis. Ametropia was evaluated in both eyes of 50 patients with congenital ptosis. The age at investigation was one year and older, average 6 years and 10 months. The amount of refraction was documented as the spherical equivalent (100% cycloplegia). Differences between the paired eyes of 1.0 dpt or more were defined as anisometropia. Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-square and sign tests. The frequency of myopia was lower (7\/50: 14%) than that of hyperopia (43\/50: 86%) in the ptotic eye (p&lt;0.001). However, myopia occurred more often in the ptotic eye (7\/50: 14%) than in the fellow eye (3\/50: 6%, p&gt;0.3). Myopic anisometropia was found only in the ptotic eye (5\/50 vs. 0\/50, p = 0.06), but was not more frequent than hyperopic anisometropia: (5\/50 vs. 9\/50, p&gt;0.4). A covered center of the pupil in 27 out of 50 eyes was not associated significantly with myopia (2 of 27 versus 5 of 23, p&gt;0.2). Altogether, we found a significantly higher rate of myopia &lt;-1 dpt and hyperopia &gt; 2 dpt: 10% vs. 1.4% and 40% vs. 10.2% (p&lt;0.001) in comparison with normal school children. In summary, the following three findings were noted, of which the first two were expected and the third was not. 1. Compared with the normal population, there was an overall higher frequency of myopia in unilateral congenital ptosis. 2. There was a higher frequency of myopia in the ptotic than in the fellow eye. 3. Compared with the normal population, there was also a higher frequency of hyperopia. The clinical presentation of human congenital ptosis may be influenced by compensating head posture, strabismus, accommodation and biochemical effects, and the condition may therefore differ from the classical well-defined animal model of stimulus deprivation myopia. ","741":"We investigated whether Listing's law applies in patients with diminished or no stereopsis due to strabismus or amblyopia. Eye movements of normal subjects and patients with strabismus and\/or amblyopia were recorded during monocular and binocular fixation; from these data the shape and relative orientation of displacement planes were calculated. In normal subjects, monocular or binocular fixation did not influence the thickness and relative orientation of displacement planes. No differences were found between normals and the patient with amblyopia due to anisometropia. In one patient with strabismus but without amblyopia, the orientation of displacement planes depended on the fixation conditions; a coupling between horizontal vergence effort and plane orientation was observed. Patients with amblyopia and strabismus showed abnormally shaped and\/or abnormally orientated displacement planes, which depended on the fixation conditions. Differences between both eyes in the shape of the planes were also observed. These results show that normal Listing behavior can be present in subjects with diminished stereopsis. They also show that normal stereopsis does not necessarily mean normal Listing behavior, suggesting that Listing's law is mainly a result of motor strategy.","742":"A patient with hyperopia and accommodative esotropia was implanted bilaterally with hyperopic angle-supported refractive implants. Control of the esotropia was achieved as was some improvement in fusional ability. After three years, the endothelium remains healthy, the eye is quiet and control of the esotropia is maintained.","743":"Heterophoria does not provide a reliable clue for ordering prisms in an asthenopic patient. The same reservation applies to associated phoria, as determined by prism correction of fixation disparity. Subjective tests for fixation disparity, even those with a fusionable fixation target, do not correctly indicate the vergence position of the eyes under natural viewing conditions. Attempts to measure fixation disparity on the basis of stereo disparity, using the \"Measuring and Correction Methods of H.-J. Haase\", have failed.","744":"The neurobiological basis of saccade control has at least three components: fixation, reflexes, voluntary control. It was found in earlier studies that the voluntary component of saccade is specifically impaired in dyslexics as compared with controls of the same age. In this study, we searched for evidence of fixation instability by analyzing the eye movements of 99 control subjects and 262 dyslexics (age 7-17 years) performing an overlap prosaccade and a gap antisaccade task. The percentage of intrusive saccades was counted for each subject during a period of the trial where stationary fixation was required. Both groups showed improvements of fixation stability with age, but the dyslexic group exhibited developmental deficits. It is discussed whether these deficits could be interpreted as consequences of deficits in the magnocellular pathway.","745":"In order to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of transnasal orbital decompression for malignant Graves' ophthalmopathy, we carried out a retrospective chart review and clinical follow-up examination of 78 consecutive patients who were operated on for compressive optic neuropathy (CON) with loss of visual acuity or visual field defects. The intervention - strictly transnasal, endoscopically controlled, bilateral decompression of the medial and inferomedial wall of the orbit - was performed when medical and radiation therapy had failed. A total of 145 endonasal decompressions were performed on 78 patients (63 female, 15 male, 52. 2 +\/- 10.5 yrs.) over 9 years. Of these, 65 were operated bilaterally, 15 required only unilateral decompression; 4 had repeated surgery. Visual acuity increased from an average of 0.50 +\/- 0.27 (range, 0.01 - 1.25) to 0.75 +\/- 0.21 (range, 0.01 - 1.25). Proptosis decreased by an average of 3.94 +\/- 2.73 mm (range, -1.0 - 11.0 mm), from a mean preoperative Hertel measurement of 22.19 +\/- 3. 13 mm (range, 15 - 34 mm) to a mean postoperative Hertel measurement of 18.3 +\/- 2.65 mm (range, 10 - 26 mm). Ocular motility was corrected by recession of the medial rectus muscle in 58 cases, in 26 cases immediately after decompression in the same surgical session. The transnasal orbital decompression procedure improved vision, decreased proptosis in a range comparable to more invasive techniques and had favorable cosmetic results without additional disfiguring by scars. Post-decompression strabismus was successfully managed by recession of both medial orbital muscles in the same surgical session.","746":"Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) is thought to result from a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Various genes, including those coding for HLA, may determine a patient's susceptibility to the disease and its severity, but in addition, numerous and often unknown environmental factors may determine its course. Once established, the chronic inflammatory process within the orbital tissues appears to take on a momentum of its own. Based upon our current state of knowledge, we propose the working scheme shown in Fig. 1 for the pathogenesis of GO: Against the background of a permissive immunogenetic milieu, circulating T cells in patients with Graves' Disease (GD), directed against certain antigens on thyroid follicular cells, recognize antigenic epitopes that are shared by tissues contained in the orbital space. Here, preadipocytes and fibroblasts most likely act as target and effector cells of the orbital immune process. This includes preadipocyte fibroblasts present in the perimysium of extraocular muscles, which do not appear to be immunologically or metabolically different from those located in the orbital connective tissue. Differentiation of orbital preadipocyte fibroblasts into mature adipocytes expressing increased levels of TSHR may be driven by stimulation with circulating or locally produced cytokines or effectors. To date, it is still unknown how autoreactive T cells escape deletion by the immune system and become directed against a self-antigen that is presented by cells residing in the thyroid gland and in certain extrathyroidal locations. Mimicry of a host antigen by a microorganism or presentation of an altered self-antigen may promote proliferation and expansion of autoreactive T cell clones. T cell recruitment into the orbital tissues is facilitated by certain chemokines and cytokines, which help to attract T cells by stimulating the expression of several adhesion molecules (e.g. ICAM-1, VCAM-1, CD44) in vascular endothelium and connective tissue cells. Adhesion molecules are known to be important for a variety of interactions between immunocompetent cells, connective tissue cells and extracellular matrix components. In addition, these molecules play a central role in lymphocyte activation and localization, facilitating antigen recognition, T cell costimulation, and various effector-target cell functions at the inflammatory sites, many of which result in amplification of the cellular immune process in active GO. Analysis of variable region genes of T cell antigen receptors in orbital T cells of patients with active GO has revealed limited variability of TcR V gene usage, suggesting that antigen-driven selection and\/or expansion of specific T cells may occur during the early stages of GO. T cells and macrophages populate the orbital space and release a number of cytokines (most likely a Th-1-type spectrum) into the surrounding tissues. Cytokines, oxygen free radicals and fibrogenic growth factors, released both from infiltrating inflammatory and residential cells, act upon orbital preadipocytes in a paracrine and autocrine manner to stimulate adipogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, glycosaminoglycan synthesis, and the expression of immunomodulatory molecules. Smoking, a well-known aggravating factor in GO with an uncertain mode of action, may aggravate tissue hypoxia and exert important immunomodulatory effects. Finally, the long-held hypothesis of a thyroid cross-reactive antigen within the orbital tissues has recently gained significant support from an animal model of ophthalmopathy, and from in vitro and ex vivo studies. If confirmed by immunological studies, these data may well explain the localized infiltration of the orbital tissues by autoreactive lymphocytes that share intriguing molecular features with intrathyroidal lymphocytes. Local release of certain cytokines, TSHR-directed autoantibodies, or other factors might further enhance adipogenesis, glycosaminoglycan synthesis and expression of","747":"Because of its advantages, topical cyclopentolate is often preferred over the gold standard, atropine. The purpose of this study was to obtain an overview over current cycloplegia protocols and to estimate the likelihood of severe complications due to the use of cycloplegics. A questionnaire was sent to 107 German-speaking centers with a supposed high frequency of cycloplegias. 57 centers answered, whereby 1,112 cumulated years of experience with cycloplegia were available for analysis. The frequency of cycloplegias varied between 2 and 180\/week\/center, median 25\/week\/center. A cumulated total of 1.7 million cycloplegias was computed. The extrapolated average experience with cycloplegia was 49,000 cycloplegias\/30 years. Complications which would warrant a medical follow-up of several hours (severe complications) or which led to a follow-up in a ward (very severe complications) were named 47 times and 2 times, respectively. During 30 years of a cycloplegia career with an average of 34 cycloplegias\/week, one may expect 2-10 severe or very severe complications. In current practice, the patient risk of severe complications is very small. Health care professionals and parents should be informed about the frequent occurrence of harmless side effects in order to achieve a good compliance with cycloplegia. ","748":"The purpose of this study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of orthoptic screening for amblyopia in kindergarten. A decision-analytic model was used. In this model all kindergarten children in Germany aged 3 years were examined by an orthoptist. Children with positive screening results were referred to an ophthalmologist for diagnosis. The number of newly diagnosed cases of amblyopia, amblyogenic non-obvious strabismus and amblyogenic refractive errors was used as the measure of effectiveness. Direct costs were measured form a third-party payer perspective. Data for model parameters were obtained from the literature and from own measurements in kindergartens. A base analysis was performed using median parameter values. The influence of uncertain parameters was tested in sensitivity analyses. According to the base analysis, the cost of one orthoptic screening test was 7.87 euro. One ophthalmologic examination cost 36.40 euro. The total cost of the screening program in all kindergartens was 3.1 million euro. A total of 4,261 new cases would be detected. The cost-effectiveness ratio was 727 euro per case detected. Sensitivity analysis showed considerable influence of the prevalence rate of target conditions and of the specificity of the orthopic examination on the cost-effectiveness ratio. This analysis provides information which is useful for discussion about the implementation of orthoptic screening and for planning a field study.

Toxoplasma chorioretinitis, morning glory anomaly, toxocara retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity and Coats' disease were the most common diagnoses. Eighteen patients (58%) had esotropia and 13 (42%) had exotropia. The mean age of onset of deviation was significantly lower in the esotropic patients.

Fifteen healthy volunteers (control group, n=15) and sixteen patients diagnosed with strabismus were enrolled in the study. Either recession or resection was planned on one horizontal rectus muscle in the eyes of Group 1 (n=11) and on two horizontal rectus muscles in the eyes of Group 2 (n=10). CDI was performed to measure peak systolic velocity (V(max)), end-diastolic velocity (V(min)) and mean blood flow velocity (V(mean)) in the ophthalmic artery (OA), central retinal artery (CRA) and posterior ciliary artery (PCA) in the control group and in Groups 1 and 2, both preoperatively and 2-7 days postoperatively. The postoperative resistivity indexes in Groups 1 and 2 were found to be different from those in the control group. Preoperative V(max) and postoperative V(min) and V(mean) values of the vessels in Group 2 were different from those in both Group 1 and the control group (p&lt;0. 001). In both treatment groups, the differences between postoperative and preoperative measurements of the parameters in the OA, CRA and PCA demonstrated statistical significance (p&lt;0.001). After strabismus surgery on the horizontal recti, there are some alterations in the retrobulbar blood flow with a significant difference between pre- and postoperative blood flow velocities after single and double rectus surgery.

This retrospective review included 40 children with a diagnosis of infantile esotropia. There were 22 females and 18 males. The children were identified from surgical records between 1987 and 1992. Each child had surgery before the age of 2 years at an average age of 17 months (7 months to 22 months). Many patients (60%) achieved a small-angle (less than 20 prism dioptres), cosmetically acceptable strabismus. Nine patients (22.5%) achieved binocular vision postoperatively, five with microtropia, one with intermittent exotropia and three with bifoveal exophoria. The bifoveal patients did not exhibit high grade stereopsis, which may relate to the time of onset of infantile esotropia when development of cortical stereopsis is critical. Persistent amblyopia postoperatively was significantly associated with a poorer outcome and lack of binocular function.","757":"","758":"","759":"Vergence adaptation is an important element of comfortable binocular single vision and probably contributes to the high incidence of orthophoria or small angles of heterophoria in the normal population. Where binocular single vision has been absent for a period of time, restoration of good visual acuity appears to enable the vergence adaptation mechanism to become active again. A case is presented in which a moderate to large angle of deviation rapidly 'disappeared' once good visual acuity was restored and the disparate images could be fused. Known factors concerning vergence adaptation are discussed in relation to such clinical cases.","760":"To compare the success rates of augmented bimedial rectus recession and the standard recession. Ninety patients were included in the study. The patients were evaluated in two groups according to the amount of recession. Group 1, the standard surgery group, received 5 mm or less of recession; Group 2, the augmented surgery group, received 6 mm of recession or more. The mean postoperative follow-up was 29 months (6-60 months) in Group 1, and 20 months (6-58 months) in Group 2. The mean age at the time of surgery was 4.61 years in Group 1 and 4.58 years in Group 2. The 56 patients in Group 1 underwent bilateral rectus recession varying from a minimum of 3 mm to a maximum of 5 mm; the 34 patients in Group 2 had recessions varying from a minimum of 6 mm to a maximum of 8 mm. The mean preoperative angle size was 39.64 +\/- 8.93 SD (range 20-50 PD) in the standard surgery group, and 59.70 +\/- 10. 04 SD (range 51-85 PD) in the augmented surgery group. The average postoperative deviation was 13.37 +\/- 11.87 SD (range 0-45) in Group 1 and 9.02 +\/- 10.02 (range 0-45) in Group 2. A good surgical result was achieved with one operation in 29 of 56 patients (51.8%) in Group 1 and 24 of 34 patients (70.58%) in Group 2. The optimal surgical technique for the correction of large-angle esotropia is still controversial; it appears that the augmented bilateral medial rectus recession is an effective and reasonable alternative to three- or four-muscle procedures as the initial surgical treatment.

The same volume of saline was injected into the second eye of the rabbit as a control. External examination, ophthalmoscopy, visual evoked potentials and electroretinography were done before injection and repeated at the first and second weeks after the injection.

Esotropia was produced in a newborn squirrel monkey by surgical tenotomy of both lateral rectus muscles. The alignment and eye rotations of the monkey were examined longitudinally and VEP testing was performed at the age of one year. Visual acuity was measured using spatial frequency sweep VEPs (SSVEP) in response to grating stimulation. OKN was tested under conditions of monocular viewing using full-visual-field, vertically oriented, moving stripes. MVEPs in response to horizontal motion were recorded with the animal sedated to reduce the possibility of eye movement artifact. The artificially strabismic squirrel monkey displayed a constant, committant esotropic strabismus accompanied by latent nystagmus. Monocular SSVEP acuity was subnormal in one eye, consistent with mild monocular strabismic amblyopia. The monkey demonstrated asymmetric OKN favoring nasally-directed stimulus motion when viewing with either eye. Monocular MVEPs were also characterized by a horizontal asymmetry with a directional bias inverted 180 degrees between the right and the left eyes. The eye movements and MVEP asymmetries were similar to those observed in strabismic macaque monkeys and humans with early-onset strabismus. Neither the OKN asymmetry nor the MVEP asymmetry was evident in a normal squirrel or normal macaque monkey. The artificially strabismic squirrel monkey is an appropriate eye movement and VEP model for the study of neural mechanisms in human infantile strabismus.

METHODS A review of the pertinent English language literature was performed to devise a guide for the evaluation (including neuroimaging) of FNP. The authors report a retrospective review of imaging studies performed on 206 patients with FNP. RESULTS The literature was used to develop the imaging guide. In the retrospective chart review of 206 patients from two tertiary care centers, 28 patients (13.6%) underwent a computed tomography scan and\/or a magnetic resonance scan. Of these patients, five had associated neurological symptoms (non-isolated), one was traumatic, five were congenital, four were vasculopathic, eleven were non-vasculopathic, and two were progressive. Following the recommendations of the imaging guide, the five isolated congenital FNP and the four isolated vasculopathic FNP would not have undergone neuroimaging studies. The total costs of these neuroimaging studies in these nine patients were 19,000 dollars. Four patients in the retrospective review with associated neurological deficits (non-isolated) should have undergone neuroimaging according to the guide, but did not. CONCLUSIONS Although the evaluation of FNP can be difficult, the decision to order neuroimaging can be improved by using an imaging guide. An imaging guide for the evaluation of FNP may allow more appropriate and cost-effective imaging of these patients. Isolated congenital, old traumatic, or vasculopathic FNP do not require neuroimaging studies. Patients with non-isolated FNP should have directed neuroimaging studies based upon the results of clinical examination.","764":"PURPOSE Various patterns of synkinesis have been observed following both congenital and acquired III nerve palsies. Aberrant regeneration is the most widely accepted mechanism which explains this synkinesis. Two models of aberrant regeneration have been proposed, namely central collateral axon sprouting, and misdirection of regenerating neurones at the site of nerve injury. We have studied the clinical patterns of III nerve recovery and synkinesis following III nerve palsies and relate the findings to the proposed models of synkinesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twelve patients with acquired and two with early onset III nerve synkinesis were reviewed. The type, rate and pattern of recovery of III nerve palsy was established from case notes. Observations and measurements of ocular motility, pupil movements, eyelid position and intraocular pressure changes were performed on each patient. Signs of contralateral synkinetic movements were also sought. RESULTS Upper lid retraction on attempted down gaze and in adduction was the most frequent synkinetic movement recorded. Observation of pupil size revealed evidence of pupillary-extraocular muscle synkinesis in all gaze positions except abduction. Similarly, intraocular pressure changes and signs of globe retraction showed widespread extraocular muscle co-contraction. Synkinetic levator innervation of extraocular muscles [i.e., LPS to MR, IR, SR] was also observed, a finding not previously reported in III nerve palsy but predicted by our model of misdirection of regenerating neurones at the site of nerve injury. There was no evidence of contralateral aberrant innervation. CONCLUSION Evidence of III nerve synkinesis in patients with III nerve palsy is widespread and the patterns of synkinesis observed were broadly similar for all patients irrespective of the aetiology. Random aberrant III nerve regeneration at the site of nerve injury best explains the patterns of synkinesis observed. Central collateral axon sprouting does not seem to play a major part in the synkinetic movements observed in acquired III nerve lesions.","765":"Acquired loss of central fusion occurs most frequently after severe head trauma. It has also been described as a result of disruption of binocular function by unilateral deprivation from a cataract and following mid-brain injury due to vascular lesions, tumours or abscess. Symptoms include diplopia in all positions of gaze associated with a squint of variable size. Occasionally some patients experience a spontaneous, partial recovery of fusion, which may be manipulated with strabismus surgery to minimise diplopia. Recovery of fusion may take months or even a few years to occur. We present two cases of patients who lost fusion but later regained it spontaneously with a high degree of stereopsis. Neither patient required strabismus surgery. In the first case, fusion was lost following a severe head injury which resulted in unconsciousness and a unilateral vitreous haemorrhage. The second case followed the removal of a long-standing, unilateral cataract.","766":"AIMS To assess the agreement between the hand-held autorefractor Retinomax(R) and three different on-table autorefractors when measuring cycloplegic refraction in subjects with small and high ametropia. To assess the agreement between the cycloplegic refraction using the Retinomax(R) and by retinoscopy in children with small and high ametropia. METHODS Part A.276 subjects were refracted under cycloplegia using both the Retinomax(R) and an on-table infrared automated refractor (Topcon RM-A 6000, Nidek AR 800 or Nikon NR 5000). They were separated into subjects withsmall ametropia (mean sphere &lt;\/= 3.5 D hyperopia, &lt;\/= 3 D myopia) and high ametropia (mean sphere &gt; 3.5 D hyperopia, &gt; 3 D myopia). The agreement between both types of refractors regarding the different refractive components was assessed for the whole group and for the two subgroups of small and high ametropia. Part B. 48 infants were refracted under cycloplegia by retinoscopy and by the Retinomax(R). The agreement between both methods of refraction was analyzed in the same manner as in part A. RESULTS Part A. No significant bias was found between the two types of refractors with regard to the spherical equivalent. The 95% limits of agreement were +\/- 1 D. Although no clinically significant bias was found with regard to the cylinder power in the 276 subjects, it was found that the 95% limits of agreement were much better (+\/- 0.75 D) in small ametropia subjects than in high ametropia subjects (-2.1 to +1.3 D). No significant bias was found with regard to the axis determination. Part B. No significant bias was found between the Retinomax(R) and retinoscopic measurements with regard to the spherical equivalent. The 95% limits of agreement were -1.36 to +1.76 D. However, the mean difference for spheres and cylinders showed a positive bias and a negative bias, respectively, suggesting more positive spheres and larger cylinders when measured by the Retinomax(R) compared to retinoscopy. This was particularly obvious in cases of high ametropia. CONCLUSION Compared to retinoscopy and on-table autorefraction, the hand-held refractor Retinomax(R) is accurate in any ametropia with respect to the spherical equivalent. In small ametropia, there is a good accuracy when measuring the three refractive components (sphere, cylinder and axis). The accuracy decreases in high ametropia, especially with regard to the cylinder power.","767":"Diplopia is an uncommon finding in patients with subretinal neovascular membranes. We present two patients with binocular diplopia secondary to subretinal neovascular membranes and the foveal displacement syndrome. Subjective diplopia was not improved by prism therapy in either case. In one patient, diplopia was transiently relieved by removal of the choroidal neovascular membrane, but a subsequent subretinal hemorrhage resulted in severe visual loss. In the second patient, diplopia developed following laser therapy for a subretinal neovascular membrane. It is presumed that misalignment of the foveomacular receptor elements between the two eyes produced a central-peripheral fusional mechanism rivalry resulting in binocular diplopia. Ophthalmologists should be aware that a subretinal neovascular membrane may cause binocular diplopia and may mimic neuromuscular strabismus.","768":"The present study investigates the results of Cuppers' 'Fadenoperation' in patients with non-accommodative convergence excess esotropia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A series of 13 subjects was included in the present study (5 normal subjects and 8 patients suffering from small angle esotropia). The patients were evaluated in an illuminated environment where they were told to stare at a target which subtended a visual angle of 20 degrees and, successively, in the dark using a luminous stimulus which subtended a visual angle of 3.5 minutes. The vergence movements were evaluated using a four diopter base-out prism; eye movements were recorded under conditions of both binocular and monocular vision. Ocular movements were recorded by means of a magnetic search coil; the amplitude and peak velocity of the vergence movements were evaluated by computer analysis.

RESULTS: The data obtained in the present study demonstrate that: 1) there is a significant difference between binocular and monocular vision in both groups of subjects; however, the ocular response in the patients affected by strabismus was significantly different from that in the control group of subjects; 2) during monocular vision in the dark, the response of the strabismic patients was highly variable; 3) for both groups of subjects no significant differences were observed in the vergence response when a large-angle stimulus was employed in light conditions nor when a small-angle stimulus was utilized in a dark environment.","773":"The action of the superior oblique muscle depends on both the contractile function of the muscle belly as well as the force transmission function of the tendon trochlea complex. Brown's syndrome is a restriction to elevation in adduction presumed due to an anomaly of the superior oblique tendon trochlea complex. This report presents two patients with an unusual restriction to elevation in adduction in the affected eye, and a clinical picture consistent with a Brown's syndrome. A non-invasive analysis of the functional anatomy of the superior oblique was performed using a high-resolution MRI with surface coils. Imaging in the first case revealed a cyst in the area of the right superior oblique tendon just posterior to the trochlea in primary position. The second patient had undergone reattachment of an avulsed trochlea after a dog bite (canine tooth syndrome). Imaging in the second case revealed scarring and connective tissue disruption around the tendon impeding muscle function.

METHODS: Light and electron microscopy were performed on fresh autopsy specimens from a neonatal and a 26-year-old cadaver. RESULTS: The collagenous capsule of the nerve to the inferior oblique is present throughout its entire course, becoming more complex anteriorly as the myoneural junction is approached. A similar capsule surrounds the nerves to the other extraocular muscles. This structure is well developed by birth. CONCLUSIONS: The mechanical inelasticity of the nerve to the inferior oblique muscle has been shown to influence postoperative ocular alignment. The nerve is surrounded by a collagenous and fibrous capsule, which is well developed along the entire course of the nerve and is present from birth. The nerves to the other extraocular muscles have a similar capsule that likely conveys similar mechanical properties to those nerves and that may affect ocular alignment following surgical procedures on these muscles as well.

This study investigates the indications for and outcome of BTXA therapy in children at our institution. From 1985 to 1995, 237 children up to and including 16 years of age were treated with BTXA for strabismus. We undertook a retrospective study of 163 (69%) children from this group. Factors considered were age; anaesthesia; number of, indication for and outcome of injections; complications and follow-up. There were three major indications for the use of BTXA in children: firstly to improve binocular function, secondly as a post-operative diplopia test or for cosmetic reasons, and thirdly in the investigation or treatment of paralytic and restrictive strabismus. In the first group (54 children), BTXA produced improved binocular function in 54% of all patients treated and in 49% of those with a minimum follow-up of 12 months. In the second group (82 children), 88% showed informative post-operative diplopia tests and 44% had more than one injection to maintain improved cosmetic alignment. The third group comprised 27 children with a range of diagnoses, including 1 third nerve paresis, 12 unilateral or bilateral sixth nerve pareses, 7 unilateral or bilateral Duane's syndromes, 5 lost or fibrosed muscles and 2 others. This group had a range of outcomes which are discussed in the text. BTXA is useful in the treatment of a select group of children with strabismus. If there is evidence of threatened or recently lost binocularity, or risk of creating or worsening diplopia after surgery, it is a useful therapeutic tool. In children with strabismus of unusual cause it has diagnostic value.","785":"VLBW children are known to have a high frequency of early onset strabismus, which is related to the high prevalence of pre- and perinatal cerebral disturbances reported in these children. It is unknown if the early onset strabismus in VLBW children has the characteristics of infantile esotropia. If so, then (acquired) cerebral damage may play an important role in the origin of this type of strabismus. For this reason, the charts of 265 VLBW children were retrospectively reviewed. Strabismus was present in 55 (20.7%) children. Mean follow-up was 75 weeks, with 29.8% of the children having a follow-up of less then 6 months. Only 5 children (1.9%) with characteristics of infantile esotropia could be identified. Another 8 children (3.0%) possibly had infantile esotropia, but follow-up had been too infrequent during the first year of life to determine the time of onset of strabismus precisely. The other 42 children with strabismus all had ophthalmological disorders (i.e. ROP, optic nerve atrophy, cortical blindness) explaining early disruption of binocular visual development. Therefore, VLBW children are at risk for early onset strabismus. However, infantile esotropia is not typical for VLBW children and may be an indication that early acquired cerebral damage does not play an important role in the pathogenesis of infantile esotropia.","786":"The contrast sensitivity function was assessed in children and adults with normal vision, visual impairment due to ocular disease, and strabismic amblyopia. The methods used were: the LH contrast vision test and the ability to detect raisins, puffed rice and white and black sugar strands against a white and black background. The aim of the study was to see whether any of the tests could be used in the detection of subnormal vision, and to compare the results between the different groups of patients. The following parameters of contrast sensitivity function (CSF) were measured with the LH-test: the maximum contrast sensitivity, the total area of CSF, and the area of 8 spatial frequency bands. Difficulty in detecting an object with low versus high contrast was measured with the sugar strands. Subjects with subnormal vision due to ocular disease and strabismic amblyopia had lower contrast sensitivity than subjects with normal vision measured as the total area of the CSF or the area of a specific frequency band. However, the maximum contrast sensitivity value that could be measured with the test was not significantly different between the groups. No subject had difficulties in the detection of raisins and puffed rice on a white and black background. Difficulties in detecting sugar strands on a white background were not seen in the normal children, but approximately 65% of the children with visual impairment had difficulties, as did approximately 25% of the children and adults with strabismus. Most of these subjects also had low visual acuity, but there was no correlation between the level of reduction of visual acuity and the difficulty in detecting sugar strands.","787":"","788":"The clinical signs of the rarely encountered ocular neuromyotonia consist of transient involuntary tonic contraction and delayed relaxation of single or multiple extraocular muscles, resulting in episodic diplopia. With a mean time delay of 3.5 years, this motility disorder frequently follows tumor excision or adjuvant radiation near the skull base. Ocular neuromyotonia may reflect inappropriate discharge from oculomotor neurons with unstable cell membranes because of segmental demyelinization by tumor compression and radiation-induced microangiopathy. In the present paper, the authors present the case of a 53-year-old patient with a history of transsphenoidal hypophysectomy and adjuvant radiotherapy, who underwent strabismus surgery for abducens palsy.","789":"To study the effects of Duane's retraction syndrome on sensory visual development. Monocular and binocular visual function and ocular motility have been studied and pattern reversal visual evoked potentials recorded from 22 patients with Duane's syndrome aged from 4 to 55 years. Sixteen of the patients maintained binocular single vision using an abnormal head posture. All had normal visual acuities in both eyes. The 12 adults in this group had a mean stereoacuity of 78 seconds of arc with the Titmus stereotest and 101 seconds of arc with the TNO test. Both these values were significantly worse than for normal adults with a similar age range. The binocular VEPs from these patients showed enhancement of the binocular P100 VEP amplitude compared to the mean monocular P100 amplitude when they used their head posture but, unlike in normal subjects, this binocular enhancement was not reduced significantly after the age of 5. Six patients had lost binocular function and had a manifest convergent squint. Of these, 4 were anisometropic. VEPs in this group showed mildly delayed P100 latencies in the affected eye with asymmetric amplitudes even though their amblyopia had been successfully treated by patching and only one patient had a substantially reduced acuity. In neither group was there any relationship between the degree of restriction of ocular motility and the sensory changes. Patients with Duane's syndrome who retain binocular single vision show abnormal binocular visual maturation after the age of 5 years. This results in reduced stereoacuity in the absence of amblyopia. ","790":"The aim of the study was to assess different visual acuity tests in the age group 1 1\/2-6 years in 105 children with assumed normal vision, visual impairment due to ocular disease or strabismus. Acuity tasks for young children can be divided into three subtypes according to the kind of stimulus used. For \"detection acuity\", the stimulus should be detected or distinguished from the background, as assessed with the Stycar Rolling Balls. For \"resolution acuity\", the stimulus pattern should be resolved, as assessed with the Preferential Looking procedure (Teller Acuity Cards). For \"recognition acuity\", the stimulus must be recognized by the subject as assessed with the BUST-D symbol test, Sheridan Gardiner (S-G) single letters, LH single symbols and line tests, and also the HVOT test. Different acuity values were obtained with regard to detection, resolution and recognition acuities. Assessment with the Stycar Rolling Balls only gave a rough estimate of the visual function. There was an overestimation of the acuity values in all groups of children when using the Preferential Looking technique. Good agreement was found between the LH line and HVOT tests. The BUST-D test, S-G single letters, and LH single symbols gave slightly better acuity values than linear recognition tests. A \"crowding ratio\" was calculated by dividing the single optotype acuity by the linear acuity, and also by dividing the grating acuity by the optotype linear and single acuity. The crowding ratio varied in the individual children and in the different groups, being highest for strabismic amblyopia. The general conclusion is that reliable visual acuity measurements were not obtained until the visual acuity could be assessed with a recognition test using linear letters or symbols.","791":"","792":"","793":"","794":"To determine whether strabismus surgery significantly influences corneal curvature, corneal topography was measured in 68 patients before and both one day and three months after strabismus surgery.

Long term absolute astigmatism increased not significantly by 0.16 D. Our results demonstrate that strabismus surgery can induce transitory but usually no long term changes of corneal topography. Patients should be informed, however, that in rare cases an induced astigmatism may persist.","795":"Amblyopia is the leading cause of monocular vision loss in people under 40 years, and especially in children. The purpose of the present investigation is to determine the prevalence of amblyopia and ocular pathology, specially the most common causes of amblyopia, in a population of 3-to 6-year-old children. From a total of 8167 children, a geographically defined population of 3-to 6-year-old children, 2000 were randomly selected, and 1179 (58.9%) examined. Ophthalmologic examination included: Personal and familial history, visual acuity, extraocular motility, cover test at near distance, cycloplegic refraction with autorefractometer and fundus eye examination. Amblyopia was considered when corrected visual acuity was &lt; 0.5 with Marquez optotypes and difference in visual acuity of 0.2 or more between eyes. Pathology considered as amblyogenic were strabismus, visual acuity asymmetry and anisometropia. The family history showed amblyopia in 249 (21.1%), strabismus in 227 (19.2%), and refractive errors in 808 (65.5%). Cover test was positive in 78 children (6.7%). A visual acuity difference of 0.2 or more between eyes was present in 88 (7.5%) children, and anisometropia over 1.5 diopters (in spherical equivalent) was present in 17 (1.4%) subjects. One hundred and twenty-two (10.35%) children did not achieve a normal visual acuity: visual acuity in the better eye was less than 0.5 in 55 children under 5 years and less than 0.6 in 67 children over 5 years. The prevalence of amblyopia was 7.5%. The data support the importance of early detection and treatment of amblyopia and the need for visual screening at an early age. ","796":null,"797":"A total of 101 patients (total group) with primary large angle esotropia who had primary bimedial rectus recession (BMR) of 6.5 mm or more were reviewed in a retrospective study. The average pre-operative size of the deviation was 63.5 prism diopters (PD) for near and 58.2 PD for distance. Of these, 26 patients (group I) attended for one post-operative visit only. The remaining 75 patients (group II) were followed for an average period of 17.7 months. Among group II patients there was an average shift in the post-operative deviation towards divergence consisting of-6.4 PD for near and-5.5 PD for distance. The alignment (deviation of 10 PD or below) rate in the first postoperative visit was 31.7%; undercorrection was 60.4% and overcorrection was 7.9%. At the end of the period of follow-up the above rates were 40%, 42.7%, and 17.3% respectively without further surgery. This increase in the overcorrection rate was solely derived from the initially aligned patients. Amblyopia and\/or poor fixation were found to be of significance in the production of overcorrection. There was no direct relationship between the age of surgery, duration of follow-up or the degree of the BMR and the rate of correction. Among group II patients, post-operative ocular movements analysis revealed limitation of adduction of-0.5 to-0.75 (out of scale 0 to-4.00) in 22.7% (17\/75) and-1.00 to-1.50 in 6.7% (5\/75). None had more than-1.5 limitation of adduction. Large BMR is an acceptable surgical modality for the management of large angle esotropia. It has approximately 50% alignment rate. Slight undercorrection is recommended especially in the presence of significant amblyopia and\/or poor fixation. No significant limitation of adduction was encountered.","798":"","799":"","800":"","801":"","802":"The effect of surgery in highly asymmetric dissociated vertical deviations (DVD) was evaluated in 13 patients. All the patients had a moderate or large DVD (more than 15 PD) in one eye with a latent or very small (less than 5 PD) DVD in the fellow eye. As there was no strong fixation preference in either of the two eyes of the patients before surgery, bilateral surgery was performed. Eleven patients underwent surgery which consisted of conventional (3-5 mm) superior rectus (SR) recession combined with posterior fixation sutures placed 13 mm from the original insertion in the eye with moderate or large DVD, with posterior fixation sutures alone in the eye with minimal or latent DVD. In the remaining two patients, bilateral conventional SR recessions were combined with posterior fixation sutures. The mean follow-up was eight months. A cure was defined as latency or elimination of the hyperdeviation and was noted in five patients, two of whom had undergone bilateral SR recessions with posterior fixation sutures. All the remaining eight patients developed a cosmetically unacceptable moderate or large DVD (more than 15 PD) in the eye that had a very small DVD prior to surgery, two of them having a manifest comitant hypertropia postoperatively in addition to the DVD, demonstrating overcorrections with the previously elevated eye now in a hypotropic position. Performing posterior fixation sutures alone to the eye with a very small DVD does not seem to be effective in the surgical treatment of DVD; combining posterior fixation sutures with a recession of the SR muscle seems to be a more reasonable approach.","803":null,"804":"In an attempt to evaluate the response to surgical treatment, the surgical outcome of 16 patients with Duane's retraction syndrome (DRS) was investigated. Single horizontal rectus muscle recession, transposition of vertical recti and recession of both horizontal recti were carried out. In one of the four patients with significant globe retraction, Y splitting of the lateral rectus muscle was added to the procedure to overcome the cosmetically unacceptable upshoot. Single horizontal muscle recession surgery was effective in reducing the abnormal head posture and the deviation in primary position. The results of both horizontal recti recession were not so predictable in reducing globe retraction. Recession of both horizontal recti was ineffective in vertical DRS. It is suggested that the variability of surgical outcome in DRS may be related to the different innervational patterns and mechanical factors.","805":"The authors present a 75-year-old patient with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) and ophthalmoplegia.

This report details the surgical treatment and outcome of 6 patients with disparate distance-near deviations due to different etiologies. The surgical procedure involves recessing all four horizontal recti on both eyes using the adjustable suture technique. The approach to surgery consisted of operating on the vergence angle with the larger deviation with a bilateral lateral rectus recession (BLREC) or a bilateral medial rectus recession (BMREC) and simultaneously operating on the smaller vergence angle, treating the total induced deviation with the bilateral recession not used first (remaining BLREC or BMREC). All patients had a significant decrease in their distance-near disparity, increased horizontal comitance, normalization of their accommodative convergence to accommodation ratios, and resolution of diplopia. A four horizontal recti muscle, adjustable suture recession is another technique that can be added to the treatment regimens for distance-near disparity strabismic syndromes.","812":"","813":"","814":"While, in routine strabismus surgery, empirical guidelines and experience are the best in judging which eye muscles to operate, a complex case may need a unique surgical approach, the consequences of which cannot always be envisioned in detail. We sought to improve the results of surgery in these cases by preoperative simulation of each case with the Computerized Strabismus Model 1.0 (CSM). The basis of this model was laid by David A. Robinson. It has been improved by us over the past years to the point that it can be used clinically. Improvements concerned, for example, the mechanics of the eye muscles and the anatomy of insertions and origins. The ease of operation has been improved and the algorithms have been made so much faster that a full calculation for 9 positions of gaze now takes 10 seconds on a hand-held Hewlett Packard 200LX Palmtop. From 1994 onwards, all cases to be operated in our department which were more complex than straightforward horizontal rectus muscle surgery were simulated in the model preoperatively. The predictions of the model compared well with the actual result of surgery in most cases. The model was particularly good in handling complex and unique disorders of motility. However, the model could not reliably predict the effect of strabismus surgery in cases with mechanical restrictions of motility.","815":"The development of monocular grating acuity was studied in 210 children between 1 and 6 years using Teller Acuity Cards (TAC). 95 of these children were also tested with the Keeler Acuity Cards (KAC). Monocular visual acuity measured with the TAC showed a gradual increase from 8.4 to 32.4 c\/deg for 7 to 79 month-olds and with the KAC from 14.5 to 31.4 c\/deg for 19 to 78 month-olds. Mean visual acuity at 6 years was still 0.5-1.0 octave lower than grating acuity in adults. The results of 95 children tested with TAC and KAC did not indicate any significant differences between the acuity scores obtained with the two tests. Stimulus configuration of the TAC did not result in overestimation of acuity in children 1-6 years of age. In 141 older children (39-79 months), the TAC test was compared with a recognition test (C-test). Children between 3 and 5 years of age reached significantly lower acuities with the C-test than with the TAC. The C-test showed a higher sensitivity for unconnected refractive errors than the acuity card tests.","816":"Twenty adult patients with strabismic amblyopia were examined with seven different contrast sensitivity tests in order to determine which of these tests is the most sensitive in the detection of amblyopia. Both grating tests (Vistech, Arden, Cadwell, and Cambridge) and optotype tests (LH, Regan, and Pelli-Robson) were used. The following parameters of the contrast sensitivity function (CSF) were measured: maximum contrast sensitivity, total area of CSF and the area of 8 different spatial frequency bands in the CSF. Based on non-parametric tests, it was found that separations of the normal from the amblyopic eye by means of CSF could be done with: - maximum contrast sensitivity using the Vistech test; - total CSF area using all tests except the Cadwell test; - area of frequency bands (within 1-16 cycles per degree) using Vistech, Pelli-Robson, and the Arden tests; - maximum spatial frequency for tests with a fixed contrast using the LH and Regan tests.","817":"","818":null,"819":"Brown's syndrome is generally an isolated clinical condition.

Detection and measurement of (insufficient) accommodation is necessary for adequate management of these patients. Dynamic retinoscopy reversal was used to estimate the accommodative amplitude. Subjective point of blur was compared in two groups of healthy and ophthalmologically normal preschool children: (1) six weeks to one year, (2) one year to six years, in comparison to a group of (3) five years to 12 years, who underwent two different tests. Four targets, mounted on a hand-held occluder, are introduced and tested, 1-3 showing different, more or less detailed and fine drawings of faces, 4 showing a grating of lower spatial frequency with a center of high spatial frequency. The subjective near point for the targets was also tested and compared in 12 young adults (16 to 31 years). The finest drawing appeared to be most adequate for reproducing the closest near point in young adults. This also applies for children above 2% years, while younger children showed better performance and more constant fixation with roughly outlined, schematic drawings of a smiling face. The grating was met with no (babies below two months) or little interest (older infants). The amplitude of accommodation seemed less good with the grating in preschool children. Thus, dynamic retinoscopy is an adequate method to estimate the amplitude of accommodation in early childhood, and the drawing of a smiling face on a 5 cm target is an adequate stimulus attracting attention and accommodation of preverbal children and even babies.","821":"The authors report on a newly developed data base program for strabismus patients.

Binocularity in the primary visual cortex (VI) measured electrophysiologically was reduced both in a monkey with resolved strabismus and in a monkey with accommodative strabismus when compared to normal controls. By contrast, binocularity in the nucleus of the optic tract and dorsal terminal nucleus of the accessory optic system (NOT-DTN) was only reduced in the monkey with resolved strabismus ('resolved'), but appeared normal in animals with accommodative strabismus ('accom. 1 'and 'accom. 2'). Sub-threshold binocular interactions were normal in all animals. The velocity tuning curves of retinal slip neurons in the NOT-DTN of all strabismic monkeys were not different from normal controls. Horizontal optokinetic nystagmus was asymmetric in monkey 'accom. 2', and for the non-fixating eye in monkey 'resolved'. In monkey 'accom. 1' OKN was normal. Open loop eye velocity was lower in the monkey with resolved strabismus than in monkeys with accommodative strabismus. These data suggest that different causes of strabismus may affect neuronal response properties and behavior to different degrees. The effects on the optokinetic reflex of resolved, but early onset strabismus were more severe than those of accommodative strabismus. This corresponds to the wide variability of defects in the optokinetic system of strabismic humans.","823":"","824":"","825":"","826":"In this article we review our further development of D.A.

First, an extensive literature study has been carried out to get more accurate data on the anatomy of the average eye and the eye muscles, and about how these vary with age and with refraction. Secondly, the force-length relations that represent the mechanical characteristics of the eye muscles in the model have been determined more accurately in vivo recently, and the model was changed accordingly. Thirdly, many parameters that were free in the original model and not derived from in vivo measurements were replaced by derivatives from in vivo measurements or made redundant. Fourthly, the ease of operation was improved greatly and the algorithms were made so much faster that a calculation for nine positions of gaze now takes ten seconds on a handheld HP 200LX Palmtop. The predictions of the model compared well with clinical results in horizontal muscle surgery, oblique muscle surgery, forced duction tests and abducens, oculomotor or trochlear palsies. Consequently, complex strabismus surgery in our clinic is now guided by the predictions of the computerized model.","827":"Two methods to measure visual acuity in children aged 18 months and upwards are described, the Kolt-test and the O-test. The validity of the tests was evaluated. These new tests are based on the ability of small children to identify symbols of increasing complexity as they grow older. Thus, a circle is recognized at 12 months, and a cross at about 24 months, while recognition of a triangle and a square comes in between. Correct performance is rewarded. Simplified procedures permit testing children with visual acuity below 0.1 (6\/60, 20\/200). The tests may also be used in mentally retarded persons if conventional methods fail.","828":"Tracking of large visual targets by normal neonates and by infants with visual cortex damage has led to the suggestion that infants use subcortical vision to guide visuomotor behaviors.

Use of a full-field, high-contrast visual stimulus failed to elicit any evidence of optokinetic nystagmus.

Diplopia persisted in six patients (13.6%) and limitation of ductions occurred in 22 of 44 patients (50%). The risk of developing postoperative strabismus was 2.5 times longer if an implant was placed under a rectus muscle. Otherwise, presence, degree, and direction of the duction deficits did not correlate with placement of a local implant under the corresponding rectus muscles or their antagonists. Reoperation, preoperative detachment of macula and size of the local implant were not statistically correlated with extraocular muscle imbalance. We believe that decrease in postoperative swelling and increase in visual acuity that allows phoria adaptation are the main causes of spontaneous resolution.","836":null,"837":"","838":"In patients with obligate fixation disparity central objects may be seen double when peripheral fusion manifests. The diplopia cannot be treated with prisms because fusional power of the peripheral retina breaks down central fusion.

The authors report on the clinical findings of a 45-year-old man with macular dystrophy who complained about binocularly perceived vertical diplopia up to Id`. Investigation with Aulhorn's phase difference haploscope revealed an inhomogeneous retinal correspondence in the vertical plane with a displacement of the visual field center relative to the periphery by 0.6 degrees. Paracentral scarring was associated with a displacement of central retinal receptors. The center of the visual field and the peripheral field could not be fused simultaneously.

The presence of latent fixation nystagmus was tested by requiring the subjects to steadily fixate a stationary target subtending less than I deg of visual arc. OKN was tested using high-contrast, vertically-oriented moving stripes that filled 80 deg of the visual field. A macaque monkey who had infantile strabismus induced by alternating occlusion from birth showed latent nystagmus highly similar to that recorded in an adult human subject with infantile strabismus. The strabismic monkey also had asymmetric OKN similar to that of the strabismic human, favoring nasally-directed stimulus motion when viewing with either eye. Neither nystagmus nor an OKN asymmetry was observed in a normal macaque or in humans who had normal binocular vision. The findings of latent nystagmus and OKN asymmetries in the strabismic monkey support the notion that monkeys who have infantile-onset strabismus are an appropriate ocular motor model of human infantile strabismus.","840":"","841":"","842":"","843":"","844":"The authors report a preliminary study on the usefulness of Ryser filters fixed on a pole to evaluate the degree of penalization needed to induce the imbalance of visual inputs coming through the right and the left eye.

Excyclotorsion is not usually a major complaint in true unilateral superior oblique paresis. Occasional cases, however, may find this symptom bothersome and it may interfere with fusion. The purpose of the present study is to determine the effect of the unilateral modified Harada-lto procedure on the correction of symptomatic excyclotorsion in unilateral superior oblique paresis. A retrospective case-note review of patients with unilateral superior oblique paresis undergoing unilateral modified Harada-lto procedures during the five-year period 1988-1993 was performed. Six patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Superior oblique paresis was congenital in one case, secondary to trauma in two cases and idiopathic acquired in three cases. There were four males and two females aged from 25 to 63 years and all but one had previous surgery. The mean pre-operative excyclotorsion was approximately 10 degrees (range 8-14 degrees). Mean post-operative excyclotorsion was 3 degrees (range 2 degrees incyclotorsion -10 degrees excyclotorsion). The unilateral modified Harada-lto procedure is an effective surgical treatment of excyclotorsion resulting from superior oblique paresis and may improve sensory and motor fusion. ","852":"Eight patients with secondary strabismus as a result of longstanding unilateral traumatic cataract or uncorrected aphakia were seen in the Orthoptic Department between April 1993 and September 1994. At the initial orthoptic examination three patients did not have any binocular vision and five patients demonstrated some form of binocularity although the fusional amplitude was seriously reduced. Three of these five patients showed just a small heterophoria and a better fusional amplitude within six months after a good optical correction and\/or prescription of prisms with or without strabismus surgery. Orthoptic examination and therapy is mandatory in these patients because binocular functions can be restored in some of them, in spite of the long interval between trauma and optical correction.","853":"It has long been advocated that the accuracy of the synoptophore is affected by the artificial viewing conditions it provides and the patient's awareness of its proximity, which results in an increase in the angle in ET and a decrease in XT. The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the agreement between distance horizontal strabismus measurements taken with the synoptophore and PCT. Fifty-four measurements (n = 42: 28 with ET, 14 with XT) were analysed. The PCT was repeated by a second examiner and the measurements (n = 17) were compared to those of the first examiner's prism measurements. The main finding was a high agreement between the measurements obtained by the two methods (ICC: R = 0.91). There was an eso-shift of the deviation at the synoptophore (compared with the PCT) in 26% and an exo-shift in 28%. Therefore, over-convergence was just as likely to occur as un-der-convergence. The findings cannot support the popular notion that the synoptophore exaggerates the angle in ET and understates it in XT. Furthermore, it was shown that the variability between the two measurement methods was similar to the inter-examiner variability for the PCT. It was concluded that the synoptophore measurements are valid and that the phenomenon of over-convergence with this device ('instrument convergence') is not a relevant clinical entity.","854":"Fifty-two children with infantile esotropia had surgery for their esotropia between two and seven years of age. Another 49 had similar surgery before the age of two years. Of these 101 operated children, the esotropia in 70 patients was aligned to within 10 prism diopters. The patients with successful alignment were reviewed to study the effect of early versus late surgical intervention of their deviation, i.e. before and after two years of age. The motor and sensory states of the selected patients were analysed before and after surgical correction. The choice and number of surgical procedures employed are discussed. It appears that patients two years and older when strabismus was surgically corrected have a good chance of alignment, but less chance of attaining binocularity. In many cases there was a V-pat-tern esotropia, requiring surgery on the overacting inferior oblique muscles. In comparison, the younger group with earlier surgery appeared to show a better chance of attaining binocularity and fewer patients had significant V-pattern requiring surgery on the inferior oblique muscles.","855":"A 13-year-old white female with a past medical history of facial acne treated with minocycline presented with headaches, normal visual acuity, bilaterally enlarged blind spots on visual field testing due to bilateral disc edema, and a right fourth nerve palsy. Neuroimaging studies were normal and a lumbar puncture revealed an elevated opening pressure but normal cerebrospinal fluid contents. The diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri was made and the patient was treated with acetazolamide. The papilledema improved over several weeks and the fourth nerve palsy resolved completely. Fourth nerve palsy is an uncommonly reported nonlocalizing sign in pseudotumor cerebri.","856":"","857":"","858":"In general an A-or V-symptom is an additional sign of an oblique muscle dysfunction and is treated by surgery of oblique muscles. The vertical transposition of horizontal rectus muscles is a suitable treatment only in those cases with no coexistent vertical deviation. The mechanical particularities of this vertical displacement are summarized. Possible side effects of this surgical method, including cyclotropia are reported.","859":"Three patients affected by the congenital mono-ophthalmia syndrome were submitted to horizontal eye movements recording. The aim was to study the nystagmus and its characteristics, in order to give information that could explain signs and symptoms of the syndrome. Eye movements recording and analysis displayed a jerk nystagmus with a decreasing-velocity exponential slow phase, characteristic of a latent\/manifest-latent nystagmus. The intensity of nystagmus decreased in adduction of the viewing eye, and increased in abduction in accordance with Alexander's law. The fast phase was toward the viewing eye. There was no reversal of the fast phase, nor an instability of gaze in the blind eye.","860":"","861":"The Early vs. Late Infantile Strabismus Surgery Study Group is a group of strabismologists and orthoptists who investigate whether early or late surgery is preferable in infantile strabismus, in a non-randomized, prospective, multi-center trial. Infants between six and 18 months of age will receive a standardized entry examination and then be operated either before their second anniversary, in clinics A, or between 32nd and 60th month of age in clinics B. The children will be evaluated at age six. After completion of the study, the two groups can then be compared regarding degree of binocular vision, angle of strabismus and visual acuity of the worse eye relative to the better one. This is the second monitoring report of the study.","862":"Lack of cone function is one and nystagmus is the other cause of low vision in patients with rod monochromatism. The nystagmus has been assumed to be a consequence of the increased light sensitivity due to the predominance of rods. However, symptoms of patients with cone dystrophy are not very different from those observed in patients with congenital nystagmus. For example, they occasionally have a dampening of the nystagmus on fixation at near. Therefore, like in congenital nystagmus, we can elicit convergence innervation during fixation at distance with prisms base-out or with a surgically induced divergence ('artificial divergence'). This approach only works in patients with binocular function, necessary to keep the eyes aligned. The authors report on three patients with complete rod monochromatism in whom they performed an artificial divergence operation (OAD) by recessing the medial rectus muscle and resecting the lateral muscle of one eye. After surgery, the measured visual acuity was the same but the nystagmus of these patients had been considerably reduced. The patients themselves considered the effect of surgery a great improvement.","863":"Duane's retraction syndrome is sometimes associated with developmental ocular and extraocular abnormalities. This disorder may also be present in association with specific malformative syndromes. The authors report the clinical features of a seven-year-old female affected by Duane's retraction syndrome (D.R.S.), rectoperineal fistula, imperforate anus and other congenital malformations. From two extensive reviews of 106 reports published before 1982 and from a search (using Medline 1981-1994) for reports of congenital malformations associated with this syndrome, no cases of sporadic D.R.S. associated with the perineal malformations mentioned were found, even though imperforate anus is considered the commoner of hindgut malformation.","864":"Surgically induced changes of eye torsion often show a subjective over-effect which resolves later on. Hence the authors initiated a prospective study with the purpose of analyzing motoric and sensoric elements in postoperative rotational changes by comparing subjective and objective cycloduction. Fundus cyclometry, a new method for measurement of objective cycloduction, is introduced. An image of the posterior pole is obtained by an infrared Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope without pupil dilatation and is transferred to a computer system by which nature and amount of objective cycloduction is calculated. Four patients who underwent surgery for oblique eye muscle disorders are presented. Objective torsional changes were slightly higher than subjective changes. Postoperative reduction of torsional changes was noted subjectively and objectively in all cases. For statistical reasons further investigations on a great number of patients are needed to interpret the postoperative changes in terms of motoric and sensoric cyclofusion.","865":"","866":"Increasing extraocular muscle length by regenerative growth has been proposed as a potentially useful means of treating patients with paralytic or multiple re-operation strabismus. This study evaluates the viability and pattern of regeneration of fresh, autologous extraocular muscle and temporalis muscle transplants in the canine orbit. Bilateral grafts of either inferior oblique or temporalis muscle were sewn between host lateral rectus muscles and the globe. Grafts were biopsied and examined by light and electron microscopy at survival times to 56 days. Functional responses to abducens nucleus stimulation were examined in one extraocular muscle and one temporalis muscle graft at 15 weeks post-operatively. During the first week, both graft types were characterized by loss of pre-terminal nerve from neuromuscular junctions, muscle fiber necrosis that spared the central fibers, and inflammatory cell infiltrate. Myoblasts migrated into and fused within the existing basal laminae of degenerating fibers. By 14 days, grafts were populated by immature myofibers. Neuromuscular junctions were seen by 56 days, coinciding with muscle fiber differentiation as seen by enzyme histochemistry. Only two grafts failed to show regeneration. At 15 weeks survival, both types of grafts contracted in response to abducens nucleus stimulation. Free skeletal muscle grafts to extraocular muscle survive and mature with clear evidence of contractility by 15 weeks. These data suggest that muscle graft procedures could be useful in the management of certain types of strabismus where greater muscle length is needed.","867":"To investigate the relationship between intraocular lens (IOL) malposition and quality of binocular single vision following uncomplicated extracapsular cataract extraction and posterior chamber IOL implantation. Fifty-two bilaterally pseudophakic patients were included. The main outcome measures were visual acuity, stereoscopic acuity, horizontal and vertical amplitudes of fusion and heterophoria, tilting angle and decentration amount of the pseudophacos and summation of these values in somewhat vectorial manner to define the total decentration and tilt of IOLS. The mean total horizontal decentration was 0.19 mm and vertical decentration was 0.90 mm, mean total horizontal tilt being 1.55 degrees and vertical tilt 7.52 degrees. The mean stereoscopic acuity was found to be 1020 seconds of arc. Although the stereoscopic acuity threshold increased as decentration and tilt of IOLS increased, only the horizontal tilt was found to be statistically significantly correlated with stereoscopic acuity (pc0.01). The quality of binocular single vision may be affected by IOL malposition in pseudophakic patients. Therefore, when an IOL implantation is planned, the most appropriate IOL design and surgical technique causing least decentration and tilt should be preferred. ","868":"The long-term result of surgery in intermittent exotropia is often an undercorrection and relapse into tropia. This may be due to an underestimation of the horizontal angle and\/or an undetected vertical component. The aim of the present study was to test which method, prism neutralization or diagnostic occlusion was best suited to attain the maximal angle of horizontal and vertical deviation. Twenty-two patients with intermittent exotropia but without initial vertical or incomitant components participated in the study. The horizontal deviation was neutralized with prisms for periods of 14 days on four different occasions with diagnostic occlusion three times for periods of one, three or ten days in between. Measurements of sensory functions and the amount of deviations were performed before and after the procedures. It was shown that the largest horizontal deviation was elicited by prism neutralization without previous occlusion and the largest vertical deviation by diagnostic occlusion for ten days. Conditions of initial divergence excess and lateral incomitances usually were restored by both procedures.","869":"Dissociated vertical deviation (DVD), a vertical strabismus, is often associated with infantile esotropia, latent nystagmus and excyclo-torsion. DVD usually becomes apparent at about three years of age. The authors wished to determine whether DVD is a manifestation of an abnormal motor vergence system or is part of a visual system disorder. Vertical eye movements of six subjects with DVD, on cover-uncover and alternate cover tests, were studied using the magnetic search eye coil system. Asymmetry between the eyes' saccades were quantified during the DVD upward movement and during a trial of pure vertical saccades. In three subjects the vertical deviation increased to its full amount through a smooth vertical divergence movement, and in the other three patients through a combination of smooth and asymmetrical saccade-like movements. The latencies of the DVD, the peak velocity of the deviation movements, its time constant and the asymmetries in the saccades suggest that DVD represents an abnormal vertical vergence system.","870":"","871":"Photorefractors are objective refraction devices that determine the refractive state from the size and shape of a static light reflex in the pupil of the eye. The technique may be of interest for pediatric ophthalmology, because it can be used with small children. The refraction technique requires only little cooperation. It is able to operate from an arbitrary working distance. Both eyes are measured at the same time. The following short communication describes basic working principles and the current state of development.","872":"The authors examined vertical vergence in a 15-year-old girl with dissociated vertical deviation, a 6d` convergent strabismus, no binocular vision, latent nystagmus, and a minimal left amblyopia. Eye movements were recorded during 4s-periods of (1) both eyes open, alternated with 4s-periods of (2a) right eye covered, (2b) left eye covered or (2c) both eyes closed. The patient preferred fixation with the right eye; when this eye was covered, the left eye took over fixation with an almost completely monocular, downward saccade (a horizontal saccade occurred at the same time). The right eye only made a very small saccade, and then started to drift upward with an exponentially decreasing velocity. Enright has shown that fast convergence or divergence may occur when a horizontal saccade is performed at the same time. Similarly, the authors suspected that, in their patient, vertical vergence was facilitated by the horizontal saccade that resulted, in this case of horizontal strabismus, from alternation of fixation. To examine whether this was the case, they compensated for the horizontal strabismus by placing a 30 prism-dioptre base-out prism in front of the left eye (the patient had no binocular vision). With the prism in place, the horizontal saccade that occurred when the right eye was covered was smaller, and only little vertical vergence occurred together with the horizontal saccade. It seems possible that vertical vergence is also facilitated by horizontal saccades.","873":"The authors propose a model that provides an explanation for the ocular motility, anatomical and electromyographic features of Duane's syndrome. It is proposed that, in the human embryo, the abducens nucleus is derived from the same stem cells as the oculomotor nucleus. Duane's syndrome represents a failure of differentiation and displacement of the abducens nucleus from the oculomotor nucleus in the 21- to 26-day-old human embryo.","874":null,"875":"The clinical appearance of dissociated vertical deviation (DVD) can be modified by the presence of other vertical deviations. This may be one of the reasons of relatively late diagnosis (sometimes even only after a first strabismus operation). If the DVD is not recognized preoperatively, this can lead to unexpected failure of the strabismus operation, with cosmetically unacceptable vertical deviations. The key to early diagnosis is a meticulous observation with special attention to differences in vertical deviations on right and left eye fixation in primary position and in levo- and dextroversion, using the alternating cover test. This is relatively easy and non-invasive. The authors propose a method for registration and analysis of the results. This method leads in most cases to a reliable diagnosis of the different components of the vertical deviation. The authors illustrate this method in 82 patients. In the large majority, the method presented allowed them to evaluate the respective importance of each component. Their sample illustrates convincingly the wide variety of clinical expressions of DVD. Only six patients presented a DVD without associated vertical deviations. In many cases the DVD was less important than the associated vertical deviations. This explains the difficulty of diagnosis of DVD in many cases.","876":"","877":"","878":"","879":"","880":"","881":"","882":"","883":"","884":"The Early vs. Late Infantile Strabismus Surgery Study Group is a group of strabismologists and orthoptists who investigate whether early or late surgery is preferable in infantile strabismus, in a non-randomized, prospective, multi-centre trial.

Objective deviation was more than 45 prism diopters (PD) in all of the patients preoperatively. After surgery the deviation ranged between -10 PD and +IO PD in 26 (81.2%) patients, and limitation of abduction disappeared in all of the cases. A slight limitation of adduction was encountered in two (6.2%) patients. The authors concluded that bimedial rectus recession with a loop is an effective method as an early surgical procedure in patients with infantile esotropia with a large deviation.","886":"Diagnostic occlusion is used in strabismus to examine the changes in the angle of squint after a period of disrupted fusion. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of diagnostic occlusion on ocular alignment in normal subjects without strabismus and other ocular motility related symptoms. Diagnostic occlusion of the non-dominant eye was applied to ten subjects for three days. In all cases a small horizontal deviation was seen in the primary position and in three cases also a small vertical deviation was noted. Diagnostic occlusion for seven days was applied in nine persons. Changes in alignment of approximately the same size as after three days of occlusion were seen. In both groups incomitances of ocular alignment were noted that indicate small muscle imbalances particularly in the oblique muscles of normal subjects that are easily compensated by normal motor fusion.","887":null,"888":"","889":"Force-length recordings were made from isolated human eye muscles during strabismus surgery in local, eye-drop anesthesia in 32 adult patients. From each muscle three recordings were made: (I) while the patient looked with the other eye into the field of action of the recorded muscle, (2) looked ahead, and (3) looked out of the field of action of the recorded muscle. Non-innervated eye muscles (state 3) had an approximately exponential relation between force and length. During contraction evoked by letting the patient look ahead or into the field of action of the muscle (states 1 or 2), the relation between force and length was grossly linear. The approximate spring constants of horizontal rectus muscles that had not been operated on before ranged from 2 to 4 g\/mm. In palsies, the degree of muscle paresis could be quantified accurately using this method and, accordingly, cases of true superior oblique palsy could be well differentiated from strabismus sursoadductorius (= upshoot in adduction) that may mimic a superior oblique palsy. In seven patients with Graves' disease of recent onset, affected muscles were found to be very stiff when the other eye looked ahead. It was expected that these stiff muscles would be able to shorten to some extent but would not be able to lengthen, due to fibrosis of the muscle. We found, however, that the affected muscles lengthened considerably when the other eye looked out of the field of action of the muscle. This implies that, in these cases of Graves' disease of recent onset, the raised muscle tension and reduced elasticity of the affected muscles and, hence, the strabismus were primarily caused by active muscle contraction, not by fibrosis.","890":"The importance of the occlusion test is analysed in patients who were operated for a decompensating exophoria or an intermittent exotropia. Of particular interest before and after the occlusion test was the number of the following variables: the distant angle, the near angle, the difference between these two (the so-called distant angle-near angle difference), and the angle at right respective left gaze. All patients included in this study had been examined at least three times preoperatively. The occlusion test was performed in all patients by occluding one eye on three consecutive days. A total of 36 patients with decompensating exophoria and 33 patients with intermittent exotropia were included in this retrospective clinical trial. Only the near angles of the patients with the decompensating exophorias demonstrated a statistically significant increase. All the other angles did not show a significant change. In contrast to what might have been expected, the difference between the distant angle and the near angle increased in the exophoria group. This was not the case in patients with intermittent exotropia. Thus the occlusion test cannot generally be recommended as an obligatory part of the preoperative diagnostics in patients with exophoria or intermittent exotropia. In selected cases it may however be worthwhile to decide on the exact extent of the operation planned.","891":"The authors investigated and specified the spatial extent of binocular suppression for normal and strabismic subjects at differing retinal eccentricities. Increment luminance thresholds for detecting a probe line which was presented to one eye were measured under the influence of a contralateral suppressing line. Probe sensitivities were obtained as a function of positional disparity of the contralateral suppressing line. Two normals and two strabismics served as subjects. The suppression patterns for the normal and strabismic subjects were similar except for the width of the suppression area. The interocular suppression functions were U-shaped, and there were significant effects of eccentricity. The spatial extent of suppression for normal subjects was between 2 and 20 min arc at the fovea or between 5 and 40 min arc at an eccentricity of 2 degrees. The maximum disparity which produced suppression effects in the strabismics was about half of that obtained for the normals, in either the foveal or near peripheral conditions. The psychophysically obtained U-shaped functions appear to be similar to the neuro-physiological data from cat striate cortex by Kato, Bishop &amp; Orban (1981). Therefore, the authors believe that these results may reflect the operation of an interocular version of the Westheimer function.","892":"","893":"","894":null,"895":"From May 1988, an endoscopically controlled endonasal orbital decompression was performed in 17 patients with malignant ophthalmopathy. Indications were exclusively acute loss of visual acuity or visual field defects, when medical and radiation therapy had failed. The new minimal invasive technique proceeds in three steps. First, an endonasal, endoscopically controlled ethmoidectomy with resection of the middle turbinate is done and the medial wall of the maxillary sinus is widely opened. Second, the medial and inferior orbital walls are removed, preserving the infraorbital nerve. In the last step, the periorbita is incised and the orbital fat herniates. The advantages of this procedure consist of the absence of exterior scars, the avoidance of lacrimal duct stenosis and bony defects in the maxilla and the prevention of the known morbidity of a Caldwell-Luc antrotomy with hypesthesia, dysesthesia and oro-antral fistula. The results were documented by computerized tomographic scans (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Hertel measurements, evaluation of ocular motility and ophthalmoscopy. All patients had a postoperative improvement of visual acuity. An average of 3-4 mm improvement in Hertel measurements was reached. Four patients who had a diplopia before the interventions developed a more significant diplopia postoperatively, whereas in all other patients ocular motility either improved (five patients) or remained the same. In conclusion, the endoscopically controlled endonasal procedure enables greater preservation of normal structures and provides results comparable with the common extranasal and transantral procedures without the disadvantages of the latter.","896":"If preoperative examinations indicate postoperative diplopia, we generally would dissuade a patient from a squint operation. In this situation, a reliable test for diplopia can be done by injection of Botulinum toxin into an eye-muscle. Thus a predominantly transient paresis is produced during which there is parallelism for a sufficient period of time, so that the patient has time enough to experience disturbing double vision or its absence. In all 31 patients of this study a clear decision for or against an operation was possible, only in three cases was an operation contraindicated.","897":"Extraoclar muscle development has been studied in two species of monkeys (Macaca nemestrina and Macaca fascicularis). In these studies, the authors have demonstrated a distinctive developmental difference between the two macaques. Specifically, tubular aggregates (ordered aggregations of sarcoplasmic reticulum) occur transiently in the orbital singly innervated muscle fiber type in nemestrina extraocular muscles only. Tubular aggregates are typically seen in skeletal muscle fast-twitch fibers during neuromuscular disease or experimental denervation. The alterations in developing extraocular muscle either may be indicative of a primary muscle disorder or may be secondary to neurologic maldevelopment. The authors suggest that the presence of tubular aggregates in the extraocular muscles of nemestrina monkeys may be indicative of aberrant innervation levels during early postnatal development.","898":"In the past 15 years all of our strabismus procedures in patients suffering from endocrine orbitopathy were carried out under topical anesthesia with full retention of all active motility of the globe. A total of 74 patients were operated on under such conditions with a total of 111 ocular muscles. In all instances the most affected muscle was the first to be operated on. In 52% of the patients this involved the inferior rectus muscle. Forty-five of the described patients required one operation, 21 needed two ocular muscle operations and four of the described patients needed a surgical procedure three times. In 91 % of the cases the ocular muscle surgery alone or the post-operative addition of prismatic correction led to a useful field of binocular single vision and stereopsis. A clear amount-to-effect correlation resulting from such surgery could not be established. The mechanical nature of the motility disturbance in these patients did not allow such a conclusion.","899":"","900":"","901":null,"902":"A 24-year-old man, left eye enucleated at the age of ten months, had jerk-right nystagmus with increasing amplitude in abduction and null position in near-extreme adduction. Under occlusion or in darkness, the nystagmus changed to jerk-left, the amplitude increased in adduction and null position was in abduction; as if his left eye had nystagmus blockage syndrome and he was seeing with this absent left eye! The difference between nystagmus blockage syndrome and latent nystagmus is discussed: nystagmus blockage syndrome is manifested by 'motor' maneuver of adduction and abduction, whereas latent nystagmus is induced with 'sensory' maneuver of occlusion. It suggests that nystagmus blockage syndrome and latent nystagmus may arise from different mechanisms despite their frequent concurrence.","903":"Up to 25% of the eyes affected with Duane's syndrome show upshoot and\/or downshoot in attempted adduction. This is thought to be caused by the tight horizontal muscles both contracting in attempted adduction (leash or bridle effect) due to abnormal firing of the lateral rectus muscle through which the globe slips beneath the muscle. Surgical procedures successful in correcting the very disturbing cosmesis of gaze are posterior fixation, recession of the horizontal rectus muscles or splitting of lateral recti muscles insertion. The authors report on a 27-year-old male with Duane's syndrome type III with extreme upshoot in adduction. After recession of both horizontal muscles the upshoot on attempted adduction was no longer present postoperatively. At one year follow-up a very discrete upshoot in attempted adduction could be documented. The resolving of the upshoot postoperatively could be explained by the bridle mechanism alone. The low grade upshoot in attempted adduction at one year follow-up could have been caused by new adhesions of the check ligaments and Tenon's capsule at the level of the lateral rectus muscle resulting from surgery itself. The possibility of an anomalous cyclovertical innervation playing a role in the vertical anomalous movements as Duane originally hypothetized cannot be excluded.","904":null,"905":"The purpose of this study is to develop and test criteria for diagnosis of an 'overacting' cyclovertical muscle using a modification of Parks' Three-Step Test. The Parks' Three-Step Test has become invaluable for isolation of a weak muscle in those strabismus cases in which there is a known paralysis. This test can yield confusing results in cases of non-paralytic vertical strabismus. The utricular induced ocular counter-rolling response combined with the premise that vertical strabismus is, in part, secondary to imbalances in vertical forces, are the physiologic bases for this test and the described modification. A modification of the first step of the Parks' Three-Step Test was designed which isolates an 'overacting' cyclovertical muscle in the same manner as a 'paretic' muscle. Possible 'overacting' muscles are isolated in primary position, lateral gaze and right and left head tilt. Fifty patients from the author's practice with non-paralytic vertical strabismus examined from July, 1990 through June, 1991 who had complete ocular motility evaluations were included in this analysis. The modified test was used during patient evaluations to corroborate the clinical impression of a predominantly overacting cyclovertical muscle. The Three-Step Test modification correctly identifies a cyclovertical muscle as 'overacting' when the vertical deviation is asymmetric in horizontal gaze (step 2) and when the Bielschowsky head tilt (step 3) is asymmetric. This modification of the Parks' Three-Step Test assists with vertical strabismus diagnosis and can be an adjunct to surgical planning by isolating a cyclovertical muscle to weaken in order to balance vertical forces.

Upshoot-in-adduction may sometime mimic a superior oblique palsy. The authors have found that even in healthy volunteers these motility disorders can be found and made manifest by patching. One eye of complaint-free volunteers with full stereopsis was patched for three days. Then the eye movements of the patched eye were recorded with the search coil technique, first before taking the patch off and secondly after putting the patch on the other eye. The latter registration served as reference for the first registration. It was found that 11 out of 18 volunteers had developed an upshoot-in-adduction of the patched eye. In five cases no directional change was found whereas two cases had developed a downshoot-in-adduction. It seems that up- and downshoot-in-adduction are latent motility disorders that become manifest after disruption of fusion.
