conventional nursing programs prepare students to provide safe, competent care for the typical adult medical\/surgical patient, it is necessary for new graduate nurses to apply for nurse residency programs for on-to-job intensive training for a unique specialty such as surgery, pediatrics, or neonatal intensive care.1-3 Although not the norm for all nurse residency programs, some require residents to complete an evidence-based practice (EBP) project.4 EBP projects are a newer, very valuable component of residency programs that facilitate practice change and positively impact unit goals and metrics. When EBP projects become an expectation of a new nurse residency program, both the unit and the resident benefit in numerous ways. With EBP project process and expectation changes, just like within EBP in general, constant reevaluation is necessary to further improve the experience and outcomes for all stakeholders involved.","3":"Resuscitations in the delivery room or the nursery cause significant stress for caregivers. Diligent preparation will improve the efficacy and safety of life-saving interventions and increase staff comfort. When establishment of an airway and delivery of positive pressure ventilation and chest compressions fail to result in return of spontaneous circulation, pharmacotherapeutic interventions should be considered. Epinephrine is first-line pharmacotherapy for severe bradycardia or cardiac arrest, increasing coronary arterial pressure and blood flow during chest compressions. Despite limited data regarding dosing and efficacy, the first dose of epinephrine may be delivered through the endotracheal tube during attainment of venous access (preferably a low-lying umbilical venous catheter in the delivery room). Intravenous dosing is preferred, and any facility caring for newborns must ensure optimized logistics including readily available dosing guidance and optimal flush volumes. After provision of epinephrine, additional medications may be considered, especially for resuscitations occurring outside of the immediate perinatal period, including normal saline, glucose, adenosine, atropine, and calcium. Clinicians must understand the indications, dosing, and monitoring parameters for these medications and ensure rapid availability for resuscitation. Every second truly counts in a neonatal resuscitation, and optimal understanding and preparation will ensure delivery of pharmacotherapy to optimize both patient outcomes and staff comfort.","4":"Germinal matrix hemorrhage-intraventricular hemorrhage (GMH-IVH) is a particular type of intracranial hemorrhage that affects the preterm population. GMH-IVH originates from bleeding within the highly vascular area near the center of the brain known as the germinal matrix. The pathogenesis of GMH-IVH is unclear; it is likely related to hemodynamic changes and fluctuations in cerebral blood flow within a fragile developing brain. Cranial ultrasound is the primary diagnostic test and reveals the degree of GMH-IVH based on a grading system. Management includes prevention of preterm delivery with meticulous antenatal and postnatal preventative strategies. This article discusses current evidence specific to the pathogenesis, risk factors, diagnosis, grading scales, and management approaches with GMH-IVH in preterm infants.","5":"(a) Quantify frequency of patient moves within a NICU with single patient and semi-private rooms (SPR). (b) Compare staff and parent perceptions of these moves. A hospital administrative database was evaluated to quantify the frequency of moves. A Room Change Questionnaire was devised to evaluate perceptions from NICU families and staff. Most families reported experiencing at least 1 patient move (92 percent), with the majority reporting at least 3 moves (58 percent). Staff perceived moves as negative significantly more than parents (p &lt; .01), and overreported negative family perceptions (p &lt; .01). Overall, moves did not bother families (52 percent); however, most families who moved 3 or more times reported at least 1 negative perception (63 percent). SFRs increase the number of patient moves. NICU staff's perception is significantly more negative than family's perception; however, most families who were moved frequently reported at least 1 negative perception. ","6":"Incontinentia pigmenti (IP) is a rare X-linked neuroectodermal dysplasia affecting the skin, hair, teeth, nails, microvasculature, and central nervous system. Mutations in the IKBKG gene cause this disorder. Incontinentia pigmenti is found in 65-75 percent sporadic mutations and 25-35 percent familial cases. Most patients are female, as the disease is generally lethal in males. The condition often is identified secondary to skin presentations followed by the central nervous system (CNS) manifestations in the eye and brain within the first year of life. In addition to the skin changes, there may be defects in the hair, nails, and teeth. The uniqueness of the disorder and shared findings similar to other skin disorders complicate the diagnosis. Clinical findings point to an array of possibilities. Lack of information on family history complicates the time to diagnosis.

Symptoms may manifest in utero as fetal hydrops or during the first few days to months of life. This article shares the case of a Dominican infant who presented with CNS-FT. It provides a comprehensive overview of CNS-FT including the underlying genetic cause, prenatal and postnatal diagnostic testing options, and treatment recommendations.

Shared governance models have been introduced within health systems to shape healthy work environments. The NICU experienced an extended hiring freeze that led to a significant nursing shortage and staff dissatisfaction. A unit-shared governance model was established to address key areas of concern. This led to the development of the new employee orientation committee. Their goal was to make significant changes in the onboarding and precepting process, including: (1) revising the Registered Nurse Competency-Based Orientation tool to align with a 3-phased orientation process, (2) incorporating a systems approach throughout the orientation period, (3) embedding references to best practices and policies, (4) creating a reference list of recommended reading materials, and (5) developing a skills checklist to guide in selection of patient assignments. The final step was developing a NICU preceptor course to increase consistency between preceptors and standardize orientation. Recent engagement survey results revealed significant improvements in employee satisfaction, validating key improvements made in the onboarding process.

Meet Linseigh, a former NICU patient who was full-term at birth and was ultimately diagnosed with NEC. In this article, we talk to Linseigh about what it was like growing up with the residual effects of NEC and even how it affects her today. This is a must-read for every NICU nurse so that families can better understand the long-term effects and know what resources to turn to for assistance.","14":"Critical appraisal of the evidence is the third step in the evidence-based practice process. This column, the second in a multipart series to describe the critical appraisal process, focuses on critical appraisal of systematic reviews or meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials.","15":"During the recent COVID-19 pandemic, neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) issued strict visiting policies that limited parent visitation and impacted how family-centered care was practiced. This article describes how these visiting policies impacted parents and neonates. Implications for clinical practice and future research will also be discussed.","16":"Diaper dermatitis is an ever-present condition among infants. Little is known about the prevalence among infants in the NICU. This article presents an adaptation of the skin safety model (SSM) for the infant in the NICU. The concepts of the model were extracted, defined, and integrated into an adapted SSM model to provide a focus on the infant with diaper dermatitis in the intensive care setting. It is essential to include all factors of the infant's clinical characteristics and hospital experience in the modeling to accurately predict risk of skin vulnerability in this infant population.","17":"Extremely low birth weight (ELBW), &lt;1,000 g, neonates require central venous access for their growth, development, and survival. Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) provide such access and reduce the risks associated with other types of central venous catheters. While the use of ultrasound (US) to guide PICC placement further reduces these risks, this technology has not been integrated into neonatal practice. The purpose of this case study is to describe US-guided PICC placement in 2 ELBW neonates. PICCs were placed in 2 patients weighing 505 g and 800 g, respectively, utilizing US guidance where the practitioner was unable to identify veins using traditional methods (e.g., palpation, landmarks, transillumination, or infrared device). PICC placement utilizing US guidance in ELBW neonates is a safe and effective technique that improves outcomes, prevents complications, and promotes vessel preservation in this vulnerable population. It is essential that this technique is integrated into neonatal practice.","18":"To explore the caregiving dynamic between NICU nurses and mothers with a substance-exposed pregnancy (SEP) by examining how nurses view these mothers compared to mothers without an SEP. A qualitative design using interviews with NICU nurses who care for infants and families with an SEP. The sample (n = 9) was all female, with an average of approximately 10 years of nursing experience in the NICU, with two-thirds having achieved a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) or higher. Perceptions of nurses working with families affected by an SEP. Stigmatized views and trust issues shaped nurses' views of mothers with an SEP as different from other mothers. Empathy levels toward mothers differed related to nurses' views of substance use as either a moral decision or chronic disease. These viewpoints shaped the nurse's judgment of the mother's potential to provide a safe environment and independently care for the infant at home. Nurses described personal distress when caring for these families.

Each phase in the evolution of hypoxic-ischemic injury presents potential pharmacologic targets for neuroprotective agents. Melatonin is a promising emerging therapy for early phases of ischemic injury, but utility is currently limited by the lack of pharmaceutical-grade products. Magnesium has been extensively studied for its neuroprotective effects in the preterm population. Studies in neonates with HIE have produced mixed outcomes. Erythropoietin use in HIE with or without therapeutic hypothermia appears to be safe and may provide additional benefit. Dexmedetomidine, N-acetylcysteine, xenon, and topiramate all have promising animal data, but need additional human trials to elucidate what role they may play in HIE. Frequent review of existing literature is required to ensure provision of evidence-based pharmacologic agents for neuroprotection following HIE.","25":"Critical appraisal of the evidence is the third step in the evidence-based practice process. This column, the first in a multipart series to describe the critical appraisal process, defines and provides examples of the levels of evidence and tools to begin the appraisal process using a rapid critical appraisal technique.","26":"Telehealth in the neonatal environment can improve remote medical care and access to specialized care and training eliminating barriers for effective health care delivery. Clinicians are utilizing telehealth in their practice to provide specialized care and training in areas that have little access. Educating health care clinicians on the basics of telehealth is an essential component of clinical training programs. Use of simulation-based telehealth experiences as part of that training can provide hands-on learning in a safe, realistic environment. Simulation can prepare health care teams in using telehealth technology in managing patient care, postdischarge care, and specialized care programs.","27":"Chylothorax, a lymphatic flow disorder characterized by an abnormal circulation of lymph fluid into the pleural cavity, is the most common cause of pleural effusions during the neonatal period. This condition affects 1\/15,000 neonates every year. Affected neonates often manifest with respiratory distress, electrolyte imbalances, sepsis, and even immunodeficiencies. Mortality risk is highest among neonates undergoing cardiac surgery as well as those with associated hydrops fetalis. Conservative treatment options include bowel rest with administration of parenteral nutrition, followed with medium-chain triglyceride enteral feedings, and octreotide therapy. Severe or persistent cases require surgical intervention. This can involve a unilateral or bilateral pleurectomy and thoracic duct ligation, with or without pleurodesis. Early identification and successful treatment of this condition is contingent upon awareness of the most current evidence and a timely cross-disciplinary approach to care.","28":"Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is a disorder of thyroid hormone deficiency which develops secondary to incomplete thyroid development or inadequate thyroid hormone production. State-mandated newborn screening throughout the United States has increased the detection rate of CH, allowing for early intervention. Although the overall mortality rate of CH is low, delayed or omitted treatment can lead to devastating neurocognitive outcomes. As such, CH is regarded as the leading cause of preventable intellectual disability in children. Early identification, facilitated by astute neonatal nursing and medical care, is contingent upon an active working knowledge of the disease process and awareness of the limitations of the newborn screen.","29":"Relative adrenal insufficiency (AI) is a disease process commonly associated with preterm birth and critical illness. Further, the incidence of AI is inversely proportional to gestational age. The incidence of AI is likely underreported; however, it is reported to occur in 150-280\/1,000,000 live births worldwide. Functional development of the adrenal gland does not occur until after 30 weeks of gestation; however, advances made in neonatal care increase the survivability of infants born well before this period. Among infants with AI, the adrenal gland is transiently incapable of secreting physiologic levels of cortisol in response to stressors. Common and nonspecific signs include hypotension, poor perfusion, and dysregulation of fluid, electrolytes, and euglycemia. Recognition, diagnosis, and steroid therapy is critical, as inappropriately managed AI can lead to an adrenal crisis, shock, and death. Understanding the presentation and common risk factors for developing relative AI is crucial for quick diagnosis and timely management to prevent morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable population.","30":"Seizures are the abnormal, excessive, synchronous discharge of cortical neurons that results in injury to the brain. Seizures presenting in the neonatal period may be the first and only clue to underlying neurological pathology. Despite advances in care, the mortality rate for infants experiencing neonatal seizures is still as high as 20 percent, with up to 65 percent of infants with seizures demonstrating significant morbidity. Early identification and treatment of the seizure or modifiable underlying etiology greatly reduces the extent of morbidity associated with neonatal seizures. Literature, including journal articles and relevant textbooks, was reviewed and condensed into a practical guide to neonatal seizures which includes the pathophysiology of injury associated with neonatal seizures, clinical manifestations, methods of diagnosis, and various options available for treatment.","31":"","32":"","33":"","34":"NICUs around the United States seem like cloistered environments where only the best of professional intentions are exhibited. Yet implicit bias is real and it does exist in NICUs. In interviewing 3-time preemie mom Ashley Randolph, we dive in with great honesty about the fact that racism is lurking in ways that are not always as overt. We need to do better.","35":"Unrecognized congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is the most common cause of preventable cognitive delay in children. Infants with CH appear normal and are usually asymptomatic at birth. Early detection is critical for prevention of intellectual disability. Standardized newborn screening can have a positive impact on cognitive development in infants with CH.","36":"Trauma-informed care (TIC) has been described to apply to several groups of traumatized patient\/families in the NICU. Trauma is multidimensional, including physical and psychological injuries with long-term effects on well-being and function. A newborn experiences the best outcomes when the mother also experiences the best outcomes. Thus, the TIC approach is applicable to the care of the infant with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) and mother. Organizational adoption of this model is likely to provide a supportive and therapeutic environment for the infant with NAS and family.","37":"Debriefing, a facilitator-guided reflection of an educational experience or critical incident, is an important tool in improving the safety and quality of practice in the NICU. Unlike feedback, which is often a one-way discussion, debriefing is a purposeful, 2-way reflective discussion which is based on experiential learning theory. The purpose of this article is to review the theoretical basis of debriefing and describe styles and tools for debriefing that can be applied in the NICU.","38":"Arnold-Chiari malformation (ACM), a defect that involves downward displacement of the hindbrain and herniation of the cerebellar vermis, tonsils, pons, medulla, and fourth ventricle through the foramen magnum, is the most complex of the 4 types of Chiari malformations. Unique to the other types of Chiari malformations, approximately 95 percent of infants with ACM also present with an associated myelomeningocele (MMC), the most severe form of spina bifida. Among affected infants, those with symptomatic comorbidities incur a significantly higher morbidity and mortality risk. Prompt identification and diagnosis of ACM, as well as evidence-based postnatal and postsurgical nursing and medical care, is critical. Early surgical intervention can repair an existing MMC and restore proper cerebrospinal fluid circulation, which can dramatically improve patient outcomes and quality of life, and reduce disease and health care burden.","39":"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a developmental defect in the diaphragm that allows abdominal viscera to herniate into the thoracic cavity. Pulmonary hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension are consequences of this disease process. The incidence is approximately 2.4-4.1\/10,000 births, and survival rate is estimated at 70-90 percent. To avoid potentially devastating delays in care, it is crucial that neonatal nurses and care providers in both tertiary and nontertiary care centers be familiar with the pathogenesis of CDH and the standard of care for initial stabilization of the neonate. Novel fetal and postnatal surgical repair techniques are also described here.","40":"Pulmonary hemorrhage (PH) is a pathology associated with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly among preterm infants in the NICU. The diagnosis is made when hemorrhagic secretions are aspirated from the trachea concurrent with respiratory decompensation that necessitates intubation or escalated support. The implementation of mechanical ventilation and widespread exogenous surfactant administration have significantly reduced respiratory morbidities. However, when PH develops, death remains the most common outcome. Treatment for PH remains primarily supportive; thus, a thorough understanding of underlying disease processes, manifestations, diagnostic testing, and current evidence is vital to enable early identification and proactive management to reduce morbidity and mortality.","41":"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is an autosomal recessive disorder that leads to the partial or complete deficiency of cortisol and aldosterone production from the adrenal glands. The lack of these key hormones can precipitate acute adrenal crisis during the newborn period. This disorder can further lead to the development of virilized female genitalia from exposure to increased levels of androgens during fetal development. Nonclassical CAH is a common autosomal disorder, affecting 1\/200 live births. The classical form of CAH affects 1\/10,000-16,000 live births. Infants affected by classic CAH manifest with severe complications and an increased mortality risk. Early identification of CAH is critical to prevent significant sequela of adrenal crisis and to support families of affected females as they work through decisions of gender assignment. Newborn and pediatric nurses, as well as advanced practice providers, should maintain an active working knowledge of CAH to identify affected individuals early, implement needed interventions, and support families through education.","42":"","43":"","44":"","45":"Chronic pain and agitation can complicate the clinical course of critically ill infants. Randomized controlled trials of analgesia and sedation in neonatal intensive care have focused on relatively short durations of exposure. To date, clinicians have few options to treat chronic visceral pain and hyperalgesia. Gabapentin has emerged as a common therapy for a diverse group of pain syndromes and neurologic conditions in adults. In neonates, case reports and series describe the successful treatment of visceral hyperalgesia arising from gastrointestinal insults with or without concomitant neurologic morbidities. Additionally, a case report and series describe the utility of gabapentin for neonatal abstinence syndrome refractory to standard pharmacotherapy. The adverse effect profile of gabapentin, most notably bradycardia and sedation, compares favorably to alternative analgesics and sedatives. However, the long-term impacts of prolonged gabapentin therapy have not been studied. Therefore, candidates for therapy must be selected carefully, and response must be assessed objectively. Future studies must assess the short-term and long-term benefits and risks of gabapentin compared to standard therapies for chronic pain and agitation in infants and refractory neonatal abstinence syndrome.","46":"A compelling clinical question using the PICOT format sets the stage for a successful search for relevant evidence.

Recent evidence suggests the most unstable infants get the most benefit, yet these infants are not consistently offered opportunities for SSC because of safety concerns and discomfort of the care team. To identify barriers and implement a multidimensional approach to increase SSC within the first 72 hours of life among infants born less than 28 weeks' gestation and less than 1,000 g in a Level IV university-based regional intensive care nursery. Using Institute of Healthcare Improvement quality improvement methodology, a multidisciplinary team identified barriers to SSC and developed targeted interventions, including a unit-specific protocol; widespread parent, staff, and provider education; and an infant readiness checklist. The primary outcome was the rate of SSC within 72 hours. The balancing measure was the rate of severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). Data were collected from monthly chart review and analyzed with statistical process control charts. The aim was to increase SSC within 72 hours of birth from 7 percent to greater than 80 percent within 12 months for infants born less than 28 weeks' gestation or less than 1,000 g. Between June 2017 and December 2019, there were 52 extremely preterm infants included in the project (15 preintervention and 37 postintervention). The rate of SSC within the first 72 hours increased from 7 to 84 percent. There has been no increase in any or severe IVH during the project period despite the increased rate of SSC. Implementation of multidimensional, multidisciplinary interventions for reducing barriers to early SSC in extremely preterm infants resulted in rapid adoption of SSC in the first 72 hours of life without increasing severe IVH in this high-risk population. ","49":"The Children's Hospital at Providence (TCHaP) is a hospital within a hospital, in the heart of Alaska's biggest city, Anchorage. TCHaP admits up to 60 extremely low birth weight (ELBW) neonates per year. The ELBW population, although small in number, contributes disproportionately to rates of death or serious morbidities. Nationally, ELBW is defined as a neonate born at a gestational age between 22 and 29 weeks. In 2014, only 38 percent of neonates born in Alaska &lt;28 weeks survived without experiencing major morbidities. For those born &lt;26 weeks, morbidity-free survival dropped to 25 percent. Discussions were held among NICU nursing leaders, clinical nurses, and physicians about current co-morbidities and potentially best practices to improve outcomes. Subsequently, the group decided to develop best practices for managing the care of the ELBW, which started by organizing a group of specialists. This group at TCHaP is called the Wee CARE team.","50":"Survival rate for preterm infants has improved significantly in the last decade because of advancements in care provided by NICUs. Yet, a large proportion of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants continue to be at risk of being discharged home from NICUs with long-term co-morbidities. Several centers have introduced and described the concept of a focused program on the care of micro-preemies and demonstrated improved processes as well as outcomes utilizing a continuous improvement approach with adoption of standardized guidelines, checklists, and shared team values. The journey and effort that it takes to develop and sustain such a program have been described less. This article discusses the process of building a Small Baby Program using a change model framework, how the organization and staff bought into the concept, as well as the accomplishments and challenges experienced during the last 3 years as the program continues to evolve and grow.","51":"The number of babies born extremely low birth weight surviving to be discharged home after experiencing the NICU continues to improve. Unfortunately, early sensory development for these babies occurs in an environment vastly different from the intended in-utero environment and places them at high risk of long-term neurodevelopmental and neurocognitive challenges. Our goal in the NICU must transition from simply discharge home to supporting the neurosensory development necessary for a thriving lifetime. To accomplish a goal of thriving families and thriving babies, it is clear the NICU interprofessional team must share an understanding of neurosensory development, the neuroprotective strategies safeguarding development, the neuropromotive strategies supporting intended maturational development, and the essential nature of family integration in these processes. We share the educational endeavors of 11 center collaboratives in establishing the foundational knowledge necessary to support preterm babies and their families.","52":"Implementation of neuroprotective and neuropromotive (NP2) strategies is essential to optimize outcomes for premature infants. Developmental care, once an addition to medical care, is now recognized by the NICU team as foundational to support long-term neurodevelopment of micropremature infants. A group approach to education and sharing implementation processes can result in collaborative and individual center improvements. This article includes examples of quality improvement (QI) education and tools inspired by implementation of NP2 strategies in a consortium of 11 NICUs in the United States and Canada. Process change guided by potentially better practices are key; however, consistency of application must be included to ensure success. Assessment of NP2 practices via use of surveys and practice audits are described. Increases occurred in family NP2 education and provision of support during painful experiences. There were also increases in skin-to-skin holding, 2-person caregiving, and focus on reducing unnecessary painful procedures.","53":"","54":"","55":"","56":"COVID-19's first wave created chaos for new NICU families as they struggled to cope with the challenge of a fragile infant along with a pandemic. Safety was paramount due to a lack of understanding around how the virus transmits, but much has been learned since then. The next wave of the virus needs to have a rethink around family separation.

There have, however, been few reports of the effect this virus has on the newborn population. This case study presents an infant with a vertical transmission of COVID-19, including symptoms, diagnosis, and management, to help inform care for the COVID-19-positive infant.","61":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic upon the health care landscape has prompted many organizations to revise policies in response to ever-changing guidelines and recommendations regarding safe breastfeeding practices. The application of these professional guidelines into clinical practice is fraught with barriers, inconsistencies, and often-minimal evidential support. Key concerns for health care providers and patients include antenatal versus postnatal transmission, milk transmission, and separation care versus rooming-in, including the subsequent impacts upon breastfeeding and bonding. While SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, the volume of literature to support best practice for couplet care continues to be developed at a rapid pace. The benefits of breastfeeding are steeped in evidence and outweigh the potential risk of transmission of COVID-19 from mother to newborn. Health care organizations must continue to seek guidance for policy revision within the ever-growing body of evidence for best practice and evaluate current practices for feasibility during and after hospitalization.","62":"COVID-19 continues to spread across the United States with a continued increase in reported infections and deaths. How this virus effects pregnancy, particularly mothers and their infants around and after delivery, is of particular concern for health care workers. Moreover, concerns for compassion fatigue in the health care worker, as they attempt to provide comprehensive care to this population, is a documented concern that could have long-term effects on workers' ability to provide care. This article will describe the current concerns for the transmission of COVID-19 from the mother to the infant and how that has affected recommendations from several national and international organizations around maternal\/infant testing, isolation, breastfeeding, and the infant requiring neonatal intensive care. Effects that changing recommendations may have on health care workers and care delivery, and how these may contribute to compassion fatigue, will also be discussed.","63":"","64":"","65":"","66":"During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, containment strategies aimed at limiting the spread of the virus were implemented but not to the extent as the current COVID-19 pandemic.

The purpose of this commentary is to explore the implications of isolation practices on the parent-infant dyad during a pandemic.","67":"NICUs have evolved in the last 20 years. Patients are being rescued at earlier gestation, and with this comes potential sequelae and complex issues throughout the hospitalization. As a result, there is an increased need for experienced, well-rounded neonatal nurse practitioners (NNPs) to care for these patients. Staff ratios are slow to catch up to the needs of the patients; NNPs are often caring for 15-30 patients at a time. This can leave the provider with a sense of not providing good enough care, burnout, and disillusionment with the reasons they entered school to become an NNP. This article provides a unique alternative to improve staffing ratios of students who are already familiar with not only the NICU, but your NICU: Relationships have been established and engagement of the unit is already present in the candidates.","68":"Delirium is a frequent complication of critical illness in adult and pediatric populations and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Little is known about the incidence, risk, symptoms, or treatment of delirium in the NICU. Only 4 cases of NICU delirium have been reported, but many pediatric studies include infants. The Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium tool has been validated in neonatal and infant populations for identification of delirium. Initial treatment should focus on identification and reversal of the cause, with pharmacologic management reserved for patients with symptoms that do not resolve or that significantly impact medical care. Routine use of intravenous haloperidol should be avoided because of the high incidence of serious adverse effects, but it may be considered in patients with significant symptoms who are unable to take oral medications. Atypical antipsychotics (olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone) appear to be efficacious with a low incidence of adverse effects. Risperidone has weight-based dosing and a liquid dosage form available, making it a good option for use in the NICU. Additional data from large cohorts of NICU patients routinely screened for delirium, and treated as indicated, are needed.","69":"The incidence of abdominal wall defects like gastroschisis and omphalocele are relatively rare. Gastroschisis occurs approximately in 2 to 3 births in every 5,000, and omphalocele occurs in fewer than 2 births in every 10,000. However, our Level III NICU was informed that we were going to receive 2 infants with gastroschisis and one infant with an omphalocele in the same year. Because of the infrequency of these defects, our novice NICU nurses expressed concern about their lack of exposure to and familiarity with these defects. It became apparent that a thorough review of the clinical care and emergency interventions was needed before the anticipated deliveries. The challenge, however, was to develop an innovative, interactive learning experience for the NICU nurse that would provide both a didactic review and hands-on education to care for these patients. We opted to employ simulation. Infant mannequins were used along with moulage to create realistic-looking loops of bowel, herniated bowel segments, and umbilical cord. Scenarios were created that covered the various unpredictable clinical directions these cases could take. These scenarios included the emergency equipment, maneuvers, and interventions that could be required for the anticipated deliveries. Ten sessions for each abdominal wall defect were held; 51 NICU nurses participated in each simulation. NICU nurses reported increased comfort and readiness to care for each infant.","70":"The neonatal population is at increased risk for central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) related to prematurity, critical illness, and compromised immune function.1,4,5 METHODS: To address a 30 percent CLABSI rate increase, a quality improvement (QI) project in a Level IV NICU was developed and implemented by the NICU CLABSI team in 2018. The project trialed a dedicated CLABSI prevention-registered nurse (DCP-RN) role with select responsibilities aimed at rate reduction. The DCP-RN spearheaded an RN education plan, addressed prevention bundle compliance, and aided in establishing a reliable apparent cause analysis (ACA) process.

We searched databases (e.g., PubMed, Google Scholar, EBSCOhost) to find studies describing the use of NIRS on critically ill and high-risk neonates. Near-infrared spectroscopy provides continuous noninvasive monitoring of venous oxygen saturation. It uses technology similar to pulse oximetry to measure the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin in a tissue bed to describe the relative delivery and extraction of oxygen.

To investigate Jordanian neonatal nurses' perceptions about the use of oral sucrose for neonatal pain. A cross-sectional descriptive design was used to collect data from 191 neonatal nurses working in 3 different hospital settings in northern and middle central Jordan. Knowledge and perception of Jordanian nurses about neonatal pain and oral sucrose and their relationship to demographic variables. More than half of nurses had knowledge deficit about pain management. Fifty-five percent of the nurses had a positive perception toward pain assessment tools, and the majority indicated positive opinion toward oral sucrose usage. Demographic factors can impact their perceptions. ","84":"Evaluate parental knowledge of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and other respiratory infections in preterm infants. Survey. Five hundred and eighty-three parents of preterm infants with generalized, Canadian provincial representation. Knowledge of RSV infection, sources of information, and parental understanding of disease risk. 97.9 percent (571\/583) of the parents had heard about RSV, since they all had a preterm infant. Sixty-one percent reported having good knowledge of RSV; 19.4 percent had very good knowledge; 19.7 percent had little or no awareness of RSV-related infection. Most (86.3 percent) believed that RSV illness was a very serious condition; 13 percent recognized that it could be a major problem for their child. Principal sources of information were the nurse, doctor and pamphlets. Over 480 participants cited 3 or more sources of additional information-Internet, social media platforms, and educational sessions. Respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis was a priority, but knowledge regarding the eligibility criteria for prophylaxis is essential. ","85":"This paper discusses neonatal endotracheal intubation and the need for standardization in practice regarding the use of premedication. Intubation is common in the NICU because of resuscitation, surfactant administration, congenital anomalies, apnea, and sedation for procedures or surgery. Intubation is both painful and stressful. Unmedicated intubation is associated with several adverse outcomes including repeat and prolonged attempts, airway trauma, bradycardia, severe desaturation, and need for resuscitation. Most providers believe intubation is painful and that premedication should be provided; however, there is still resistance to provide premedication and inconsistency in doing so. Reasons for not providing premedication include concerns about medication side effects such as chest wall rigidity or prolonged respiratory depression inhibiting immediate extubation after surfactant administration. Premedication should include an opioid analgesic for pain, a benzodiazepine for an adjuvant sedation, a vagolytic to decrease bradycardia, and the optional use of a muscle relaxant for paralysis.","86":"","87":"","88":"","89":"","90":"In the United States, pregnant women are screened for hepatitis B antigen because of the significant risk of perinatal vertical transmission of hepatitis to the fetus. It is important that the maternal hepatitis B antigen screen is documented in the medical record to ensure appropriate prophylaxis for the neonate. The purpose of this column is to discuss the pathophysiology of hepatitis B, as well as the screening process and prophylaxis for the neonate.","91":"Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin essential for the formation of factors in the clotting cascade. Newborns are born with insufficient levels of vitamin K, resulting in high risk for vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB). Vitamin K deficiency bleeding can occur in the first week of life (\"classic\" VKDB) and also between 2 weeks and 3 months of age (\"late\" VKDB). Vitamin K deficiency bleeding can present as bleeding in the skin or gastrointestinal tract, with as many as half of affected neonates experiencing intracranial bleeding. A single intramuscular injection of vitamin K effectively prevents both classic and late VKDB. Although intramuscular vitamin K is safe and effective, VKDB has reemerged because of decreased utilization. Parents refuse intramuscular vitamin K for a variety of reasons, including a disproven association with childhood cancer, the desire to avoid exposure to additives, and valid concerns about early neonatal pain. Many parents request oral vitamin K, an inferior alternative strategy that requires multiple doses utilizing products not designed for neonatal oral administration. In this setting, health care professionals must understand the epidemiology of VKDB and compassionately counsel parents to assuage concerns. Delivery of intramuscular vitamin K to all newborns remains a public health imperative, benefitting thousands of infants annually.","92":"Effective communication is essential to the delivery of safe, quality health care. Handoff reporting, situational reporting, interprofessional collaboration, caregiver communication, and team huddles are forms of status reporting and communication common in a neonatal nursing practice. Adequate training for health care professionals on effective communication techniques is often lacking. Simulation provides a method to develop and refine necessary communication skills for neonatal health care professionals and affords the opportunity for the learner to immerse into realistic clinical scenarios. The purpose of this article is to review communication techniques in the neonatal setting and describe methods of utilizing simulation to enhance communication skills for neonatal nursing practice.","93":"Central or neurogenic diabetes insipidus (DI) is uncommon in the pediatric age group and rarely occurs in neonates. It should be suspected in any neonate presenting with excessive urine output and hypernatremia that persists despite increased fluid administration. Diabetes insipidus may be secondary to asphyxia, intraventricular hemorrhage, infection, and structural abnormalities or may be idiopathic or genetic. Diagnosis includes a careful history, laboratory testing, and magnetic resonance imaging. Management of neonatal DI involves a careful balance between fluid intake and pharmacologic treatment. In this article we report a case of an extremely low birth weight infant presenting with central DI possibly caused by abnormality of the pituitary gland. Persistent hypernatremia was the initial presentation. Increased fluids were given initially but were only partially helpful. Eventually subcutaneous desmopressin (DDAVP) was required. The infant was unresponsive to intranasal DDAVP and required subcutaneous DDAVP upon discharge.","94":null,"95":"The purpose of this article was to determine specific skin injury prevention interventions for neonates in the NICU. The design was a systematic review. PubMed, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Embase, and Scopus were systematically searched to identify quantitative studies identifying skin injury preventions for neonates in the NICU. The outcomes included skin integrity or skin condition. Nineteen studies were included in the review. Twelve studies included a randomized design. Barriers were the main interventions for the prevention of pressure injury, medical adhesive skin injury, diaper dermatitis, and general skin condition. The types of barriers included hydrocolloids, polyurethane-based dressings, film-forming skin protectant, or emollients. Nonbarrier interventions included rotation between a mask and nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) interfaces, utilization of prescribed guidelines to decrease pressure injuries, and use of a lower concentration of chlorhexidine gluconate as a disinfectant.

It is now known to be the most common cause of congenital infection in the world, leading to various central nervous system sequelae, the most common being hearing loss. Cytomegalovirus is a ubiquitous pathogen that affects nearly 30,000 infants annually in the United States, leading to 3,000-4,000 cases of hearing loss. Prevention through vaccination has proved unreliable, as has the use of immune globulin. Prevention through education has been shown to be the most effective method of minimizing infection. Antiviral therapy is effective at reducing the impact of infection on newborns. Continued global efforts will hopefully provide more solutions for this opportunistic infection.","102":"We report findings from an institutional ethnography (IE) of nurses' work of feeding infants within an increasingly technical organization of NICUs. Five primary informants; 18 secondary informants. The institutional ethnographic approach included field observations, interviews, and phone and e-mail conversations. Our analysis followed accounts of what actually happened within the textual organization of nurses' work. Nurses' feeding practices are directed by protocols that arise within multiple documentation systems and clinical technologies. These systems produce barriers to nurses' efforts to skillfully feed infants. Prioritization of quality and safety perspectives can obscure and constrain the ordinary yet critical clinical reasoning neonatal nurses employ during feeding work. Clinical technologies that have been developed to improve safety can paradoxically disrupt the ability of nurses to respond in the moment to neonatal feeding cues. This finding provides nurses, leaders, and policymakers with insight into why policies and procedures may not be followed as expected. ","103":"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, the most common enzymopathy worldwide, is an insufficient amount of the G6PD enzyme, which is vital to the protection of the erythrocyte. Deficient enzyme levels lead to oxidative damage, hemolysis, and resultant severe hyperbilirubinemia. If not promptly recognized and treated, G6PD deficiency can potentially lead to bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction, acute bilirubin encephalopathy, and kernicterus. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is one of the three most common causes for pathologic hyperbilirubinemia. A change in migration patterns and intercultural marriages have created an increased incidence of G6PD deficiency in the United States. Currently, there is no universally mandated metabolic screening or clinical risk assessment tool for G6PD deficiency in the United States. Mandatory universal screening for G6PD deficiency, which includes surveillance and hospital-based risk assessment tools, can identify the at-risk infant and foster early identification, diagnosis, and treatment to eliminate neurotoxicity.","104":null,"105":"Simulation is an effective teaching methodology to enhance clinical thinking and reasoning skills among nursing students and practicing nurses. The opportunity to practice in a safe environment maintains a structure that promotes learning at all levels. There are various levels of fidelity as well as cost to facilitate simulation in the neonatal setting. This at times hinders the ability to incorporate simulation into educational practices. The purpose of this article is to provide a discussion on simulation practices in the neonatal setting, an overview of low-cost neonatal simulation exemplars, and implications for practice.","106":"","107":"","108":"","109":"","110":"NICU parents are stressed, and adding vaccinations into the discussion can cause resistance.

I interviewed her about how to help \"vaccine-hesitant\" parents come around in complying with vaccinations while in the NICU.","111":"Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) produces a high rate of long-term neurodevelopmental disability in survivors. Therapeutic hypothermia dramatically improves the incidence of intact survival, but does not eliminate adverse outcomes. The ideal provision of sedation and treatment of seizures during therapeutic hypothermia represent therapeutic targets requiring optimization in practice. Physiologic stress from therapeutic hypothermia may obviate some of the benefits of this therapy. Morphine is commonly utilized to provide comfort, despite limited empiric evidence supporting safety and efficacy. Dexmedetomidine represents an interesting alternative, with preclinical data suggesting direct efficacy against shivering during induced hypothermia and neuroprotection in the setting of HIE. Pharmacokinetic properties must be considered when utilizing either agent, with safety dependent on conservative dosing and careful monitoring. HIE is the leading cause of neonatal seizures. Traditional therapies, including phenobarbital, fosphenytoin, and benzodiazepines, control seizures in the vast majority of neonates. Concerns about the acute and long-term effects of these agents have led to the exploration of alternative anticonvulsants, including levetiracetam. Unfortunately, levetiracetam is inferior to phenobarbital as first-line therapy for neonatal seizures. Considering both the benefits and risks of traditional anticonvulsant agents, treatment should be limited to the shortest duration indicated, with maintenance therapy reserved for neonates at high risk for recurrent seizures.","112":"This article describes the nurse practitioner (NP) led management of a possible nosocomial exposure of tuberculosis (TB) in a level 3 NICU in Toronto, Canada. 26 babies, premature and term, were identified as being at risk and multiple emergency clinics were set up to diagnose possible infection, prescribe window prophylaxis, and monitor for adverse effects to the medication. The NICU NPs were chosen to organize, co-ordinate, and manage these emergency clinics because of their skills in leadership, diagnosing, therapeutic management, and client relationship building. The clinic was able to achieve 100 percent follow up with each at risk baby, from initial assessment through to completion of window prophylaxis with negative tuberculin skin test. Some insight in to the decision making surrounding possible TB outbreak management is provided, and special considerations around therapeutic management specific to this population are discussed. This incident demonstrates how nurse practitioners can be utilized to provide high quality care, across multiple clinical situations, to meet the needs of the health care system.","113":"Enterovirus infections in neonates have the potential to cause a cascade of devastating clinical complications that can lead to death. Because of vague maternal symptom presentations, the diagnosis may not be obvious to antepartum adult providers. Clinicians evaluating infants in the newborn nursery and following initial hospital discharge must be alert for this potential infection. Common newborn issues, such as hyperbilirubinemia and weight loss, may be early signs of a more life-threatening diagnosis. Enterovirus infections may be responsible for a continuum of critical diagnoses in the neonate. Utilization of viral panels during the initial rule-out sepsis evaluation may provide rapid diagnosis and, ultimately, earlier response times to devastating clinical symptoms. Antepartum history and presenting features of enteroviral infections warrant rapid diagnosis with viral polymerase chain reaction detection panels to potentially reduce antibiotic usage and inpatient length of stay. The purpose of this case report is to review risk factors, presentation, and management of neonatal enterovirus infections. As this infant was born in a remote setting and required air evacuation, the logistics of this transport are also discussed.","114":"Neonatal encephalopathy (NE) is defined as a condition of impaired neurological function often caused by a peripartum event that impairs gas exchange resulting in hypoxia, hypercapnia, cerebral ischemia, and metabolic acidosis. NE is a significant cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) is the standard of care for the treatment of moderate and severe NE and has significantly improved long-term outcomes for affected infants. There are extensive systemic physiologic effects associated with TH that clinicians need to be aware of to optimize care for these infants. There is a paucity of literature that comprehensively identifies causal relationships between the physiologic and biochemical effects of TH. This can leave neonatal clinicians devoid of a comprehensive understanding of the medical management of NE. Therefore, this article seeks to help fill this gap, improve clinician knowledge base, and ultimately improve the care of infants undergoing TH.","115":"Neonatal hypocalcemia (NHC) is one of the most common disorders of calcium metabolism in infants admitted to the NICU.

Several approaches have been shown to reduce the incidence of IVH and, more recently, mitigate the impact of IVH on long-term neurodevelopment. This article discusses the pathophysiology of IVH, with a focus on prevention strategies. Posthemorrhagic ventricular dilation is a common complication of severe IVH and has implications for neurodevelopmental sequelae. Both surgical and nonsurgical interventions for PHVD are described.","122":"Neonatal tumors occur infrequently; sacrococcygeal teratoma (SCT) is a rare and abnormal mass often diagnosed on antenatal ultrasound. An SCT may cause serious antenatal complications, requires surgery in the neonatal period, and can lead to various long-term sequelae including fecal incontinence or constipation, urinary incontinence, and lower extremity mobility impairment. Even rarer are SCTs that include intraspinal extension necessitating complex neurosurgical intervention to relieve possible spinal cord compression or tumor tissue resection. A comprehensive understanding of the natural history of SCT provides frontline neonatal nurses and nurse practitioners with the expertise and language to support families during an infant's NICU admission. A glossary of key terms accompanied by a case review of a premature infant born with a large external SCT with intrapelvic and intraspinal components aids in enhancing knowledge related to the potential impact of an SCT on the central nervous system.","123":"Glucose is the primary substrate for energy metabolism in the brain and although the brain is dependent on a constant glucose supply for normal function, both local energy stores and the supply of alternate substrates are limited. In utero, the placenta provides a continuous supply of glucose to the fetus while transition to extrauterine life marks an abrupt change in substrate delivery and a major change in glucose metabolism where insufficiencies and disruptions can occur. Hypoglycemia is one of the most common biochemical disturbances in the neonatal period, affecting a wide range of neonates. Prolonged or persistent low plasma glucose concentrations can lead to neonatal brain injury and abnormal neurological outcomes. This article discusses fetal and neonatal metabolic adaptation, the physiology of glucose homeostasis, hypoglycemic brain injury (HBI), and neurodevelopmental long-term outcomes.","124":"Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) can have both transient and long-lasting effects on the neonate, including neurologic, renal, cardiac, hepatic, and hematologic. Both the disease process and the treatment option of therapeutic hypothermia can result in hemodynamic instability. Understanding the effects of HIE on the neonatal myocardium, pulmonary vascular bed, and the cardiac dysfunction that can occur is key to managing infants with HIE. This article focuses on causes of hemodynamic instability in neonates following perinatal asphyxia and how to recognize hemodynamic compromise. It reviews the underlying pathophysiology and associated management strategies to improve hemodynamics and potentially improve outcomes.","125":"The neonatal neurological examination is a cornerstone in the assessment of a neonate's neurological function. Although current neuroimaging and neurophysiology techniques have markedly improved our ability to assess and diagnose neurologic abnormalities, the clinical neurological examination remains highly informative, cost-effective, and time efficient. Early recognition of abnormal findings can prevent delays in diagnosis and implementation of beneficial therapies. The intent of this article is to improve the understanding and performance of the neonatal neurological examination. A standardized approach to neonatal neurological examination is described, including examination techniques and normal and abnormal findings.","126":"","127":"","128":"","129":"Opioid addiction and the NICU are common themes in the news.

Enter the ICON (Improving Care for the Opiate-exposed Newborn) program, which not only turned her life around but gave her son a chance at a normal life. The ICON program changes the stereotype of the addicted mother in the NICU for the better. We all have something to learn here.","130":"Herpes simplex virus (HSV) acquired during delivery places the neonate at risk for mortality or long-term neurodevelopmental disability. Exposure generally occurs from recurrent genital herpes infection, although primary infections result in the highest risk of neonatal disease. Neonates generally present in the second or third week of life with lesions. Encephalitis with seizures indicates the presence of central nervous system involvement, and other end organs may also be impacted. Clinical suspicion for neonatal HSV infection warrants immediate initiation of appropriate antiviral therapy. In the last 50 years, antiviral therapy has progressed from agents with prohibitive toxicity or cumbersome administration to herpes virus-specific agents that dramatically improve clinical outcomes with manageable toxicity. Multicenter clinical trials have demonstrated the superiority of high-dose intravenous acyclovir for acute therapy, followed by long-term oral suppressive therapy. This work has dramatically reduced morbidity and mortality from neonatal HSV, representing the benchmark for future clinical trials in neonatal pharmacotherapy.","131":"Aplasia cutis congenita (ACC) is a rare condition that presents at birth as an absence of skin that does not usually involve underlying structures. Occurring in 3\/10,000 live births, ACC is evenly distributed between males and females; the risk of ACC increases to 7 percent in consanguineous marriages. Up to 86 percent of lesions are found on the scalp in the midline vertex position. Lesions can also be found on the trunk and limbs, as with Adams-Oliver syndrome or accompanying epidermolysis bullosa. ACC is associated with chromosomal abnormalities and 35-50 percent of the time with trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome). This case study presents an infant with multiple ACC lesions of the scalp. The pathophysiology, treatment, potential long-term complications, and nursing considerations are discussed.","132":"Postpartum depression (PPD) is higher among NICU mothers compared to mothers without infants in the NICU. Routine screening improves early PPD identification and treatment for mothers. Key national women and infant organizations endorse facility-based policies that address PPD screening. In addition to PPD screening, the key national organizations recommend facilities providing care to women and infants develop a method of referral for maternal PPD evaluation, treatment, and follow-up. Due to the timing, onset, and maternal predisposition to PPD, the NICU is a prime setting for PPD screening. Despite recommendations, PPD screening is not routine in the NICU. This article describes the development and assessment of a PPD screening program implemented in the NICU. Data analysis of 30 NICU mothers evaluated the risk of PPD based on screening tool scores, maternal diagnostic evaluation compliance, and documentation of maternal follow-up with designated NICU staff.","133":"Although various educational technology interventions have been introduced to support parents of preterm infants, the interventions tend to focus on mothers over fathers. This study aims to advance understanding of the concerns and needs of fathers and seek opportunities of information technology to support them. A convenience sampling method recruited 18 parents (i.e., ten mothers and eight fathers of preterm infants) for interviews. The interview transcripts were analyzed by the inductive content analysis method. The analysis identified two main themes (i.e., customized education, learning styles and tools preferred by fathers) and five subthemes (i.e., infant care, self-care, self-regulated online learning, adaptive user interfaces of online education modules, and hands-on learning with multimedia). The interviewed parents emphasized the importance of education customized for the fathers of preterm infants, and argued that an e-learning system has the potential to fulfill the fathers' educational needs.

","141":"The goal of the NEC-Zero project is to reduce the burden of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) by increasing access to evidence-based tools to help clinicians and parents integrate evidence into daily care. It involves (a) human milk feeding with prioritized mother's own milk; (b) use of a unit-adopted standardized feeding protocol; (c) a unit-adopted strategy for timely recognition that integrates risk awareness and a structured communication tool when symptoms develop; and (d) stewardship of empiric antibiotics and avoidance of antacids. A toolkit for caregivers and parents was developed to make implementation consistent. For clinicians the toolkit includes: the GutCheckNEC risk score, a structured communication tool, the \"Avoiding NEC\" checklist, and the NEC-Zero website. For parents, NEC-Zero tools include the website, three educational brochures in English and Spanish, and a collaborative care video produced with the NEC Society. This article describes the toolkit and how it has been accessed and used.","142":"Caffeine is one of the most commonly utilized medications in the NICU. In preterm infants, short-term and long-term pulmonary and neurodevelopmental benefits of therapy are well documented in the literature. While robust evidence supports the use of standard doses of caffeine for apnea of prematurity or to facilitate successful extubation, much remains unknown regarding the boundaries of efficacy and safety for this common therapeutic agent. Escalating dosing regimens seem to provide additional benefit in select infants, but grave toxicity has also been documented with early utilization of high-dose caffeine. Conflicting data exist surrounding the ideal timing of initiation of therapy. Even the widely adhered to discontinuation point has been challenged by data supporting continued use. Until robust data definitively support change, practice should align with current evidence defining clear, safe, and efficacious dosing and timing of caffeine therapy.","143":"Congenital chylothorax is defined as an abnormal accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the pleural space. It is a rare condition in the neonate that causes significant respiratory, nutritional, and immunologic problems resulting in a high mortality rate. Presented here is a case of congenital bilateral chylothorax in a preterm infant. Fetal ultrasound at 33 weeks' gestation showed polyhydramnios, bilateral pleural effusions, ascites, and subcutaneous edema. Fetal pleuracentesis was done on the right side with 118 mL of fluid aspirated. This article addresses the management of this difficult disease process, complications, and implications for research of controversial therapies.","144":"Neuroblastoma represents approximately 6 to 10 percent of childhood cancers, yet is one of the most common solid tumors observed in neonates; approximately 700 cases are reported in the United States each year. Neuroblastoma occurs secondary to oncogene mutations that cause abnormal proliferation of neural crest cells and tumor formation anywhere along the spinal cord. Visible manifestations include a blueberry rash and subcutaneous skin nodules. Common histologic findings include multifocal, small, round, blue cell tumors. Cytogenetics testing differentiates aggressive versus nonaggressive forms of neuroblastoma. Treatment ranges from supportive care to surgery and chemotherapy; targeted molecular therapies and immunotherapy offer opportunity to individualize treatment. Morbidity and mortality are contingent upon age at diagnosis and genetic abnormalities. Neonatal clinicians must establish and maintain active knowledge of the current science pertaining to this neoplasm to assist in early identification and timely initiation of medical management. This article presents a case report and comprehensive discussion of the state of the science on metastatic familial (congenital) neuroblastoma.","145":"With the rise in genetic screening both pre- and postnatally, new variances in genes are being recognized. Some are of unknown significance, while other known genetic expressions have obvious phenotypical expressions. Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus is a result of the duplication of chromosome 6q24, but little is known about the phenotypic expression of a triplication of chromosome 6q24. This case study presents an infant with a postnatally diagnosed triplication of chromosome 6q24, meconium pseudocyst, and multiple congenital anomalies with unknown genetic significance.","146":"","147":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a morbidity of prematurity with implications for respiratory and neurologic health into adulthood. Multiple risk factors contribute to the development of BPD leading to examination of various prevention strategies. The roles of systemic corticosteroids and caffeine have been addressed by the American Academy of Pediatrics. The place in therapy of other agents commonly utilized in clinical practice remains unclear. Inhaled nitric oxide has been the subject of numerous large, randomized controlled trials in preterm infants. Despite sound rationale, these trials have largely failed to document benefit, suggesting a limited role for inhaled nitric oxide therapy in the preterm population. In contrast, intramuscular vitamin A has been documented to reduce the incidence of BPD in randomized trials. However, the invasiveness and the sporadic availability of this therapy have led to decreased utilization. All macrolide antibiotics do not appear to have a similar impact on the incidence of BPD; however, azithromycin administered to infants colonized with Ureaplasma may have impact. Questions remain about the optimal dosing approach and long-term safety of this intervention. Finally, diuretic therapy is widely used in clinical practice despite significant toxicities and limited data supporting a role in BPD prevention. Taken together, available data suggest that caffeine and selective use of corticosteroids remain the mainstays of pharmacologic BPD prevention.","148":"Subcutaneous fat necrosis (SCFN) is a rare complication, usually occurring in otherwise healthy full-term infants who have experienced some level of trauma that causes ischemic injury to adipose tissue. Tissue injury usually occurs in areas of the body that are exposed to excessive pressure as during delivery. Tissue injury has also been described secondary to therapeutic cooling. This case study presents an infant who received whole body cooling for hypoxic ischemic injury and later developed severe hypercalcemia at one month of age without the skin lesions consistent with SCFN. The differential diagnosis for hypercalcemia and how it relates to SCFN is presented, as well as clinical presentation, treatment, and prognosis.","149":"Intellectual curiosity is the gateway to an innovative mindset. Success is contingent upon what we do with that knowledge to solve problems in our everyday professional practices. However, merely 13 to 25 percent of college graduates enter the workforce with the desirable innovative mindset. Rather, a culture of mediocrity persists within facets of academia as well as the professional workforce. Given that the youngest ranks of nurses emerge from institutes of higher learning and are the future of the nursing workforce, it is appropriate for academia to begin the charge toward change. This article presents a pragmatic discussion of key antagonists to the adoption of a culture of innovation, namely factors that comprise a culture of mediocrity. Strategies that promote creative problem-solving and a shift toward a collaborative culture of innovation will be presented for nurses practicing within academia and the health care system.","150":"Following an infant death, if breast milk production is not weaned, this could lead to issues for the mother. Lactation suppression can be done safely with proper education and support. Caregivers should be educated on how to provide support to the lactating woman during this difficult situation. An abrupt wean can lead to engorgement and milk trapping. This can be uncomfortable and possibly lead to mastitis with infection. The mother who has been providing breast milk needs special attention. Providing her with the knowledge of what to expect and the use of comfort measures will make the discontinuation of her milk production a smoother and more comfortable process.The emotional support of the grieving process begins in the NICU. Encourage follow-up for the bereaved family by offering them resources. Give the parents the option to donate breast milk. In some situations, donation promotes healing and closure.","151":"Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a rare and sporadic neurocristopathy characterized by alveolar hypoventilation and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. CCHS manifests quickly after birth, initially as respiratory distress. Mortality risk is estimated at 38 percent, with a median age of death of three months of age. A timely and accurate diagnosis is critical. Genetic testing for PHOX2B gene mutations is necessary to confirm the diagnosis; however, laboratory turnaround time often imposes an additional 7-14-day waiting period on an often anxious family. Neonatal clinicians should recognize that families require disease-specific education, emotional support, and time to rehearse daily caregiving in preparation for discharge. Therefore, this article presents the key clinical, pathophysiologic, and diagnostic factors, as well as a discussion of discharge needs. A case report of an infant, born to parents with no known history of CCHS, is included as a case-based learning opportunity for readers.","152":"To evaluate the effect of a NICU parent education program on parents' early language and literacy practices, and on their confidence interpreting and responding to infant signals.

Ten parents participated in follow-up interviews. Before and after sessions, participants reported on frequency of their current and intended early language and literacy practices, and their confidence interpreting and responding to infant signals. Participants also reported program satisfaction. Interview participants reported their behavior change one to two weeks later. The program significantly increased intention to engage in more early language and literacy practices, and increased parent-reported knowledge of how and when to interact with their infants. The majority of interviewed parents reported engaging in these practices one to two weeks later. ","153":"Intussusception is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in infants and toddlers; however, it is a rare entity in neonates. During intussusception, a proximal portion of the bowel pushes inside the adjacent, distal segment of the bowel in a telescoping fashion leading to obstruction, strangulation of the mesentery, ischemia, and necrosis. The etiology of intussusception is often unknown and there are currently no preventive techniques. Intussusception often mimics other common disease processes affecting neonates; this can result in detrimental delays in diagnosis and treatment. Intussusception is considered a surgical emergency and a delay in treatment results in significant morbidity and mortality. With proper education on this rare complication, neonatal nurses play a vital role in early diagnosis. To improve the care of neonates affected, it is imperative that intussusception remain a differential diagnosis for clinicians.","154":"Families in the NICU during the holiday season are confronted with an even tougher isolation than normal.

CS is associated with miscarriage, stillbirth, early infant death, and organ dysfunction in the newborn. Prevention is the optimal goal; however, early identification of infected infants is imperative to reduce the risk of serious, long-term complications. Clinicians must possess adequate knowledge of CS and the potentially life-threatening conditions that can arise to provide immediate and effective care. This case study portrays the clinical presentation of an infant with CS and the management of the multisystem effects of the disease.","156":"Tens of thousands of infants are impacted yearly by prenatal opioid exposure. The term neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is now replacing the more familiar term neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Ongoing debate continues related to standard regimens for treatment of this oftentimes perplexing condition. Historically, treatment has focused on pharmacologic interventions. However, there is limited research that points to nonpharmacologic methods of treatment as viable options, whether alone or in addition to pharmacologic interventions. This article, utilizing a review of pertinent literature, outlines the physical aspects of NOWS, including its pathophysiology and the resulting physical clinical signs. In addition, we present an overview of how age-appropriate, nonpharmacologic interventions, centered on developmental care, may be a valuable approach to organize and prioritize routine care for these infants, their families, and the health care team facing the challenges of NOWS. Finally, the need for further research to better define evidence-based standards of care for these infants and their families is discussed.","157":"There is a critical shortage of neonatal nurse practitioners (NNPs) in the United States. The NNP shortage increases workload and negatively affects job satisfaction, which ultimately impacts patient safety. Therefore, it is imperative to identify strategies to improve job satisfaction and retention. Authors of current evidence supported the connection between mentoring and role transition, job satisfaction, and intent to stay. Mentorship is key to the success of new graduate nurse practitioners as they develop confidence in the nurse practitioner (NP) role. The aim of this integrative review is to examine the existing evidence regarding mentoring of advanced practice nurses and the potential impact on the NNP workforce.","158":"Down syndrome (DS) is a well-known genetic disorder that affects 700-1,000 infants per year. One particular comorbidity of DS is transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD), a disease characterized by leukocytosis with elevated blast counts. Approximately 10 percent of DS infants develop TMD, which usually manifests during the first week of life and can lead to an extended hospitalization in a NICU. In addition to hallmark hematologic findings, other manifestations include jaundice, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, hepatomegaly, and pericardial or pleural effusions. TMD generally resolves spontaneously in the first three months of life with the provision of timely medical management; however, survivors are at increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Neonatal nurses need to have knowledge of this disorder to facilitate screening of DS infants and optimize family education and coordination of care.","159":"Stress in parents who have an infant in the NICU is well documented in literature. Prematurity and related comorbid conditions, high-tech NICU environments, presence of multidisciplinary health care professionals, altered parenting roles, and concerns of health outcomes in the infant are common stress factors. Further, inadequate management of stress can result in poor parent-infant bonding, poor infant outcome, and postpartum depression in parents. Effective stress management strategies may help parents adapt to their parental role thereby improving infant outcomes. Research has shown mindfulness-based strategies help reduce stress in the general population. Can this strategy be applied in the context of parents of infants in the NICU? Literature is scant on the impact of mindfulness-based strategies on parents of infants in the NICU and on the infant's health outcomes. This article explores the application of mindfulness-based strategies to reduce stress in parents of infants in the NICU.","160":"An expected complex outcome of a premature infant need not be assumed completely life limiting.

Frequent handling by multiple examiners potentially increases the risk of cross infection. Interruption in kangaroo care is not advisable unless urgent. A minimum of three-point exam should be done (chest, heart, and abdomen) using a stethoscope and gentle palpation. However, the infant should not be wakened from sleep and all handling should be synchronized with the touch time.","163":"VACTERL association is a sporadic, nonrandom series of congenital malformations diagnosed by the presence of three or more of the following: vertebral malformations, anal atresia, cardiac defects, tracheoesophageal fistula, renal malformations, and limb malformations. Situs inversus totalis (SIT) and esophageal malformations are rarely associated. This is the first reported case in North America of VACTERL association with SIT. Respiratory distress in the term infant requires full exploration of all possible causes because the etiology may be far more complex than routinely diagnosed respiratory distress syndrome. This particular case demonstrates physical exam findings and supportive imaging that would be observed in infants with VACTERL association and with SIT, highlighting considerations when, rarely, both occur simultaneously. ","164":"This study aimed to explore support for mothers and fathers in single-family rooms (SFRs) of a NICU. A qualitative descriptive design was employed. A convenience sample of 15 parents (nine mothers, six fathers) were recruited from a Level III NICU. During their infants' hospitalization, each parent recorded their thoughts and feelings regarding support whenever appropriate over a period of 48 hours using Handy Application to Promote Preterm infant happY-life (HAPPY), an android recording application. Parents felt supported when staff facilitated their learning in a collaborative manner, fostered their optimism, and provided situational assistance. Continuity and consistency of care and presence were important characteristics of supportive nursing care. Though SFRs offered privacy for parents to learn and to be with their infants, the design limited parental access to nursing and medical staff, which sometimes prevented parents from receiving adequate support and partaking in decision making concerning their infants' care. ","165":"This evidence-based practice project evaluated the efficacy of a respiratory algorithm administered by specially trained transition nurses on the reduction of preventable NICU admissions for infants experiencing mild respiratory distress during transition. A retrospective chart review compared a cohort of newborn admission rates for seven months before and seven months after initiation of a respiratory algorithm. Records of infants were included if they were born &gt;35 weeks' gestation, had documented mild respiratory distress after birth, required &lt;48 hours of noninvasive respiratory support, and had a length of stay less than four days. Ninety-six infants (before n = 34, after n = 62) were included. Before implementation of the respiratory algorithm, infants requiring noninvasive respiratory support were admitted to the NICU. Following implementation of the algorithm, NICU admissions for mild respiratory distress significantly decreased (86 percent), despite a concurrent increase in maternal acuity. ","166":"The transition from the NICU to home is a complicated, challenging process for mothers of infants dependent on lifesaving medical technology, such as feeding tubes, supplemental oxygen, tracheostomies, and mechanical ventilation. The study purpose was to explore how these mothers perceive their transition experiences just prior to and during the first three months after initial NICU discharge. A qualitative, descriptive, longitudinal design was employed. Nineteen mothers of infants dependent on lifesaving technology were recruited from a large Midwest NICU. Description of mothers' transition experience. Three themes were identified pretransition: negative emotions, positive cognitive-behavioral efforts, and preparation for life at home. Two posttransition themes were negative and positive transition experiences. Throughout the transition, the mothers expressed heightened anxiety, fear, and stress about life-threatening situations that did not abate over time despite the discharge education received. ","167":"Numerous chromosome abnormalities are seen in NICUs around the world. With increased access to health care, in some cases, parents and practitioners are aware of an abnormality prior to birth, and a plan of care can be made. However, in many situations there is no prenatal diagnosis and these discoveries and diagnoses are made during the neonate's NICU stay. Providers in the NICU setting need to have a vast understanding of chromosome abnormalities, as they may be the first to guide parents through the maze of decisions that will follow. This case study analyzes a very rare deletion on chromosome 1q43q44. The 1q43q44 deletion is located at the subtelomeric region, the region farthest from the centromere, on the long arm of chromosome 1. This case study describes Baby D, who presented with multiple anomalies and was subsequently diagnosed with 1q43q44 deletion.","168":"","169":"","170":"","171":"","172":"","173":"","174":"Parenteral nutrition (PN) is frequently required by extremely preterm infants due to gastrointestinal immaturity and complications of prematurity. Parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis (PNAC) and intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD) are common complications of prolonged PN. Plant-based intravenous lipid emulsions, containing proinflammatory omega-6 fatty acids and phytosterols, may contribute to these conditions as well as other comorbidities such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retinopathy of prematurity. Intravenous lipid emulsions containing animal-based fats, such as fish oil, contain fewer proinflammatory omega-6 fatty acids and more anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants. SMOFlipid, recently Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for adult use, is a blend of plant- and animal-based lipid emulsions with a favorable omega-6:omega-3 ratio that may prevent the development and progression of PNAC\/IFALD in infants.

Analgesics, sedatives, vagolytics, and\/or muscle relaxants have the potential to blunt these adverse effects, reduce the duration of the procedure, and minimize the number of attempts necessary to intubate the neonate. The medical care team must understand efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic data for individual medications to select the optimal cocktail for each clinical situation. Although many units utilize morphine for analgesia, remifentanil has a superior pharmacokinetic profile and efficacy data. Because of hypotensive effects in preterm neonates, sedation with midazolam should be restricted to near-term and term neonates. A vagolytic, generally atropine, blunts bradycardia induced by vagal stimulation. A muscle relaxant improves procedural success when utilized by experienced practitioners; succinylcholine has an optimal pharmacokinetic profile, but potentially concerning adverse effects; rocuronium may be the agent of choice based on more robust safety data despite a relatively prolonged duration of action. In the absence of an absolute contraindication, neonates should receive analgesia with consideration of sedation, a vagolytic, and a muscle relaxant before endotracheal intubation. Neonatal units must develop protocols for premedication and optimize logistics to ensure safe and timely administration of appropriate agents.","184":"Meconium peritonitis is a sterile chemical peritonitis preceded by bowel perforation, resulting in meconium leakage and subsequent inflammatory cascade within the peritoneal cavity.

Presentation with signs of global hypotonia and respiratory insufficiency are among the classic findings. Rapid diagnosis is essential for medical management and family support. This case study reviews the presentation of hypotonia in the newborn, followed by a path to a diagnosis of nemaline myopathy in the form of an ACTA-1 mutation. This review can aid the clinician in the diagnosis of patients in whom hypotonia is present at birth. Included is a discussion of the incidence, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of this devastating disease.","188":"Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a serious secondary disease that alters the events in the clotting cascade. DIC leads to microclots in the peripheral vasculature. The uncontrolled formation of these clots consumes the body's clotting factors, which precipitates bleeding. Neonates, defined as newborns zero to one month old, are born with slightly altered hemostasis, also known as developmental coagulopathy. This coagulopathy puts neonates at a greater risk of developing DIC, specifically when additional body systems have been compromised by a primary disease. Because of the serious nature of this disease and its precipitating factors, advanced practitioners should study the nuances of DIC to provide accurate diagnosis and proper treatment. The aim of this article is to discuss the pathophysiology behind DIC along with etiologies, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis in neonates, along with gaps in current research.","189":"Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) is the most common gastrointestinal disease among infants. IHPS occurs as an isolated condition or together with other congenital anomalies.

Familial aggregation has been described and a family history is seen in 47.9 percent of siblings. Infants typically present with projectile vomiting associated with symptoms of failure to thrive. An olive-like mass palpable in the right upper abdominal quadrant is being reported less frequently because of earlier diagnosis by ultrasound. IHPS is generally corrected through laparoscopic pyloromyotomy. Endoscopic pyloric balloon dilation is a novel alternative.

The infant was later diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as having an isolated cisterna magna. When assessing brain abnormalities, there is increased accuracy of prenatal MRI versus prenatal ultrasound. Accurate diagnosis of an infant is paramount so that an inheritance pattern, risk of recurrence, involvement of other systems, and a prognosis can be determined. Communicating with the family and supporting them with the correct information is then enhanced. It should be standard protocol to obtain a fetal MRI if an abnormal prenatal ultrasound of the brain is detected. Further research is needed to assess the accuracy of using MRI versus ultrasonography prenatally to diagnose posterior brain abnormalities.","197":"The aim of this project was to determine how implementing neuroprotective, family-centered, developmental care interventions would impact the satisfaction of nurses and families compared with traditional care in a NICU. Neuroprotective, family-centered, developmental care is grounded in the principle that optimal health outcomes are accomplished when patients' family members play an active role in contributing emotional, social, and developmental support for their babies. To accomplish this, nurses needed an understanding of the developmental problems associated with high-risk premature infants, fundamentals of neurosensory growth, and how the intrauterine environment protects the infant from the fluctuation of an unstable extrauterine environment. The model we chose to use was the Neonatal Integrative Developmental Care Model. Pre- and post-surveys showing an increase in knowledge and benefits of these interventions were collected from nurses. Pre- and post-Press Ganey reports showed families had a strong satisfaction with neuroprotective, family-centered, developmental care in our NICU.","198":"Infant medical trauma in the NICU is associated with serious and lasting consequences.

The evidence supporting SSC will be reviewed and discussed using TIAAC as a framework. SSC is an effective and evidence-based care strategy that reduces the infant's traumatic NICU experiences by improving parental proximity, attachment, and lactation; decreasing stress and pain; improving physiologic stability; supporting sleep; and enhancing neurologic outcomes.","199":"","200":"","201":"Deb Discenza interviews Geoff, a preemie born almost 40 years ago, and gets unique insight into his birth, his NICU stay, and life afterward.","202":"There are numerous factors placing neonates at increased risk of developing pressure injuries while hospitalized. Prevention of hospital-acquired pressure injuries in this vulnerable patient population requires early risk identification. Unfortunately, identifying neonates who are at risk of developing pressure injuries is complicated because of the lack of pressure injury risk assessment tools validated for use in neonates. The Braden Q risk assessment scale was adopted by two NICUs within a health care system to aid in identifying neonates at risk of developing a pressure injury.

The APIB was completed on nine infants with IVH III\/IV at 36 and 40weeks postmenstrual age to determine the effects of IVH on the neurobehavioral functioning and maturation over time. The APIB neurobehavioral scores (i.e., physiologic, motor, state, attention\/interaction, regulatory, and examiner facilitation subsystem scores) were examined in relation to the two different testing times and to infants without lesion. APIB scores at 36weeks suggested easily disorganized and poorly modulated behavioral regulation and low threshold of disorganization and stress. At 40 weeks, poor overall behavioral regulation persisted; only motor differences statistically improved between the two ages. Neurobehavior was significantly poor in all but state subsystems when tested at both ages in infants with a brain lesion. ","204":"Chromosome 16p13.11 microdeletion syndrome is a rare copy number variant that carries increased risks for complications in the neonatal period and throughout the life span. Clinical manifestations and associated defects known to present in the neonatal period include motor delay, facial dysmorphisms, microcephaly, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and congenital heart defects. Management in the neonatal period focuses on associated comorbidities, including motor delay with or without GERD, which commonly manifests as feeding difficulties. Life span implications of chromosome 16p13.11 microdeletion syndrome include developmental, speech, and language delay; psychiatric and behavioral problems; seizure disorders; and, less commonly, obesity. Nursing assessment is critical to the early identification of nonspecific abnormalities associated with de novo genetic disorders. Early identification and diagnosis of chromosome 16p13.11 microdeletion syndrome are critical to optimizing outcomes throughout infancy and across the life span. We present a case report of an infant diagnosed with chromosome 16p13.11 microdeletion. A discussion of genetic influences, associated clinical manifestations, diagnostics, management, and health promotion strategies are presented to establish core knowledge of chromosome 16p13.11 microdeletion.","205":"To present a case of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), followed by discussion of the etiology, pathophysiology, prenatal diagnosis, management, complications, prognosis, and family considerations. A literature review was conducted using MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, ProQuest, and Google Scholar. The search resulted in 593 articles; 25 relevant articles were chosen. Approximately 1 of every 250 cases of monochorionic twins acquire TTTS. The progression of TTTS is unpredictable; nontreatment and early onset have been associated with &gt;90 percent mortality of both twins. Neurodevelopmental impairment, preterm birth, renal hypoperfusion, growth restriction, cardiomyopathy, and hydrops fetalis have been associated with TTTS. A paucity of research and case reports exists, limiting recommendations for optimal diagnosis, management, and treatment regimens. TTTS is unpredictable in progression; earlier identification of chorionicity, diagnosis of TTTS, and improvement of treatment and management have the potential to improve the mortality and morbidity outcomes associated with TTTS.

In the United States approximately 40,000 infants are born each year with a CHD. Of the infants diagnosed with a CHD, one in every four heart defects are life threatening in origin. Early identification and treatment of congenital heart lesions, beginning with a comprehensive physical assessment after birth, are critical. For infants delivered at community-based hospitals, the importance of the physical assessment, timing of diagnostic strategies, anticipatory planning, and interprofessional collaboration among referring and accepting centers cannot be understated. This article presents a rare case of an infant with atrioventricular canal complicated by dextrocardia. Embryology, pathophysiology, epidemiology, symptomology, cardiac assessment, diagnostics, treatment, and nursing strategies for facilitating transfer of care from community-based hospitals to tertiary medical centers are discussed.","207":"Gestational alloimmune liver disease (GALD) is initiated by maternal antibodies that attack fetal hepatocytes. The fetal immune response to the antibodies causes liver damage. The incidence of GALD is four per 100,000 live births in the United States. Frequently, liver injury leads to fetal loss or neonatal demise; nonetheless, the presentation of GALD has a wide range of severity. Survival rates have increased from 20 to 80 percent changes in treatment and understanding of GALD. Current treatment is focused on supportive care with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and exchange transfusions. Mortality risk is positively associated with the timing of diagnosis. Although there has been an increase in understanding this disease, the discovery of the specific alloantigen is still needed.

Advances in pharmacotherapy, specifically antenatal corticosteroids and postnatal surfactant therapy, have significantly reduced the incidence and impact of neonatal RDS. Antenatal corticosteroids accelerate fetal lung maturation by increasing the activity of enzymes responsible for surfactant biosynthesis, resulting in improved lung compliance. Maternal antenatal corticosteroid treatment has improved survival of preterm neonates and lowered the incidence of brain injury. After birth, exogenous surfactant administration improves lung compliance and oxygenation, resulting in reductions in the incidence of pneumothorax and of death. Future research will identify the optimal surfactant product, timing of the initial dose, and mode of delivery.","214":"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is considered one of the most commonly occurring fatal genetic disorders. This disorder is associated with pancreatic insufficiency and pulmonary complications. However, at birth the initial complications are associated with bowel obstruction. Cystic fibrosis management warrants an interdisciplinary team because this disorder affects various organ systems. Effective management of the newborn with CF assists in improving the child's overall prognosis. Family support is critical throughout the prenatal and postnatal periods. The case presented reviews a child born with suspected CF and the clinical course within the NICU.","215":"Perinatal hypoxia is a devastating event before, during, or immediately after birth that deprives an infant's vital organs of oxygen. This injury at birth often requires a complex resuscitation and increases the newborn's risk of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). The resuscitation team in a community hospital nursery may have less experience with complex resuscitation and post-resuscitation care of this infant than a NICU. This article provides the neonatal nurse in a Level I or Level II nursery with information about resuscitation and post-resuscitation care of an infant at risk of HIE while awaiting transport to a NICU for therapeutic cooling.

This general review of developmental care in the NICU discusses how caregivers can apply appropriate, individualized developmental care measures to diapering regimens. Numerous opportunities to expand developmental care measures into diapering care are identified; these opportunities can protect and promote sleep for hospitalized infants, enhance the diapering environment, minimize stress that infants may experience with diapering, improve infant skin health outcomes through use of evidence-based skin care practices, and foster family involvement during diapering care in the NICU. A developmental approach to diapering offers hospitalized infants regular opportunities to reach their neurodevelopmental potential.","217":"The approach to the management of meconium-stained newborns in the delivery room has been changing for over 40 years. The goal is to prevent meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) and complications related to MAS. For decades, airway obstruction was believed to be a major component of MAS and, consequently, suction maneuvers to remove meconium from the airways were recommended to decrease the frequency and severity of MAS. Initial recommendations were based on observational studies. However, the incidence of MAS and mortality related to MAS has declined since the 1970s, mostly because of a decrease in the number of postterm deliveries. Recently updated guidelines by the American Heart Association and the Neonatal Resuscitation Program have reflected the strength of evidence supporting tracheal intubation and suctioning for nonvigorous, meconium-stained newborns. This article examines practice change since the 1970s in the delivery room management of meconium-stained newborns and evaluates evidence behind the changes.","218":"This case reports the findings and management of a late preterm female infant born with congenital bilateral eyelid eversion with chemosis. The pathogenic process remains unknown but typically presents at birth, predominantly affecting the upper eyelid of both eyes. Black males, patients with trisomy 21, and collodion infants have a higher incidence of eyelid eversion.

In this case report, successful resolution of chemosis and eyelid inversion occurred with conservative management.","219":"","220":"","221":"","222":"Neonatal infections result in significant morbidity and mortality. Antibiotics are vital for the treatment of infections but disrupt the neonatal microbiome, put the infant at risk for an adverse drug reaction, and may lead to the development of antibiotic resistance. Immediately after birth, clinicians must determine which infants require empiric antibiotics. Online risk stratification tools may provide a superior approach to decision trees. In infants who require empiric therapy for early-onset sepsis, ampicillin and an aminoglycoside with dosing based on recent pharmacokinetic studies represents the most appropriate first-line agents; third-generation cephalosporins should be reserved for patients with a high likelihood of Gram-negative meningitis. An antistaphylococcal penicillin and gentamicin should be utilized for suspected late-onset sepsis. Vancomycin and other broad-spectrum agents are reserved for patients with a history of resistant organisms. Antibiotic duration should be guided by understanding the clinical indications and obtaining the necessary cultures appropriately (i.e., adequate volume blood cultures). In the absence of a positive culture, antibiotic duration should often be limited. Individual institutions should leverage a multidisciplinary, interprofessional team to identify opportunities for antimicrobial stewardship. A collaborative, transparent system is required to change unit culture and generate a sustained impact on antibiotic utilization with optimal patient outcomes.","223":"Central venous catheters are commonly used for the provision of parenteral nutrition and medications for critically ill neonates in the NICU. However, central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are a major complication associated with their use and remain an important cause of nosocomial sepsis in NICUs. Central line-associated bloodstream infection has shifted from being an expected routine complication of central line use to an adverse event now evaluated as a critical event with the goal of identifying root causes so future CLABSI events are prevented. Success has been achieved through multiple strategies including implementation and maintenance of care bundles, education strategies to promote consistent adherence to bundle components, and institutional and unit support. Although low CLABSI rates can be achieved, sustaining low CLABSI rates and achieving zero CLABSI remain an ongoing challenge. We describe our experience with lessons learned, with an emphasis on the areas of difficulty during implementation of the bundle elements and the strategies and tools we utilized to overcome them.","224":null,"225":"The aim of this project was to evaluate the implementation of the Respiratory, Activity, Perfusion, Position, and Tone (RAPPT) instrument in assessing the infant's transition to extrauterine life while in skin-to-skin contact (SSC). Sample\/Design: Nurses (n = 17) completed a pretest and posttest of RAPPT and Apgar scoring knowledge, attended an in-service about accurate scoring, and were observed during 17 deliveries when newborns were in SSC. Primary variables were knowledge scores, use of RAPPT, and accurate RAPPT scoring. Apgar scoring was also measured. Knowledge scores increased significantly after education, RAPPT scores were correctly assessed, and 1 of 17 newborns had a sudden unexpected postnatal collapse. Apgar scoring accuracy did not change and nurses reported that their Apgar scores were based on their overall impressions of the infant instead of Apgar criteria. ","226":"Quality improvement has evolved rapidly in neonatal nursing. This review outlines the history and current state of quality improvement practice and education in neonatal nursing. The future of neonatal nursing includes a stronger emphasis on quality improvement in advanced practice education that promotes doctoral projects that result in clinical improvements.

The potential for decreasing cost and valuable time to diagnosis along with pain and suffering is becoming a reality in the NICU. Coupled with rapidly developing technology is a need to explore the associated ethical implication.","234":"Gastroesophageal reflux is a normal physiologic occurrence that is common throughout infancy and usually resolves on its own. Infrequently, reflux causes complications and turns into gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which may warrant intervention. Available interventions vary in invasiveness and supporting data may be lacking for efficacy and safety. Nonpharmacologic interventions are first-line therapy for GERD in infants, whereas pharmacologic and surgical approaches are controversial. Efficacy data are limited for pharmacologic strategies for infantile GERD and safety data have demonstrated serious risks, especially in younger infants. Utilization of these medications should be approached cautiously in this population, if appropriate diagnostic techniques determine acid suppression could be beneficial. A robust monitoring plan with frequent reassessment of need for therapy may optimize benefit and minimize risk.","235":"Respiratory distress continues to be a major cause of neonatal morbidity. Current neonatal practice recommends the use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) in the immediate resuscitation and continued support of neonates of all gestations with clinical manifestations of respiratory distress. Despite the many short- and long-term benefits of nCPAP, many neonatal care units have met resistance in its routine use. Although there have been numerous recent publications investigating the use and outcomes of various modes of nCPAP delivery, surfactant administration, mechanical ventilation, and other forms of noninvasive respiratory support (high-flow nasal cannula, nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation), there has been a relative lack of publications addressing the practical bedside care of infants managed on nCPAP. Effective use of nCPAP requires a coordinated interprofessional team approach, ongoing assessment of the neonate, troubleshooting the nCPAP circuit, and parent education.","236":"Assistive reproductive technology has progressed significantly over the past few decades. In spite of the advances, people may still resort to a surrogate for bearing and birthing a baby. Surrogacy, though an altruistic act, has been commercialized in the past few years, leading to emergence of several ethico-legal concerns. Nurses care for the surrogates, the infants, and the intended parents through their journey with sensitivity, advocacy, compassion, and confidentiality. This article intends to explore the implications of surrogacy to individuals, families, nations, and health care.","237":"The purpose of this study is to learn how caregivers who are expert in feeding infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) successfully feed these infants during withdrawal. Focus group methodology was used to gather information from self-identified experts from three large regional NICUs. Twelve NICU nurses and speech therapists participated in open-ended, recorded discussions. Detailed flip chart notes were taken, reviewed, and verified by the participants before the group ended. Four major themes emerged verified by the participants: (1) optimal medication management, (2) follow the baby's cues, (3) calm and comfortable, and (4) nurture the relationship. Participants reported using both common and creative techniques. Keeping the infant calm was crucial to being successful, as well as maintaining good control of withdrawal signs. Feeding the infant facing away from them to avoid eye contact was used, as well as vertical rocking, continuous butt patting, bundling, \"shhing\" sound, and a novel feeding position.

The hospital protocol for initial bathing procedures was updated: immersion baths; 12 hours postpartum; family included. Staff nurse champions provided staff training. The evaluation included three seven-week periods (2016-2017) and three measures: adherence, temperature stabilization, and exclusive breastfeeding. Of 1,205 38-week healthy newborns, 322 were born preimplementation (Pre), 486 after (Post), and 397 during maintenance (M). Adherence to bath timing increased and was maintained: 28 percent Pre; 83 percent Post; 85 percent M. Almost 100 percent of newborns had stable temperatures. Breastfeeding exclusivity rates did not change (ps greater than or equal to .05): baths less than 12 hours: 79 percent Pre, 74 percent Post, and 68 percent M; baths 12 hours: 68 percent Pre, 71 percent Post, and 73 percent M.

It is characterized by rapid proliferation in the first year of life, followed by slow involution during childhood. Presentation can range from asymptomatic to severe, high-output congestive heart failure (CHF). The purpose of this article is to review the case of an infant with an atypical presentation of IHH. It also addresses pathophysiology, diagnosis, management, and multidisciplinary team care.","245":"Pneumopericardium occurs when air accumulates in the pericardial sac surrounding the heart and is one of the rarest forms of air leaks in neonates. Because of various advances in neonatal care, including gentler modes of ventilation, surfactant replacement, and antenatal steroids, the incidence of pneumopericardium has decreased. Despite the decrease in incidence of pneumopericardium, most cases arise in premature infants with a history of respiratory distress and mechanical ventilation. Evidence has shown that the incidence is inversely related to birth weight and that pneumopericardium has high mortality and morbidity rates.","246":"To develop and content validate the Neonatal Eating Assessment Tool (NeoEAT), a parent-report measure of infant feeding. The NeoEAT was developed in three phases.

There can be cardiac involvement, including, but not limited to, pulmonary stenosis and tetralogy of Fallot. Patients can also present with butterfly vertebra, ocular issues, and vascular events. Because this syndrome follows an autosomal dominant inheritance, it can have variable expression even in the same family line. For infants in the NICU who have a cardiac defect and persistent hyperbilirubinemia after two weeks of age, genetic testing for AGS should be considered. Early detection and diagnosis can lead to improved outcomes. In this discussion of AGS, the clinical features as well as management are discussed.","249":"By using a literature review, this article examines the implications of achondroplasia.

With increased acuity comes an increase in diagnostic testing, including radiologic imaging. Although x-rays are necessary, they do not come without risk, including the future development of cancers.&lt;br\/&gt; Methods: The number of x-rays completed in the NICU over a one-year period, was evaluated prior to the radiation safety program, directly after implementation, and five years postintervention.&lt;br\/&gt; Results: Prior to the radiation safety program, the mean number of x-rays was 4.2 per patient per NICU admission. Immediately after implementation, the mean decreased to 3.8 per patient, and five years postintervention, the mean significantly decreased to 1.9 x-rays per patient per NICU stay.","260":"Neonates are at greater risk for central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) because of prolonged vascular access for nutrition and medications. Skin antisepsis using chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG), particularly the formulation with alcohol (CHG\/alcohol), during central line insertion and maintenance activities is a key clinical care process associated with CLABSI reduction. One area of ongoing confusion for many clinicians is whether to adhere to the manufacturer's recommendations that CHG remain on the skin following the procedure to promote persistent microbicidal effects or to foster product removal in hopes of preventing skin-related complications. Determine the effect of a targeted education program on the knowledge and attitudes of nurses who place peripherally inserted central catheters in the NICU regarding the use and removal of CHG antiseptic. A quasi-experimental presurvey\/postsurvey quality improvement project (QI project) recruited participants from the electronic mailing list of a national neonatal nursing organization. There was a statistically significant deficiency in knowledge or misinformation related to the use of CHG\/alcohol on the presurvey assessment. Eight questions reflecting knowledge consistent with most recent evidence were answered correctly only 11.4-25.7 percent of the time, all of which were considered statistically significant. Following completion of the education program, a nearly 100 percent correct response rate on all but three postsurvey questions resulted. This quality improvement project demonstrated success in the ability to change knowledge surrounding the removal of CHG\/alcohol from the skin of babies in the NICU following completion of a targeted education program and the effectiveness of targeted web-based educational programs. ","261":"Compassion fatigue is a concept used to describe how various stressors affect individuals who work in health care and other caregiving professions. The results of compassion fatigue may include decreased work productivity, poor quality of care, safety concerns, job dissatisfaction, and job turnover. The NICU professionals are at an increased risk for experiencing compassion fatigue because of the nature of working with critically ill infants, their families, and the additional stress of the workplace. The purpose of this article is for the NICU professional to understand compassion fatigue, identify the risk factors, recognize the signs and symptoms, and offer strategies to implement within the NICU environment.","262":"Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is the third most common yet most frequently underrecognized, congenitally acquired hemolytic disease of the neonate. Hereditary spherocytosis is caused by a defect of one or more erythrocyte membrane proteins, which leads to an increased rate of destruction of circulating red blood cells. The HS spectrum of symptoms is varied from asymptomatic to intrauterine hydrops. Diagnostic tests range from a complete blood count (CBC) analysis to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing. Management in the neonatal period focuses primarily on associated comorbidities, including the prevention of severe hyperbilirubinemia and anemia. Life span implications of HS include hemolysis, jaundice, anemia, splenomegaly, and periodic gallstones. Early identification and diagnosis of HS is essential to ensure proper monitoring and medical management throughout infancy, childhood, and adulthood.","263":"Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in neonates. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy occurs as a result of a perinatal hypoxic-ischemic event just prior to or during delivery. Therapeutic hypothermia using whole body cooling is the current treatment of choice to reduce brain injury and improve long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes for neonates with HIE. All English language articles published since 2005 in PubMed and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) were analyzed for existing evidence-based methods for whole body cooling. Whole body cooling is effective in the treatment of HIE in term and near-term neonates. Further research is needed to investigate the use of adjunctive therapies in conjunction with whole body cooling for improved neuroprotection.","264":"The clinical guidelines for treating patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) have significantly evolved over the last decades from treating any ductal shunt to more conservative management where only the hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (HSPDA) is treated. This shift has resulted largely from a lack of evidence from randomized controlled trials supporting a relationship between treating a PDA and improving long-term neonatal outcomes. However, there are many unresolved issues. There is no consensus on the precise definition of HSPDA requiring treatment or a clear understanding of when to treat HSPDA. Moreover, the current evidence shows worsening of the long-term neurodevelopmental outcome for infants undergoing surgical PDA ligation.&lt;br\/&gt; The presence of physiologic variability among preterm infants, and the presence of different compensatory mechanisms may make it difficult to establish a link between pathophysiology and long-term outcomes. That is, the physiologic variability cannot be simply assessed by randomly assigning infants into two arms of a study. Relying on research from animal and human studies, this article explains the link between the pathophysiology of a PDA and neonatal outcomes.","265":"","266":"","267":"","268":"","269":"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as glucose intolerance with onset during pregnancy. During pregnancy, women with GDM develop insulin resistance, which results in altered glucose tolerance.

This article discusses the role of the mother-baby nursing in the care of neonates born to women with gestational diabetes.","270":"Hospitals are challenged to implement measures to improve health outcomes, decrease costly interventions, and increase patient satisfaction. By following a nurse-driven protocol, our institution has successfully met these three challenges in our treatment of newborns diagnosed with neonatal hypoglycemia (NH). Based on results of a randomized clinical trial, a multidisciplinary team trialed glucose gel as a standard treatment for NH. During the first year, admission rates to the NICU for NH decreased by 73 percent. Exclusive breastfeeding rates for this population increased to 49 percent and 40 additional families remained together on the mother baby unit. This practice change is improving health outcomes, decreasing expensive interventions, and increasing satisfaction among the population of infants at risk for NH.","271":"The anion gap, in conjunction with other laboratory results, can be a useful clue in the differential diagnosis of metabolic acidosis. There are three primary causes of metabolic acidosis: loss of base, decreased renal excretion of acid, and increased acid production.

As a result, there is no direct communication between the right atrium and right ventricle. Surgical treatment, including the Fontan procedure, is indicated yet palliative, leaving patients with various lifelong complications. A comprehensive literature review revealed a paucity of evidence-based education on the identification, evaluation, management, treatment, and life span implications of TA. We present a case of TA from birth through adulthood, while simultaneously assessing the literature, to report the most current evidence relative to living with TA after surgical palliation. In addition, the embryology, methods of prenatal and postnatal diagnosis, potential complications, management, anticipatory guidance, and educational needs of both parents and patient are discussed.","273":"Early exposure to age-appropriate, meaningful auditory stimuli, such as lullaby singing, has been shown to advance various medical and developmental goals in premature infants in the NICU while reducing medical costs. A primary goal of NICU music therapists is to control auditory stimuli in the unit to help premature infants reach the greatest possible sedation. In hospitals with limited or no NICU music therapy (NICU-MT) coverage, nurses and other NICU staff can play an important role in providing neuroprotection to these premature infants while also optimizing neurodevelopment via use of recorded music. Based on current literature, this article provides a set of evidence-based guidelines for the use of recorded music with premature infants.","274":"Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) is a rare congenital imprinting disorder. The genetic findings in SRS patients are heterogeneous and often sporadic. However, chromosomes 7, 11, and 17 are consistently involved in all individuals who meet the strict diagnostic criteria of SRS. There are many clinical features characteristic of SRS; the most common are low birth weight, short stature, triangular face, clinodactyly, relative macrocephaly, ear anomalies, and skeletal asymmetry.","275":"Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM) is a rare disorder, with a reported incidence of approximately 1 in 450,000 live births. It is characterized by insulin-requiring hyperglycemia in the neonatal period. The disease improves by early childhood, but the patient may relapse in later life. Diagnosis is made after genetic testing following presentation with hyperglycemia not conforming to Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. Management is based on insulin and possible sulfonylurea administration. Three genetically distinct subtypes of TNDM are recognized. Type 1 TNDM is due to overexpression of genes at the 6q24 locus, whereas the 11p15 locus is involved in Type 2 and 3 TNDM. In this article the clinical presentation, management, and genetics of TNDM are discussed, particularly emphasizing the role of the neonatal nurse.","276":"Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a clinical tool that provides a bedside method of noninvasively measuring continuous, \"real-time\" oxygen consumption and monitoring for potential ischemia of somatic tissues, particularly the brain, kidneys, and intestine in neonates. Although the concept of NIRS seems promising, its implementation into clinical practice has been inconsistent for various reasons, including difficulty in interpreting regional oxygen saturation (rSO2), the wide variation in types of NIRS monitors and probes, the cost of new equipment, different monitoring modalities, large discrepancies in both intra- and interindividual use, a lack of defined universal normative values, and little to no data on outcomes or potentially harmful interventions made based on rSO2 readings. We combine findings from previously published informational articles and studies on the use of NIRS in neonatal medicine to provide a comprehensive overview of this tool and identify potential indications for clinical use.","277":"","278":"","279":"","280":"Parents confronting the death of a child or working through the complex health needs of a child often feel isolated in their communities.

A successful transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life is contingent on adequate pulmonary vasodilation. Several pathophysiologies contribute to the failure of this cascade and may result in life-threatening hypoxia and acidosis in the newborn. Management includes optimal respiratory support, adequate sedation and analgesia, and support of vascular tone and cardiac function. Pulmonary vasodilation has the potential to overcome the cycle of hypoxia and acidosis, improving outcome in these infants. Oxygen and inhaled nitric oxide represent the foundation of therapy. Tertiary pulmonary vasodilators represent a greater challenge, selecting between therapies that include prostanoids, sildenafil, and milrinone. Variable levels of evidence exist for each agent. Thorough review of available data informing efficacy and adverse effects contributes to the development of an informed approach to neonates with refractory PPHN.","282":"Placental blood remains an underused resource for early neonatal care despite ample evidence that placental blood provides the same clinical decision making information without the need for painful, invasive blood sampling procedures. Potential benefits of placental\/umbilical blood sampling (PUBS) for neonatal admission labs include decreases in pain reactivity, rates of anemia, need for blood transfusions, use of vasopressors, and rates of intraventricular hemorrhage. Here, we present a unique case study of a critically ill infant with contradictory blood culture results from PUBS and direct infant sampling. A negative admission direct sample blood culture result compared with a positive admission PUBS blood culture result suggests that infection may have been missed in the direct infant sample. Relevant placental embryology and circulation is also described, as well as the benefits of PUBS for neonatal admission labs (with focus on the blood culture), challenges associated with PUBS practice, and strategies for implementation of PUBS.","283":"Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurobehavioral and genetically determined condition, which affects approximately 1 in 15,000 individuals. It is caused by various genetic mutations and deletions of the maternally-inherited UBE3A gene, on the 15q11-13 chromosomal region. The UBE3A gene, which encodes E3 ubiquitin ligase, shows tissue-specific imprinting, being expressed entirely from the maternal allele.The diagnosis of AS is confirmed either by methylation test or by mutation analysis. A more severe clinical picture is linked with the deletion phenotype.Patients with AS have a behavioral and motor pattern defined as \"happy puppet\" because it is characterized by puppet-like ataxic jerky movements; a happy, sociable disposition; and paroxysms of laughter. There is currently no cure for AS, and management is mainly symptomatic. Novel therapeutic options are directed toward the possibility of activating the silenced paternal copy of the UBE3A gene.","284":"The imprinting disorder, Prader-Willi syndrome, is a condition associated with the gene region 15q11.2-q.13. The phenotype includes multiple characteristics, most of which are endocrine-related. An accurate diagnosis is done mostly through pre- or postnatal genetic testing. Management is mainly aimed at correcting the endocrine dysfunctions present in these patients. Genetic testing is also important to distinguish between the different causes and to calculate the recurrence risk for parents with affected children. Although a lot has been discovered and this syndrome can be managed to a satisfactory degree, further research is still important especially regarding new potential treatments with greater efficiency and reduced invasiveness. The neonatal nurse has an important role because the management requires thorough monitoring as well as high compliance from both the patient and the carers. Thus, it is essential for the neonatal nurse to have a good knowledge of this condition.","285":"Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is the most common pediatric overgrowth syndrome. Features characteristic of the BWS phenotype include both physical attributes, such as macroglossia, abdominal wall defects, gigantism, nevus flammeus, visceromegaly, and mid-face hypoplasia, as well as biochemical abnormalities such as hypoglycemia. It is essential for the neonatal nurse to be able to recognize BWS in the patient's early years of life because of the increased frequency of medical complications, malformations, and the increased risk of embryonic malignancies. This article focuses on the presentation of BWS as an aid to early detection.","286":"Epigenetics refers to the heritable information that is exclusive of DNA. Several syndromes have been found to occur as the result of the process of epigenetics. This process causes changes in the expression of genes, without changing the actual DNA sequence. The factors influencing this process include both internal and external triggers, leading to modulation of the epigenome through different mechanisms. This article aims to describe how the process of epigenetics gives rise to the multitude of possible syndromes seen in neonates.

In this comprehensive review, benefits of SSC for newborns, mothers, and fathers after vaginal and cesarean births are discussed as well as the benefits of SSC observed for infants in the NICU. Barriers to SSC practice implementation are discussed, and proposed solutions and recommendations are offered. By understanding the many benefits of SSC and strategies for implementation, health care providers can best support and promote this high-quality, evidence-based practice with mothers, newborns, and their families.","294":"Multiple preterm birth is associated with more maternal psychological distress and less positive mother-infant interactions than singleton preterm birth. This study's purpose was to compare psychological distress and the relationship with their infants in mothers of multiples and mothers of singletons. An exploratory secondary analysis of longitudinal data. 236 mothers and their preterm infants. Maternal psychological distress (depressive symptoms, anxiety, posttraumatic stress [PTS], parenting stress), the mother-infant relationship (worry; child vulnerability; maternal positive involvement and developmental stimulation; and child developmental maturity, irritability, and social behaviors), and the home environment. Mothers of multiples had greater PTS symptoms at baseline, anxiety at discharge, and depressive symptoms at six months than mothers of singletons. Mothers of multiples also had more positive home environments at six months. Multiple birth was a risk factor for psychological distress but not for less positive mother-infant interactions. ","295":"Two distinct architectural designs are found in today's NICUs-the open-bay (OPBY) and the single-family room (SFR) designs. When neonatology was recognized as a medical subspecialty in the 1970s, the OPBY design was the only platform offered to neonates and families. The OPBY design facilitated communication between staff, collegiality, and interprofessional collaboration among members of the neonatal team. Over time, pitfalls to the design were recognized, including increased transmission of sound and light. As a result, the SFR design emerged offering a family-centered, customizable environment. Through recognition and adoption of best practices, the neurodevelopmental benefits to SFRs can be infused within the OPBY unit. This article aims to identify best practices to infuse the benefits of SFR design (such as low light, low sound, and less overstimulation) into the OPBY NICU to reduce negative stimulation and optimize developmental outcomes for vulnerable neonates.","296":"","297":"","298":"","299":"Preeclampsia is one of the most common complications in the last half of pregnancy.

Although treatment of low blood pressure is common, clinicians must use all available information to target neonates with compromised perfusion. Pharmacotherapy should be tailored to the specific physiologic perturbations of the individual neonate. Dopamine is the most commonly utilized agent and may be the most appropriate agent for septic shock with low diastolic blood pressure. However, alternative therapies should be considered for other etiologies of hypotension, including milrinone and vasopressin for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn and dobutamine for patent ductus arteriosus. Additional studies are required to refine the approach to neonatal hypotension and document the long-term outcomes of treated neonates.","302":"The most common nonencapsulated solid renal tumor in the neonatal period is congenital mesoblastic nephroma. Mesoblastic nephroma is a solid lesion originating within or extending from the renal parenchyma. These tumors proliferate rapidly, typically within 3-6 months after birth. Mesoblastic nephromas are stratified by classification as either classical (benign) or atypical (malignant); masses composed of both benign and malignant cells are also reported. The hallmark clinical manifestation of mesoblastic nephroma is a palpable abdominal mass, which may be accompanied by hypertension, hypercalcemia, hematuria, and polyuria. Differentiating between benign and malignant renal tumors is essential to invoke a timely, evidence-based management and treatment plan. With appropriate surgical intervention in a timely manner, prognosis is excellent and mesoblastic nephroma is considered curable. We present a case involving a premature infant with congenital mesoblastic nephroma with discussion of embryology, pathophysiology, diagnostic, management, and prognostic implications for the neonate and family.","303":"We present a first report of necrotizing fasciitis of the abdominal wall in a 23-day-of-age, former 32-week-gestation premature infant.

Staff has the responsibility of providing parents with a myriad of education regarding the intensive care environment and information concerning their child's medical condition. With first-time parents, staff teaching topics extend to also include training on how to perform basic newborn care such as diapering, bathing, feeding, and numerous other primary parenting responsibilities. True comprehensive education, however, should include information about and evidence on the significance of parental self-care in not only their own health and emotional stability but also the cognitive and behavioral development of their child prior to leaving the comfort of their NICU support network. Recommendations for this essential education are presented so NICU providers can best prepare parents for this critical responsibility.","305":"Procedural distress is a common occurrence in the NICU and is tied to attempts to support the life and development of vulnerable premature infants. We discuss the epidemiology of procedural distress and the potential negative consequences on infant neurodevelopment. We define procedural distress in the NICU and outline three approaches to limit or to reduce its detrimental effects including minimizing the number of procedures, instituting measures for developmentally supportive care, and using preemptively pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic analgesia. Despite the pervasiveness of procedural distress in the NICU, clinical and administrative measures are available to ameliorate possible harmful outcomes.","306":"NICU nurses have seen a dramatic increase in cases of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). The care needs of infants with NAS are highly demanding and can lead to feelings of frustration and emotional exhaustion among NICU nurses. Although studies have examined the experiences of nurses caring for NAS patients, none have specifically addressed the risk for compassion fatigue and burnout. Nurses need practical strategies to reduce their risk for compassion fatigue and burnout when caring for these patients. Improved education and implementation of self-care measures can help nurses more effectively manage stress and positively impact care of these infants and their families.","307":"","308":"","309":"","310":"Infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) are a growing population in the NICU setting, and nurses report that caring for families can be challenging. Women who are pregnant and newly parenting who use drugs and alcohol typically face significant negative attitudes, judgment, and stigma within their communities and from providers when they access health care. When nurses witness biased behavior or communication from their peers, they may feel distressed and unprepared to address the situation. Using script guides or structured communication frameworks (e.g., SBAR) is one helpful strategy for rehearsing actions and responses. The ACTS script was developed specifically to address peer attitudes and stigma in relation to substance use during pregnancy. ","311":"Gestational substance exposure continues to be a significant problem. Neonates may be exposed to various substances including illicit drugs, prescription drugs, and other legal substances that are best not used during pregnancy because of their potential deleterious effects as possible teratogens or their potential to create dependence and thus withdrawal in the neonate. Screening the newborn for gestational substance exposure is important for both acute care and early intervention to promote the best possible long-term outcomes. This column provides insight into what is known about the extent of substance use by pregnant women, an overview of neonatal biologic matrices for drug testing, and a discussion of the legal implications of neonatal substance screening. ","312":"Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) from in utero opioid exposure has reached epidemic levels in the United States. Although nonpharmacologic therapies form the foundation of care, many neonates require pharmacotherapy. Morphine represents the most widely used first-line agent and effectively treats the symptoms of withdrawal. However, methadone or buprenorphine may facilitate earlier discharge. Although phenobarbital is traditionally used when opioids fail, clonidine may be a more appropriate adjunctive agent to minimize negative neurodevelopmental impact. Consideration of the available data allows hospitals to generate effective pharmacologic strategies to manage NAS while further research continues. ","313":"Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) affects 3.39 in every 1,000 live births. A literature review was conducted to determine the varying types of nonpharmacologic management being used currently and its effect on the treatment of NAS symptoms. Fourteen articles were found that used nonpharmacologic management in the treatment of NAS. Therapies included breastfeeding, positioning, rooming-in, acupuncture\/acupressure, and beds. Each of the nonpharmacologic therapies in these articles, with the exception of rocking beds, was shown to have a positive effect on the newborn with NAS. These effects include a shorter length of stay, a decrease in NAS scores, a decrease need for pharmacologic treatment, less agitation, a better quality of sleep, and a decrease in the severity of NAS symptoms. This review article shows that nonpharmacologic management is an effective tool for NAS symptom treatment. ","314":"The purpose of this study was to describe the interactions between mothers in a methadone treatment program and their infants during a bottle feeding and compare the findings with normed data. A comparative-descriptive design was used. Data from 12 opiate-exposed mother-infant dyads were compared with normed data. Nursing Child Assessment Satellite-Training Scale scores. The opiate-exposed dyads scored significantly lower than the normed dyads in the infant subscales of clarity of cues (p &lt; .001, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.56-4.08) and responsiveness to caregiver (p &lt; .01, 95% CI, 0.27-2.5), as well as the total score (p &lt; .001, 95% CI, 2.42-6.15). Parent sensitivity to infant cues subscale (p &lt; .01, 95% CI, 0.42-2.37) and parent contingency score (p &lt; .01, 95% CI, 0.55-3.81) were also significantly lower.

","315":"The purpose of this focused ethnography was to describe the culture of care and nonpharmacologic nursing interventions performed by NICU nurses for infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Roper and Shapira's framework for the analysis included participant observation, individual interviews, and examination of existing documents. Twelve full-time nurses were observed and interviewed. Results described the culture of care provided to infants with NAS by NICU nurses as evidenced by six themes: learn the baby (routine care, comfort care, environment, adequate rest and sleep, feeding), core team relationships (support, interpersonal relationships), role satisfaction (nurturer\/comforter, becoming an expert), grief, making a difference (wonderful insanity, critical to them), and education and care of the mother. ","316":"Parents of infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) in the NICU may have questions about the long-term consequences of prenatal exposure to methadone, both asked and unasked. Although the signs of withdrawal will abate relatively quickly, parents should be aware of potential vision, motor, and behavioral\/cognitive problems, as well as sleeping disturbances and ear infections so their infants can be followed closely and monitored by their pediatrician with appropriate referrals made. Furthermore, this knowledge may inspire parents to enroll their infants in an early intervention program to help optimize their outcomes. There are still many unanswered questions about epigenetic consequences, risk for child abuse\/neglect, and risk of future substance abuse in this population. ","317":"Neonatal nurses frequently care for babies who have been exposed in utero to potentially harmful substances, both licit and illicit. The risks to the fetus from nicotine, marijuana, alcohol, and opiates are significant. Adverse effects from environmental factors may confound pharmacologic effects of substances. Nurses are called to shift the perception of substance use disorder from that of willful harm to the fetus to that of an opportunity to provide treatment assistance that can positively affect child health and development. Concerns for unethical practices in the toxicology screening of pregnant women and their babies by risk factors that are unproven or disproven are discussed, and three goals of toxicology screening based on the ethical principles of justice and beneficence are proposed.

Multiple risk factors contribute to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia leading to examination of various strategies of prevention. Systemic corticosteroids are one prevention strategy with a large body of data, creating an ongoing controversy regarding the risks and benefits of therapy. Careful consideration of the available data along with the clinical characteristics of the individual infant is required before using this powerful therapy. ","324":"To determine if a foam septum protector prevents nasal injury in preterm infants receiving nasal heated humidified oxygen. A retrospective before and after comparative design was used. Medical records of 101 preterm infants receiving either nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) or nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) were reviewed; 50 were in the control group and 51 were in the intervention group that had the NeoSeal septum protector applied. The groups were not different in terms of gender, birth weight, gestational age, days intubated, or on days on NCPAP\/NIPPV. Skin condition of nares was scored daily using the Neonatal Skin Risk Assessment Scale (NSRAS). Infants who had the NeoSeal applied had significantly less nasal injuries, OR = 4.08; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.22-9.59; p = .01. The best predictors of nasal injury were gestational age and whether the NeoSeal was applied or not. ","325":"Oral feeding is a developmental task for all premature infants. often, independent nipple feeding is the last barrier to discharge home from the NICU. A relationship exists between consistent, infant-driven feeding management practices and improved feeding performance. Conversely, a random approach to feeding may contribute to poor short-term and long-term clinical outcomes. We report a quality improvement project that was undertaken across five NICUs in an urban setting. our aim was to safely initiate and advance nipple feeding for very preterm neonates (born at &lt;32 weeks gestation) who had a respiratory morbidity requiring nasal continuous positive airway pressure therapy. A novel algorithm entitled \"eating in SINC: Safe individualized nipple-Feeding Competence\" was developed. Safe individualized nipple-feeding competence involves the baby, the parents, and the health care team by using infant-driven strategies, common language, and developmentally appropriate goals while supporting fragile neonates to be skilled feeders.

Disruption of the intestinal microbiota has been linked to necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and late-onset sepsis (LOS). To determine what is known about the intestinal microbiota of very premature infants. We describe the relationship of the intestinal microbiota to NEC and LOS and provide an overview of the effect of environmental factors. A review was conducted using PubMed\/MEDLINE from 2008 to 2015 to examine what is currently known about the intestinal microbiota of very premature infants. The intestinal bacteria are low in diversity and generally contain a predominance of potentially pathogenic bacteria. Evidence suggests that these bacteria play a role in NEC as well as LOS through translocation. Environmental factors such as mode of delivery, use of antibiotics, and type of feeding may also contribute to the development of the intestinal microbiota. ","327":"Intact hemodynamics results when there is adequate oxygen uptake by the respiratory system, normal cardiac output, sufficient oxygen-carrying capacity of blood, and intact autoregulatory mechanisms to maintain enough oxygenation for normal end-organ function. The current routine monitoring of cardiovascular dynamics in sick preterm and term infants has been based on incomplete evaluation and relies on nonspecific and sometimes misleading clinical markers such as blood pressure.

Prior to the infant's discharge, the parents undergo rigorous training to continue the care of their infants at home. Even after training, parents may feel overwhelmed by the thought of managing an emergency at home. This evidence-based practice project aims to provide parents with additional hands-on practice of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) prior to their infant's discharge. Based on this project, a program of teaching CPR regularly is established currently in the NICU at Nemours Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children.

","338":"Polydactyly, also known as hyperdactyly, is a common congenital limb defect, which can present with various morphologic phenotypes. Apart from cosmetic and functional impairments, it can be the first indication of an underlying syndrome in the newborn. Usually, it follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with defects occurring in the anteroposterior patterning of limb development. Although many mutations have been discovered, teratogens have also been implicated in leading to this anomaly, thus making it of multifactorial origin. There are three polydactyly subtypes (radial, ulnar, and central), and treatment options depend on the underlying feature. ","339":"Premature neonates delivered &lt;32 completed weeks gestation are unprepared to handle the physiologic demands of extrauterine life. Within the respiratory system, alveolar instability and collapse can cause decreased functional residual capacity, impaired oxygenation, and hypoxemia leading to respiratory distress syndrome. Supportive measures are indicated immediately after birth to establish physiologic stability including bubble continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. CPAP is a noninvasive, gentle mode of ventilation that can mitigate the effects of lung immaturity, but prolonged use can increase the risk for nasal breakdown. Strategies to mitigate this risk must be infused as best practices in the NICU environment.

CST can be used as a treatment modality to release fascial restrictions that are affecting the structures involved in feeding, thereby improving feeding outcomes. ","343":"Bone mineralization of preterm infants is significantly less than full-term infants at birth, placing preterm infants at risk for osteopenia of prematurity and other metabolic bone diseases. Advances in nutritional supplementation and standard nursing care alone have been unsuccessful in improving bone mineralization postnatally. Research supports a daily physical activity protocol of passive range of motion and gentle joint compression when combined with adequate nutritional supplementation reduces osteopenia of prematurity. This article provides a systematic review of the current evidence surrounding early physical activity and neonatal massage for the treatment of osteopenia and indicates the need for universal handling protocols in caring for this unique population. ","344":"Neonatal neurocritical care is an emerging subspecialty that combines the expertise of critical care medicine and neurology with that of nursing and other providers in an interprofessional team approach to care. Neurocritical care of the neonate has roots in adult and pediatric practice. It has been demonstrated that adults with acute neurologic conditions who are treated in a specialized neurocritical care unit have reduced morbidity and mortality, as well as decreased length of stay, lower costs, and reduced need for neurosurgical procedures. In pediatrics, neurocritical care has focused on various primary and secondary neurologic conditions complicating critical care that also contribute to mortality, morbidity, and duration of hospitalization. However, the concept of neurocritical care as a subspecialty in pediatric practice is still evolving, and evidence demonstrating improved outcomes is lacking. In the neonatal intensive care nursery, neurocritical care is also evolving as a subspecialty concept to address both supportive and preventive care and optimize neurologic outcomes for an at-risk neonatal patient population. To enhance effectiveness of this care approach, nurses must be prepared to appropriately recognize acute changes in neurologic status, implement protocols that specifically address neurologic conditions, and carefully monitor neurologic status to help prevent secondary injury. The complexity of this team approach to brain-focused care has led to the development of a specialized role: the neurocritical care nurse (neonatal intensive care nursery [NICN] nurse). This article will review key concepts related to neonatal neurocritical care and the essential role of nursing. It will also explore the emerging role of the NICN nurse in supporting early recognition and management of at-risk infants in this neonatal subspecialty practice.

In the presence of DIC, transfusion of FFP is beneficial. ","353":"The diagnosis of trisomy 13 has been considered incompatible with life. Trisomy 13 is associated with a pattern of congenital anomalies and mental disabilities that make caring for these infants a challenge for both the family and health care professionals. The clinical management of trisomy 13 varies based on the organ systems involved. The current standard of care has been withholding intensive support and providing comfort care. Recent literature suggests there are improved outcomes in infants who receive intensive care at birth. In addition, case reports evaluating older children with trisomy 13 report that, although there are significant intellectual and psychomotor disabilities, these children do meet developmental milestones such as smiling in response to parents, sitting unassisted, and walking with a walker.

","354":"Epidermolytic ichthyosis (EI) is a rare autosomal dominant genodermatosis that presents at birth as a bullous disease, followed by a lifelong ichthyotic skin disorder. Essentially, it is a defective keratinization caused by mutations of keratin 1 (KRT1) or keratin 10 (KRT10) genes, which lead to skin fragility, blistering, and eventually hyperkeratosis. Successful management of EI in the newborn period can be achieved through a thoughtful, directed, and interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary approach that encompasses family support. This condition requires meticulous care to avoid associated morbidities such as infection and dehydration. A better understanding of the disrupted barrier protection of the skin in these patients provides a basis for management with daily bathing, liberal emollients, pain control, and proper nutrition as the mainstays of treatment.

Approximately 20 percent of all neonates in a NICU are intubated, mechanically ventilated, and require suctioning, which can cause both acute and chronic pain. Pain management in the neonate can be challenging. Nurses and other caregivers need to be well trained to assess pain in the neonate to effectively identify and provide appropriate pain management strategies.

Adverse skin reactions, most commonly burns, have been reported after the use of CHG. Preserving skin integrity in preterm infants is vital in the prevention of sepsis, excessive water loss, hypothermia, and renal failure. This is a case report of two incidents of significant skin burning in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants who were treated with CHG for the purposes of umbilical cord sterilization prior to umbilical line placement. This case report of burns associated with CHG in one infant weighing 610 g at birth and a second infant weighing 600 g at birth. CHG does have a strong association with causing skin burns in the ELBW population; however, wiping the solution off of the skin seems to reduce injury. ","464":"Nurses have demonstrated concern for years about their interactions with pregnant women who abuse drugs. Reports of nurses' concern with substance abuse have been reported in the literature since the 1980s. As with any chronic disease, drug addiction causes physiologic changes, and the pathology that occurs in the brain drives characteristic behaviors. Research suggests that choices that addicts make are driven by pathology rather than by failure of a moral compass. This article reviews the theoretical explanations for addictive behaviors, describes the pathophysiology of drug addiction that is responsible for the predictable symptoms and behaviors exhibited by women who abuse prescription drugs and other opioids, and identifies nursing interventions to impact positive outcomes. Nurses who have a working knowledge of this disease will provide more effective nursing care to the women they encounter and are better prepared to make a difference in the lives of both women and their children. ","465":"Among the indigenous people of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta area of Alaska, a homemade moist chewing tobacco known as Black Bull or \"iq'mik\" is widely used. Intake of various tobacco products is reported to be more than 80 percent in pregnant women throughout this area, with up to 60 percent of the pregnant women admitting to regular use of Black Bull. High levels of nicotine, cotinine, heavy metals, and other chemicals are known to pass to the fetus. Neonatal exposure to maternal tobacco use has been studied for the past three decades and has been shown to cause neonatal passive addiction and subsequent withdrawal symptoms. The intensified exposure and withdrawal experienced by infants passively subjected to Black Bull warrant further study.

Interviewed is Jayne M. Standley, PhD, MT -BC, NICU-MT , who talks about how lullaby music combined with a specialized device that includes a pacifier can help premature infants learn to pace themselves during feeding sessions. ","468":"Clonidine is a nonnarcotic analgesic historically used as a nasal decongestant and more recently established as an antihypertensive agent in adults. Because of its sedative properties with few adverse effects, clonidine has also been reported to be an effective pharmacologic agent for the treatment of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). The use of oral clonidine as a primary or secondary agent in the treatment of NAS has been found to reduce hospitalization and duration of treatment in this population. ","469":"Infants of diabetic mothers (IDMs) can present with various symptoms and disorders. The neonatal nurse must be able to assess the infant for glucose control and other anomalies. ","470":"When women addicted to opioids seek prenatal care, the treatment of choice is methadone. Methadone mediates the addiction by reducing fluctuations in maternal serum opioid levels and protecting the fetus from repeated withdrawal episodes. Methadone maintenance is associated with increased maternal weight gain, decreased illegal drug use, and improved compliance with prenatal care. Although the risks are less when compared with street drugs, the risk to the fetus is physical dependence. Despite the magnitude of this national problem, there is a dearth of literature to guide NICU nurses on how to best support mothers of infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) in the care of their infants. The purposes of this article are to review what is known about women in methadone treatment who have a history of opioid addiction and apply that evidence to guide neonatal nurses to support mothers of infants with NAS in the NICU. ","471":"Although studies have shown cue-based feeding can lead to earlier achievement of full oral feeding, the successful implementation of cue-based feeding has been constrained by the volume-driven culture, which has existed for many years in the NIC U. This culture was built on the notion that a \"better\" nurse is one who could \"get more in,\" and infants who are \"poor feeders\" are ones who \"can't take enough.\" The infant who feeds faster is often viewed as more skilled in this task-oriented approach. The feeding relationship and the infant's communication about the experience of feeding may not be nurtured. This article will explain the central role of the preterm infant's communication in successful cue-based feeding. When the infant is perceived as having meaningful behavior (i.e., communicative intent), the focus changes from a volume-driven to a co-regulated approach, through which the infant guides the caregiver. This is cue-based feeding. ","472":"To quantify mothers' concerns in anticipation of their infant's discharge from the NICU. An exploratory, cross-sectional survey design was used. A convenience sample of 150 mothers. The focus was the mothers' concerns about their infant's impending discharge. The mothers expressed confidence in their ability as a caregiver but expressed concern about being tired, the need for readmission to the hospital, and missing a change in the infant's conditions. ","473":"The purpose of this quality initiative was to increase NICU nurse competency to meet the care needs of higher acuity infants. A multifaceted educational approach with individual bedside education, a clinical practicum, inservices, and case presentations was based on results from a needs assessment, observational feedback, and chart audits. Results of this educational intervention included increased nurse competency and a change in admission criteria to care for higher acuity infants without transporting them to another hospital miles away. As the admission criteria changed, the volume of higher acuity infants increased, and the nurses were able to maintain their competency in caring for these infants. ","474":"","475":"Delayed cord clamping is a collaboration between the obstetric team and the neonatal team. Although the optimal timing for clamping the umbilical cord after birth continues to be subject to study, delaying clamping for at least 30-60 seconds, with the newborn held at or below the level of the uterus\/placenta supports normal physiology and has proven benefits. Practical issues such as thermoregulation and equipment can be overcome with team collaboration and prebriefing planning. Neonatal nurses who attend deliveries are perfectly poised to influence this practice and improve short- and long-term outcomes for their patients. ","476":"Troponin T and I can be found within the myocardial filaments. Measuring these cardiac troponin levels in full-term newborns and premature infants has not become a common practice in the neonatal intensive care unit and newborn nurseries. Research studies are discovering that an elevation in troponin T and I levels can be directly correlated with the severity of the infant's illness, and it can be potentially prognostic of morbidity. This literature analysis discusses what can be considered normal cardiac troponin levels along with what elevated levels are and possible conditions associated with those elevations. ","477":"Various regulatory agencies have indicated the need to measure initial and ongoing competency among health care workers. Yet, what is competency and how can it be measured? In reality, competency assessment is about outcomes. Maintaining and advancing our knowledge, skills, and analytical abilities is important for achieving optimal patient outcomes. Competency assessment should go beyond the act of attending lectures and skills fairs. Competency assessment should be a time when nurses can demonstrate and document their problem-solving and decision-making skills, inclusion of best practices, and evidence of how those skills make a difference for the patients they care for. ","478":"Kangaroo Care (KC) has been recommended as a pain-reducing strategy in neonates; however, KC has not been widely used to minimize procedural pain caused in part by nurses'\/phlebotomists' discomfort when positioning themselves and the infant for blood drawing and injections. Therefore, an ergonomically designed setup incorporating the use of KC was introduced into clinical practice to facilitate blood draws and injections. The step-by-step procedure used for heel sticks and injections is presented in this manuscript. After implementing the ergonomic step-by-step protocol, complaints of discomfort by nurses and phlebotomists ceased, and an additional benefit was that infant pain responses were significantly reduced. ","479":"Jeune syndrome (JS), or asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a small, narrow thorax, with associated shortening of limbs. Children with JS present with variable degrees of respiratory distress, frequently lethal in the neonatal period. Other associated complications include renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, and retinal dysfunction. Management focuses on stabilization and support of respiratory function. Treatment may be palliative in nature or corrective. In recent years, the advance in surgical treatment of the thoracic hypoplasia in JS offers hope to those families with a child suffering from the syndrome. Even with increased research into treatment of this disorder, prognosis is usually poor. Comorbidities associated with JS lead to serious organ dysfunction in later years. Families who have a child with JS need genetic counseling and education focusing on the seriousness of the disorder, the risks and benefits of treatment, and the lifelong needs of those with JS. ","480":"Having an infant admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) can be a frightening experience for parents. However, it can be even more frightening for them when they are from a different culture and speak a different language than the health care team. Hence, a nurse needs to be culturally competent in order to provide proper care to a multicultural society. The purpose of this article is to describe how NICU nurses can communicate with one such culture, the Chinese American, the largest Asian group in the United States. A transcultural nursing model will be described to use as a guide to help the nurse. The culture, Chinese Americans, will be described to help nurses provide culturally competent care. Research studies will be presented so the reader can develop an understanding of how parents of Chinese descent perceive the care they receive. Interventions and recommendations will be presented on how to enhance communication between the nurses and this cultural group. ","481":"To identify what parents need to feel ready for the discharge of their infant from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Qualitative. 20 parents of infants admitted to a Canadian Level III NI CU were interviewed (2011-2012) and asked to identify what they require to feel ready for discharge. Interview transcripts underwent qualitative content analysis to produce a descriptive summary of parents' perceptions of their needs. Parents indicated a need for information and hands-on experience to enhance their readiness for discharge. Observations of their infant and of the NI CU environment impacted parents' perceptions of their infant's readiness for discharge, which influenced perceptions of their own readiness for discharge. Finally, parents require tailoring of information and experiences to meet the unique needs of their family. ","482":"Rectal bleeding in neonates is an alarming sign that suggests a possible serious underlying condition, such as infection or bleeding disorder that would necessitate hospitalization and prompt intervention. We report a case of eosinophilic gastroenteritis caused by cow's milk protein allergy in a one-day- old infant, who presented with frankly bloody stools associated with massive gastrointestinal and peripheral blood eosinophilia prior to initiation of enteral feedings. The patient's outcome was favorable, with complete spontaneous recovery in one week, after a period of bowel rest, parenteral nutrition, and use of amino acid formula. The eosinophilia was also transient and gradually resolving by two months of age. Rectal bleeding secondary to allergic colitis caused by cow's milk sensitization may occur in neonates, and failure to appreciate this possibility may lead to inappropriate diagnostic or therapeutic intervention. ","483":"The relationship between high oxygen levels and blindness in small preterm infants is common knowledge in today's NI CU. However 60 years ago, tiny babies were routinely given oxygen without knowledge of the relationship between the concentration of oxygen being administered and the subsequent outcome of the infant being blind.1 Today's knowledge is the result of research methods and statistical techniques that identified this relationship and predicted the consequences of high concentrations of oxygen administration.","484":"The incidence of neonatal seizures varies according to gestational age, weight, and cause. Seizures occur in an estimated 1.0-3.5 per 1,000 term infants1 with an increased incidence of 10-130\/1,000 in preterm infants.2 Most neonatal seizures have a specific cause.3 Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy has been identified as the most common etiology associated with neonatal seizures, accounting for 50-60 percent of the cases.4 Table 1 outlines common causes of neonatal seizures. Early recognition of seizures and appropriate treatment is vital in preventing multiorgan dysfunction and permanent brain damage.","485":"One of our roles as nurse educators is to teach best practices related to patient care. However, have you ever stopped to think about what evidence supports your teaching strategies? Just as our patients deserve care that is based on the best available evidence, our learners also deserve education that is based on evidence.1-3 With so many advances in knowledge, technology, and even life itself, it is interesting that education has changed very little over the past 100 years. A study among 946 nurse educators documented that most teach the way they were taught.4 In addition, even after learning new strategies, educators often continue teaching in the manner they are most comfortable. However, this trend is beginning to change. Nurse educators are becoming increasingly aware of and willing to try new and innovative teaching strategies. Educators are also seeking out evidence-based teaching strategies and are becoming more involved in nursing education research.","486":"This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that skin-to-skin contact (SSC) would reduce hepatitis B vaccine injection pain in full-term neonates. Randomized controlled trial (RCT). Thirty-six mother-;neonate dyads were randomly assigned to SSC or control groups. Cry time (CT ), behavioral state (BSt), and heart rate (HR ) were measured throughout the 16-minute protocol. HR and BSt were measured every 30 seconds; CT was recorded continuously. SSC neonates cried less compared with controls (23 vs 32 seconds during injection; 16 vs 72 seconds during recovery), reached calmer BSts sooner (M = 2.8 vs M = 6.5 time points), and trended toward more rapid HR decrease. SSC as described was safe and effective and merits further testing.

Although disorders of trifunctional protein (TFP) complex including long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD) and mitochondrial TFP deficiencies are extremely rare, the combined incidence of mitochondrial fatty acid disorders is quite frequent. With the expansion of newborn screening, what were once considered uncommon disorders are being identified with increasing frequency in asymptomatic infants. The following case scenario presents an infant who developed symptoms prior to the completion of newborn screening. This fairly routine course for a late-preterm infant reveals an extremely rare inborn error of metabolism, LCHAD deficiency. An overview of TFP complex, the differential diagnoses as the case unfolds, diagnostic test results, acute care management, and short-term patient follow-up is presented. With experience, health care providers often become accustomed to and expect to see common things regularly. This case presents a scenario which, as it unfolds, appears to be quite common. It turns out, however, to be very uncommon. ","488":"Neonatal ventilation is an integral component of care delivered in the neonatal unit. The aim of any ventilation strategy is to support the neonate's respiratory system during compromise while limiting any long-term damage to the lungs. Understanding the principles behind neonatal ventilation is essential so that health professionals caring for sick neonates and families have the necessary knowledge to understand best practice. Given the range of existing ventilation modes and parameters available, these require explanation and clarification in the context of current evidence. Many factors can influence clinical decision making on both an individual level and within the wider perspective of neonatal care.

Therefore, the aim of this article is to (a) summarize the extant neonatal bioethical literature to appreciate the complex ethical issues that translate into practice challenges, (b) present a framework that guides the assessment of the benefits and burdens of neonatal intensive care in the clinical setting to solicit and provoke dialogue, and (c) provide examples that advocate for educational training for neonatal healthcare providers in support of ethically sound care to affected families and infants.","503":"Forms of human milk banking and donation have been present for more than a century worldwide, but, since 1985, the Human Milk Banking Association of North America (HM BANA) has established guidelines to make the use of donor's breast milk safe and the second best form of feeding to maternal breast milk for a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) infant. The Indiana Mother's Human Milk Bank provides an extensive and meticulous process of selecting breast milk donors. The process begins with a phone interview with a potential donor and includes the review of the donor's medical records, blood laboratory screening, medication and dietary intake, as well as consent from the donor's pediatrician. The milk bank follows steps of collecting, storing, and receiving the breast milk in accordance with the guidelines of the HM BANA. Pasteurization is the method used to ensure the proper heating and cooling of breast milk. Despite the rigorous pasteurization method, the donor's breast milk will not lose most of the important beneficial components needed for sick or ill NICU infants. Every batch of pasteurized breast milk will be cultured for any possible contamination and shipped to NICUs after it has been cleared by laboratory testing.","504":"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a leading cause of prolonged hospitalizations for premature infants in the United States. In a recent large retrospective study, a significant proportion of NEC cases were shown to occur within 48 hours of packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion, especially in growing preterm neonates of older postnatal age. A small body of evidence consistently demonstrates that 25-35 percent of NEC cases are temporally associated with PRBC transfusion and that cases of NEC associated with transfusion are generally more severe with a higher rate of surgical intervention and mortality. Awareness of this association is vital for potential prevention and early recognition of NEC. The neonatal nurse has a primary role in care strategies that may affect NEC.

Ninety-nine percent of respondents agreed that positioning is important for the well-being of the infant. Sixty-two percent of nurses and 86 percent of therapists identified the Dandle ROO as the ideal method of neonatal positioning. Forty-four percent of nurses and 57 percent of therapists reported that the Dandle ROO is the easiest positioning method to use in the NICU.

We recently cared for two infants who presented with clinical deterioration. An abnormally placed feeding tube seen on the chest radiograph revealed underlying serious conditions. The first case was an infant 29 weeks of age who presented with right-sided pneumothorax after birth. By history and a right-side-displaced orogastric (OG) tube, iatrogenic esophageal perforation was diagnosed. The second case was a 16-day-old infant who presented with recurrent vomiting. An OG tube extending into a cystic mass at the right cardiophrenic angle resulted in diagnosis of a herniated stomach with organoaxial-type volvulus, which required surgical repair.

Neonates are sometimes deprived of this important benefit due to staff anxiety or inexperience. A collaborative approach between perinatal and neonatal team members can effectively introduce the practice as routine in the OB OR and the Level III NICU. Parents are valuable advocates for this essential best practice. Mothers and their offspring benefit both in the short term, as well as long term, when we address the barriers and overcome this clinical challenge.","545":"","546":"","547":"Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is a challenging clinical entity that has often been associated with a number of negative clinical outcomes. The treatment of this condition lacks evidence and is often based on anecdotal beliefs and myths.

This article describes the history of images and video use in the NICU to aid in linking parents and then focuses on the challenges and lessons learned through redesign, installation, and management of a new web-camera system. Technology can support NICU families, and when implemented with input from nurses and families, the process can be a positive experience.","549":"The development of clinical practice guidelines involving multiple health care providers presents a challenge in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Implementation and evaluation of the guideline is as important as the development of the guideline itself. We explored the use of a quality improvement approach in the implementation of a feeding framework. A Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) quality improvement cycle model was used to implement and evaluate a stepwise oral infant feeding guideline with emphasis on parent and care provider satisfaction. Three PDSA cycles were conducted, with each cycle resulting in modifications to use of the framework and development of knowledge translation and parent education techniques and tools. A PDSA cycle approach can be used effectively in guideline implementation and evaluation involving multidisciplinary health care professionals. This is Part II of a two-part series. Part I introduced the concept of quality improvement and tools for advancing practice changes.","550":"To conduct an integrative literature review to studies that focus on the transition of premature infants from neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to home. A literature search was performed in Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CIN AHL), PubMed, and MEDLINE to identify studies consisting on the transition of premature infants from hospital to home life. The search yielded seven articles that emphasized the need for home visits, child and family assessment methods, methods of keeping contact with health care providers, educational and support groups, and described the nurse's role in the transition program. The strategy to ease the transition differed in each article. Home visits by a nurse were a key component by providing education, support, and nursing care. A program therefore should consist of providing parents of premature infants with home visits implemented by a nurse or staying in contact with a nurse (e.g., via videoconference).

Many of these substances can result in varying degrees of drug withdrawal after delivery. Polysubstance use can complicate the clinical evaluation of a newborn both in terms of assessment of withdrawal and treatment of symptoms. For the purpose of this column, the focus is on those infants with in utero narcotic exposure. The primary circumstances under which pregnant women use narcotics are illicit drug abuse, prescribed narcotic maintenance as treatment for abuse, and treatment of chronic pain conditions.","555":"","556":"In this article, we describe a digital photo scrapbooking project as a standard of care for the parents of infants admitted in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Photographs were taken from birth until discharge or expiry at special moments during the infant's hospitalization and used to create a digital scrapbook with daily notes by the parents. The scrapbook and original photos were provided on a CD at discharge or at expiry. Parents and their families unanimously appreciated the photos and the opportunity to record their thoughts, and considered the CDs as a lifetime treasure. Digital photo journaling could be implemented as a standard of care at other institutions with a commitment from the nursing and ancillary staff of the NICU and labor and delivery department, with possible support from volunteers.","557":"Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), which occurs in less than 1 in every 50,000 infants and children, is a rare syndrome first noted in literature by Mellins in 1970. Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome is a condition in which the patient loses the drive to breathe during deep sleep and can mimic many diseases. Until recently, CCHS has largely been a diagnosis of exclusion; fortunately, there is now a genetic test available to confirm the diagnosis. The purpose of this article is to discuss the steps taken to confirm the diagnosis of CCHS. In addition to the history of the disease and clinical manifestations, genetics and prognosis of children with CCHS will be discussed. Two cases are presented for illustration of hospital course and preparation for discharge.","558":"Oral feeding is a complex sensorimotor process that is influenced by many variables, making the introduction and management of oral feeding a challenge for many health care providers. Feeding practice guided by tradition or a trial-and-error approach may be inconsistent and has the potential to delay the progression of oral feeding skills. Oral feeding initiation and management should be based on careful, individualized assessment of the NICU infant and requires an understanding of neonatal physiology and neurodevelopment. The purpose of this article is to help the health care provider with this complex process by (a) defining oral feeding readiness, (b) describing the importance of oral feeding in the NICU and the physiology of feeding, and (c) providing a review of the literature regarding the transition from gavage to oral feeding in the NICU.","559":"Neonatal nurse practitioners (NNPs) have played a significant role in providing medical coverage to many of the country's Level III neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Extensive education and experience are required for a nurse practitioner (NP) to become competent in caring for these critically ill newborns. The NNP can take this competence and experience and expand her role out into the community Level I nurseries. Clinical care of the infants and close communication with parents, pediatricians, and the area tertiary center provide a community service with the goal of keeping parents and babies together in the community hospital without compromising the health of the baby. The NNP service, with 24-hour nursery and delivery coverage, supports an ongoing obstetric service to the community hospital. The NNP's experience enables her to provide a neonatal service that encompasses a multitude of advanced practice nursing roles.","560":"","561":"Magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) has been widely used in the perinatal arena for many decades. It has been used for tocolysis in the U.S. for more than 60 years. Estimations of MgSO4 use for preterm labor (less than 34 weeks of gestation) run as high as 80 percent. Magnesium sulfate is a smooth, skeletal, and cardiac muscle depressant. It is used for preterm labor because of its potential to decrease muscle contractility by interfering with calcium uptake in the cells. Thousands of moms and babies have been exposed to this medication even though tocolysis remains an off-label use, the exact mechanism of action is not completely understood, and there are studies that show that it is ineffective for this indication, and no evidence that it improves perinatal outcomes.1-3 Additionally, it is a high alert medication because of its narrow therapeutic window and the risk of causing an immediate life-threatening condition (acute respiratory failure) if an error in administration occurs.4.","562":"This is the third in a series of columns exploring health information technology (HIT) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The first column provided background information on the implementation of information technology throughout the health care delivery system, as well as the requisite informatics competencies needed for nurses to fully engage in the digital era of health care. The second column focused on information and resources to master basic computer competencies described by the TIGER initiative (Technology Informatics Guiding Education Reform) as learning about computers, computer networks, and the transfer of data.1 This column will provide additional information related to basic computer competencies, focusing on communication and collaboration technologies. Computers and the Internet have transformed the way we communicate and collaborate. Electronic communication is the ability to exchange information through the use of computer equipment and software.2 Broadly defined, any technology that facilitates linking one or more individuals together is a collaborative tool. Collaboration using technology encompasses an extensive range of applications that enable groups of individuals to work together including e-mail, instant messaging (IM ), and several web applications collectively referred to as Web 2.0 technologies. The term Web 2.0 refers to web applications where users interact and collaborate with each other in a collective exchange of ideas generating content in a virtual community. Examples of Web 2.0 technologies include social networking sites, blogs, wikis, video sharing sites, and mashups. Many organizations are developing collaborative strategies and tools for employees to connect and interact using web-based social media technologies.3.","563":"Antimicrobial treatment is a mainstay therapy in the neo-natal intensive care unit (NICU). Given the lack of specificity for clinical symptoms of infection in the newborn and the overwhelming impact of infection with rapid multisystem dissemination, NICU providers tend to treat early while awaiting laboratory results. With the high vulnerability of our special population to a variety of potential infecting microbes, a combination of antibiotics is preferred for initial treatment. The selection of these antibiotics is based on the known or presumed environment of exposure. If the newborn is within a week of birth, we can reasonably expect the likely environment of exposure is the community or the mother. If the newborn is older or has undergone numerous procedures, we can presume the exposure is more likely to be hospital-based.","564":"\"How much does my baby weigh?\" and \"How long is my baby?\" are two of the most frequently asked questions in the delivery room. From that point on, growth is followed closely by parents and primary care providers alike. Anthropomorphic measurements (height\/length, weight, head circumference) are obtained routinely and are compared with standardized references to follow the growth pattern compared with the norm.","565":"The birth of an individual with a blend of both male and female internal or external genitalia is known as an intersex condition. The incidence of genital anomalies is estimated to occur in 1 in 4,500 live births. Each intersex condition is determined by the external genital appearance, internal genital structures, and fertility potential. The main concept involved in the management of intersex is the establishment of an experienced multidisciplinary team. Management of intersex conditions is complex and involves a person's gender identity, gender role behavior, sexual orientation, sexual functioning, and psychological adjustment. This review will outline the management of intersex in the light of the latest research. We focus on diagnosis, surgical techniques, and the psychological aspects that are encountered in the management of intersex.","566":"This article presents an overview of a neonatal intensive care unit along with resuscitative care and management of the 22 to 23 weeks gestational age infant is as it was noted during a visit to the NICU of a large academic center in Japan. Non-English speaking neonatology communities may be at a disadvantage of having their research and practices well known in the English speaking ones. Thus, visits such as this are beneficial in exchanging ideas and practices that may ultimately be mutually beneficial in reducing mortality and morbidity in a specific category of neonates.","567":"Quality improvement (QI) and patient safety are becoming increasingly powerful drivers for health care planning and delivery. In this two-part series, the concept of QI will be introduced and implications for neonatal nursing care will be discussed. Part I reviews trends in the fields of QI and patient safety and introduces how neonatal practitioners are currently taking up QI and patient safety in their practice. Part II, to come, is titled \"Using a Plan-Do-Study-Act Process to Introduce a Step-wise Framework for Establishing Oral Feeds in Premature Infants\" will present the QI process \"in action\" by describing a QI project conducted in a Level III NICU on introducing and testing a new process for improving the transition from tube to oral feeding for preterm infants.","568":"Antibodies to red cell antigens that are found at low frequency in the general population are rare causes of hemolytic disease of the newborn. To understand how to detect these cases, we provide a basic review of routine antenatal maternal antibody testing and report a case of a neonate with severe HDN caused by anti-Wright (anti-Wra), successfully managed with transfusion, phototherapy, and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin. When hemolysis in a newborn is suspected in the absence of major blood group incompatibility or commonly detected maternal red cell antibodies, a direct antiglobulin test should be performed. A positive DAT should alert the clinician to the presence of maternal antibodies against low-incidence antigens. Antibodies to the Wra antigen are one such rare cause of HDN.","569":"","570":"","571":"","572":"","573":"","574":"Infants born with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) often require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Infants on ECMO may experience a long period of being nothing by mouth (NPO) while receiving parenteral nutrition. Once the infant with CDH is repaired and off ECMO, human milk should be used to initiate enteral feedings. Human milk provides immunologic, developmental, and nutritional protection for these highrisk infants and may be crucial in decreasing morbidities commonly associated with post-ECMO survivors. These mother-infant dyads require extensive lactation support to ensure maintenance of milk supply and successful transition to direct breastfeeding. Three case studies are presented as exemplars to demonstrate how breastfeeding success can be achieved even in the most vulnerable infants.","575":"Infants in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit may experience a myriad of painful procedures and stressful experiences. Pain management for infants requiring mechanical ventilation is complex and challenging especially in the preterm population. Many infants may not receive analgesia, primarily due to the unknown long-term neurodevelopmental effects of morphine exposure on the developing brain. Currently, there is no consensus on how to treat pain related to mechanical ventilation due to conflicting scientific evidence lacks clarity and certainty about the role of morphine in pain in preterm infants. The Advance Practice Neonatal Nurse must make the best use of available information about morphine analgesia for the preterm infant, and use it to guide policy and practice for infants. The Advance Practice Neonatal Nurse must use his\/her clinical expertise to judicially balance the risks and benefits of morphine analgesia, when used, and tailor the treatment plan to each infant's specific needs.","576":"The author draws on narratives as an illustration of embodied knowledge and argues for the importance of using embodied knowing to inform ethical decisions in the neonatal setting. Nurses have a unique perspective of the complex care associated with neonatal intensive care (NIC). NIC nurses listen to parent's stories and share their own practice stories, leading to an intimate appreciation of a family's particular response to their health care experience. These narratives can deepen understanding of how nurses go about doing their everyday work, describe experiences in everyday practice, and help the writer come to terms with traumatic events. Moreover, nurses' narratives provide a voice, an expression of their embodied knowledge. By telling and listening to nurses' stories, we can better understand how embodied knowledge supports families in crisis. The narratives in this article are examples of the challenges neonatal nurses face in using embodied knowing to enhance relationships with families. These narratives may help nurses to reflect on their practice and cultivate relationships with families in the NICU.","577":"Hospital emergency management has evolved beyond satisfying regulatory requirements. Although tools and resources have been developed to support hospitals in emergency planning, there appears to be a scarcity of resources to guide hospital departments. To ensure that standards of care are maintained and to minimize the impact on the hospital and\/ or a nursing unit, Good Samaritan Hospital has developed a mobile emergency system and an Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) template to assist other nursing units in their planning efforts. This article focuses on the development of emergency bedside backpacks, mobile disaster boxes, disaster documentation and forms go-kits, and guidelines for creating such a plan. The ongoing equipment testing, inventory rotation, staff training, and exercising response protocols are all crucial to test the effectiveness of the program in place. All these activities require a multidisciplinary approach to ensure integration with hospital-wide emergency planning efforts.","578":"","579":"As part of the 30th Anniversary of Neonatal Network and the 10th Anniversary of the Academy of Neonatal Nursing, an honor wall was created for the national meeting held in September in Washington, DC.

In NAIT , maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG) antiplatelet antibodies cross the placenta, resulting in rapid destruction and removal of fetal platelets by the reticuloendothelial system. Studies have shown that NAIT has an incidence of 1 of 1,000 live births, with a mortality rate of 10-15 percent and the risk of long-term morbidities up to 20-60 percent if intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) occurs. This column will discuss the pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, morbidities, and treatment of NAIT and conclude with a relevant case study.","583":"Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a rare syndrome of dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system characterized by a decreased response to hypercarbia. It is a disorder in which affected individuals fail to breathe during sleep despite progressive hypercapnia and hypoxia. Infants simply fall asleep and quit breathing. They are found by their parents or caregivers blue and lifeless. CCHS is an autosomal dominant disease. It has been linked with tumors of neural crest origin, segmental aganglionosis of the colon, and diffuse autonomic dysregulation but can occur alone. Discovery of the genetic link between the paired-like homeobox 2B (PHOX2B) genetic mutations and CCHS represents a breakthrough in the diagnosis of CCHS, association of mutated alleles with disease severity, and clues to the pathophysiology responsible for the disorder. Early genetic screening and intervention can provide the families of these infants with hope for achieving a normal life.","584":"With the advancement of neonatal medicine during the past several decades, premature and critically ill infants are living past the neonatal period and surviving. The survival of these infants at smaller birth weights and younger gestational ages puts them at an increased risk for intraventricular hemorrhages (IVHs). Although shifts in cerebral perfusion have been linked to the development of these brain bleeds, many seemingly benign care activities have been linked to changes in cerebral blood flow patterns, possibly contributing to IVHs. The purpose of this article is to evaluate the current evidence to determine if the practice of midline positioning for infants born less than 32 weeks gestation for possible IVH prevention is supported by the literature. Many of the researchers involved in these studies attributed the consequential venule leakage of blood to occlusion of the jugular venous drainage system following a turn in the position of the head. Additionally, the articles that examined the connection between the effects of head tilting on brain hemodynamics attributed changes on the infants' potential inability to autoregulate cerebral blood flow adequately. Both of these findings were linked to the development of IVHs. Based on physiologic data and expert opinion, the authors found support in the literature and recommend implementing a plan of care that includes midline head positioning for premature infants.","585":"Baby M was born limp, blue, and without respiratory effort at 38 weeks gestation to a 38-year-old, gravida 5, para 1, woman. Delivery was vaginal after a rapid progression of labor leaving no opportunity for a cesarean section. No other complications were noted during labor but a large surge at delivery, later diagnosed as uterine rupture, initially raised concerns about placental abruption. Apgar scores were 1, 2, and 4 at one, five, and ten minutes, respectively. She was resuscitated in the delivery room, intubated, and transferred in critical condition to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at the birth hospital. Her initial cord pH was 6.7 and was slightly improved at 7.17 on arterial blood gas after resuscitation. Our NICU team was consulted because of her severe neurologic depression. The birth hospital was within walking distance of our tertiary care center and our neurologists went to evaluate her for the hypothermia protocol. Her neurologic exam was notable for dilated and unresponsive pupils, no spontaneous movements, and diminished reflexes and tone, consistent with moderate-to-severe encephalopathy. Seizure activity began at one hour of age and consisted of lip smacking, which was later confirmed by electroencephalogram (EEG). Enrollment criteria were met based on respiratory depression at birth requiring intubation and continued need for ventilation, concern for placental abruption, cord pH less than 7, and encephalopathy on exam and EEG. After stabilizing her airway and achieving central access to treat acidosis and seizures, the team prepared her for transfer to our NICU. At this point, the primary concern became her neurologic status.","586":"","587":"","588":"","589":"","590":"Concept maps are teaching and learning tools that incorporate visual and written representations of related information.

After initial serology testing of the infant, appropriate treatment was commenced. The infant received crystalline penicillin G for a period of ten days in consultation with pediatric infectious disease specialists. As expected, the infant's rapid plasma reagin (RPR) titers declined by three and six months of age. An interdisciplinary approach provided safe and optimal care for this infant.

It involves the loss of genetic material on the short arm of one of the chromosome 22 alleles. Until advanced testing was available, this syndrome was known by various names including DiGeorge syndrome and velo-cardio-facial syndrome. This syndrome has a varied presentation with significant abnormalities including congenital heart disease, hypocalcemia, immunologic deficiencies, learning disabilities, and behavioral problems. A multidisciplinary approach is required to diagnose and manage the varied manifestations.","595":"The skin is a vital organ with key protective functions. Infants in the NICU are at risk for skin injury because of developmental immaturity and intensive care treatments. When skin injury occurs, the neonatal nurse is challenged to provide wound care to optimize functional and cosmetic healing. Optimal wound care requires basic knowledge of the mechanisms of injury, physiology of wound healing, host factors affecting wound healing, and wound assessment. This knowledge provides the basis for determining appropriate wound treatment, including dressing selection. Attention to pain issues associated with wound care is difficult because of the infant's developmental stage, but is essential because of the potentially negative life-long impact of pain. The premature infant's propensity for skin stripping limits the selection of appropriate dressing, as does the paucity of research examining wound care products in this population.","596":"","597":"","598":"","599":"","600":"","601":"","602":"","603":"The role of a pediatric occupational therapist (OT) in the NICU is to provide comprehensive services, including evaluation, treatment, education, decision making, family support, and discharge planning.

During Phase I of the study, the rate of capillary blood draws by the traditional method was determined. At the completion of Phase I, the manufacturer provided in-service training to senior nurses in the NICU with the use of the Innovac Quick-Draw device. Additional in-service training was also provided for the traditional capillary blood draw technique. Within a month of in-service training, an openly randomized study (Phase II) was carried out comparing traditional versus Innovac device capillary blood draws. All infants admitted to the NICU between June 2008 and June 2009 were eligible to be in the study.

Not all of these infants need to be admitted to the NICU. Since 1994, we have had a triage program to care for these infants. We define triage as a temporary (12 hours or fewer) level of care for monitoring, assessment, and intervention. This level of care is more intensive than in the newborn nursery, but the infant does not require an immediate NICU admission.

HIE in the newborn is often the result of a hypoxic event, such as uterine rupture, placental abruption, or cord prolapse. Biphasic brain injury occurs in HIE. The first phase involves activation of the sympathetic nervous system as a compensatory mechanism. The second phase, known as reperfusion brain injury, occurs hours later. Induced hypothermia, a neuroprotective strategy for treating HIE, targets the second phase to prevent reperfusion injury. NICU nurses are in a unique position to detect patient instability and to maintain the therapeutic interventions that contribute to the healing process. This article highlights the significant role nurses play in the management of infants diagnosed with HIE who are treated with induced hypothermia.","635":"There is extensive literature on the physical and physiologic benefits of breastfeeding premature infants.

The acceptance of pain as an inevitable part of NICU hospitalization is part of the culture in many NICUs. This article is intended to encourage discussion of pain prevention in the NICU, with a goal of creating a new \"minimal-pain\" NICU culture. The focus of NICU pain management programs should be on decreasing the number of painful events the NICU patient experiences. Areas for consideration include assessing the performance of procedures by novice versus experienced NICU personnel, reevaluating the role of pediatric residents in the treatment of NICU patients, evaluating the use of umbilical lines and peripherally inserted central catheters to reduce the frequency of peripheral punctures, and evaluating the admission process for ways to reduce neonatal pain and stress.

This article reports a case of cardiac tamponade and right pleural effusion secondary to transudation of hyperosmolar fluid from an appropriately placed umbilical venous catheter. The infant survived as a result of early diagnosis by echocardiography and urgent chest tube placement that drained both pleural and pericardial effusions. Cardiac tamponade should be highly suspected in any neonate with a central venous catheter who develops sudden, unexplained clinical deterioration in cardiopulmonary status even when the line is properly placed, and urgent echocardiography or pericardiocentesis should be considered early in management of such patients. Umbilical venous catheterization should be considered only for a select group of sick neonates due to risks involved with these lines. When an umbilical venous catheter is placed, special precautions should be taken and maintenance guidelines followed.","647":"THIS YEAR WAS THE CENTENNIAL OF FLORENCE Nightingale's death and in commemoration, was designated as the International Year of the Nurse (IYNurse) by The Honor Society of Nursing, Sigma Theta Tau in the U.S., The Nightingale Initiative for Global Health in Canada, and the Florence Nightingale Museum in England. 2010 IYNurse is \"a collaborative, grassroots global initiative honoring nurses' voices, values, and wisdom-to act as catalysts for achieving a healthy world.\" In this \"celebration of commitment,\" we honor Florence Nightingale as the founder of modern nursing and for the legacy she left us and we recognize the contributions of nurses today, all over the world.

Several large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted to explore the use of fluconazole for fungal prophylaxis in premature infants. Despite the findings of these studies, practice varies among units. In a recent survey of members of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), 34 percent of clinicians indicated that they have used antifungal prophylaxis and only 11 percent of clinicians indicated that a written protocol was in place in their NICU. Intravenous (IV) fluconazole (66 percent), oral nystatin (59 percent), and IV amphotericin (21 percent) were the three most commonly used agents among the respondents.1.","651":"This study explored the experiences of NICU nurses in caring for infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). A qualitative research approach was used with open-ended questions employing computer-assisted personal interviews. Fourteen NICU nurses employed in a regional hospital provided responses. The nurses reflected a personal struggle between a desire to employ their technical and critical nursing skills and the need to provide expected maternal care to NAS infants. Other themes included frustration and burnout, challenges to values about parenting, and increased awareness of drug use in the community and at home. The results suggest that nurses underrate the skill required to care for infants with NAS. The level of knowledge, patience, and commitment to these newborns should be reframed to increase job satisfaction, and education should be offered to nurses about women struggling with addictions.

Symptoms of adenovirus infection are similar to those seen with bacterial infections in neonates, making early recognition and diagnosis difficult. Consideration of adenovirus as a causative agent is important to early diagnosis. Currently available culture techniques, particularly the shell vial culture technique, make more rapid identification of adenovirus infection possible. Early identification and treatment are necessary to improve patient outcomes and prevent the spread of infection to other neonates. Available agents for the treatment of adenovirus have had mixed results, yet their use is preferable to nontreatment of critical patients. This article presents the case of a preterm infant who became fatally ill from disseminated adenoviral infection.","653":"Nonimmune hydrops fetalis (NIHF) is a condition in which excess fluid has accumulated in the fetal interstitial spaces as a result of one or more nonimmune factors.

Pain among neonates is often underestimated and untreated, producing untoward consequences. A literature review established strong evidence supporting the use of sucrose as an analgesic for minor procedural pain among neonates. A review of unit practices and nurses' experiential evidence initiated the production of a standardized protocol in our unit at the University of Washington Medical Center NICU in Seattle.Nursing practices surrounding sucrose use differed widely in dose, timing, and patient application.

Traditionally, ventricular punctures of these reservoirs have been performed only by physicians. In the pilot project described in this article, we taught nursing staff to perform punctures of a cerebral ventricular reservoir in neonates with hydrocephalus to give nurses more control in their daily care of these infants.All consecutive punctures performed between August 2006 and March 2007 (n = 302) were studied. The chart was reviewed for the infant's state during the puncture, the caregiver who performed the puncture, and the timeliness of the puncture with respect to schedule and to infant state. During the day shift, there was no significant difference in timeliness, whether the puncture was performed by a physician, a nurse, a physician assistant (PA), or a nurse under the supervision of a physician. On the night shift, punctures were performed on schedule significantly more often when they were carried out by nurses (p&gt;.001). This pilot project demonstrated that nurses can learn to perform cerebrospinal fluid removal from a ventricular reservoir. Because it increased the timeliness with which punctures were performed and gave nurses more control in planning rest periods for these infants, this policy change was judged a success.","661":"Implementation of computer physician order entry (CPOE) demands planning, teamwork, and a steep learning curve. The nurse-driven team at the hospital unit level is pivotal to a successful launch. This article describes the experience of one NICU in planning, building, training, and implementing CPOE. Pitfalls and lessons learned are described. Communication between the nurse team at the unit and the clinical informatics team needs to be ongoing. Self-paced training with realistic practice scenarios and one-on-one \"view then practice\" modules help ease the transition. Many issues are not apparent until after CPOE has been implemented, and it is vital to have a mechanism to fix problems quickly.

Complementary and alternative therapies have been proposed to assist with lactation in NICU mothers. These methods for increasing breast milk supply include herbal galactagogues, kangaroo mothering, and relaxation therapies.A review of the literature was performed using PubMed and CINAHL databases. Twenty-four sources were chosen for inclusion in this article. Search terms included the following: galactagogues, breastfeeding, kangaroo care, and lactation, among others.

The standard treatment for pulmonary immaturity, mechanical ventilation (MV) at birth, can lead to barotrauma, volutrauma, pulmonary edema, infection, and inflammation. To minimize these negative outcomes, multiple treatment strategies have been proposed and evaluated as to their subsequent clinical course. This article compares, contrasts, and integrates the use of MV, nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP), and surfactant administration to encourage and support consideration of their use in the VLBW and ELBW population. Supporting a reduction of the use of MV in favor of NCPAP is safe and recommended because this practice is likely to decrease the probable sequelae of CLDI while permitting an individualized approach.","670":"Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) examinations in the NICU are necessary to protect vision in premature infants, but the examinations are associated with risk and discomfort. ROP examination risks include adverse effects from mydriatic agents, systemic responses to the stress of examination, and nosocomial infection. Infant discomfort may be lessened by limiting examination length and possibly by measures such as topical anesthetic, oral sucrose, and certain nonpharmacologic techniques. A well-organized ROP service facilitates appropriate scheduling of examinations and education of the infant's parents. This article addresses causes of risk and infant discomfort, providing a framework for developing a safe and efficient ROP service while minimizing infant discomfort.","671":"Congenital heart defects are not uncommon among neonatal patients. Although most are benign, the prompt identification of a life-threatening anomaly is essential for rapid intervention and a positive treatment outcome. Cardiac defects may be identified in the newborn nursery with thorough and systematic physical assessment, including inspection, palpation, auscultation, and measurement of blood pressure and oxygen saturations.

The second aim was to determine whether there were differences in decibel levels across the five bays of the NICU, the four quadrants within each bay, and two 12-hour shifts. A repeated measures design was used. Bay, quadrant, and shift were randomly selected for sampling. Staff and visitors were blinded to the location of the sound meter, which was placed in one of five identical wooden boxes and was preset to record for 12 hours. Sound levels were recorded every 60 seconds over 40 12-hour periods, 20 during the day shift and 20 during the night shift. Total hours measured were 480. Data were collected every other day during a three-month period. Covariates of staffing, infant census, infant acuity, and medical equipment were collected. The main outcome variable was sound levels in decibels, with units of measurement of energy equivalent sound level (Leq), peak instantaneous sound pressure level, and maximum sound pressure level during each interval for a total of 480 hours. All sound levels were &gt;45 dB, with average readings ranging from 49.5 to 89.5 dB. The middle bay had the highest levels, with an Leq of 85.74 dB. Quadrants at the back of a bay were louder than quadrants at the front of a bay. The day shift had higher decibel levels than the night shift. Covariates did not differ across bays or shifts.

Low-birth-weight infants with persistent Staphylococcus aureus septicemia, possibly associated with percutaneous central venous catheters, may develop metastatic infections including endocarditis with large vegetations. This article describes a neonate with S. aureus bacteremia that resolved with treatment who died secondary to decreased left ventricular function. At autopsy, organizing microthrombi were seen within both atria, the left ventricle, and the left coronary arterial system. Extensive infarcts were noted throughout the entire myocardium of the left ventricle. It was suspected, but not proven, that the thrombotic sequelae from septicemia caused this neonate's death.","679":"When recognized in the extremely premature infant in the delivery room, ambiguous genitalia is a devastating diagnosis. It can be even more so, if the diagnosis is made several weeks later. The case study reported here illustrates this point. A 24-week Twin B infant born with multiple congenital anomalies was originally thought to be a male. After two weeks, assessment by an astute bedside nurse revealed that the infant's genitalia were not consistent with those of other 24-week males. A complete workup followed. Twin B was indeed a female with ambiguous genitalia and a high cloacal anomaly. Faced with the uncertainty of ambiguous genitalia, many parents feel emptiness, grief, and guilt. This article differentiates among the various intersex disorders and their treatments, and discusses physical findings, embryologic development, incidence, and treatment plans for male pseudohermaphroditism, true hermaphroditism, gonadal dysgenesis, and female pseudohermaphroditism. Current management strategies are contrasted with protocols of the 1950s to show changes over time.","680":"","681":"A late preterm infant is defined as one born between 34 and 36 6\/7 weeks of completed gestation. The rate of late preterm births has risen 18 percent since the late 1990s. Data are beginning to emerge concerning morbidity rates and the risks these newborns face with regard to feeding difficulties, temperature instability, hypoglycemia, and hyperbilirubinemia. Feeding challenges place these vulnerable infants at risk for prolonged hospital stays and readmission after discharge. To better address the unique needs of late preterm infants, providers should establish individual feeding orders. This article offers research-based suggestions for caring for these infants in the newborn nursery and the postpartum unit as well as parent teaching guidelines.","682":"Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are commonly used in NICUs. Although they have many benefits, they also have many potential complications. Confirming catheter tip position is essential to decreasing complications, but the best method to achieve confirmation is unclear. Literature review for studies that address line position confirmation to assist health care providers in evaluating the available research and to identify gaps in the literature. A literature search of four major databases followed by an ancestry approach was performed. Articles reviewed specifically discuss PICC lines and PICC line placement confirmation. Data on confirming PICC placement were lacking. Fluoroscopic placement is ideal, but cannot be done at the bedside and is costly. Supine chest radiograph is the most widely used method and is convenient, but when line tip position is unclear, contrast or ultrasound confirmation can be used. When PICC lines are placed in the saphenous vein, infants may benefit from supine and lateral abdominal radiographs to ensure placement in the inferior vena cava. More studies are needed to generalize findings. PICC line tips should be located in the superior vena cava or inferior vena cava close to the junction with the right atrium (0.5-1 cm outside of the cardiac chambers in premature infants and 1-2 cm outside of the cardiac chambers in larger infants). Arm position is very important when performing radiographs for placement because movement of the arm can cause migration of the catheter. There is also significant inter-observer variability when identifying line tip position. ","683":"Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a persistent and often devastating morbidity associated with premature and low birth weight infants. It continues to be a frequent diagnosis in the neonatal intensive care unit, despite technologic advances and increased knowledge. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has issued practice guideline recommendations for ROP screening and treatment that aid in creating a consistent and reliable ROP protocol. Challenges exist in screening for and treating ROP, including delayed or omitted exams, lack of qualified examiners, lack of parental compliance with follow-up care, and fear of litigation. This article provides a detailed example of a successful ROP program based on the AAP recommendations and utilizing a multidisciplinary approach to ensure optimal ROP care for the preterm infant.

Pulmonary hypertension in neonates is associated with high morbidity and mortality and multiplies the challenge of caring for conjoined twins. BNP is a peptide hormone secreted by cardiac ventricles that have undergone stress related to ventricular filling, volume overload, and pressure. BNP is commonly used in adults to assess heart failure, but its utility is less established in infants receiving neonatal intensive care. In this case, BNP testing was used as an adjunct to standard assessments for rapid diagnosis which was critical to expediting appropriate treatment management for these high-risk patients.","686":"","687":"","688":"","689":"Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CR-BSIs) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the NICU, occurring at rates ranging from 11.3 per 1,000 catheter days in infants &lt;1,000 g to 4 per 1,000 catheter days in infants &gt;2,500 g. Cost-effective and successful educational interventions aimed at nurses have been shown to decrease CR-BSIs with adults, but no such studies address neonatal nurses. This literature review examined how educational interventions could help neonatal nurses reduce infection rates in patients with central venous catheters. Four databases were searched: PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane, and OVID. Of ten studies that measured CR-BSIs before and after educational interventions, nine showed a postintervention reduction in the rate of CR-BSIs of 40 percent or greater (eight demonstrating statistically significant reductions), and the tenth reported a reduction rate of 21 percent. All of the educational programs had additional intervention components, so it is not possible to ascribe all the success to the education, but this review suggests that this topic needs to be studied with the NICU population.","690":"Difficulty with breastfeeding is common, and challenges are particularly pronounced for mothers of ill or preterm infants. This study explores the breastfeeding experiences of mothers of these at-risk infants to determine their breastfeeding patterns and to better understand reasons they prematurely stop breastfeeding and\/or human-milk feeding (HMF). A qualitative, longitudinal, descriptive design was used. The sample consisted of 144 mothers whose preterm or ill infants were cared for in either an NICU or an intermediate care nursery in a large central Canadian city; 112 mothers completed data collection to six weeks after their infants were discharged from the hospital. The main outcome variable was continued breastfeeding or HMF of formerly ill or preterm infants at one and six weeks after their discharge from the hospital. Of infants who were being fed mother's milk when discharged from the hospital, 71 percent continued to receive at least some mother's milk at six weeks after discharge. Mothers reported that their own physical and emotional problems, infant health concerns, and lack of time and support were reasons for discontinuing provision of human milk.

Beginning in the mid-1990s, one Level III NICU began making changes in how feedings were prepared and distributed in an attempt to reduce breast milk errors. Despite these changes, breast milk errors continued to occur, and, in 2005, this NICU introduced a bar coding system to further reduce the risk of administering breast milk to the wrong infant. Breast milk errors have subsequently been substantially reduced.","698":"To assess the effectiveness of an educational intervention aimed at staff and parents in changing breastfeeding practices in the NICU. The breastfeeding education initiative consisted of three parts: breastfeeding training for NICU staff, issuance of complementary breastfeeding materials to mothers of infants in the NICU, and addition of a breastfeeding pathway to the individualized care plan. Infants admitted before and after the initiative were compared to evaluate for changes in breastfeeding practices. The study sample included very low birth weight (VLBW) infants hospitalized in the NICU for more than seven days and born weighing &lt;1,500 g. Infants were grouped based on whether they were admitted before (pre-intervention) or after (post-intervention) implementation of the education initiative. Health care professional (HCP) knowledge of breastfeeding interventions in the NICU was measured using a posttest following training. Breast milk feeding initiation rates, breastfeeding rates, and rates of breast milk feeding at discharge were measured via retrospective chart review among pre- and post-intervention infant groups. The post-intervention group demonstrated significant improvement in rates of breastfeeding (infants being put directly to the breast) in the NICU compared with the pre-intervention group. General positive trends in breast milk feeding initiation (up 11 percent) and breast milk feeding at discharge (up 5 percent) were observed, but these increases failed to reach significance.

We report an infection with the dermatophyte Trichophyton tonsurans, the most common cause of tinea capitis in children but not yet described in a premature baby who has never left the nursery. Our case illustrates the need to consider this diagnosis among the causes of dermatitis in the newborn, especially in at-risk populations such as indigenous Australians. Though our infant's presentation was the classic \"ring\" shape, a literature review revealed varied presentations. In contrast to the usual need for long-term antifungal medication, our case responded rapidly to a topical azole preparation. Although we did not screen visiting family members, screening would have been appropriate, and those found positive might have benefited from at least antifungal shampoo.","700":"The endotracheal tube (ETT) is the most common artificial airway used in NICUs. Suctioning of the ETT is imperative to maintain patency and prevent complications.

A literature search was performed to identify published studies that discuss parental perceptions related to their preparedness for their infant's discharge home from the NICU. Data from the parents' perspective were lacking. There are limitations in the data that are available. Parents are not prepared for discharge and have unanswered questions. Parental perceptions are different from health care professionals' perceptions. The studies that have been done need to be repeated in different centers, with greater sample sizes, and with subjects of different cultures, ethnicities, and socioeconomic status.

This article provides bedside clinicians with foundational information related to acute lung injury and the sequence of events that can ultimately lead to neonatal chronic lung disease and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","710":"Care practices during the first hour of life, the Golden Hour, can have a significant impact on outcomes of low birth weight infants. Although the latest edition of the Neonatal Resuscitation Program added guidelines for preterm infants, additional care is often indicated. Complications that could potentially be impacted by care in the first hour of life include thermoregulation, intraventricular hemorrhage, chronic lung disease, and retinopathy of prematurity. Our unit has implemented and revised a Golden Hour evidence-based care process that includes the use of realistic videotaped simulations, followed by team debriefing sessions. Early results of the revised process show reductions in the targeted complications.","711":"","712":"","713":"","714":"","715":"Premature infants in the NICU are often exposed to continuous loud noise despite research documenting the presence and damaging effects of noise on the preterm infant's development. Excessive auditory stimulation creates negative physiologic responses such as apnea and fluctuations in heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation. Preterm infants exposed to prolonged excessive noise are also at increased risk for hearing loss, abnormal brain and sensory development, and speech and language problems. Reducing noise levels in the NICU can improve the physiologic stability of sick neonates and therefore enlarge the potential for infant brain development. Recommendations include covering incubators with blankets, removing noisy equipment from the incubator environment, implementing a quiet hour, educating staff to raise awareness, and encouraging staff to limit conversation near infants.","716":"The purposes were to relate responses (including unacceptable ones) of twins to shared kangaroo care (KC), to provide explanations for the unexpected responses, and to offer suggestions for safe nursing practice. A descriptive, evaluative case study was conducted. Both twins received KC while their vital signs and maternal breast temperatures were manually recorded every 30 seconds. Descriptive statistics were computed. Identical twins, born to a 19-year-old African-American primigravada, were 34 3\/7 weeks postconceptional age with weights of 1,760 and 1,480 g, respectively, when tested. Preterm labor resulted in spontaneous vaginal birth at 30 weeks gestation. Infant heart and respiratory rates, oxygen saturations, abdominal temperatures, and maternal breast temperatures. Infant A's vital signs exceeded acceptable clinical limits during shared KC; vital signs returned to normal range once Infant A was returned to the incubator. Infant B's vital signs approximated clinically acceptable ranges throughout the session. Breast temperatures did not differ. Individuality mandates vigilant assessment of infant responses to shared KC. ","717":"The neonatal population is at a particularly high risk for catheter-associated bloodstream infections (CABSI). Chlorhexidine for skin antisepsis is well documented to effectively decrease the incidence of bloodstream infections associated with central venous catheters in other populations. The project described in this article demonstrates that chlorhexidine for central venous catheter insertion and line maintenance in the neonatal population safely and effectively reduces CABSI.","718":"The rate of cesarean deliveries by maternal request (CDMRs) is rising in the U.S. This article explains why women choose this type of delivery, notes the risks of CDMR for the infant, and suggests ways neonatal nurses can minimize the risks for well infants, as well as for those who must be admitted to the NICU.","719":"","720":"These articles review the physiologic adaptations occurring during the transition from fetal to neonatal life and examine common red flags which may alert care providers to an infant experiencing delayed transition or an underlying disease process, congenital abnormality, or birth injury.","721":"","722":"","723":"","724":"","725":"","726":"","727":"Coarctation is a constriction or narrowing of the aorta and presents most commonly within the first two weeks of life. This article reviews a case study of an infant diagnosed with coarctation of the aorta on day 8 of life. It includes an overview of the etiology, clinical presentation, and management plus an account of the infant's transport to a regional pediatric intensive care unit (PICU).","728":"Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) results from the abnormal growth of blood vessels in the vascular bed supporting the developing retina. Estimated to cause up to 500 new cases of blindness in the U.S. each year, ROP affects primarily infants born at less than 1,500 g. Although its etiology is not well understood, ROP is thought to occur as a result of a complex interaction between oxygen and vascular growth factors. This article briefly reviews the history of ROP, discusses its pathophysiology, and addresses the risk factors and strategies for prevention.","729":"This article presents the physiologic rationale for dressing infants in the NICU. It reports interview responses from mothers and nurses on their feelings about one infant dressing program, proposes a care plan, discusses the advantages and disadvantages of infant dressing, and suggests ideas for related research. The goals of the program described here are to provide preterm and\/or sick infants with increased insulation to improve thermoregulation, personalize and normalize care, promote developmentally appropriate care, promote discharge planning, and support all families equally, regardless of socioeconomic status.","730":"There is a need in the NICU for an end-of-life care guideline that nurses can follow when working with dying infants and their families. Maintaining intravenous access to relieve the infant's pain, communicating sensitively to the family, and creating precious, everlasting memories are goals that should be part of every dying infant's care. The nurse's ability to partner with the family in caring for the infant is integral to helping the family take the first steps in their grief journey. Evidence-based literature provides NICU nurses with the knowledge that they are the facilitators of end-of-life care for dying infants. New mothers and fathers are not aware of the caring parental tasks they can perform for their dying baby. They look to and depend on their infant's nurses to encourage them. The guideline included here provides nurses with a tool for ensuring that families have the opportunity to create memories that will not only help them with their immediate pain, but also comfort them for a lifetime.","731":"","732":"","733":"","734":"","735":"Intestinal lymphangiectasia (IL) is a potentially fatal disorder of the lymphatic system if it is not recognized and proper treatment initiated. The disease is characterized by lymphocytopenia, peripheral edema, and hypoalbuminemia. Because IL is a rare disease, the symptoms, diagnostic workup, and treatment are unfamiliar to many clinicians. Current literature documents only a few reported cases of IL in a preterm infant. This case report of a preterm infant reviews history, symptomatology, and the diagnostic workup performed. The steps in making the diagnosis, the treatment, and the prognosis of this condition are also presented.","736":"Improved technology and management approaches that have reduced bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have decreased mortality and morbidity in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants. Early extubation to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) decreases the complications associated with long-term oral\/nasal endotracheal intubation, including BPD, ventilator-associated pneumonia, volutrauma, subglottic stenosis, oral palatal grooves, and nasal septum erosion. Research and anecdotal evidence have shown that iatrogenic injuries to the nose also occur with extended time on NCPAP. Research observing associations between the patient interface and nasal injury has shown duration of therapy to be the most significant risk factor. Immature skin and developing nasal structures place ELBW infants at increased risk for injury. The challenge for NICU caregivers is maintaining the ELBW infant on NCPAP for extended periods without nasal injury. Appropriate protocols, practice guidelines, and staff education can decrease these injuries.","737":"Health care providers' opinions can influence how parents place their infant to sleep. Neonatal nurses can improve how they teach and model safe infant sleep practices to parents. To increase neonatal nurses' knowledge, a sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) prevention program was implemented. Program components included a computerized teaching tool, a crib card, sleep sacks, and discharge instructions. Initial program evaluation showed that 98 percent of infants slept supine and 93 percent slept in sleep sacks in open cribs. However, nurses continued to swaddle some infants with blankets to improve thermoregulation. To increase nursing compliance in modeling safe infant sleep practices, Halo SleepSack Swaddles were provided for nurses to use in place of a blanket to regulate infant temperature. Recent data show that 100 percent of infants in open cribs are now sleeping supine wearing a Halo Swaddle or a traditional Halo SleepSack. This model program can easily be replicated to enhance neonatal nurses' knowledge about SIDS prevention.","738":"","739":"","740":"","741":"","742":"Nurse leaders in NICUs need to make improving crucial conversations one of their top priorities. AACN points out that sustainable change in challenging interpersonal communication will take the combined commitment of nurses and of medical and business leaders of health care organizations. No matter how good a strategy is, execution is the key to success. Empowering health care team members to use the two-challenge rule, CUS, or both will foster patient safety. A by-product of that success will be greater work environment satisfaction for health care team members.","743":"","744":"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common gastrointestinal emergency in the NICU, with often devastating consequences. The etiology of NEC is probably multifactorial, with preterm infants at the highest risk. The relationship between feeding and NEC was identified in the 1970s, leading to delayed feeding becoming standard treatment in NICUs. More recent research suggests that early feedings not only are safe, but reduce other morbidities associated with prematurity. Standardized feeding guidelines seem to confer some benefits in decreasing NEC, despite a wide variability in feeding practices within the published guidelines. A standardized approach to the management of feeding problems may be the key. This article briefly reviews the pathogenesis of NEC and examines studies of various feeding practices for their relationship to the development of NEC. It also highlights the potential benefits of breast milk in NEC prevention.","745":"Improvements in neuroimaging technology and techniques have contributed to the increased recognition of cerebellar hemorrhage (CBH) in the prererm infant. Studies have indicated that the extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infant (&lt; 1,000 g) is at highest risk for this injury. Associated risk factors include a constellation of antenaral, intrapartum, and neonatal factors, with immaturity, fetal distress, and cardiorespiratory instability in the early neonatal course as significant contributors. The long-term impact of CBH for the ELBW infant is not fully understood, but recent reports suggest that, in addition to motor impairments, deficits in cognitive, language, and social-behavioral function are also apparent. This article reviews the current state of knowledge of cerebellar development, risk factors for injury, and long-term developmental consequences of injury. Implications for nursing practice, education, and research are discussed.","746":"Caring for the premature infant in the NICU requires knowledge and understanding of the physiologic adaptation to extrauterine life and how prematurity affects that transition. Nurses play an integral role in managing fluid and electrolyte balance in these infants. This article addresses postnatal adaptation and all aspects of fluid and electrolyte management of the preterm infant.","747":"Breast milk has been shown to contribute significantly to positive neurodevelopmental and medical outcomes in the extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infant population. It is crucial that ELBW infants receive their mother's colostrum as a first feeding, followed by expressed breast milk for as long as possible. Evidence-based literature supports the difficult challenges both mothers and ELBW infants face if they are to succeed at breast pumping and breastfeeding. Influencing factors include the medical fragility of the infant, limited frequency and duration of kangaroo care between mother and infant, lack of an adequate volume of breast milk, as well as inconsistent or incorrect information surrounding the use of breast milk and breastfeeding. A feeding care map as described in this article can help the bedside nurse assist the mother-ELBW infant dyad in optimizing breast milk volumes, laying the groundwork for breastfeeding. Displaying supportive practices and preterm infant developmental milestones, the map categorizes infant, maternal, and dyad feeding issues along a progressive time line from admission to discharge.","748":"","749":"","750":"","751":"","752":"","753":"Continuously monitoring brain ftinction at the bedside in the NICU for term infants at risk of brain injury has become part of routine clinical practice in many countries. These monitors offer invaluable information about the sick infant's neurologic status by providing real-time measurements of the brain's electrical activity and identifring or confirming seizure activity. With the increasing availability of bedside electroencephalogram technology, it is essential for neonatal intensive care nursing staff to understand the rationale for its use, as well as the fundamentals of application and interpretation of this new technology.","754":"Although there is general agreement that noise in the neonatal intensive care unit should be reduced, there is controversy about the use of music as a developmental care strategy with prererm infants. Much literature supports using music with preterm infants, indicating that it enhances physiologic and neurobehavioral functioning, but some experts worry that music is overstimulating. This article presents evidence supporting the use of music with preterm infants as well as criticism of same. Recommendations for music interventions with preterm infants are discussed, although fUrther research is needed before specific guidelines can he established.","755":"Dolichocephaly, narrow width and long anterior-posterior cranial distance, is more commonly seen in preterm than in term infants. It seems to persist after NJCU discharge and may be a marker for adverse neurodevelopment. This article reports a case of cranial molding in one extremely low birth weight infant. He was placed on a viscoelastic mattress and a twice weekly developmental care program. Cranial molding was measured using the cranial index (CI), a ratio of width to length. Initially, the patient presented with dolichocephaly (CI=72 percent). y week 2, CI measurements approached normal limits (CI=75 percent). When placed on continuous positive airway pressure, the infant presented with substantial dolichocephaly (CI=66.7 percent). Following position changes to midline, CI measurements continued to improve and remained within normal limits until discharge. This dual-element program was feasible, acceptable to parents and staff and may be effective for identifying and managing dolichocephaly.","756":"Redesign of a neonatal intensive care unit is a major budget undertaking, demanding accountability for its equipment and feasibility of design. It must be philosophically based and driven by research supporting best practice. The NJCU at the Magee-Womens Hospital of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, a Level III, 74-bed unit, has made the change from a ward design to an individual-room design suitable for family-centered, developmentally supportive care. This article presents the design process as it occurred. Unique to this process are the involvement of NJCU-graduate families and the use of transition teams. Guidelines and recommendations are offered to others interested in designing and practicing in an individual-room NJCU. Outcome data demonstrate staff adjustment to the new design and practice model. A comparison of this NICU design is made with the Recommended Standards for Newborn ICU Design.","757":"","758":"","759":"","760":"Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) continue to be necessary in neonatal care. They benefit many premature infants and those needing long-term intravenous access. An experienced inserter, early recognition of PICC candidates, early PICC placement, knowledge of anatomy, and correct choice of vein all increase placement success. As with any invasive procedure, there are risks. These include pain, difficulty advancing the catheter, damage to vessels, catheter malposition, and bleeding. Utilizing assessment skills, following the product manufacturer's instructions, and carefully placing the catheter should minimize most of these risks. Additional risks include postinsertion complications such as occlusions, thrombosis, catheter failure, infection, and catheter malposition. Proper nursing care--which includes controlling infection, properly securing the catheter, and changing the dressing as needed--is key to preventing complications and maintaining the PICC until treatment has been completed.","761":"Femininity is often associated with the nursing profession, but is not one of its defining characteristics. Men have been providing care to the sick and injured for many centuries, and they continue to do so for many reasons. Male nurses display a wide range of caring practices, which may not always be interpreted as such by their female counterparts. This article presents the male perspective and approach to caring, including the unique relationship that male nurses can have with fathers in the NICU.","762":"Critical thinking is the hallmark of today's nursing practice environment. Nowhere is this more critical than in the high-tech environment of the NICU. Despite the importance of critical thinking in nursing practice, there is limited information on the process of teaching new NICU nurses to think critically. Based on the principles of adult education, orientation and continuing education for NICU nurses should be goal directed, build on the learner's prior experience, and build in opportunities for active participation, reflection, and experiential learning. This article reviews the principles of adult education and their application to the process of teaching critical thinking in the NICU. One unit's experience of critical thinking education is used to provide concrete examples of how NICU education can be transformed from a traditional didactic methodology to a more dynamic experiential approach.","763":"To examine whether a relationship exists between a neonate's weight and the neonate's receipt of comfort medication between four hours prior to elective ventilator withdrawal and death. It was hypothesized that the greater the neonate's weight, the more likely the neonate was to receive comfort medication at end of life. A retrospective chart review. One hundred seventy-one neonates in a midwestern Level III NICU who died after withdrawal of ventilatory support. Of the 171 neonates in the sample, 27.5 percent (n = 47) did not receive comfort medication within the designated time frame; neonates who weighed &lt; 800 g were significantly less likely to receive comfort medication than were their heavier cohorts. In this sample, smaller neonates were given comfort medication less often while they were dying than were their larger counterparts. ","764":"","765":"Sacrococcygeal teratomas (SCTs) are the most common germinal cell neoplasms of the fetus and neonate. They originate during embryonic development when the primitive streak fails to differentiate among mesodermal, ectodermal, and endodermal tissues in the embryonic disc. This article discusses the fetal pathophysiology of SCTs and the impact of the condition on the newborn. Fetal SCTs can have life-threatening physiologic effects--such as premature labor, dystocia, and high-output cardiac failure--if not managed appropriately. Clinical manifestations, prenatal diagnosis, therapeutic approaches and treatment options for the fetus and newborn, and current research related to SCTs are addressed to aid practitioners caring for a fetus or infant diagnosed with an SCT.","766":"Extrauterine growth restriction (EUGR) is a common condition in very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants (&lt; or = 1,500 g). Most affected infants have a birth weight that is average for gestational age, but by the time of hospital discharge have a weight that is less than the tenth percentile for corrected gestational age. EUGR is the most frequent morbidity among VLBW survivors at their time of discharge from the hospital. Studies to elucidate the causes of EUGR have been inconclusive. Recent research has found an association between EUGR, developmental outcomes, and long-term morbidity. Low birth weight has also been associated with chronic diseases later in life. These findings emphasize the critical nature of understanding the phenomenon of EUGR and ways it can be prevented.","767":"Research over several decades describes various adverse health effects of noise on the hospitalized neonate. Noise is a direct cause of long-lasting auditory problems and a significant cause of cardiovascular and respiratory problems and neurologic impairment. Many hospitals have turned the NICU into a quiet environment that promotes the neonate's health and well-being. But auditory pathways continue to develop during the neonatal period, reaching maturation at 12 months and beyond. Some of this development thus occurs after the neonate is discharged from the hospital. It is a responsibility of NICU professionals to teach families about the health benefits of noise modulation and planned quiet in the home environment. This teaching may make a world of difference to the continued healthy growth, development, and well-being of the infant.","768":"Perinatal drug exposure costs our communities millions of dollars each year in hospital fees and in services such as foster care, child protection, and drug treatment. Infants and their families in this group require substantial long-term health care and community resources. Neonatal health care providers should take an active role in developing and implementing home visitation programs to support early hospital discharge and continuity of care for these high-risk infants and their families. Neonatal nurse practitioners should prepare in the future to practice not only in secondary-- and tertiary--level neonatal centers, but also in follow-up clinics, long-term developmental centers, and the community This article describes a home intervention program delivered by neonatal nurse practitioners for high-risk infants and their mothers. The target population is infants exposed prenatally to drugs and\/or alcohol.","769":"To determine the effects of kangaroo care (KC) (skin-to-skin contact) on breastfeeding status in mother-preterm infant dyads from postpartum through 18 months. Randomized, controlled trial. The control group received standard nursery care; in the intervention group, unlimited KC was encouraged. A subsample of 66 mothers and their preterm infants (32-36 completed weeks gestation, 1,300-3,000 g, 5 minute Apgar &gt; or = 6) who intended to breastfeed. Breastfeeding status at hospital discharge and at 1.5, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months as measured by the Index of Breastfeeding Status. KC dyads, compared to control dyads, breastfed significantly longer (5.08 months vs 2.05 months), p = .003. KC dyads also breastfed more exclusively at each measurement, p = .047. More KC dyads than control dyads breastfed at full exclusivity (100 percent breast milk, index of breastfeeding status levels 1 or 2) at discharge and at 1.5, 3, and 6 months. Mean KC contact per day was 4.47 hours. ","770":"","771":"Nurses will work in a unit and choose to stay because they feel pride in their work and are respected. Eliminating horizontal hostility at the unit level begins with a commitment from the NICU's leadership. Establishing and maintaining an environment of civility is essential if the unit is to successfully recruit and maintain the best staff to care for the patients entrusted to it.","772":"","773":"","774":"This article is an exploratory effort meant to solicit and provoke dialog. Conscientious objection is proposed as a potential response to the moral distress experienced by neonatal nurses. The most commonly reported cause of distress for all nurses is following orders to support patients at the end of their lives with advanced technology when palliative or comfort care would be more humane. Nurses report that they feel they are harming patients or causing suffering when they could be comforting instead. We examined the literature on moral distress, futility, and the concept of conscientious objection from the perspective of the nurse's potential response to performing advanced technologic interventions for the dying patient. We created a small pilot study to engage in clinical verification of the use of our concept of conscientious objection. Data from 66 neonatal intensive care and pediatric intensive care unit nurses who responded in a one-month period are reported here. Interest in conscientious objection to care that causes harm or suffering was very high. This article reports the analysis of conscientious objection use in neonatal care.","775":"Over the past century, improvements in technology and neonatal care techniques have dramatically reduced infant mortality rates. While this progress continues, a growing body of literature supports the significant role that parents play in the development of infants, particularly within the hospital setting. Throughout much of the twentieth century, various barriers prevented many parents from participating in thc care of their neonates, negatively influencing infant outcomes. Today parental involvement in neonatal carc has become a key part of a larger family-centered care model. This historical review describes how past neonatal care practices affected the roles of parents, from absence or indirect involvemcnt to the important involved roles of today. Understanding current trends in relation to these past experiences may encourage the formulation of family-centered care practices now and in the friture.","776":"Meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) is one of the most common conditions associated with aspiration during the newborn period. MAS can be defined as respiratory distress in a neonate born through meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAE) with symptoms that cannot otherwise be explained. It can be characterized by early onset of respiratory distress in term and near-term infants delivered through MSAE. Early presentation includes respiratory symptoms such as respiratory distress, poor lung compliance, hypoxemia, and radiographic findings of hyperinflation and patchy opacifications. This article discusses the pathophysiologv of MAS, historical and current prevention strategies, current management strategies, and prognoses for infants born through MSAE.","777":"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality for low birth weight premature infants. Prematurity, ischemia, formula feeding, and bacterial colonization are risk factors for the self-perpetuating cycle of damaged intestinal epithelia, inflammation, bacterial entry, sepsis, and shock that characterizes NEC. Probiotics are food supplements containing live bacteria that benefit the recipient by improving the microflora balance within the intestine. Several studies suggest that the administration of probiotics may have a prophylactic effect for NEC and may reduce morbidity and mortality rates for low birth weight infants.","778":"","779":"","780":"Trisomy 18 is a devastating genetic disorder that can be characterized by multiple congenital anomalies. Some of these anomalies have no medical significance, but merely provide clues to suggest the diagnosis. The most common form of trisomy 18 is the nondisjunction type, which affects every cell of the body with an extra chromosome 18. Mfected infants are typically born with a prominent occiput, short eye fissures with droopy eyelids, micrognathia, external ear variations, clenched fist with index finger overlapping the third finger and fifth finger overlapping the fourth, small fingernails and toenails, underdeveloped or altered thumbs, \"rocker-bottom\" feet, and redundant skin at the back of the neck. Congenital heart defects are common. The mortality rate among infants with trisomy 18 is high as a result of cardiac and renal malformations, feeding difficulties, sepsis, and central apnea caused by central nervous system defects. A case study is provided.","781":"Neonatal health care providers are fortunate that the umbilical cord generally provides easy intravenous (IV) access for newborn patients. Outside of the immediate newborn period, however, it may be impossible to obtain peripheral or umbilical IV access in critically ill newborns. Intraosseous (IO) infusion is not widely used in the neonatal population, but is a viable option when IV access cannot be established quickly. This article examines IO infusion devices and placement sites and addresses assessment and care of the infant receiving IO fluids and medications.","782":"To describe the effect of nursing caregiving on infant sleep-wake states by gender in preterm infants. Descriptive measures at 34 weeks postmenstrual age and at discharge. Twenty-two hospitalized preterm infants. Infant state and caregiving episodes were coded in 15-second intervals from video recordings of approximately three hours duration. Time plots of state and caregiving were analyzed visually to summarize spontaneous state changes and state change associated with caregiving. Sleep and wake state distribution did not differ statistically by gender; however, the rate of state change in male infants was twice that of females (p=.012) at discharge. At discharge, male infants received approximately twice as many care episodes as females. At discharge, the rate of state change in response to caregiving in male infants was four times that of female infants (p=.026). Males exhibited a greater percentage of caregiving episodes related to state change than did females at discharge (p=.018). Findings suggest further exploration of possible gender differences in state regulation and state change in response to caregiving. ","783":"Breast milk provides physiologic and neurodevelopmental protection for premature infants. Most hospitals are breast-milk friendly, but the number of premature infants breastfeeding successfully at discharge is relatively small. There are evidence-based techniques to improve the odds of premature infants breastfeeding at discharge and into the first year of life. Measures that help the infant make the transition to the breast include kangaroo care, nonnutritive sucking, avoidance of bottles, and consistent and supportive staff. A guide to management of the transition process is provided in this article.","784":"","785":"As the incidence of late preterm births continues to rise, health care providers need to be aware of this population's unique needs. This review focuses on the additional risks late preterm infants encounter related to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and the importance of breastfeeding support and follow-up. Additional, population-based studies concentrating on the late preterm infant are needed to determine more clearly the incidence of hyperbilirubinemia, with specific levels documented; incidence of ED visits and rehospitalizations related to hyperbilirubinemia; and incidence of bilirubin neurotoxicity with both short- and long-term follow-up. It is also important to study these outcomes in relation to the nature and degree of risk associated with early discharge, insufficient follow-up, and breastfeeding. Future research is needed to develop evidence-based recommendations for optimal discharge timing, counseling, and postdischarge follow-up of late preterm infants, particularly those who are breastfed, to promote safe patient care.","786":"Tissue extravasation resulting from intravenous (IV) infiltration can occur as a complication of neonatal intensive care with varying degrees of morbidity. Serious extravasation can result in pain, infection, disfigurement, prolonged hospitalization, increased hospital costs, and possible litigation. Although most infiltrates resolve spontaneously after the IV catheter is removed, IV extravasations and tissue sloughing do occur in NICU patients. Specific therapies are based on assessment of the degree of the injury. The goal in managing tissue damage after IV extravasation is to improve tissue perfusion and prevent progression of tissue necrosis. This article presents an initial approach to nursing care for peripheral IV infiltrations to guide clinicians in management of this complication. The approach is based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, and reports from expert committees.","787":"Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is the cessation of normal eye development and subsequent abnormal vessel growth that occurs exclusively in premature infants. ROP was first discovered in the 1940s and was for two decades the leading cause of blindness in children. Currently, the disease causes about 500 new cases of blindness per year. The severity of the disease increases with decreasing gestational age. The pathogenesis of ROP involves disruption of normal retinal vascularization. Vessel endothelial growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, and oxygen play important roles in its development. ROP is classified using an international classification system that provides direction for screening and treatment of premature infants. Examinations are performed by ophthalmologists, who identify the scope of vascularization, the degree of abnormal vessel growth, and the amount of the eye that is affected. Treatment modalities include cryosurgery and laser photocoagulation. Long-term outcomes include both structural and functional vision problems.","788":"To explore the influence of poverty on the parenting experience and maternal developmental trajectory of Lumbee mothers with medically fragile infants. A multiple-case study design using secondary data from a larger longitudinal study of parental role attainment with medically fragile infants. Five cases involving mothers who were Lumbee Indians and who had medically fragile infants. The key features of the mothers' talk about their parenting experiences were organized into categories that fit into five inductively derived themes related to poverty. Health care professionals need to be aware of how the context of living in poverty affects mothers of high-risk infants who are hospitalized in tertiary care units. In particular, low-income mothers, especially American Indians living in high-poverty areas, urgently need improved community resources such as access to birth control; early prenatal care; programs to help reduce drug, alcohol, and tobacco use both during and following pregnancy; and follow-up health and developmental services for their infants. ","789":"","790":"","791":"So much is unknown about SIP-its etiology, pathophysiology, best treatment modality, and outcome. Yet the incidence of SIP is increasing as more VLBW infants are surviving and since SIP has been identified as a separate disease from NEC. Because many cases present with an insidious onset, it is imperative that practitioners review all x-rays with SIP in mind. Although SIP is a relatively rare occurrence in the NICU, its potential to increase morbidity and mortality in premature infants warrants further research to improve outcomes.","792":"","793":"To examine parents' and health care providers' perceptions of back transport from a tertiary care neonatal intensive care unit to a community hospital. Qualitative, hypothesis-generating, cross-sectional study utilizing focus group methodology. Participants included 12 parents of back-transported infants insured by Medicaid, 6 regional NICU health care providers, and 17 community hospital special care nursery health care providers. Participant perceptions of factors that support or impede successful back transport. Data from the focus groups were analyzed to identify five main themes: early communication about back transport, preparing parents for back transport, communication between hospitals at the time of back transport, follow-up and information exchange after back transport, and improving the back-transport experience for parents. ","794":"Over the past 20 years, corticosteroid use in the preterm infant has fallen in and out offavor. Steroids were introduced in the 1980s as a mode of preventing and treating chronic lung disease (CLD) in the preterm infant population. This use has been targeted toward low birth weight infants who are unable to wean off the ventilator. Dose, duration, and timing of treatment with dexamerhasone, the steroid typically used in NICUs, has varied. This article examines why the medication has fallen out of favor and whether postnatal corticosteroids still have a place in preventing and treating CLD.","795":"News that a woman with diabetes is about to deliver brings up images of a macrosomic infant. This infant may experience birth injuries, asphyxia, respiratory distress, hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, hyperbilirubinemia, polycvthemia\/hyperviscosity syndrome, asymmetric sepral hypertrophy, and other congenital malformations. Uncontrolled diabetes has profound effects on embryogenesis, organogenesis, and fetal and neonatal growth, and evidence increasingly indicates that some of these effects are lifelong and may contribute to adult obesity. Preconception control of diabetes and monitoring throughout pregnancy are important in reducing the impact of diabetes on the fetus and newborn.","796":"Caput succedaneum and cephalohematoma are conditions that rarely evoke much concern in the NICU but deserve more attention.

One critical strategy is to retain the talent and experience base of the older nurse. The replacement of experienced nurses is very costly to the unit and negatively impacts quality of care, patient safety, productivity, and unit cohesion. Older nurses can, do, and will make choices about where they work. Organizations have a responsibility to respond to their needs and align strategies aimed at their retention. Understanding the needs of older nurses will enable managers to better retain the staff they lead.","800":"Screening for thyroid hormone levels in the first week of life is extremely important to identify infants with CH. Worldwide neonatal screening programs have been successful in decreasing childhood mental retardation related to CH by early detection and treatment. To successfully screen for CH, nurses must understand how to draw blood that will yield valid results on the metabolic screening filter paper. It is also important for the nurse to understand that thyroid levels are normally decreased in preterm infants and that regular follow-up of those low thyroid levels is crucial because levels may return to normal and eventual treatment is necessary. Early follow-up testing and treatment are essential. A thyroid scan or ultrasonography is optional and decided on by evaluating the risk-benefit ratio.","801":"Honey has been shown to have antibacterial activity against a variety of species of bacteria in vitro. Although the evidence regarding the use of honey for wound treatment in neonates and infants is interesting, it is not strong. The sample sizes in the cited clinical studies are small; there were no comparison groups and no randomization. It appears that honey may be safe and useful in treating difficult-to-heal infected wounds, but double-blinded randomized controlled clinical trials with sufficient power are needed to determine the efficacy of honey in both initial wound management and secondary treatment of infected and poorly healing wounds. A comparison of different types of honey would be an important component of these trials. Currently, there is not enough evidence to recommend one type of honey over another type; however, honey and wound care experts do recommend honey for wound care, not for consumption.","802":"","803":"The fetal-origins-of-adult-disease hypothesis describes an adaptive phenomenon of in utero reprogramming of the undernourished fetus that predisposes the infant to increased morbidity as an adult. Studies have identified a positive association between indicators of fetal undernutrition such as low birth weight and chronic adult diseases like hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and coronary artery disease. Current research is focusing on determining other factors that may contribute to these chronic adult diseases.","804":"Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (ARA) are two long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) found naturally in human milk. DHA and ARA have been receiving increased attention from health care professionals and the public. Research suggests that DHA intake and status have a significant impact on visual and cognitive development in breastfed infants. For formula-fed infants, studies have shown mixed results from DHA or DHA plus ARA supplementation. There are several important differences among LCPUFA studies with term infants that may contribute to the differing results, including levels of LCPUFA added to the formula, variations in test methods, ages of infants evaluated, and sources of LCPUFA. Nevertheless, several expert groups recommend that infant formulas be supplemented with DHA and ARA. Recommendations for term infants for DHA and ARA range from 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent and from 0.35 percent to 0.7 percent of the fatty acids, respectively.","805":"Subgaleal hemorrhages, although infrequent in the past, are becoming more common with the increased use of vacuum extraction. Bleeding into the large subgaleal space can quickly lead to hypovolemic shock, which can be fatal. Understanding of anatomy, pathophysiology, risk factors, differential diagnosis, and management will assist in early recognition and care of the infant with a subgaleal hemorrhage.","806":"To evaluate the effect of changes in the NICU environment on sound levels. A prospective quasi-experimental design evaluated sound levels in a 43-bed NICU. Decibel levels were monitored utilizing a data-logging dosimeter for 24 hours weekly over 12 months. Sound levels were also measured inside four different incubator models. Forty-four 24-hour decibel recordings were obtained in one of eight randomly selected four-bed pods. In addition, a single 1-hour recording was obtained in four different models of vacant incubators. Ambient sound levels. Decibel levels were analyzed to identify changes in noise levels following alterations in the NICU environment. Installation of motion-sensing motorized paper towel holders significantly increased levels at beds closest to the towel dispensers, as did thetrial of a new communication system. Decibel levels in four different incubators revealed varying noise levels. This study suggests that all environmental changes must be monitored to ensure that they reduce rather than increase noise levels.

This article reports on the experiences of the Intermountain Health Care Life Flight Program in selecting a high frequency ventilator and preparing the transport team members for its use. Once the use of the Duotron ventilator was initiated, pre- and posttransport data were collected for the first 134 neonates requiring HFV on transport. Analysis of the data determined that 96 percent of the infants were successftslly transported using the Duotron ventilator. Inspired oxygen requirements staved the same or improved in the majority of intubated patients for whom comparison data xvere available. Ventilation and acid-base balance improved. Although HFV has been a common therapy in neonatal care for some time, its adoption for use during transport required modification and considerable education for transport team members.","811":"Breast milk is the optimal source of nutrition for infants. According to research, neonates fed breast milk have a reduced risk of sepsis, increased feeding tolerance, a decreased incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis, and better neurodevelopmental outcomes. Unfortunately, researchers have not identified practices to reduce or eliminate the risk for errors in breast milk administration. This article discusses the potential hazards of incorrect administration of breast milk. It then describes how the tertiary care center at Children's Hospital of Illinois implemented a policy utilizing six sigma quality improvement methodologies to improve breast milk administration. Since implementation of this policy, the NICU at our hospital has reduced the risk of breast milk administration errors to less than 3.4 mistakes per million opportunities.","812":"To determine whether the S.T.A.B.L.E. Program increases health care providers' confidence and clinical abilities in pretransport stabilization and to assess the care of transported neonates before and after S.T.A.B.L.E. Program education. A descriptive design was used to evaluate health care providers ' confidence about pretransport stabilization and to assess infant outcomes before and after S.T.A.B.L.E. education. Sixty-four participants in the S.T.A.B.L.E. Program in Nova Scotia participated in this study over a 13-month period. Thestudy evaluated the charts of all neonates transported tothe IWK Health Centre over two one-year periods, before and after the S.T.A.B.L.E. Program. Perceived confidence and incorporation of S.T.A.B.L.E. Program principles among regional health care provide:rs and neonatal stability at time of transfer were measured. Ninety-six percent of participants indicated that the course was relevant and useful. Ninety percent indicated that they felt more confident about their ability to provide neonatal pretransport stabilization, and 86.5 percent reported adoptionof the S.T.A.B.L.E. Program principles into their practice. There were no differences in infant outcomes between the pre- and post-S.T.A.B.L.E. time periods.

Yet there is an urgent need to define and provide excellence in end-of-life care for infants and their families. Beneficent end-of-life care for the dying neonate includes efforts directed at comfort care, assistance with end-of-life decision making, and bereavement support. Through research and education, the challenges to implementing neonatal palliative care programs can be overcome. This article describes the components of neonatal palliative care, identifies the challenges associated wiith the implementation of such programs, and proposes strategies for addressing these challenges.","820":"The use of percutaneously inserted central catheters (PICCs) is an established practice in most NICUs. With the widespread use of these catheters, an increasing number of PICC complications has been reported in neonates. We present one case of a PICC retained and tethered in the vein in a very low birth weight infant, as well as a systematic review of PICC retention cases. Ten previous cases of PICC retention in neonates were found. Among those cases, the most common associated factors were coagulase-negative staphylococcus catheter colonization\/bactcremia and long duration of catheterization. Occlusion was not a usefiul sign for predicting catheter retention. Once retention was established, heparin or urokinase instillations were ineffective. Although surgical exploration was sometimes required, firm, continuous traction applied to the catheter over several hours or intermittent, moderately strong pulling maneuvers were successful in 44.4 percent of the cases in which they were performed. Traction did not show major side effects. Our case provides additional support for use of traction as the initial approach in the management of this rare complication.","821":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the time of birth and the mortality and morbidity of infants admitted to neonatal intensive care units. This prospective, cohort study examined the records of women and infants admitted to the NICUs of four hospitals in Beirut, Lebanon, between July 1, 2002, and June 30, 2003. The hospitals selected were university affiliated and had a large number of deliveries (5,152 total for the year 2002-2003). Neonatal mortality and morbidity for infants admitted to the NICU were evaluated in relation to time of birth. For the whole sample, mortality was higher for infants born during the night shift than for those born during the day shift. Mortality, morbidity, and brain asphyxia rates were also higher for infants born during the night shift and admitted to the NICU. Maternal risk factors and delivery complications were nor consistently higher on the night shift. ","822":"Newborn screening is the largest genetic testing effort for newborns in the U.S. Its purpose is to identify newborns who are at risk for metabolic, endocrine, or hematologic disorders. A review of the literature was conducted to determine the benefits of newborn screening; specimen collection timing and handling; ethical considerations of screening; as well as current practices regarding consent, notification of results, and follow-up procedures. The use of tandem mass spectrometry for expanded newborn screening and postmortem diagnosis of unexplained infant death was also reviewed. This article is intended to educate health care providers in the areas of controversy that surround the U.S. newborn screening program, with the hope of encouraging further research in this mportant area of newborn care.","823":"Historically, nipple feeding in the NICU has been initiated and advanced by physician order based on nursing observation and suggestions. The growing evidence base regarding nipple feeding readiness and progression, contingent caregiving, and nurse autonomy in decision making prompted our Level III NICU to reconsider our process. A literature review and discussions resulted in new protocols for initiating and advancing nipple feedings for three distinct groups: healthy preterm infants, preterm infants with complicated medical courses, and sick term or posttcrm infants. Through incorporating contingent earegiving, greater autonomy for the bedside nurse, developmental support, and collaboration, we expect to improve outcomes, comnuinication, and problem solving.","824":"","825":"","826":"The five-part \"Pointers in Practical Pharmacology\" immunomodulation series has presented some of the agents researchers are investigating in hopes of finding the means to effectively prevent and treat infectious processes in neonates. The phosphodiesterase inhibitor pentoxifylline appears promising, but large, randomized, clinical trials are still lacking. So far, there is no clear evidence to support the use of G-CSF for either the prevention or the treatment of sepsis. The results of a large, randomized, clinical trial of G-CSF in the United Kingdom are pending. Although intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy does not appear to be useful in the prevention of sepsis, its effectiveness in the treatment of sepsis is uncertain. It is hoped that the results of the International Neonatal Immunotherapy Study will provide definitive answers regarding treatment of sepsis with IVIG. The \"conditionally essential\" amino acid glutamine administered either enterally or parenterally does not make a difference in the rate of systemic infection or NEC in very low birth weight infants. Finally, probiotics appear promising as documented by at least two of the three randomized, clinical trials described here. As the search continues for agents to enhance the neonate's immune system and prevent and treat infectious diseases, remember that our best prevention tool is excellent and consistent hand hygiene.","827":"When presented with an edematous infant who may be experiencing a severe infection, particularly an unusual one, it is important to include nephrotic syndrome in the differential diagnosis. Because drastic measures may be required to manage this illness, it is important to be able to recognize symptoms, compile needed diagnostic data, and commence appropriate treatment. A referred pediatric nephrologist can aid in diagnosis, direct management, and educate and support parents. The nephrologist is also instrumental in guiding ongoing care and preparing the infant for transplantation when it becomes necessary.","828":"","829":"","830":"","831":"The integration of research into practice can be a challenge; however, the DEHP-reduction steps provided in this column should make the process simpler and faster. DEHP's link to adverse effects makes it crucial for neonatal nurses to do their best to protect their patients using a preventative approach. As critically ill neonates and infants continue to be exposed to DEHP-leaching devices, neonatal nurses can be at the forefront in taking precautionary action to reduce DEHP exposure among their most vulnerable patients.","832":"","833":"Glutamine, a nonessential amino acid that appears to be conditionally essential during periods of physiologic stress, plays important physiologic roles in the immune system. However, neither enteral nor parenteral glutamine supplementation makes a difference in the rate of systemic infection or of NEC in very low birth weight infants. Thus, the search for agents to enhance the neonate's immune system and to serve as safe and effective adjuvants to antibiotics continues. Part V, the final article in this immunomodulation series, will explore the use of probiotics to support the neonatal immune system.","834":"Pediatric home health care enables patients to be at home with their families in settings that bring them joy, comfort, and the security we all feel when we are at home. There is also a feeling, no matter how small, that the parents have some control over what is happening to their child. Infants with multiple needs require in-depth discharge planning. There are the physical and health concerns of the preterm infant and the potential complications that he could still develop. Parent teaching is vital for the successful transition from hopital to home. When the neonatal discharge nurse is aware of what difficulties the parents and the patient might face at home, her teaching can be tailored to meer the specific needs of these vulnerable, complicated infants. This article discusses the discharge planning process, which begins upon admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, as well as common problems encountered by many premature infants discharged home.","835":"With advances in neonatal and obstetric care over the past few years, the number of premature, multiple-birth neonates entering NICUs has increased. As we have started to recognize the special bond that twins and higher multiples share, cobedding has emerged as an NICU practice. As with any change, the introduction of cobedding presents challenges in the NICU. Both the theoretical benefits anti the potential concerns are many. Although nursing staff and parents may be excited about the prospect of placing these infants in the same crib, careful investigation and planning are necessary for any new procedure. This article discusses the cobedding of multiples as implemented at the University of Michigan. As a new practice, cobedding warrants further research, especially regarding its proposed benefits and implementation in the NICU.","836":"Kangaroo care (KC) is skin-to-skin contact between an infant and parent, where the infant is usually held chest-to-chest in an upright prone position. It is a very simple, beneficial developmental intervention for both baby and parent, as demonstrated in the literature, but many parents and health care professionals are not aware of KC, its benefits, or how to perform it. The purpose of this article is (1) to inform health care professionals about the research literature on KC and its benefits and (2) to develop a list of evidence-based KC guidelines for the use of all infants and their parents. Increased knowledge of and education on KC for healthcare providers should lead to increased, routine use of this beneficial intervention.","837":"Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) continues to be a significant complication in preterm neonates despite advances in neonatal care. Very low birth weight and extremely low birth weight infants continue to suffer from the sequelae of premature birth, including ROP. Controversy and uncertainty surround prevention of ROP. Possible preventive strategies include the use or restriction of oxygen therapy; steroid therapy; changes in blood transfusion protocols; reduced exposure of the retina to light; and administration of nutritional factors, indomethacin, and D-penicillamine. This article reviews recent studies that have proved or disproved the effectiveness of these preventive measures. It also identifies the implications of the study results for clinical practice and makes recommendations for future research.","838":"Despite the existence of a universal protocol in palliative care for dying babies and their families, provision of this type of care remains ad hoc in contemporary neonatal settings. Influential bodies such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization support palliative care to this patient population, so why are such measures not universally adopted? Are there barriers that prevent neonatal nurses from delivering this type of care? A search of the literature reveals that such barriers may be significant and that they have the potential to prevent dying babies from receiving the care they deserve. The goal of this literature review is to identify these barriers to providing palliative care in neonatal nursing. Results of the research have been used to determine item content for a survey to conceptualize and address these barriers.","839":"Congenital chylothorax, an uncommon cause of respiratory distress in the neonate, is diagnosed initially by prenatal ultrasound or postnatal x-ray and definitively by evaluation of the fluid in the pleural space. The etiology is not well understood, and reaccumulation of fluid can occur. Thoracentesis and chest tube placement may be required to support respiratory status. Conservative treatment, which may be tried for up to five weeks, includes diet and should be attempted before surgical intervention. Nutritional status, along with fluids and electrolytes, needs to be monitored closely.","840":"The use of SC or IV octreotide, a long-acting synthetic analog of somatostatin, provides a promising pharmacologic approach to reducing drainage in selected patients with a congenital or postoperative chylothorax, who do not respond to conservative treatment strategies. Prompt institution of octreotide therapy after surgery in patients with significant drainage or the formation of chyle may reduce the expense and morbidity associated with a prolonged hospital stay. Given the individual variability in patient response to octreotide and the limited clinical data regarding its use in the pediatric population, octreotide therapy must be individualized with careful consideration being given to possible benefits versus inherent risks.","841":"","842":"","843":"An omphalocele, a ventral defect of the umbilical ring resulting in herniation of the abdominal viscera, is one of the most common congenital abdominal wall defects seen in the newborn. Omphaloceles occur in 1 in 3000 to 10,000 live births. Associated malformations such as chromosomal, cardiac, or genitourinary abnormalities are common. Postnatal management includes protection of the herniated viscera, maintenance of fluids and electrolytes, prevention of hypothermia, gastric decompression, prevention of sepsis, and maintenance of cardiorespiratory stability. A primary or staged closure approach may be used to repair the defect. Some giant omphaloceles require a skin flap or nonoperative management approach, hoxvever. Immediate postoperative complications, usually related to significant changes in intra-abdominal pressures, include compromise of interior venous blood return and hemodynamic and respiratory instability due to diaphragmaric elevation. Complications occur more frequently with giant defects. Potential short-term complications include necrotizing enterocolitis, prolonged ileus, and respiratory distress. Long-term complications include parenteral nutrition dependence, gastroesophageal reflux, parenteral nutrition-related liver disease, feeding intolerance, and neurodevelopmental delay. Overall, advances in surgical therapies and nursing care have improved outcomes for infants with omphaloceles; survival rates for those with isolated omphaloceles are reported at 75 to 95 percent. Infants with associated anomalies and giant omphaloceles have the poorest outcomes.","844":"Providing care to neonates with bowel obstruction requires a basic understanding of gastrointestinal (GI) anatomy and functional landmarks as well as knowledge of the pathophysiology associated with intestinal blockage. Early recognition and prompt diagnosis necessitate astute assessment of common presenting symptoms and accurate interpretation of diagnostic investigations. Initial medical management is focused primarily on gastric decompression and maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance. This article describes features of the neonatal GI tract and discusses common causes of neonatal bowel obstruction.","845":"","846":"","847":"","848":"Pain assessment and management are important issues for the neonatal nurse today. Clinicians have gradually come to acknowledge that newborn infants (term and preterm) are capable of responding to painful stimuli. This article reviews the evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of oral sucrose administration, to help answer the clinical question of how to manage an infant's pain response to minor invasive procedures that are everyday occurrences in the NICU. This review included information on 1,077 infants enrolled in 16 studies. The evidence presented in the 16 studies reviewed here shows the safety and efficacy of sucrose in decreasing term infants' pain response to a single procedure. In regard to preterm infants, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of sucrose as a routine comfort measure. More research is needed to determine the safety and efficacy of repeated doses of oral sucrose given for multiple procedures in preterm infants.","849":"The care registered nurses offer makes a critical difference in the quality and cost-effectiveness of patient outcomes. The prevention and treatment of alterations in skin integrity remain primary nurse-sensitive quality indicators. Although wound prevention is a primary goal for nurses, iatrogenic wounds do occur. Neonatal patients are at greater risk for alterations in skin integrity because of the fragile nature of their skin. When skin breakdown occurs, nurses must have knowledge of effective treatment alternatives. The purpose of this article is to describe the use of a collaborative practice protocol to introduce and document patient outcomes with the use of amorphous hydrogel as a treatment modality for iatrogenic neonatal wounds. All hospitals collect data on the quality of patient care, and it has been known for some time that registered nurses can make a critical difference in the quality of patient care and the effectiveness of patient outcomes. The American Nurses Association has identified ten specific quality measures that are impacted by nursing care. Referred to as nurse-sensitive quality indicators, these measures include the maintenance of skin integrity.","850":"Devices used to maintain thermal stability in preterm infants have advanced over time from the first incubator reported by Jean-Louis-Paul Denuce in 1857 to the latest Versalet Incuwarmer and Giraffe Omnibed devices today. Optimizing the thermal environment has proven significant for improving the chances of survival for small infants. Understanding the basic physiologic principles and current methodology of thermoregulation is important in the clinical care of these tiny infants. This article highlights principles of thermoregulation and the technologic advances that provide thermal support to our vulnerable","851":"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) affects 1 in every 2,000 to 4,000 live births. Many infants with this condition are diagnosed antenatally through routine ultrasound screening. Nearly 90 percent present at delivery with severe respiratory distress requiring intubation. Many of these infants develop persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn due to hypoplasia of the affected lung. The survival of infants with CDH is limited by the degree of pulmonary hypoplasia and requires sophisticated medical technology such as high-frequency ventilation and inhaled nitric oxide. Some infants also require treatment with extracoporeal membrane oxygenation. This article gives details of two cases of CDH in which the presentation was atypical. The more subtle presentation is discussed, as well as the embryology and pathophysiology of CDH and the possibility of associated anomalies. Clinical management and impact on the family are outlined.","852":"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a technique for providing life support to patients with cardiac and\/or respiratory dysfunction, allows the heart and lungs to \"rest.\" The neonatal respiratory population has been a major benefactor of ECMO since 1982. Its use for neonatal respiratory disease increased dramatically until the past few years, when the number of neonatal respiratory ECMO cases began a downward trend. Fewer patients with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), meconium aspiration syndrome, respiratory distress syndrome, or sepsis are requiring ECMO support as frequently as in the past. Many attribute this decline to the newer respiratory therapies-mainly, surfactant, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, and inhaled nitric oxide. Neonates who continue to require ECMO today are sicker than the historic norm and have more complicated and lengthy ECMO runs. Patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, PPHN, and sepsis remain the most consistent in their representation among ECMO recipients within this author's institution, suggesting that the newer respiratory therapies have not had the same impact on these patients' needs for ECMO support. Better guidelines for determining which patients would benefit from earlier inititation of ECMO are needed.","853":"","854":"Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy does not appear to be efficacious in the prevention of neonatal sepsis. The value of a 3-4 percent reduction in sepsis or any serious infection without a reduction in mortality must be weighed against the cost of the therapy. The efficacy of IVIG therapy in the treatment of neonatal sepsis remains uncertain. The results of the ongoing International Neonatal Immunotherapy Study should provide definitive answers regarding the effectiveness of this therapy. Long-term follow-up and cost (length of stay) are important components of this study. Ohlsson and Lacy recommend studies evaluating the effectiveness of IVIG preparations with high concentrations of antibodies to common unit- or geography-specific pathogens. The cost-effectiveness of the production and use of such products should be included in study designs. Part IV of this series will explore the use of the amino acid glutamine as an immunomodulating agent in neonates.","855":"","856":"To describe the use of midline catheters in a Level IV, 48-bed NICU over a four-and-a-half-year period. Nonrandomized prospective review of data obtained for quality assurance monitoring. 1,130 catheters inserted in 858 patients ranging in age at insertion from 1 to 249 days, 360-8,000 gm in weight, and 23-42 weeks gestational age at birth. Catheter outcome data related to dwell times; patient characteristics; insertion site; and reason for removal, including failure related to infiltration, leaking, occlusion, dislodgment, infection, phlebitis, or malposition. There was no significant statistical difference in median catheter survival times related to weight or postconceptional age. Overall mean catheter dwell time was 8.7 days. Scalp was the most common insertion site (49 percent), and the site with the longest dwell time was the saphenous vein at the knee, which lasted a mean of 12.9 days. Elective removal represented 43 percent of all removals. Incidence of positive blood culture was 3.5 percent (0.41\/1,000 catheter days), with the risk significantly higher if a central line was also in place.

The Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (BNBAS) is one tool that can be utilized to support this process. When parents observe this assessment, they learn to recognize and understand infant cues and gain confidence for everyday routines such as diapering, feeding, general caregiving, and even taking that first trip with the baby to the grocery store. Parents become empowered when they discover not only their baby's amazing competencies, but also their own. In addition, the BNBAS provides a framework through which parents can effectively communicate and advocate for their baby.","859":"Diagnosis and treatment of severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) is documented in fetuses, term infants, and older children; however, there is very little information on its diagnosis and treatment in premature infants. When Duke University Medical Center's first preterm infant with a known SCID history was delivered, in June 1999, there was no defined protocol for the infant's nursing care. Although many of the guidelines for nursing care of the premature infant population (&lt; or = 36 weeks) apply, there are important considerations for preterm infants with an SCID diagnosis. This article provides background on SCID and identifies those special considerations--namely, multidisciplinary communication, infection prevention, thorough physical assessments, and parental support.","860":"The clinical management of respiratory failure in the newborn often focuses on lung parenchymal stiffness due to immaturity, surfactant deficiency, infiltrates, and other causes. However, health care personnel should also consider the airway, which plays an important role in gas exchange and lung mechanics. The airway can be easily injured, and an injured airway can significantly alter both the acute and chronic course of lung disease in infants. Further, there are developmental changes that affect the susceptibility of the neonatal airway to injury. Recognizing and preventing causes of airway injury can help to ensure optimal outcomes for the critically ill neonate.","861":"","862":"In spring 2006, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Heart Association (AHA) will introduce revised materials for the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP).

Some infants, though, require special devices to ensure their safe travel. NICU nurses must have the knowledge and skills to comfortably and competently give vital information to parents preparing to take their infant home. This article is intended to increase awareness among NICU nurses of the potential dangers babies face when placed in a car seat. It provides a basic overview of car seat safety for infants being discharged home from an NICU and includes references for those who seek further information on this topic.","864":"Cloacal exstrophy is an extremely rare and devastating complex of congenital abnormalities resulting in multiple debilitating morbidities. Infants with this disorder require numerous surgical interventions to repair gastrointestinal, genitourinary, spinal, and orthopedic malformations.

This article discusses the embryology, clinical presentation, and management (both early and long term) of cloacal exstrophy, with emphasis on gender reassignment issues and quality of life.","865":"Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is a rare, sporadic, progressive, congenital syndrome. In its complete trisymptomatic form, SWS is physically characterized by port-wine stains over the trigeminal area, leptomeningeal angiomas usually over the parieto-occipital region, and eye abnormalities. Clinical manifestation for infants with SWS depends on the affected organs, but can include seizures, mental retardation, and glaucoma. This article begins with a case presentation of an infant with SWS and then presents the etiology, embryology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, management, and prognosis of SWS.","866":"The birth of a premature infant causes emotional upheaval for parents. They often wonder what they can do to help their infant during the critical newborn period. Providing breast milk is one of the most important physiologic benefits a mother can give her premature infant. The advantages of breast milk are numerous. It is the responsibility of those who care for premature infants and their families to provide parents with the support they need to supply the best possible nutrition for their infant. Breastfeeding a premature infant can challenge both the mother and her health care team, however. Infants should be assessed individually for readiness to proceed through the steps leading to successftil breastfeeding. From establishing a milk supply to putting the baby to the breast, parents rely on the nurse for information, instruction, and encouragement. This article identifies obstacles to breastfeeding the premature infant and offers a step-by-step approach for promoting successful breastfeeding in the NICU.","867":"Our ultimate goal with this manuscript preparation course is twofold. First, our purpose is to encourage nurses to examine and apply the published evidence available on a selected clinical topic in the hopes that this will be incorporated into a pattern of lifelong learning for the individual. Second, this process encourages students to share their knowledge with other professionals, thereby advancing the scientific knowledge available for nursing practice. These are key components of the advanced practice nursing role and graduate students need mentoring during their education to be successful in the future. Students (and faculty!) find this course challenging but rewarding and the vast majority of students end up with a published manuscript. Although not all students appreciate the challenges, the majority of students are proud of what they have accomplished despite the intense amount of work. Final comments from several students include: I was never more proud of the work you made me accomplish.\" \"I can't believe it is done! How exciting.\" \"Thank you so much for all of your help and guidance. This has been a rewarding experience to see the progression of the manuscript....\" \"I did find this course to be challenging to say the least!\" \"I can honestly say that this semester was one of the most challenging, but most rewarding projects that I have done so far in grad school.

Adequately powered, random, controlled clinical trials of neutropenic infants are needed to further evaluate efficacy of these agents as adjuncts to antibiotic therapy. Carr and associates assert that available data do not support further study of rhG-CSF and rhGM-CSF in septic infants who are not neutropenic. A United Kingdom study of the efficacy of prophylactic GM-CSF in reducing systemic infection or mortality in infants at high risk for postnatal neutropenia is underway. No plans exist for a long-term follow-up study, however. Because infection has the potential to cause both short-term mortality and long-term neurologic disability, it is recommended that all future studies include long-term neurologic and neurodevelopmental follow-up. The next part of this series will explore the use of intravenous immunoglobulins to prevent and treat neonatal sepsis.","870":"Ethical treatment dilemmas are not new to the NICU. With technologic advances over the past 20 years, NICU care has developed rapidly, and survival rates have improved for some of the tiniest and most critically ill infants. In guiding clinical practice, however, standards in evidenced- based medicine have often superseded standards in evidence-based ethics. Neonatal nurses attain a more in-depth understanding of the clinical significance of the four principles of bioethics: autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice. Case studies illustrate the principles discussed.","871":"Ethical treatment dilemmas are not new to the NICU. With technologic advances over the past 20 years, NICU care has developed rapidly, and survival rates have improved for some of the tiniest and most critically ill infants. In guiding clinical practice, however, standards in evidenced-based medicine have often superseded standards in evidence-based ethics. Part I of this article presents a historical review of neonatal care and an overview of cases that have set precedents in neonatal ethical debate. It also includes recommendations for enhancing the skills of neonatal nurses as patient advocates in NICU ethical issues, an area that is, at times, controversial and baffling to clinicians.","872":"To provide descriptive information about the sound levels to which high-risk infants are exposed in various actual environmental conditions in the NICU, including the impact of physical renovation on sound levels, and to assess the contributions of various types of equipment, alarms, and activities to sound levels in simulated conditions in the NICU. Descriptive and comparative design. Convenience sample of 134 infants at a southeastern quarternary children's hospital. A-weighted decibel (dBA) sound levels under various actual and simulated environmental conditions. The renovated NICU was, on average, 4-6 dBA quieter across all environmental conditions than a comparable nonrenovated room, representing a significant sound level reduction. Sound levels remained above consensus recommendations despite physical redesign and staff training. Respiratory therapy equipment, alarms, staff talking, and infant fussiness contributed to higher sound levels. Evidence-based sound-reducing strategies are proposed. Findings were used to plan environment management as part of a developmental, family-centered care, performance improvement program and in new NICU planning. ","873":"NICU patients are at particularly high risk of harm and even death from medical error. In one NICU, a process change was undertaken to minimize the risk of errors resulting in the intravenous (IV) administration of enteral formulas and oral medications. In addition, a double-check system for medication doses was introduced to reduce the likelihood of medication errors. The previous practice was to deliver enteral formulas via syringe pump using TV syringes and tubing and to dispense medications in bulk bottles, drawing up patient-specific doses at the bedside. Converting to oral syringe delivery of medications and enteral formulas utilizing enteral-only tubing eliminated the necessity for Luer-Lok IV tubing and syringes, thereby reducing the potential for wrong-route error. Converting from dispensing medications in bulk to a unit-dose system permitted establishment of a double-check system in which doses are first checked by a pharmacist and then checked by the nurse before they are administered. This article describes the planning, implementation, and postimplementation process required to make this change in practice a success.","874":"To evaluate an evidence-based wound protocol for intravenous extravasation injuries in neonates. Nine newborns with intravenous extravasation injuries. Birth weight: 582-4,404 gm, gestational age: 24-40 weeks. Five Wounds were colonized with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species, two with diphtheroids, three with Enterococcus. There was no evidence of wound infection or systemic infection. Rates of wound healing ranged from one to six weeks. ","875":"This annotated bibliography from the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) presents recent findings on a variety of studies related to prenatal conditions and the benefits of prenatal care, advances in our understanding about infant care and family issues in the newborn intensive care unit (NICU), and the importance of clinicians in supporting and communicating with the family. By sharing this bibliography, we hope to increase the awareness of these valuable research findings within the nursing community and support the continued development of evidence-based practice in antenatal, postpartum, and neonatal care.","876":"There are tasks best done on an individual basis when caring for a neonate, but the ultimate outcome for infants and their families results from a team effort. Incorporating ten strategies drawn from football can help the NICU manager create and foster effective teamwork.","877":"Elevated sound levels in the NICU may contribute to undesirable physiologic and behavioral effects in preterm infants. This study describes sound levels in a busy NICU in the southeastern U.S. and compares the findings with recommended NICU noise level standards. NICU sound levels were recorded continuously at nine different locations within the NICU. Hourly measurements of loudness equivalent (Leq) sound level, sound level exceeded 10 percent of the time (L10), and maximum sound level (Lmax) were determined. Sound levels were sampled from nine different locations within the NICU. Sound levels are described using the hourly, A-weighted Leq, L10, and Lmax. The overall average hourly Leq (M = 60.44 dB, range = 55-68 dB), L10 (M = 59.26 dB, range = 55-66 dB), and Lmax (M = 78.39, range = 69-93 dB) were often above the recommended sound levels (hourly Leq &lt;50 dB, L10 &lt;55 dB, and 1-second Lmax &lt;70 dB). In addition, certain times of day, such as 6-7 AM and 10 AM-12 noon, were noisier than other times of day. ","878":"Family-centered care (FCC) has been implemented in many NICUs throughout the U.S. It is valuable in helping families whose infants require hospitalization cope with the stress, fear, and altered parenting roles that may accompany their child's condition and hospitalization. To employ such a significant philosophy of care, nurses must understand what the FCC concept signifies. A concept analysis can often aid understanding of abstract ideas such as FCC. This article utilizes a 1995 framework for concept analysis to clarify the meaning of FCC for the neonatal nurse. Incorporating FCC into daily professional practice can enable nurses to improve the emotional and physical well-being of each family they encounter.","879":"Jaundice caused by hemolysis continues to challenge practitioners caring for infants in the NICU. Bilirubin levels can rise quickly in the first days of life, and interventions must be prompt to prevent side effects related to hyperbilirubinemia. Conventional treatments such as hydration and phototherapy are common, but new studies suggest that use of intravenous immunoglobin (IVIG) as an additional treatment may prevent the need for exchange transfusion in some babies. This article presents a case study of an infant with blood-type incompatibility treated successfully with multiple doses of IVIG, discusses the pathophysiology and clinical presentation of hemolytic jaundice, and reviews current management strategies for this disease.","880":"The American Academy of Pediatrics first recommended in 1992 that infants be placed on their backs for sleep to reduce the risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Since that time, there has been a national drop in the incidence of SIDS of more than 40 percent. Unfortunately, many parents and other caregivers are still receiving inconsistent information and observing varying practices regarding infant sleep position. This article emphasizes the role of the health care professional in both teaching and modeling these potentially life-saving practices consistently and unambiguously. Available literature is reviewed regarding attitudes and beliefs about infant sleep positioning, and specific concerns are addressed in order to allow for better tailoring of educational programs.","881":"","882":"","883":"The use of mass spectrometry in newborn screening has made possible the early diagnosis of various metabolic diseases. However, because aminoglycosides, blood transfusions, nothing by mouth status, and the presence of heparinized solutions all affect the results of newborn screens, neonates in critical care units who receive such treatments ought to be screened under specific practice guidelines. Many of the devastating sequelae of metabolic diseases are preventable if diagnosed early, making the development of such practice guidelines for use in the NICU especially important. Additionally, no standardized practice guidelines presently exist for determining who, whether birth hospital or primary care provider, is responsible for notifying the parent of a positive result and thus ensuring invaluable follow-up care. Such standardized guidelines for screening practice are needed to prevent devastating neurologic sequelae for children whose condition may otherwise escape unaddressed. Newborn screening guidelines developed at Johns Hopkins Hospital and Memorial Regional Hospital provide a helpful starting point.","884":"Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), an immune-mediated response to heparin administration, has been recognized in adults for some time, but only recently recognized in neonates and children. HIT Type I is a mild, self-limiting condition. HIT type II is a severe immune reaction to heparin that leads to thrombocytopenia and often thromboembolic complications. The incidence of HIT Type II is 2-5 percent in adults on heparin products and may be as high in neonates and children. The mortality rate from HIT in adults is 7-30 percent and is unknown but potentially high in newborns as well. The cardinal sign of HIT is a drop in platelet count by 50 percent or platelet counts below 70,000-100,000\/mm3. This drop usually occurs five to ten days after the first exposure to heparin. Treatment is immediate cessation of all heparin therapy and initiation of alternative anticoagulants, especially the direct thrombin inhibitors lepirudin and argatroban. This article reviews the literature on HIT and presents a case of neonatal HIT following heart surgery.","885":"Infants with myelomeningocele and the nurses who care for them have something in common. Both are at higher risk than the general population for developing latex allergies. This article provides a review of the literature regarding latex production, latex allergic responses in children and adults, types of latex allergic reactions, and prevention of latex allergies.","886":"Newborn lungs are particularly susceptible to pathophysiology. Respiratory distress commonly brings infants to the intensive care nursery. Premature birth compromises the infant's ability to respond to early lung dysfunction because of the reduced functional reserve available at younger gestational ages. The respiratory pump consists of respiratory musculature and the chest wall. The respiratory pump is the physiologic \"machine\" that responds to lung pathology. From gestation onward, components of the pump undergo developmental changes that influence its compensatory ability in the neonate. Careful observation of the synchrony of the chest wall and abdomen during spontaneous breathing efforts assists the caretaker in detecting respiratory compromise and impending respiratory failure. Noninvasive monitoring of respiratory patterns is a valuable tool for the neonatal caregiver, who must understand the developmental changes in the respiratory pump and be able to identify an infant's ineffective responses to lung pathophysiology.","887":"When an infant presents with hypoglycemia, acidosis, hepatomegaly, and respiratory arrest, the neonatal team must be alert to the possibility of a metabolic disorder. Among those to be considered is medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, which occurs in 1 in 10,000-23,000 live births. Recognizing and treating this disorder early could decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with the diagnosis.","888":"","889":"The complexities involved in managing a neonatal intensive care unit in today's health care setting make survival a challenge for nurse managers. A little resuscitation of spirit and focus can ensure that the nurse manager thrives even in adversity. Manager CPR may be the prescription needed for continued professional success.","890":"PTXF appears to be a promising adjunct to antibiotic therapy in neonatal sepsis. No adverse effects were noted in either study reported in the literature. However, there is a need for large randomized clinical trials to confirm or refute the role of PTXF in the treatment of sepsis in neonates. Clinically important comorbidities such as chronic lung disease, periventicular leukomalacia, duration of assisted ventilation, and NEC should be evaluated as a part of these studies. Comparison of PTXF with immunomodulatory agents such as colony-stimulating factors and intravenous immunoglobulins is suggested. Part II of this five-part series on immunomodulation will explore the use of colony-stimulating factors in neonates. Other topics will include the amino acid glutamine, intravenous immunoglobulins, and probiotics.","891":"Hirschsprung's disease (HD), also known as congenital aganglionic megacolon, is a relatively common cause of congenital obstruction of the colon. Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), also known as Ondine's curse, is a rare condition involving failed autonomic respiration in the absence of cardiorespiratory disease resulting in inadequate alveolar ventilation. Both conditions typically present in the newborn period and belong to a group of disorders referred to as neurocristopathies. HD and CCHS most commonly exist as discrete entities, but the coexistence of them is now called Haddad syndrome. Although few documented cases of Haddad syndrome exist in the literature, the association of CCHS and HD suggests a common etiology involving neural crest development.","892":"Supporting parents in coping with stress and loss improves the health and development of their child. This article looks at the need for monitoring the health and well-being of parents of infants in the NICU, including practical matters for health care professionals providing follow-up care. It is important to increase public and professional awareness of the grief response. Practical suggestions for coping with the NICU experience, many of them from professionals who are also parents of NICU patients, are offered for grieving parents and family members.","893":"To describe the implementation and evaluation of a home gavage program for preterm infants. Retrospective chart reviews were used to assess the physiologic progress of infants, and retrospective written questionnaires were administered by mail to families participating in home gavage to assess their experience and solicit advice. One hundred forty-three infants born at &lt;37 weeks gestational age with a primary diagnosis of prematurity who met criteria for home gavage, of whom 52 were given home gavage and 91 attained full oral feedings in intensive care before discharge. The safety of home gavage was evaluated by weight change and hospital readmission. Parental satisfaction was assessed by the mailed survey. Cost savings were also evaluated. Infants gained and average of 31 gm\/day while receiving home gavage. No hospital readmissions were related to home gavage. Parents expressed satisfaction with the home gavage program. There was an average savings of $12,428 per infant related to shorter hospital stays. ","894":"Providing optimal nutrition for the very low birth weight (VLBW) infant is critical during the neonatal period. Evidence-based practice guidelines are essential in managing these fragile infants. Putting scientific research into daily clinical practice may be arduous at times, however. A multidisciplinary team of health care providers successfully established a practical feeding guideline for a 52-bed, teaching-affiliated, Level III neonatal intensive care unit in St. Louis. This guideline identifies human milk as the recommended source of nutrition for the VLBW infant, a suggestion that has significantly affected lactation services in the unit. This article describes the process of developing, implementing, and evaluating a feeding guideline based on current research and describes the impact on lactation rates of having such a guideline in place within the unit.","895":"","896":"","897":"","898":"Intraventricular hemorrhage in the premature neonate has been and continues to be a cause of morbidity and mortality in NICUs around the globe. Much information is available concerning the etiology and preventative and treatment strategies to reduce the incidence of IVH in this patient population. As neonatal caregivers are struggling to care for and protect infants who are surviving despite extreme prematurity, this survival is complicated by the infant's cerebral vasculature, which is very susceptible to hemorrhage; by respiratory problems that require the use of lifesaving, but potentially harmful, ventilation interventions; and by the infant's compromised ability to self-regulate vascular responses to stress. The preventative treatments being explored and proposed may come with debilitating and potentially lethal sequelae. Research continues, however. New recommendations are being proffered, and perhaps, in the near future, the incidence of IVH and its associated morbidity and mortality will decline dramatically.","899":"The admission of an infant to an NICU is an unexpected event for the parents and one often not predicted by health care professionals. This highly stressiful and overwhelming hospitalization is likely to be one of the greatest life challenges that parents of newborns face. Parents need support from NICU professionals, among others, to cope with the losses that occur in the hospital setting. This article provides NICU professionals with general information about loss and the subsequent grief response, focusing on losses from sources other than death. Common emotional and physical responses are provided so these can be recognized in affected parents. By increasing their awareness of the topics of loss and grief, health care professionals can help ensure that grieving parents get the support needed to assimilate their loss into a life forever changed.","900":"Communication between parents and professionals in the NICU is a necessary part of collaborative decision making in the provision of family-centered care. Decisions with ethical components, those regarding treatment plans or neonatal research enrollment, need to be made conjointly with parents and health care professionals. This article reviews the present state of knowledge of how parents' input can be facilitated in regard to decisions made about their children. Research studies involving decisions made with ethical components in the NICU since the advent of the Baby Doe regulations reveal parents' frustration with communication practices, their need for control of information, and the trust in their children's health care providers that is required to best facilitate their input into ethical decisions made about their children.","901":"Harlequin ichthyosis is an extremely rare and historically lethal congenital disorder of the skin caused by abnormal keratinization. This article reviews the embryology and currently understood pathophysiology of the disease, as well as current methods used to diagnose and treat these infants. There are serious implications for the family to consider: the high risk that their newborn will die soon, as well as future family planning issues.","902":"Preterm infants develop the skills necessary to begin oral feeding as their health stabilizes and as they reach a postconceptional age that supports coordination of breathing and swallowing with oral-motor functioning. The time from initiation of oral feeding to full oral feedings (with adequate intake for growth and maintenance of physiologic stability) can vary from days to months for the preterm infant. The approach to feeding the infant during this transition period must be developmentally supportive and tailored to meet the needs of the individual. To accomplish this, caregivers--notably nurses and parents--need to communicate about the specific skills that the infant has gained, about skills that are emerging, and about skills that the infant has not yet developed. The Early Feeding Skills (EFS) Assessment is a checklist for assessing infant readiness for and tolerance of feeding and for profiling the infant's developmental stage regarding specific feeding skills: the abilities to remain engaged in feeding, organize oral-motor functioning, coordinate swallowing with breathing, and maintain physiologic stability. This article introduces the EFS.","903":"","904":"The success of the NICU depends in large part on the manager's ability to continuously identify the high, middle, and low performers on the unit. To retain top performers, the manager must ensure a challenging work environment paired with zero tolerance for substandard performance. Middle performers need positive recognition and the opportunity to stretch for improved performance. Once employees have been categorized, the manager needs to consistently develop performance improvement plans for each one.","905":"","906":"The use of incubator covers to enhance preterm infants' rest and recovery is common in the NICU. However, the kinds of covers used vary extensively among and within nurseries. Few data exist on the effectiveness of different types of covers in reducing light levels to the infant. This study compared several types of commonly used incubator covers as to efficacy of light reduction. A descriptive, comparative design was used in this study. Twenty-three incubator covers were tested, including professional, receiving blanket, hand-crocheted, three-layer quilt, and flannel. The percentage of light level reduction of different incubator covers under various ambient light level settings. The amount of light reduction provided by incubator covers varies depending on type of fabric as well as percentage of incubator surface shielded by the cover. Dark-colored covers provided greater light reduction than bright\/light-colored covers when covers identical in fabric type were compared. The light-reduction efficiency of the covers varied depending on the level of ambient light. Covers provided less light reduction in higher ambient light levels. ","907":"After staggering numbers of infants were killed in automotive crashes in the 1970s, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended in 1974 universal use of car seats for all infants. However, positional problems were reported when car seats are used with premature infants less than 37 weeks gestational age as a result of head slouching and its sequelae. In 1990, the AAP responded with another policy statement introducing car seat testing. It recommended that any infant at or under 37 weeks gestational age be observed in a car seat prior to discharge from the hospital. The AAP did not give specific guidelines on type of car seat, length of testing, equipment, or personnel proficiency, however. Few nurseries have standard policies to evaluate car seats, to teach parents about car seats, or to position newborns in them, and not all hospitals actually conduct car seat challenges or have common standards for testing that is performed.","908":"The ductus venosus (DV) is a blood vessel unique to the fetal circulation. It functions as a shunt between the umbilical vein and inferior vena cava by passing the hepatic microcirculation and shunting highly oxygenated blood to the brain and myocardium. The DV has received less attention than the ductus arteriosus; however, with modern ultrasonographic imaging, the DV is easily identified and is becoming a valuable diagnostic tool in the areas of maternal-fetal medicine. We report a rare case of idiopathic dilation of the DV that was diagnosed during routine ultrasounds. The presence of blood flow turbulence within the dilated area and the concern that blood vessels might rupture resulted in elective cesarean section at 34 weeks gestation. The infant was discharged after 14 days. Dilation of the DV, its size as well as the presence of turbulence in the dilated area might be important factors in determining the time of delivery and could contribute to a better outcome.","909":"The presence of yellow staining and damage to the brain caused by unconjugated bilirubin was first described by Hervieux in 1847. Kernicterus, the technical term used to describe the intense yellow staining in the basal ganglia of the brain, was first used by Schmorl in 1903. Perhaps as many as 60 percent of all babies born each year in the U.S. are diagnosed with clinical jaundice. Kernicterus is a preventable brain injury caused by severe jaundice, yet it remains a threat today. Because of this, anyone caring for newborns must be aware of the risks and treatment for hyperbilirubinemia and the sequelae of this seemingly benign entity.","910":"","911":"This annotated bibliography from the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) presents recent findings on the management of high-risk pregnancy and on neonatal care from delivery trough long-term follow-up. By sharing this bibliography, we hope to increase the awareness of these valuable research findings within the nursing community and support the continued development of evidence-based practice.","912":"","913":"Every step of the research process involves decisions that must be made. In almost all cases, there are many possible choices, and none of them is wrong. However, it is up to the researcher to consider all of the options and systematically eliminate possibilities based on a theoretical framework, previous findings and methods described in the literature, or circumstances specific to each research question. When the methods used are less than ideal for some reason, the researcher should identify the problems as limitations to the study. Sometimes the limitations restrict the population to which the data can be generalized. In other instances, the limitations identify new areas of study that the current investigation did not address, but for which the current data provide support.","914":"Necrotizing enterocolitis continues to be a common and life-threatening gastrointestinal emergency in the low birth weight infant. Prematurity, ischemia, enteral feeding, and infectious disease have been identified as common risk factors, however the exact cause of NEC other than prematurity is yet to be identified. Good assessment skills by the nurse are imperative, because clinical signs of NEC can be both subtle and catastrophic. Frequent radiographs are essential for the diagnosis of NEC and ongoing assessment of neonates diagnosed with NEC. Radiographs including an abdominal flat plate examination and a left lateral decubitus film to evaluate for free air should be obtained every 6-8 hours in the neonates with Stages II and III NEC.","915":"Mongolian spots are the most frequently seen birthmarks in infants. They have almost universally been regarded as benign cutaneous manifestations that have no clinical significance. Recently, however, there have been studies suggesting that Mongolian spots manifest more often in children with certain inborn errors of metabolism, including mucopolysaccharidosis and GM1 gangliosidosis.","916":"Although early hospital discharge of infants can be both cost-effective and better for developmental care and parent-infant bonding, neonatal caregivers need to ensure infant safety. One of the concerns of early discharge is the risk that premature babies may continue to have apnea, bradycardia, and oxygen desaturation after discharge and that these events can be serious enough to increase morbidity and mortality. The discharging provider bears the responsibility of assessing each infant's risk for persistent apnea and providing the care and monitoring appropriate for his presumed risk level. Presently there is no universally accepted testing method that can accurately predict which infants will experience significant apnea. Neonatal sleep studies are one of the objective methods being evaluated to identify infants at risk for persistent apnea. This article addresses arguments for and against the use of sleep studies to determine the risk of apnea in neonates about to be discharged, types of sleep studies and what they test, and how sleep studies can be useful in determining infant care.","917":"To develop a neurologic assessment tool, the Premie-Neuro, for very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. INSTRUMENT DEVELOPMENT: Neurologic data were collected during the coursc of the NICU stay. Factor analysis was utilized to determine the strength of relationships between items and to reduce the initial number of test items. An NICU cohort of 86 preterm infants was enrolled. Mean birth weight was 1165.8 +\/- 446.7 grams, and mean gestational age at birth was 28.8 +\/- 3.2 weeks. Seventy-five neurologic and behavioral characteristics were assessed in week 1 of life and every 2 weeks thereafter until 38 weeks posreonceprional age. Three factors, the Neurologic Scale, the Movement Scale, and the Responsiveness Scale, described the neurologic examination. Factor reliability was calculated for internal consistency (Cronbach alpha coefficient) and ranged from .73 to .82. The Premie-Neuro can be utilized with VLBW infants to monitor neurologic development during NICU care. ","918":"Skin-to-skin holding has been reported as a valuable intervention for preterm infants for over a decade. However, many neonatal intensive care units are not practicing this therapy and cite lack of protocols and techniques as a barrier. This article describes in detail the nursing considerations and techniques involved to successfully implement skin-to-skin holding for very low birth weight, technology-dependent infants. NICU protocols can be derived from this article.","919":"Too often managers focus on imperfect aspects of staff performance and neglect to celebrate the triumphs of the unit and its employees. By taking time to recognize individual and group accomplishments, participating in hospital celebrations of success, and integrating rewards and recognitions into the daily culture of the NICU, managers can foster a more positive work environment.","920":"","921":"Various medications are available for symptom management during palliative care of the neonate. Neonatal nurses are knowledgeable about the use of these agents as a part of curative care and should become familiar with them as an essential aspect of palliative care. Pharmacologic symptom management is only one facet of peaceful, pain-free, family-centered palliative care. For an overview of a complete protocol for end-of-life care for neonates and their families, review Catlin and Carter's article, \"Creation of a Neonatal End-of-Life Palliative Care Protocol,\" which appeared in an earlier issue of Neonatal Network (Vol. 21, No. 4).","922":"This article reviews possible prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal causes of cerebral palsy.

This article examines three concepts from the postpartum family adaptation literature: transition to parenthood, maternal and paternal role identities, and attachment. It applies these concepts to the experiences of foster parents who care for infants with prenatal drug and alcohol exposure. Also reviewed are recommended strategies to promote development of the foster parent-infant relationship and to increase parental knowledge within the NICU setting and during the period of transition from hospital to home. Nurses within the NICU have a unique knowledge and experience of caring for infants in withdrawal. This knowledge needs to be shared beyond the hospital with community professionals, who may have limited training in infant health, mental health, or development.","924":"Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is defined as a group of skin disorders that presents as blistering of the skin in varying degrees of severity. Most cases are inherited, but rare cases may be acquired. There are three main types: simplex, junctional, and dystrophic. The dermal-epidermal junction of the newborn skin is a vital area of attachment. Any defects in the components that comprise this junction can lead to fragility of the skin. EB diagnosis and testing can be per formed both prenatally and postnatally. There is no cure for EB. Treatment revolves around supportive care and prevention of complications. The NICU nurse plays an important role on the multidisciplinary team as primary caregiver to the infant and educator to the family.","925":"This article presents a case study of an infant (JG) with an antenatal diagnosis of a left diaphragmatic hernia and an extralobar sequestration of his right lung, which was noted postnatally. JG's course was complicated by persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) and suspected pulmonary hypoplasia, and he required support with extracorporeal life support (ECLS). JG's case was unusual in his presentation of extreme PPHN that was unresponsive to inhaled nitric oxide and ECLS. His PPHN was nearly intractable, requiring treatment with vasodilators combined with intravenous sildenafil, which had never been tried in our institution before this case. The article concludes with a discussion of the etiology, diagnosis, and management of congenital diaphragmatic hernia and extralobar sequestration, singly and in combination.","926":"Many factors must be considered in planning and implementing research. Scientific reasons for decisions are important, but so are practical considerations. The suggestions made throughout this column are based on experience and may seem to some to be simply \"common sense.\" However, the importance of these practical, common sense considerations cannot be minimized. These practical suggestions are intended to bring into focus the fact that the research process is not that different from other decision-making processes: In research as in life, there are multiple ways to get from point A to point B, and none of them is inherently right or wrong. The choices the researcher makes in designing and implementing a study must be clearly described and must be based on the research goals, the theoretical framework used, and the resources available. Potential nurse researchers should not be intimidated by the task at hand. Rather, they should be comforted by the fact that the same processes they use in making decisions about clinical practice can be employed in designing and implementing research studies.","927":"","928":"In spite of the benefits reported for kangaroo holding, many mothers of preterm infants requiring intensive care do not choose to hold kangaroo style.

In this naturalistic inquiry, mothers were interviewed twice: once while the infant was hospitalized and again after the infant was discharged home. Mothers' holding practices divided them into three groups: (1) kangaroo holding in hospital and home, (2) blanket holding in hospital and home, and (3) holding practice switched from hospital to home. Three themes emerged from the interview data: (1) emotional state, (2) holding environment, and (3) benefits of close contact with the infant. ","929":"Most neonatal intensive care units have approaches to manage patients at the end of their lives. Published guidelines to help direct practitioners are lacking, and these management approaches, commonly referred to as comfort care, are often based on tradition. Recently, our neonatal staff experienced a unique situation that involved giving comfort care to a previable neonate who lived much longer than anticipated. Our staff identified the need for an evidence-based practice guideline to focus on four key care issues: provision of warmth, close physical contact, nutritional support, and sedation and pain management. The purpose of this article is to supply health care providers with evidence-based comfort care guidelines for neonates at the end of who either are previable of have had life support withdrawn.

Although all preterm infants are born with smaller vitamin A stores than full-term infants, the store of vitamin A in preterm infants at risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is often especially deficient. Despite the increases in plasma vitamin A concentrations that have been achieved with vitamin A supplementation, only modest improvements in clinical outcomes and incidence of BPD have been noted in this population. This article reviews the research on vitamin A supplementation for preterm infants, as well as the issues and clinical implications associated with this intervention.","947":"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is essentially a heart-lung bypass machine that can be used to support certain critically ill neonates. ECMO therapy reached a peak in usage in the mid to late 1980s. At that time, ECMO was most often used for severe complications of persistent pulmonary hypertension, meconium aspiration, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and sepsis. Since that time, the use of ECMO has decreased, due largely to newer medical advances that have improved the course of these neonates. Whether a nurse works in a Level III ECMO center or a Level I, II, or III NICU, ECMO treatment has become less familiar than it once was. But even though ECMO is used less often, there are times when nothing can take its place. It is important to stay informed so that families of those critically ill newborns who do need ECMO can be educated and supported. This article defines ECMO, discusses when it should be incorporated into the plan of care, describes advances in the NICU that have resulted in the dramatic reduction in the use of ECMO, and provides information and communication strategies to better support the family of a very sick newborn.","948":"","949":"Determining measurement reliability and validity involves complex processes. There is usually room for argument about most instruments. It is important that the researcher clearly describes the processes upon which she made the decision to use a particular instrument, and presents the evidence available showing that the instrument is reliable and valid for the current purposes. In some cases, the researcher may need to conduct pilot studies to obtain evidence upon which to decide whether the instrument is valid for a new population or a different setting. In all cases, the researcher must present a clear and complete explanation for the choices, she has made regarding reliability and validity. The consumer must then judge the degree to which the researcher has provided adequate and theoretically sound rationale. Although I have tried to touch on most of the important concepts related to measurement reliability and validity, it is beyond the scope of this column to be exhaustive.

Eleven of the infants received KC; 13 received standard NICU care. Heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and abdominal skin temperature were manually recorded every minute. Apnea, bradycardia, periodic breathing, and regular breathing were captured continuously on a pneumocardiogram printout. Three consecutive interfeeding intervals (three hours each) on one day constituted the pretest, test, and posttest periods. Mean cardiorespiratory and temperature outcomes remained within clinically acceptable ranges during KC. Apnea, bradycardia, and periodic breathing were absent during KC. Regular breathing increased for infants receiving KC compared to infants receiving standard NICU care.

In the pediatric and adult populations, end-tidal CO2 verification of endotracheal tube placement is considered to be the standard of care. An understanding and use of the technology available are essential for all health care professionals to allow them to provide optimum care for their patients.","954":"Postnatal corticosteroids are often administered during the neonatal intensive care unit stay to reduce the risk and severity of chronic lung disease (CLD) in preterm infants. In 2002, the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Fetus and Newborn and the Canadian Paediatric Society Fetus and Newborn Committee jointly advised against the routine use of systemic dexatmethasone for the prevention of CLD in very low birth weight infants. The objective of this review is to present evidence-based research and expert opinion to provide the neonatal clinician with current information regarding dexamethasone use with premature infants. This article serves to inform neonatal clinicians about the benefits and potential adverse neurosensory risks of this treatment option.","955":"The most severe manifestation of congenital ichthyosis presents itself in the form known as harlequin ichthyosis. Harlequin ichthyosis is characterized by a profound thickening of the fetal skin. Affected infants are born with a thick \"horny shell\" of dense, waxy, platelike scales with deep, irregular fissures covering the body. Contraction of the extremities is seen, along with deformities of the ears, eyes, mouth, and digits. This \"armor\" limits movement and compromises the skin's barrier defense, leaving the newborn at risk for metabolic abnormalities and infection.

Infants infected with HIV are likely to be placed on combination therapy, with the goal of suppressing viral replication and stabilizing the immune system. Combination therapy also reduces the risk of resistance mutations associated with monotherapy. The pharmacokinetics of antiretroviral agents in neonates is under study in a variety of PACTG protocols. However, the pharmacokinetics of most antiretroviral agents in premature infants has not been studied. With the exception of zidovudine, specific dosing for these agents in the preterm population is not known. The long-term effects of antiretroviral agents on growth and development also require further study. Knowledge of the management of HIV in all populations is expanding rapidly.

Sample of an open population. Neonatology department (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit), Academic Medical Centre\/Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. One clinical expert and 9 observers observed ventilated premature born babies simultaneously. Criterion validity was assessed by correlating the COMFORT scale with the clinical judgment regarding the amount of stress. Interobserver reliability was assessed on the clinical judgment as well as on the COMFORT scale. Diagnostic qualities were evaluated with a ROC curve. On 19 ventilated prematurely born babies (mean gestational age 30 weeks, mean birth weight 1385 gm), one clinical expert and 9 observers made 30 paired observations. The criterion validity of the COMFORT scale was good (Pearson's r of 0.84). The interobserver reliability of the clinical judgment was very good (weighted Kappa 0.84). The interobserver reliability of each item varied from good to almost perfect (weighted Kappa of 0.64 for muscle tone to 1.00 on heart rate). The reliability of the total COMFORT scale score was satisfying (intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.94). The diagnostic quality of the COMFORT scale was excellent, at a cut-off point of 20 the sensitivity was 100 percent, the specificity was 77 percent, and the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.95. In this first evaluation, the COMFORT scale appears to be a valid and reliable measurement tool to assess the stress of ventilated prematurely born babies. ","963":"Nearly 50 years after it was thought to be conquered, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) continues to cause vision disturbances and blindness among prematurely born infants. During the 1940s and early 1950s, researchers and caregivers first identified and struggled to eliminate this problem, which seemed to come from nowhere and was concentrated among the most advanced premature nurseries in the U.S. Research studies initially identified many potential causes, none of which could be proved conclusively. By the mid 1950s, oxygen was identified as the culprit, and its use was immediately restricted. The rate of blindness among premature infants decreased significantly. ROP was not cured, however. By the 1960s, it had reappeared. The history of ROP serves to remind us that, despite our best intentions, the care and treatment of premature newborns will always carry with it the possibility of iatrogenic disease. This caution is worth remembering as we work to expand the quality and quantity of clinical research.","964":"The premature infant may receive therapeutic glucocorticoid drugs while in utero or in the postnatal period. This article (part I of a two-part series) discusses the benefits and risks of in utero, or antenatal, corticosteroids (ACS) for the premature infant. Part II addresses the benefits and risks of postnatal corticosteroid (PCS) use. There are numerous clinical studies on the therapeutic use of these steroids for the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome and chronic lung disease in the premature infant, although research results on the efficacy of repeated steroid exposure among premature infants vary. Premature infants who are exposed to repeated courses of ACS and\/or high-cumulative-dose PCS may show no neurologic side effects until later in life. Research in newborn animal models focused on the timing, duration, and amounts of ACS and PCS. Current clinical research includes examination of the neurodevelopment of infants who are therapeutically exposed to perinatal corticosteroids, to identify safer minimal dose protocols. Over the past 30 years, corticosteroids have been increasingly prescribed before and after birth. Understanding the potential treatment benefits and risks to human fetuses and neonates is vital to clinical practice. This review presents historic and pharmacokinetic information about prenatal use of corticosteroids. It also offers scientific evidence of the benefits and risks identified in animal models and clinical trials, to stimulate thought that gtiides neonatal clinical practice.","965":"Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a rare congenital disorder of collagen production that results in brittle bones and affects other body systems containing collagen.

A descriptive, repeated-measures design. Four medically stable premature infants of 34 weeks postconceptional age. The mean weight was 2,180 gm, and the mean age was 24.5 days. Similar regions of increased skin-surface pressures were identified for the four infants. Within areas of peak pressure, some sensor cells reached 28-32 millimeters of mercury, which is considered to be the critical compressive pressure for obstruction of nutritive flow to the underlying body tissues. These descriptive results may be a starting point for development of research studies to determine positioning strategies to optimize the skin integrity of premature infants while minimizing unnecessary handling.

Significant succcss has been achieved in developed countries to reduce the incidence of this devastating disease in neonates through screening of pregnant women, maternal antiretroviral therapy to reduce transmission, and cesarean section for delivery. Prophylaxis continues for the first six weeks of the newborn's life with antiretroviral therapy and careful monitoring of clinical well-being. Antiretroviral therapy offers significant reduction in the rate of mother-to child transmission, and this is presently the cornerstone of therapy for the HIV-infected pregnant woman. Clinical studies of treatment modalities continue to offer new hope to prevent transmission of the virus to the fetus. Care for the HIV infected newborn is highly complex and constantly evolving. All neonatal nurses should be aware of these issues so that they can be partners in the identification of new cases and the ongoing treatment of babies who are infected.","975":"Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) has altered the management strategy for treating near-term and term infants with hypoxic respiratory failure (HRF). There is a strong relationship between HRF and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN is characterized by elevated pulmonary resistance, pulmonary vasoconstriction, and altered vascular reactivity. The resulting high pulmonary pressure may lead to HRF, which is defined as a relative deficiency of oxygen in arterial blood and insufficient minute ventilation. iNO improves oxygenation and decreases the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Although iNO therapy is effective, its efficacy can depend on the fine points of its use and on other care the infant is receiving. Even in NICUs that do not have iNO available, those who care for term infants with HRF must be familiar with its use and know when and how to transfer these infants and how to help families through this difficult period. Because iNO therapy will probably be used more frequently in nurseries over the next few years, more information on the safety and efficacy of its use in the broader neonatal population needs to be available.","976":"","977":"","978":"","979":"","980":"","981":"Using kangaroo care (KC) with unstable and\/or ventilated infants remains controversial.

With no improvement by hour 18, KC was also begun, first for 1.25 hours and then, 2 hours later, for 3.5 hours. The infant was intubated at hour 45 for increasing respiratory distress, and KC resumed 24 hours later for 1 hour and 3 hours after that for an additional 3 hours. Extubation occurred at hour 90. Kangaroo care resumed 2 hours later for periods of 1.5, 1.5, and 1 hour over the next 8 hours, 2.5 hours more later that day (day 5, the last day of data collection). Thereafter, KC was done intermittently until discharge on day 9. Total KC times for pre-vent, vent, and immediate post-vent periods were 4.75, 4, and 6.5 hours, respectively. The data from this study suggest that KC may assist in, rather than retard, recovery from respiratory distress. KC may also foster maternal relaxation and minimize maternal stress.","982":"To describe Swedish men's experiences of becoming fathers to their preterm infants. A cross-sectional descriptive study. Eight men participated in semistructured interviews with open-ended questions. The interviews were analyzed using manifest and latent content analysis. The concepts of control and noncontrol. The manifest analysis of the interview text produced six categories: concern, stress, helplessness, security, support, and happiness. The latent content interpretation indicated that the concepts of control and noncontrol were relevant to the fathers' experiences. The men's experiences of early fatherhood were influenced by their ability to experience control. When concern, stress, and helplessness dominated the fathers' experiences and coincided with low levels of happiness, support, and security, they experienced noncontrol. Conversely, when they experienced support, security, and happiness, they felt that they were in control and able to handle the situation.

Two subsets of infants were selected for comparison: one of infants receiving predevelopmental care (n = 42) and another of infants receiving developmental care (n = 42). Infants receiving developmental care required less time on total parenteral nutrition, required less exogenous surfactant, and had less documented feeding intolerance. Changes were observed in ambience and in the use of space for providing parent-infant care. Also observed was the individualized expertise of nursing staff and of parents.

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has remained a viable option for NICU infants since its introduction in 1971. Current methods of monitoring allow clinicians to troubleshoot and better understand the physiologic and clinical impact of administering CPAP to neonates with RDS. This article highlights the renewed interest in CPAP therapy and current methods of monitoring.","985":"","986":"","987":"","988":"The staff nurses' immediate manager directly influences an NICU's ability to attract and retain professional nurses. This makes it especially important that nurse executives and administrators identify opportunities to better meet the needs of their nurse managers and measure the impacts of their decisions. Data about front-line manager turnover need to be measured, reported, and examined. No longer can organizations afford to view managers as another expense; they are an asset on the balance sheet. Strategic planning for the recruitment and retention of nurse managers will be vital both to an organization's healthy bottom line and to the quality of its patient care.","989":"An experimental design is necessary for making cause-and-effect judgments about study variables. Although most researchers would agree that the experimental design is desirable, such a design is not possible or appropriate for every study--and even without an experimental design for support of the hypothesis, enough evidence might exist for a researcher to feel somewhat comfortable that variable X causes Y. At the very least, it can be demonstrated that X is always related to Y in some number of settings, with multiple samples of subjects and with controls for as many variables as possible. Before deciding to change a practice based on research findings, however, the clinician must also determine if X is not related to Y in some cases. Without experimental findings, the amount and quality of evidence available must be considered. This column has described three major types of research: experimental, quasi-experimental, and nonexperimental. Each type of research can produce valuable scientific evidence if the study is designed and implemented carefully. The type of research design and its appropriateness for the specific research question is only one consideration in critiquing research findings and making decisions about the application of those findings in practice settings. Future columns will address other considerations.","990":"To identify factors related to depressive symptoms in mothers of preterm infants and to changes in depressive symptoms between hospitalization and when the infant was six months corrected age and to determine whether these factors differentiate mothers at high risk for depression from mothers at low risk for depression. Correlational. During hospitalization, 39 mothers of preterm infants and, at six months corrected infant age, 34 mothers of preterm infants. Depressive symptoms as measured on the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale. At enrollment, 19 mothers (48.7 percent) had elevated depressive symptom scores. When the infants were six months corrected age, mean scores had decreased by 36 percent, and only 20 percent of the mothers had elevated scores. During hospitalization, the correlates of depressive symptoms were similar to the factors that differentiated between mothers at high risk and those at low risk for depression. However, the correlates of depressive symptoms during hospitalization were different from correlates of changes in depressive symptoms between hospitalization and six months corrected infant age. Identifying correlates of maternal depressive symptoms may lead to earlier identification and treatment of women at risk for depression, thereby decreasing the negative effects on infant development. ","991":"The ability of a preterm infant to make the transition from gavage to oral nipple feeding depends on the infant's neurodevelopment in relation to behavioral organization, to a rhythmic suck-swallow-breathe pattern, and to cardiorespiratory regulation. Research-based knowledge about infant neurodevelopment in these three areas has led to the creation of a semidemand feeding method to aid in this transition. The method combines the use of nonnutritive sucking to promote awake behavior for feeding, use of behavioral assessment to identify readiness for feeding, and systematic observation of and response to infant behavior cues to regulate frequency, length, and volume of oral feedings. Semidemand feeding may be individualized for healthy preterm infants. This article discusses both the relevant knowledge about neurodevelopment and the semidemand feeding method itself.","992":"Osteopenia, rickets, and fractures from nutrient deficiencies can occur during infancy, particularly in preterm infants. Bone mass accretion during the first year of life is equal to or greater than that achieved at any other stage of life, including adolescence. Optimizing calcium and bone status during infancy can have immediate benefits in maintaining calcium homeostasis and preventing disturbances in bone mineralization and can provide long-term benefits by helping infants to later reach their maximum genetic potential for peak bone mass, a prerequisite for the prevention of osteoporosis and its complications. Dietary calcium requirements during infancy generally reflect the need to achieve normal growth and bone mineralization because 99 percent of total body calcium is present in the skeleton. Knowledge of physiologic factors that determine infant calcium requirements and the bioavailability of calcium from various dietary sources is important to ensuring bone health during infancy. Also key are the practical issues related to optimizing calcium nutriture in infants born at term and prematurely.","993":"","994":"","995":"","996":"","997":"","998":"The etiology of CCAM of the lung remains unclear.

Through sharing the experience of having a child in the NICU, I examine hope and loyalty as critical features of parents' NICU experience, explaining why these emotions need to be acknowledged and encouraged by health care professionals.","1006":"For the past several years, health care providers specializing in the treatment of neonates have been working steadily to improve the environment for premature and sick neonates in order to optimize outcomes. They have also begun to recognize that involving the family in every aspect of care not only has positive value for the family, but can improve outcomes for neonates as well. This article examines how the staff at one hospital closely utilized and married these two concepts, developmentally supportive care and family-centered care, to design a Level II special care nursery that embraces parents as partners in treatment.

The grieving process may begin before the infant is born and continue for months, even years, after the death. Parents and families often feel isolated as they grieve the loss of a child whom few other people knew. Caregivers may also feel overwhelmed during this time, as they seek to provide decedent care in a sensitive way that will be helpful to the family while grieving themselves. Recognizing the needs of the families and caregivers, the Duke University Medical Center Intensive Care Nursery developed a bereavement program that provides education and assistance to the intensive care nursery staff, who care for the family at the time of death and provide follow-up for the family for up to one year after the death as they grieve the loss of their infant.","1016":"The liver, the largest organ in the body, is critical to a number of key metabolic functions.

But the realization that volume rather than pressure causes ventilator-induced lung injury has led to the development of new strategies for ventilation. Volume guarantee is a mode of ventilation that automatically adjusts the inspiratory pressure to achieve a set tidal volume according to changes in lung compliance or resistance or the patient's respiratory drive. Volume-guaranteed ventilation delivers a specific, preset volume of gas, and inspiration ends when it has been delivered.

Disorders of the motor unit that present with hypotonia in the newborn period include SMA, congenital myotonic dystrophy, congenital myasthenia gravis, and congenital myopathies. Central core disease is one of the classic congenital myopathies that can be differentiated based on characteristic histologic findings. Muscle fiber samples from patients with central core disease possess distinct morphology that can be diagnostic. Many infants may not exhibit muscle weakness in the newborn period, although there have been rare cases of profound hypotonia and respiratory failure. Clearly, muscle biopsy is the gold standard and is indicated for any infant with marked hypotonia that is not thought to be supraspinal in origin.","1026":"To evaluate the effects on thermoregulation of bathing a healthy newborn within the first hour of life compared to bathing four to six hours after birth. Quasi-experimental. Newborn nursery of a 30-bed obstetric unit in an urban university hospital. Fifty-one healthy term newborns with a minimum axillary temperature of 36.5 degrees C (97.7 degrees F). Newborns in an experimental group were bathed within the first hour of birth; those in a control group were bathed at the standard four to six hours of age. Axillary temperatures were measured before the bath, immediately after the bath, one hour later, and two hours later. Axillary temperatures as measured at four different times did not differ significantly between infants bathed within one hour of birth and those bathed four to six hours after birth. A flexible bathing time is recommended according to the characteristics and stability of the newborn and to family desires. ","1027":"Parental stress in the NICU has at least a short-term impact on the establishment of the parent-child relationship and potential repercussions on long-term child development outcomes. One way to help parents mitigate stress is to help them learn what they need to know about their infant's condition and care. In this article, we examine how learning to read the infant's physiologic and behavioral cues helps parents cope with stress. We view parental learning as a process in which parents target specific domains of information for learning according to the temporal relevance of the domain to their concerns. It is important that we recognize the fluidity of the process and anticipate what parents need to learn at different times during hospitalization. The NICU staff assumes a crucial role in reducing parental stress by delivering information that is relevant to the parents' needs and by helping parents understand this information.","1028":"Illegal drug use throughout the nation is a problem of epidemic proportion. Of particular concern is drug use among pregnant women. In most cases, these women have little hope of achieving a better life for themselves or their children. Illegal drugs, cocaine in particular, can have devastating effects on the neonate. These effects can last well into childhood and can exhibit themselves in academic, social, and family situations. Challenges for the neonatal nurse include early identification of these infants and use of available resources. This article addresses prenatal cocaine use and support services for drug-dependent women, effects of cocaine during the neonatal period, possible neonatal and infant outcomes, and implications for nursing practice.","1029":"Over the past decade, advances in neuroimaging have given birth to a new field of diagnostic pediatric neurologic assessment that includes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This invaluable tool helps medical professionals to resolve many clinical and research questions related to neonatal neurodevelopment that other imaging technology cannot explain. Nurses and others who accompany infants to MRI would benefit from a better understanding of early neurodevelopment and of the neuroimaging procedure. Knowing the advantages and disadvantages of MRI techniques can help nurses be better patient advocates, parent liaisons, and caregivers to infants having MRI scans.","1030":"Inguinal hernia repair is one of the most common surgical procedures performed on premature infants. Improved survival rates in the NICU have led to an increase in the incidence of premature infants with inguinal hernias. The NICU nurse, often the first to notice an inguinal hernia in a premature infant, should understand the etiology, basic pathophysiology, and nursing care for this condition.","1031":"Free radicals may be the cause of many neonatal complications, such as chronic lung disease and brain injury. Treatment options for these complications using antioxidants are being evaluated through research. This article begins with a review of the basic science of free radicals. It then discusses neonatal complications potentially caused by free radicals. A brief description of research into potential treatment options is also included.","1032":"","1033":"The purpose of this study was to examine the perspectives of mothers, nurses, and neonatologists on the importance and implementation of NICU practices related to caregiving, information exchange, and relationships within the context of family-centered care. This study design was descriptive. The PARTNERS Questionnaire was developed and implemented, including both quantitative and qualitative items in the three areas (caregiving, information exchange, relationships). For the parent participants, it was a retrospective study. Two hundred fifteen questionnaires were distributed to professionals and 157 questionnaires were mailed to mothers of NICU graduates. A total of 196 questionnaires (53 percent) was returned (55 mothers, 18 neonatologists, and 123 nurses). Ratings of importance to the respondent and ratings of degree of implementation of items in the three areas were uniformly high. Mothers and nurses had significantly higher ratings than neonatologists in implementation of caregiving. In addition, mothers and nurses rated importance higher than implementation for the areas of information exchange and relationships. ","1034":"Illness and immaturity often interfere with a neonate's ability to receive full enteral feedings during the first week of life. The goals of feeding in the NICU are to nourish the preterm infant for appropriate growth and development and to facilitate the earliest possible discharge from the NICU. Early, small-volume feedings, or trophic feedings, have been studied as a method for achieving these goals. The high-risk infant given such trophic feedings not only receives minimum enteral nutrition, but also attains earlier full nutritional feedings and, consequently, is discharged home earlier. Oro- or nasal-gastric gavage feedings are usually indicated for this group of infants because of their physiologic immaturity and the frequent presence of respiratory illness. Recent studies support the use of intermittent bolus feedings, which have long been used for the premature infant. Several authors have noted advantages to continuous infusions as well. Because the infant is unable to pace or refuse gavage feedings, the caretaker must determine the appropriate volume of each feeding. The optimal volume for initiation and advancement of trophic and nutritional feedings is still under investigation, but reports have demonstrated safe volumes for even the extremely premature infant.","1035":"When an infant presents in the delivery room with macular and papular skin lesions covering the trunk, extremities, and\/or skin folds, the neonatal nurse practitioner covering deliveries must be aware of possible skin lesion differential diagnoses. Among these is congenital cutaneous candidiasis, a rare, usually benign skin infection. If this condition is recognized early, unnecessary testing and treatment of newborns who present with these symptoms might be avoided.","1036":"","1037":"","1038":"Parenting a preterm infant at risk for developmental disabilities can be a profoundly stressful experience. For parents from minority cultures, language barriers and cultural differences can increase feelings of uncertainty and inability to cope. Research suggests that cultural differences influence not only parents' emotional responses to and perceptions of disability, but also their utilization of services and their interaction with health professionals. The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH), Toronto, provides care to a culturally diverse community, and approximately 45 percent of patients receiving care represent minority ethnic groups. Although efforts to provide culturally sensitive care have been made, they have tended to be isolated initiatives lacking consistency and coordination. This article describes the initiation and development of a multicultural program at MSH to support families of infants at risk for developmental disabilities. This article provides valuable guidance to other neonatal units that are attempting to support parents from diverse cultural groups.","1039":"Enhanced technology and professional expertise are making the diagnosis of congenital heart disease possible with increasing frequency during the prenatal period. This article describes the process of prenatal diagnosis of congenital heart disease and the many personal issues families face when they receive news of this condition. Ethical and legal considerations of prenatal diagnosis are reviewed. Brief vignettes describe what families experience when they receive the diagnosis. The role of the nurse in educating parents, assisting them in sorting out options for treatment, and providing ongoing care and support is discussed, and implications for nurses in obstetric, neonatal, and pediatric settings are reviewed. Finally, the need for further research on this topic is explored.","1040":"To establish the validity and clinical usefulness of a modified pain assessment scale, the Pain Assessment in Neonates (PAIN) scale. Correlational design to compare scores obtained on the PAIN with scores obtained on the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS). A convenience sample of 196 neonates from an NICU and a step-down unit with gestational ages of 26 to 47 weeks. Bedside nurses observed the neonates for two minutes and then scored their responses on both scales. The scales were scored sequentially and in a randomized order. Correlation of individual item scores and total scores on the PAIN and the NIPS. The scores for individual items on the PAIN were significantly associated with scores obtained on the NIPS. Overall correlation between the scales was 0.93. These associations suggest that the PAIN is a valid scale for assessment of neonatal pain. ","1041":"","1042":"The stories of neonatal care are a rich source of information, going beyond the typical clinical article to convey the meaning of nursing in this special environment. During its run, the Turning Points column in Neonatal Network gave nurses, doctors, and family members affected by the NICU an outlet to share their stories with others. The brief overview of the columns' contents provided in this article displays the wide variety of patient cases, workplace issues, and family situations encountered by neonatal nurses.","1043":"Knowledge translation is the process of bridging the gap between the overwhelming amount of research data\/information\/evidence and its critical appraisal, synthesis, dissemination, and application as knowledge by influential role models. Knowledge translation includes ongoing surveillance of the results of the implementation of new knowledge. By conducting research that is driven by relevant, well-defined questions and by using the most powerful study designs available, researchers generate valid new information that can later be translated into knowledge and applied in the clinical setting. Systematic reviews of the literature serve as good examples of knowledge management, when defined as \"making proper use of the sum of what is known.\" Such reviews may identify that an intervention is effective without any harmful side effects, that it is noneffective, or that further research is warranted. Consumers of perinatal\/neonatal health care or their ombudsmen should be encouraged to take part in setting the agenda and defining important outcomes for such research.","1044":"This personal account is about a labor and delivery experience that brought together two women--the author, an obstetric nurse, and Mrs. Hamilton,* the patient she cared for. This uneventful labor ended with the rapid delivery of Mrs. Hamilton's second son, who experienced a nuchal cord injury. This narrative describes selected aspects of her labor and delivery experience as well as short- and long-term outcomes for her newborn son. The unique nurse-patient relationship with its focus on caring and support is emphasized, in an attempt to illustrate the value and power of nursing by sharing one's own experiences of nursing practice.","1045":"A walk down memory lane is provided from the perspective of Chicagoland nurses who have each provided neonatal care for 20 years or greater. Sixteen nurses were interviewed, representing at least 11 different units in the area. Combined, over 390 years of neonatal care have been provided by these nurses. An oral history was obtained by asking each the same three questions: What has changed in the past 20 years in neonatal nursing? What are your fondest memories of neonatal nursing in the past 20 years? What drives your \"passion for little people\"? This special group of nurses will warm your heart with their responses. They are a reminder of how much neonatal nursing has changed, but also how the \"passion for little people\" remains the same. On this special anniversary, nurses in many units, not only in Chicago, will be able to reflect with similar stories.","1046":"The neonatal nurse practitioner (NNP) emerged in the 1970s. During the first two decades, nurses who functioned in this new advanced-practice role were forced to overcome interprofessional isolation, variable educational preparation, underutilization, and title ambiguity. However, after nearly 30 years of evolution influenced by the changing health care environment, technological advancements in newborn care, medical personnel shortages, and the advanced-practice nurse movement, the NNP is now a recognized member of the neonatal health care team nationwide. The NNP has achieved the level of provider status, but only after successfully overcoming many practice restrictions and restraints over the decades. This article chronicles the history of the NNP and recounts the external and internal elements that contributed to the development of this profession.","1047":"This article is a collaborative effort of five nurses who have worked together for a total of 173 collective years. We have experienced vast changes in the field of neonatology during the last 40 years and wish to share some of the significant developments as we experienced them in our unit. We realize that the various changes differ by location and institution.","1048":"This review reflects back on the progress that has been made in infant pain research over the past 20 years and how the research has influenced (or has failed to influence) the attitudes and practices of health professionals about infant pain. Progress in understanding of infant pain neurobiology, treatment, and measurement are discussed, and new directions for future research are proposed.","1049":"Neonatologists, neonatal nurses, and others who care for critically ill newborns hope that the care they provide will improve the health and the neurodevelopmental outcome of these neonates. In this progressive era of neonatal medicine, we must pause to look backward even as we look forward, taking full advantage of the opportunity to reflect on our short history and to review several important events in neonatal medicine that have contributed in a meaningful way to the evolution of evidence-based neonatal care. Six interventions highlight why randomized controlled trials are necessary to understand the risks and benefits of our interventions with premature and critically ill infants. We hope this history of the evolving practice of evidence-based neonatal care will enable the reader to have a greater appreciation for the consideration of each and every intervention that we take on behalf of the infants in our care.","1050":"Attempts at human resuscitation date back to ancient times. Most strategies for resuscitation focused on adults until the early 1800s, when newborn resuscitation captured the interest of noted practitioners. The most promising techniques and strategies for neonatal resuscitation were developed during the latter part of the twentieth century. This article examines the key components of neonatal resuscitation and the discoveries that stimulated the development of current neonatal resuscitation practices.","1051":"Lung disease has been a leading cause of significant morbidity and mortality since neonates first drew breath. Over the past few decades, many treatment options have evolved to aid us in our ability to support neonatal breathing. The history of neonatal pulmonary care, both its successes and controversies, can teach us a great deal about the future of this dynamic field. As new developments occur, we constantly modify the therapies we offer to preterm and term infants. Understanding traditional therapeutic options and knowing what may be on the horizon can help caregivers to better match treatment plans with individual infants. This article reviews advances in mechanical ventilation, adjuvant therapies, and respiratory drugs through the past few decades and speculates on future directions in this field.","1052":"Fat-soluble vitamin requirements for the enterally fed premature infant are an important concern, both before and after discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit. Because preterm infants fed unsupplemented human milk receive deficient quantities of these vitamins (A, D, E, and K), supplements are very important for this population. Vitamin intakes with special formulas for low birth weight infants and human milk fortifiers are also reviewed.","1053":"","1054":"","1055":"","1056":"To determine the safety and efficacy of allowing kangaroo mother care (KMC) one hour per day during the course of phototherapy using a fiberoptic phototherapy panel. Thirty premature infants, 30-35 weeks gestation, &lt;2,500 gm, who required phototherapy. Infants were randomized into three groups: (1) infants who received traditional bank or spotlight phototherapy 24 hours per day, (2) infants who received traditional phototherapy 23 hours per day and for the 24th hour lay prone on a fiberoptic phototherapy panel, and (3) infants who received traditional phototherapy 23 hours per day and for the 24th hour were given KMC with a fiberoptic phototherapy panel held against their back. Nonparametric statistics were used for between-group comparisons on number of days of phototherapy, daily bilirubin decrement, and bilirubin profiles over the course of phototherapy. Groups did not differ in the number of days of phototherapy or in daily mean bilirubin decrement. The bilirubin profile for the KMC group showed a more shallow descent than did the profiles for the other groups, but a significant difference in decline was present only on day 4 of treatment (p = .05). This pilot work suggests that KMC using a fiberoptic panel during phototherapy may be safe, but further study is needed. ","1057":"This article describes the use of a quality improvement clinical audit approach to identify insertion practices, duration of therapy, and complications related to peripheral intravenous catheters. These data provide evidence for adherence to practice standards and benchmarks for evaluation of new interventions to improve the safety and efficacy of intravenous access practices. Implications for quality improvement and clinical research related to intravenous-device practices within the neonatal intensive care unit are discussed.","1058":"Despite advances in perinatal care in the past decade, sepsis and its complications continue to present problems for the neonate, remaining a major cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Sepsis research is focusing on how the neonate (host) responds to bacteria. The newborn may develop a systemic reaction to bacteria that induces the release of substances known as inflammatory mediators. Termed the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), this reaction is believed to be responsible for the signs and symptoms of sepsis. This article introduces the neonatal nurse to SIRS, providing an overview of various inflammatory mediators and cytokines, their clinical consequences, and potential new therapies in the management of SIRS.","1059":"Physiologic anemia is a common and normal finding in newborn infants. In preterm infants, anemia of prematurity is the result of this normal physiologic process compounded by the morbidity of prematurity. Premature infants reach their nadir hematocrit sooner and at a lower level than term. This article reviews the physiology of stem cell differentiation and the structure and function of the red blood cell, as well as examining red blood cell indices. It also addresses the etiology, symptomatology, diagnostic workups and treatment\/prevention modalities of anemia of prematurity. Treatment for and prevention of anemia of prematurity remain controversial, and specific criteria are lacking.","1060":"The ability to safely and efficiently feed by mouth is based on oral-motor competence, neurobehavioral organization, and gastrointestinal maturity. Although most infants successfully make the transition to oral feedings as they approach term gestation, infants who were very immature at birth have historically had the most difficulty achieving this milestone. Postnatal complications (chronic lung disease, intraventricular hemorrhage, seizures, and so on) are also associated with delays in the onset of the first feeding, as well as with delays in achieving full enteral intake. Weaning the infant to breast is a slow and gradual process that may necessitate supplemental gavage or bottle feedings. A variety of measures--such as positioning, containment, reduced milk flow, and imposed rest breaks--may help to facilitate better oral intake, but infants probably benefit most from the passage of time. Frequently, the older the infant is at first feeding, the shorter the time required to make the transition to full oral feedings. Rather than attempting to accelerate the inherent maturational processes that form the basis for oral feeding, efforts might better be spent in providing adequate nutritional support while avoiding unnecessary stress and fatigue.","1061":"","1062":"","1063":"","1064":"Perinatal asphyxia may occur in utero, during labor and delivery, or in the postnatal period. There are numerous causes, and the clinical manifestations vary. Infants who experience mild asphyxia may show no neurologic injury. Severe asphyxia may be fatal in utero, or immediately after birth, with survivors showing extensive neurologic sequelae, with or without cognitive deficits. Mild brain hypothermia appears promising in the prevention of further neurologic damage in encephalopathic infants following asphyxia. Recent research on newborn animal models has focused on the timing, duration, and depth of hypothermia. Promising new research is now under way in nurseries in the U.S. in an attempt to establish clinical protocols for use of hypothermia in human neonates.","1065":"Accurate management of infant temperature requires appropriate placement of temperature monitoring probes. Currently, there is a lack of consensus regarding placement of skin temperature probes and the effect on temperature monitoring of the infant's lying on the probe. The objective of this study was to compare abdomen and back skin temperatures when infants were positioned supine and prone. A quasi-experimental design was used to randomize infants to prone or supine position. Infant back, abdomen, and axillary temperatures were measured at one-minute intervals with small disposable thermocouples over a one-hour period. Twenty-three infants, weight 820-2,400 gm, gestational age 27-37 weeks, postnatal age three to ten days. Gradient between abdomen and back temperature. Both mean abdomen and mean back temperatures differed significantly by position (t-test, p = .003 and .028, respectively). Weight and postnatal age did not have an effect on the mean difference between abdomen and back temperature. Results indicate that probe placement and infant positioning are important factors altering measurement of skin temperature. ","1066":"To determine if temperature probe covers contribute to nosocomial infections by providing an environment for skin microbe colonization. Descriptive, comparative design with infants randomized into two groups: foam probe cover and hydrogel probe cover. Skin cultures were obtained 72 hours after cover placement. Bacterial growth was quantified after 24 and 48 hours. Skin integrity was assessed using visual irritations scores (VIS) every 5 minutes for 30 minutes following cover removal. ANOVA and ANOVA-RM were used to compare amounts of microbes and VIS scores between groups. Twenty-six medically stable infants, 29 to 34 weeks gestational age, less than 10 days postbirth, and in an incubator. Microbial growth and VIS. There were no statistically significant differences in microbial growth and VIS scores between groups (p &gt; .05). Clinical significance was noted in VIS scores. Infants who had foam covers had more sustained irritation scores. ","1067":"To determine nurses' practices regarding skin temperature probes. Data were collected using an anonymous questionnaire, which was returned by mail. Questionnaires were distributed by volunteer neonatal nurses. Items included frequency of probe change, position of probe, use of probes in skin and air servocontrolled incubators and radiant warmers, as well as demographic data. Eighty-three neonatal nurses. Nurses reported that skin servocontrolled incubators are used widely, but generally only for infants less than 28 weeks gestational age; a high proportion of respondents reported using continuous monitoring of skin temperature in air servocontrol incubators. Although most nurses reported positioning infants to prevent their lying on the probe, 21 percent reported using the same probe site regardless of infant position. Routine changing of the probe cover was reported by a number of nurses. Practices were influenced by individual knowledge, beliefs, and experience as well as by unit protocols, which varied widely. ","1068":"This two-part article presents feeding strategies for the NICU population over the first several weeks of life. It focuses primarily on the theory and approach to feeding extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants, but also addresses some issues pertinent to larger, ill infants. The premise for these recommendations is that avoiding early malnutrition in ELBW and ill infants has both short- and long-term benefits. Many practitioners may consider our approach to be somewhat aggressive. In this strategy, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is initiated in the first hours after birth and is given together with initially small, and then increasing, enteral feedings beginning on the first or second day of life. The role of the TPN is to provide rapid, maximal nutrition and that of the early enteral feedings is to \"prime\" the gut and stimulate normal gastrointestinal tract activity.","1069":"","1070":"","1071":"","1072":"","1073":"To compare the amount of time required to collect a blood specimen, the number of heel punctures required, and the rate of hematology re-collections required when using a Monolet lancet vs a Tenderfoot Preemie device. Randomized, two-group, quasi-experimental. Neonates with a birth weight &gt;800 gm were eligible to participate in the study. Twenty subjects were randomized to the Monolet lancet (control) group and 20 to the Tenderfoot Preemie (experimental) group. A total of 157 blood specimens was collected, 89 of which were for hematology testing. For this sample population of preterm infants, less collection time was required, fewer heel punctures were necessary, and a lower re-collection rate occurred with use of the Tenderfoot Preemie than with use of the Monolet lancet. ","1074":"Parents of infants in the neonatal intensive care unit report that communication with staff helps to relieve the many stresses they face. Particularly challenging for NICU nurses, however, is communication with non-English-speaking families. To improve this communication at Vanderbilt Children's Hospital in Nashville, illustrated cards have been developed to translate phrases commonly used in the nursery into foreign languages. Three different sets of cards provide translations in Spanish, Kurdish, and Serbo-Croatian (the languages most commonly encountered at this hospital), and a fourth set, in English, is used for individuals with hearing impairments. These cards aid the bedside nurse in giving a basic report and in encouraging parental participation in the infant's care. Nurses who have used the cards report that parents respond to the questions and seem to appreciate the attempt to communicate.","1075":"A newborn lies wide-awake, about to be intubated. The infant is able to feel everything, to hear everything--but cannot do anything to change the situation. Big people hold down the newborn and place a laryngoscope blade into the mouth, then a large endotracheal tube into the trachea. As the baby struggles, coughs, chokes, gags, and cries, blood pressure and intracranial pressure increase dramatically, and the heart rate plummets. Infants, like adults, do feel pain and anxiety. Yet recent studies show that NICU staff continue neonatal intubation utilizing only force. In pediatric emergency\/critical care settings, rapid-sequence intubation (RSJ), once confined to the environment of the operating room, is now the standard of care. An understanding of commonly administered PSI medications is essential to bring this practice to standard use in the NICU as well. In the pediatric and adult critical care population, rapid-sequence intubation (RSI)--the use of sedatives and chemical paralytics to facilitate tracheal intubation--is considered the standard of care. Use of these medications optimizes intubating conditions and helps to minimize the adverse physiologic effects of intubation. Neonatology has yet to embrace this trend, however. This article addresses the issue of sedation for intubation in the neonatal population.","1076":"CPAP, the use of continuous positive airway pressure as a means of providing respiratory support to the infant, has been studied since the early 1970s. A variety of delivery methods has been used. One method, that of providing CPAP through a single nasopharvngeal tube, is reviewed here. The process of delivering nasopharyngeal CPAP can be technically difficult, and requires careful attention to the infant and the CPAP system. The ability to anticipate and troubleshoot problems is essential. Done well, this process truly shows off the art of nursing.","1077":"","1078":"","1079":"Oxygen is one of the most commonly administered drugs in the neonatal intensive care unit. A variety of techniques exists to deliver oxygen to infants who are not on a ventilator or who are not receiving positive pressure. These techniques include oxygen hood, nasal cannula, face mask delivery or \"free flow,\" and \"flooding\" the incubator with oxygen. Because each technique has unique advantages and disadvantages, the choice is frequently dependent on style. Recent advances in incubator technology have improved the delivery of supplcmental oxygen by incubator flooding. This technique is generally underutilized, but it has some advantages over thc other modalities in certain clinical scenarios. The neonatal nurse needs to be aware of the characteristics of the various oxygen delivery technologies and the tools needed to optimally care for infants who are dependent on supplemental oxygen.","1080":"Three cases of hematuria associated with urinary catheterization in infant males in this NICU over a year prompted an investigation by the health care team. The team tracked catheterizations in the unit, conducted a national survey, and did a literature review. Based on their findings, the team revised the unit policy and procedure and evaluated new products. After changes were implemented, the incidence of hematuria--originally at 20.7 percent--dropped to 5.5 percent during the first evaluation period and to zero during a second follow-up period.","1081":"Gestational diabetes mellitus is a relatively common medical condition that was described as early as the nineteenth century. This article discusses the maternal and fetal pathophysiology and the impact of the maternal condition on the neonate. Fetal macrosomia and infant respiratory distress syndrome, cardiomyopathy, hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, polycythemia, and hyperviscosity all can occur as a result of maternal hyperglycemia and are discussed in detail. Therapeutic approaches and treatment options for the mother, manifestations and diagnosis of the infant, and current research related to this condition are also included.","1082":"","1083":"","1084":"Management of congenital diaphragmatic hernia has changed dramatically over the past couple of decades. Until the early 1980s, it was felt that the abdominal contents should be returned to the abdomen as soon as possible to allow the lungs to expand. It is now known that it is not the defect that causes respiratory distress, but the infant's hypoplastic lungs and accompanying pulmonary hypertension. Advances in treatment and technology have contributed to changes in management. Ultrasonography now allows for early prenatal detection. Prenatal treatment modalities include in utero tracheal ligation and maternal antenatal steroids. Postnatal modalities have expanded to include permissive hypercapnia, high-frequency ventilation, inhaled nitric oxide, pharmacologic support, exogenous surfactant, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Liquid ventilation and lobar lung transplantation have also been tried. In spite of these advances, the overall survival rate remains about 63 percent.","1085":"To identify the process by which parents of premature infants seek information, the kinds of information they seek, and the resources they use to meet their educational and support needs. Descriptive study using 19 parent interviews and 64 questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLE; The process parents use to obtain information and support. Parents of premature infants make a transition from being passive recipients of information to actively seeking it. They spend 10-20 hours a week gathering information during the first month of the baby's hospitalization. They desire more information than is provided, particularly in the areas of infant health, infant care, and coping. Family is the primary source of support prior to birth and after discharge, but during the infant's convalescence, nurses are the main source of support and help for parents in understanding and adapting to their baby. Many parents would use a computer-based resource for information if it were available to them. ","1086":"Gastrostomy tube site complications can be difficult to manage and may temporarily prevent use of the tube for feeding. Such complications are especially common in premature newborns. Lcakage is the usual cause of tube-site complications. This makes maintenance of effective intragastric and transabdominal tube seals the most effective approach for preventing and treating tube-site complications in newborns. This article explains how to use balloon volume and transabdominal segment length to recognize problems that can lead to leakage and how to correct these problems before they cause complications. It also addresses skin care at the site.","1087":"Total colonic aganglionosis (TCA) is a rare, hybrid form of Hirschsprung's disease. It is a functional rather than mechanical obstruction, characterized by the absence of intrinsic ganglion cells in the myenteric and submucosal plexuses of the bowel wall. Ganglion cells regulate normal colonic peristaltic activity. Paucity of ganglion cells results in an aganglionic segment of bowel that is functionally abnormal and does not propagate the normal peristaltic wave that moves to it from the proximal ganglionic bowel. The lesion originates in the rectum and extends proximally over a variable distance of the bowel. The further the lesion extends, the more difficult the management becomes. Clinical and radiologic findings can be useful in diagnosis, but they are not pathognomonic. The definitive diagnosis is made following suction biopsy of the rectum, colon, and ileum. Ultimate treatment for TCA is surgical, although no single surgical procedure has been proven superior. Total parenteral nutrition during the postoperative period is essential to ensure appropriate fluid and electrolyte status. Improvements in supportive care and earlier recognition and diagnosis of TCA in infants have led to a significantly increased rate of survival since the lesion was first recognized. The embryology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, management prognosis, and outcome of TCA are discussed. A case study is presented.","1088":"The use of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and intravenous fat emulsions in sick or preterm infants is often required to maintain adequate nutrition, yet recent research has shown that when exposed to light these nutrients are altered and deliver a high load of exogenous toxic hydroperoxides to already compromised infants. Hydroperoxides cause damage at the cellular level unless mediated by the body's antioxidant systems. NICU patients are, by definition, patients at risk. Preterm infants have low antioxidant reserves and, like sick term infants, typically suffer significant oxidative stress. Endogenous hydroperoxides alone may overwhelm defenses. The addition of hyperperoxides from light-exposed TPN or fat emulsions increases the risk of tissue damage. Hydroperoxides have been associated with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, chronic lung disease, retinopathy of prematurity, and necrotizing enterocolitis. By protecting these infusates from light, bedside nurses can reduce the amount of hydroperoxides infused and protect NICU patients from the associated risks.","1089":"This article reviews the embryology, physiology, and pathophysiology of the thymus. The anatomy of this lymphoid organ, the significance of the presence or absence of the thymus radiographically, and the role of the thymus in immunity are also reviewed. Finally, the pathologic presentation of thymic hypoplasia (DiGeorge syndrome) is discussed. Despite advances in modern science, little was known about the thymus, one of the body's key organs in the immune system, until 1961, when Dr. Jacques Miller performed thymectomies in mice. Then it became evident that the thymus played a key role in the body's defense against infection. Since that time, researchers have continued to examine the role of the thymus from fetal life through adulthood.","1090":"","1091":"","1092":"","1093":"Hypothermia is an important cause of morbidity--and occasionally mortality--in the newborn. This article explains the physiology of thermoregulation and thermogenesis in term infants.

Complications associated with cold stress and thcir etiologies, as well as methods for rewarming an infant, are also addresscd.","1094":"Screening the hearing of all newborns, both NICU and well nursery, is rapidly becoming the standard of care. The impetus for universal newborn hearing screening (UNHS) has come from outside the domain of nursing and the newborn nursery. Because nursing will be involved in nearly all aspects of UNHS, nurses need a thorough knowledge base about permanent childhood hearing loss (PCHL) and UNHS. Technology exisits today that can objectively and physiologically screen for this condition at a cost comparable to metabolic screening. PCHL occurs more than twice as often as all the hemoglobinopathies and inborn errors of metabolism combined. Undiagnosed hearing loss often leads to permanent developmental delays. The ultimate goal of early diagnosis and intervention for a congenital hearing loss is to enable the child to develop language and communication skills that correspond to his chronological age and innate cognitive abilities.","1095":"The purpose of this study was to describe the range and frequency of behaviors in neonates 24-30 weeks postconceptional age (PCA) using the Newborn Individualized Developmental Care Assessment Program (NIDCAP). A prospective design with convenience sampling was used. Starting 24-72 hours postnatally and continuing through 30 weeks PCA, 8,144 two-minute observations of 85 NIDCAP behaviors were collected and analyzed from 42 neonates born at 24-29 weeks gestation. The main outcome variables were the frequencies of the 85 neonatal behaviors measured by the NIDCAP. Frequencies were organized first by subsystem (autonomic, motor, or state) and were categorized further based on week of PCA. Comparisons of behavioral frequencies by number of weeks PCA were completed using correlation and regression analyses. The most frequently observed behaviors were irregular respirations, pink color, postured flexion of the extremities, immature light sleep, and drowsiness. Least frequently observed behaviors consisted of burps, bowel movement, grunting, smooth motor movements, cooing, and speech movement. Regression analysis illustrated that the pattern of behavior was significantly similar week to week.

Hyperinsulinemia is a rare cause of persistent hypoglycemia, diagnosed by excluding other etiologies. Inappropriately high fasting serum insulin levels with concurrent hypoglycemia confirm the diagnosis. Initial interventions for hyperinsulinemia are conservative. The first line of therapy is administration of adequate intravenous (i.v.) glucose to maintain serum or whole blood glucose levels at or greater than 40 mg\/dl. When enteral feedings are tolerated, schedules and caloric concentration are adjusted. Pharmacologic therapy is added to facilitate weaning from i.v. glucose. The drug of first choice is diazoxide. Octreotide is added if diazoxide therapy fails. Partial or complete pancreatectomy is the final treatment option. Nursing care for infants with hyperinsulinemia must also focus on the support and education of families. Family education must be individualized and should cover feeding regimes, administration of medication, proper use of equipment, and care during illness.","1102":"To describe and evaluate a parent education program to promote positive parenting in the NICU. Program evaluations completed by parent participants and staff members. 104 parents (59 mothers and 45 fathers) who attended the Parent's Circle; also 44 NICU or SCN staff members. MAIN OUTEOME VARIABLE: Family and staff evaluations of the Parent's Circle program. Families reported that attending Parent's Circle helped them gain perspective on their situation, feel supported, learn key developmental concepts, locate hospital and community resources, and optimize interactions with their fragile infant. Staff reported that the knowledge parents gained from Parent's Circle influenced their interactions and behaviors in the NICU. ","1103":"Research has established that breast milk is the best source of nutrition for the premature infant. Because the infant is born prematurely, the mother will need support in expressing breast milk for her infant's use. The clinical nurse has the opportunity to educate the mother on the importance of breast milk for the premature infant and to support the mother through the course of pumping. However, many nurses are not sufficiently educated in the physiology of lactation to adequately support the mother. The purpose of this article is to educate the bedside nurse in the physiology of lactation so that the mother is adequately assisted in expressing breast milk for her vulnerable infant.","1104":"Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite, has three modes of transmission: oral intake of raw or undercooked meat or contaminated fruits and vegetables, ingestion of materials contaminated with cat feces, and transplacental infection. The focus of this article is congenital toxoplasmosis, which is transmitted to the fetus across the placenta. When primary infection of the mother occurs during pregnancy, there is a 40 percent chance of fetal infection; rate of transmission and severity of infection are related to gestational age at the time of infection. The brain and retina are often affected, and there can be a wide range of clinical disease. Amniocentesis or cordocentesis provides the most accurate diagnosis. At birth, 80-90 percent of infants with congenital toxoplasmosis are asymptomatic. But further testing may reveal retinal and central nervous system abnormalities, and there is a risk of long-term sequelae. Chorioretinitis, hydrocephalus, intracranial calcifications, and convulsions are the typical presentation of classic congenital toxoplasmosis. Serology is the most common method of diagnosing neonatal infection, but more complex tests are also utilized. The prognosis for the untreated infant is poor; however, when antibiotic therapy is started early, the rate of sequelae is reduced significantly.","1105":"Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is a term that is used to describe the presence of multiple joint contractures at birth. AMC can be seen singularly or in conjunction with other abnormalities. Historically, the term arthrogryposis was used as a disease diagnosis, but it is now clear that AMC is not a disease entity but a syndrome, involving a manifestation of many fetal and neonatal disorders of the neuromuscular system. Its etiology is multifocal, and there is a wide variation in the degree to which muscles and joints are affected. Early identification and implementation of a plan of therapy are essential. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the AMC 'syndrome, specifically, clinical features, etiology, diagnosis, therapeutic interventions, family support, and outcomes.","1106":"The long-term developmental impact of nutrition on the preterm newborn has recently been shown to be of even greater importance than previously recognized. Very immature or ill infants are challenged by the need for a high caloric intake, but are unable to tolerate large fluid volumes. These patients may require enhanced-calorie formulas to achieve the desired growth goals. Formula enhancement has traditionally been performed by uniquely developed recipes of base formula concentration with the addition of powdered formula or single components such as medium-chain triglycerides oil, protein, or polycose. These mixtures have been largely unstudied for bioavailability, long-term outcomes, and tolerance. Deviation from recommended protein, fat, carbohydrate, mineral, and vitamin delivery limits may impair growth or lead to undesirable side effects. The practitioner must have an understanding of when and how to use an enhanced formula and the important monitoring and assessment needs of the patient receiving enhanced-calorie formula.","1107":"","1108":"The etiology of situs inversus totalis remains uncertain. However, the literature establishes that isolated situs inversus totalis is usually asymptomatic in the neonate. This case study illustrates the importance of physical assessment skills in identifying situs inversus totalis in the neonate. Current research may reveal the etiology of this rare but fascinating abnormality.","1109":"To describe the challenges mothers identify in bottle feeding their preterm infants prior to discharge from the NICU. Mothers bottle fed their infants in the NICU while being videotaped. Following the feeding, a semifocused interview was conducted with the mother using playback of the videotaped feeding to enhance exploration of the experience of feeding. The participants were 22 mothers of preterm infants (&lt; or = 1,500 grams). Mothers' challenges in feeding preterm infants. Mothers identified three major categories of challenge: ensuring safety during the feeding, ensuring adequate intake of calories, and advancing the feeding plan once home. Mothers described strategies they used to meet these challenges and discussed the implications some of these strategies held for them. ","1110":"With the emergence of advanced practice roles for nurses, including the role of the neonatal nurse practitioner (NNP), nurses are increasingly being placed in the position of making difficult decisions, especially in acute or emergency situations. NNPs, therefore, must have a working knowledge of the ethical decision-making process in order to make appropriate decisions at the bedside.","1111":"Because the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) can cause neurologic sequelae with the potential to affect long-term outcomes, its prompt recognition and treatment are essential. Normally, antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is secreted when effective circulating blood volume is decreased. SIADH is marked by secretion of ADH in the presence of effective or normal circulating blood volume. This causes plasma hyponatremia simultaneously with plasma hypo-osmolality and inappropriate hyperosmolality of the urine. This article explains the pathophysiology of the syndrome; describes its diagnosis, clinical course, and treatment; and exemplifies the syndrome with a case study.","1112":"Development of improved technologies in neonatal care has yielded increasing numbers of surviving low birth weight (LBW) infants who have challenged methods of supportive care. As researchers and practitioners have focused on respiratory, cardiac, and other body system requirements, nutritional support has been low on the priority list. Support for growth and maximized neurologic development, rather than simply for survival, has been the challenge in care of small and sick newborns. Use of insulin to enhance glucose tolerance in LBW infants, and thereby maximize growth, is a management modality that can be initiated early in the infant's course and is facilitated by implementation of clear and consistent policies and procedures. Continuous insulin infusions have been demonstrated to enhance glucose uptake and utilization--facilitating neonatal growth and in turn enhancing brain growth and developmental outcome.","1113":"Hypoglycemia is one of the most common clinical care issues facing the neonatal practitioner. Increasing evidence indicates that neonatal hypoglycemia may have long-term neurologic effects. Care is complicated by the lack of a clearly defined threshold for hypoglycemia in term and preterm infants, however, and by highly variable clinical signs and symptoms. Furthermore, many infants with low blood glucose measurements do not exhibit obvious signs of impairment. The complexity of neonatal glucose metabolism is illustrated by the variety of conditions producing or associated with both neonatal hypo- and hyperglycemia. Maintenance of euglycemia is especially challenging in the sick or low birth weight neonate. This article defines euglycemia by its range and reviews the differential diagnoses and etiology of hypoglycemia--as well as the principles of its management--in the neonatal period.","1114":"","1115":"","1116":"","1117":"As medical knowledge and technology continue to increase, so will the ability to provide life-sustaining support to patients who otherwise would not survive. Along with these advances comes the responsibility of not only meeting the clinical needs of our patients, but also of understanding how the family's culture and spirituality will affect their perception of the situation and their decision-making process. As the U.S. continues to become a more culturally diverse society, health care professionals will need to make changes in their practice to meet the psychosocial needs of their patients and respect their treatment decisions. Part I of this series (April 2002) discussed how the cultural and spiritual belief systems of Baby S's family affected their decision-making processes and also their ability to cope with the impending death of their infant. The development of a culturally competent health care team can help bridge the gap between culturally diverse individuals. This article addresses the following questions: 1. What legal alternatives are available to the staff to protect the patient from suffering associated with the continuation of futile life-sustaining support? 2. What conflicts might the staff experience as a result of the continuation of futile life-sustaining support? 3. What efforts can be made to support members of the staff? 4. What can be done to prepare others in the health care professions to deal more effectively with ethical\/cultural issues?","1118":"The survival rates for very low birth weight (VLBW) infants continue to increase while the morbidity rates show little improvement. Negative outcomes have been associated with hypoxia, hyperoxia, hypocarbia, barotrauma, intraventricular hemoRrhages, metabolic acidosis, cold stress, and overwhelming stimuli. Protection from iatrogenic harm must always be provided for the extremely fragile infant. Standards for resuscitation of the VLBW infant in the delivery room need to be expanded to reflect the physiologic and developmental care requirements. In this article, guidelines are proposed to address these needs.","1119":"As the prevalence of gambling increases in society, problem or pathologic gambling in new mothers may interfere with the bonding process as well as with infant and child care. Although neonatal nurses routinely screen for maternal addictions to substances such as alcohol, cocaine, and heroin, they are less likely to be alerted to signs of gambling addiction in new parents. This article presents a case study of a mother with a bingo preoccupation, provides neonatal nurses with an overview of problem and pathologic gambling, presents brief interview questions and a standardized screening tool for assessing gambling problems in parents, and suggests areas for intervention.","1120":"","1121":"","1122":"The nurse administering any BZD--especially lorazepam--to a neonate must be knowledgeable about the drug's effects and risks and must remember that BZDs do not provide analgesia. The sedative effects of lorazepam will increase with concomitant use of opioids. The nurse must be alert for adverse reactions (Table 1). Close monitoring of the neonate's respiratory effort and blood pressure is important. Because of the various reported cases of myoclonus in neonates after lorazepam administration, close observation for seizure activity is imperative. Although lorazepam use may be beneficial in specific instances, administration should be approached with caution in the neonate (especially in the preterm neonate) and other agents considered.","1123":"","1124":"In October, 2000, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Heart Association (AHA) introduced revised guidelines for the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP).

This article cannot address every program revision, but introduces the reader to how program changes occurred, guideline revisions that affect practice, and changes in NRP educational tools and resources.","1125":"To determine whether nonnutritive sucking (NNS) in preterm infants influences selected outcome variables. A systematic review, based on the Cochrane Collaboration format, of trials utilizing experimental or quasi-experimental designs in which NNS (by pacifier) was compared to no provision of NNS; related to naso\/orogastric tube feedings, bottle feedings, or not associated with feeding. All infants born at &lt; 37 weeks gestation. This review consisted of 19 studies; 13 were randomized controlled trials. Sample sizes ranged from 10 to 59 infants and totaled 518 infants. Weight gain, energy intake, heart rate, oxygen saturation, length of hospital stay, intestinal transit time, and postconceptional age at full oral feedings. NNS significantly decreased the length of hospital stay in preterm infants. The review did not reveal a consistent benefit of NNS with respect to other major clinical variables. No negative outcomes were reported in any of the studies. ","1126":"Apnea of prematurity is a common problem of the premature infant under 30 weeks gestation. Theophylline and caffeine, two methylxanthines, are widely used to treat this condition. The drugs are equally effective in preventing apnea in the premature infant. Caffeine citrate has many advantages over theophylline, however, including once-a-day dosing, more predictable plasma concentrations, earlier onset of action, and minimal side effects. Caffeine is therefore the initial drug of choice for apnea of prematurity.","1127":"Despite development of many prevention and treatment modalities for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a form of chronic respiratory insufficiency in premature infants recovering from respiratory distress syndrome, BPD remains a treatment challenge and a significant cause of long-term morbidity. A ventilator-dependent very low birth weight infant in our newborn special care unit was receiving multiple courses of systemic dexamethasone for severe respiratory failure. The infant demonstrated adrenal suppression manifested by a baseline cortisol concentration below reported levels in infants of similar birth weight and postnatal age. We hypothesized that he had developed adrenal insufficiency as a result of the prolonged systemic steroid administration used to treat his respiratory problems. We further hypothesized that inhaled beclomethasone therapy would aid in the infant's recovery phase during relative adrenal insufficiency--and so substituted inhaled for systemic steroids. Inhaled corticosteroid treatment improved the clinical respiratory course and postnatal growth of this premature infant with BPD without inhibiting his recovery from adrenal insufficiency.","1128":"The thyroid gland contains many follicular cells that store the thyroid hormones within the thyroglobulin molecule until they are needed by the body. The thyroid hormones, often referred to as the major metabolic hormones, affect virtually every cell in the body. Synthesis and secretion of the thyroid hormones depend on the presence of iodine and tyrosine as well as maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid system. Interruption of this development, as occurs with premature delivery, results in inadequate production of thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroxine, leading to a variety of physiologic conditions. Pathologic conditions occur in the presence of insufficient thyroid production or a defect in the thyroid gland. Laboratory tests are important in diagnosing conditions of the thyroid gland. A thorough history in combination with clinical manifestations and radiologic findings are also useful in diagnosing specific thyroid conditions. Nurses play an important role in identifying and managing thyroid disorders and in providing supportive care to infants and their families.","1129":"The hypothalamus is an integral part of the neuroendocrine system.

Adequate resources were more strongly related to positive adjustment and decreased stress than were either coping or being a first-time parent. The relationships among the variables were generally the same for both parents. Mothers utilized more coping strategies than did fathers. PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS: Families with limited resources should be identified early to facilitate their adjustment to the NICU. ","1135":"Apnea is a disorder of respiratory control commonly seen in premature infants. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain apnea, and many clinical conditions have been associated with its development. Apnea of prematurity is seen in infants less than 37 weeks gestation, with the incidence increasing as gestational age decreases. Expert and consistent nursing care is essential for management of premature infants with apnea.

These findings occur as a result of the following: (1) A left-to-right shunt or mixing lesion in which excess volume of blood flow causes dilation of cardiac chambers, resulting in the appearance of cardiomegaly, and in which increased pulmonary artery blood flow causes increased pulmonary vascular markings; (2) Obstruction of blood flow that produces pulmonary venous hypertension and resultant pulmonary edema.","1141":"The chest x-ray can be a valuable tool as part of the initial evaluation of a neonate with clinical signs of congenital heart disease. The radiographic appearance of pulmonary vascularity, as well as cardiac size and configuration, can provide information about the pathophysiologic effect of a cardiac lesion. Along with clinical evaluation of the infant, information gathered from the x-ray may be helpful in indicating which cardiac defect is involved. However, final identification of a defect would require further evaluation by echocardiogram or cardiac catheterization.","1142":"","1143":"The birth of a premature or critically ill infant can result in debilitating parental responses.

The qualitative design was based on Spradley's method. Data were collected by interviewing ten nurses who worked in an NICU during a pilot study of FFDC. Transcripts were analyzed using Spradley's domain analysis. Four themes describe aspects of the transition from traditional care to FFDC: (1) negative experiences of FFDC, (2) transitions central to partnering with parents, (3) positive experiences of parental participation, and (4) organizational transitions necessary for the move to a family-centered model of care.

Nurses, parents, economists, and ethicists have questioned resuscitation of ELBW neonates, many of whom experience high levels of morbidity and mortality. Yet no systematic studies were found that addressed physicians' perceptions and delivery room decisions. Descriptive, using naturalistic inquiry. A national U.S. convenience sample was obtained in 1996-1997 of 54 physicians in five perinatal subspecialties who resuscitated ELBW neonates. Tape-recorded and transcribed interviews were analyzed using NUD*IST software and line-by-line constant comparison. Despite awareness of the high morbidity and mortality, 96 percent of the physicians offered resuscitation to all ELBW neonates in the delivery room. The main factors affecting their decisions were \"the role of the physician;\" having been \"trained to save lives;\" the belief that \"if called, I resuscitate;\" the inability to determine gestational age; requests from parents to \"do everything;\" and the need to move from a \"chaotic\" delivery room to a controlled neonatal intensive care unit. Six major themes were: role expectation, uncertainty, awareness, internal and external forces, burden, and continuing quandaries. Physicians were burdened by the devastated and dying babies, by their inability to predict which neonates had a chance for intact survival, and by conflicts with colleagues about viability. Statistical probability of survival, legal constraints, and cost of care did not appear to affect greatly their decisions. Physicians asked that society and national policy makers set parameters for resuscitation. The American Academy of Pediatrics' Neonatal Resuscitation Protocol needs revision to delineate the ethical criteria for resuscitation. Early prenatal education for families which clearly teaches the margins of viability and outcomes of early deliveries is also recommended.

The gland consists of the adenohypophysis (anterior pituitary) and the neurohypophysis (posterior pituitary), two unique structures that differ anatomically and functionally. The neurohypophysis is innervated by nerve cells in the hypothalamus and forms the connection between it and the pituitary gland. The hypothalamus stimulates release and inhibition of pituitary hormones. The neurohypophysis secretes oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone. The adenohypophysis is composed of three structures: the pars distalis, the pars intermedia, and the pars tuberalis. The anterior pituitary (pars distalis) is responsible for the release of hormones that include growth hormone, prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and melanocyte-stimulating hormone.

A cry is a series of four movements that basically resembles a Valsalva maneuver. Documented immediate and long-term sequelae of crying include increased heart rate and blood pressure, reduced oxygen level, elevated cerebral blood pressure, initiation of the stress response, depleted energy reserves and oxygen, interrupted mother-infant interaction, brain injury, and cardiac dysfunction. Caregivers are encouraged to answer infant cries swiftly, consistently, and comprehensively. Kangaroo care is an efficient method for preventing, minimizing, and halting crying. Other interventions for crying include swaddled holding, a pacifier, sugar water, a sweet-tasting nonsucrose solution, heartbeat sounds, distraction by lullabies or mother's voice, rhythmic movement, and reduction of external stimuli.","1202":"Role transition is never easy, but is complicated by the experienced neonatal nurse's frustration with reverting to a student role and becoming a novice practitioner, sometimes after years of developing a reputation as an expert nurse. This article discusses this transition, focusing on the skills needed to move successfully from nurse to nurse practitioner. Common to all advanced practice transitions are stages similar to those Benner identifies in her novice-to-expert theory of nursing practice. Feelings of frustration and inadequacy are common during the first year as an NNP. Studies focusing on role transition and role development suggest that a strong nursing identity is important for success in the NNP practice environment.

","1228":"Cisapride has been used in the neonatal population as a first-line gastrointestinal prokinetic agent for managing feeding intolerance secondary to decreased gastrointestinal motility. Cisapride acts specifically at many levels of the gastrointestinal tract and has no central nervous system side effects. Recently, prolonged QT interval has been reported secondary to high-dose cisapride, and concerns regarding its use in premature infants have been raised. In response, Janssen-Ortho Inc. and Janssen Pharmaceutica, the manufacturers of cisapride in Canada and the U.S., have released safety information prohibiting the use of cisapride in premature infants. In light of the present evidence, it is imperative that NICUs that continue to prescribe cisapride for the management of feeding intolerance exercise vigilance in cardiac monitoring and recognize the importance of drug interactions that lead to elevated cisapride levels.","1229":"Newly discovered genes and advances in genetic screening programs prompt many questions reflecting the kinds of ethical dilemmas that go hand in hand with life-changing discoveries.

Contamination precautions varied; most nurseries used Y-administration sets and extension tubing for medication administration into the PCVC system. ","1295":"Umbilical catheters have been used in NICUs for drawing blood samples, measuring blood pressure, and administering fluid and medications for more than 25 years. Complications associated with umbilical catheters include thrombosis; embolism; vasospasm; vessel perforation; hemorrhage; infection; gastrointestinal, renal, and limb tissue damage; hepatic necrosis; hydrothorax; cardiac arrhythmias; pericardial effusion and tamponade; and erosion of the atrium and ventricle. A review of the literature provides conflicting accounts of the superiority of high versus low placement of umbilical arterial catheters. This article reviews the current literature regarding use of umbilical catheters in neonates. It also highlights the policy developed for the authors' NICU, a 34-bed tertiary care unit of a children's hospital, and analyzes complications associated with umbilical catheter use for 1 year in that unit.","1296":"This article continues the series describing the presentation and treatment of congenital cardiac disease in the neonatal period. Cardiac anomalies that restrict the return of blood to the left atrium are reviewed. These include total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (with emphasis on TAPVC with obstruction), mitral atresia and mitral stenosis, and pulmonary vein obstruction. Incidence, embryology, pathophysiology and hemodynamics, clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, and medical and nursing management, as well as surgical repair and prognosis, are discussed for each of these defects. Parental support and teaching related to all forms of congenital cardiac disease are also addressed.","1297":"This method of holding infants has rapidly evolved as a practice in intensive care nurseries to support parenting.

We report two cases in which migration of the catheter into the right atrium resulted in rapid onset of shocklike symptoms. Pericardial effusion and tamponade were diagnosed by echocardiography. Subxiphoid pericardiocenteses were performed, with immediate clinical improvement. In both cases, fluid withdrawn from the pericardial space was analyzed to be hyperalimentation and intravenous fat emulsion. Pericardial effusion and tamponade should be suspected in any infant with a PSC line in place who develops sudden onset of shocklike symptoms.","1306":"The purpose of this study was to compare temperature measurements from glass\/mercury thermometers to Tempa.Dot Single-Use Clinical Thermometer, B-D Digital Fever Thermometer, Mon-a-Therm Model 1000 Skin Temperature Monitor, IVAC CORE.CHECK Tympanic Thermometer, and IncuTemp3 radiant warmer skin temperature sensor measurements. The effects of ten environmental, developmental, and pharmacological factors on thermometer readings were also assessed. The design was descriptive. The convenience sample included 220 infants &gt; or = 1,500 gm (average weight of 2,715 +\/- 743 gm). Average age was 17 +\/- 22 days of life. The outcomes were comparisons between the \"reference\" axillary glass\/mercury thermometer readings and axillary, skin, and tympanic measurements obtained from other thermometers. The B-D Digital Fever thermometer had the highest correlation with the glass\/mercury thermometer for axillary temperature. Tempa.DOT measurements showed the next highest correlation with the glass\/mercury thermometer measurements. Tympanic temperature measured by CORE.CHECK was moderately correlated with the glass\/mercury thermometer measurement. Skin temperatures were influenced by nesting, clothing, swaddling, and probe site placement. Tympanic readings showed effects of bed type and environmental temperature. ","1307":"Hyperbilirubinemia is a common problem, affecting 45-60 percent of term infants and up to 80 percent of premature neonates. Phototherapy, the standard treatment for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, is effective but has the potential for adverse effects. Prevention of bilirubin formation, rather than dependence on therapeutic measures to remove excess bile pigment, is a logical alternative. Metalloporphyrins--specifically tin-protoporphyrin (SnPP) and tin-mesoporphyrin (SnMP)--are being used experimentally to prevent and treat neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. This article reports the findings of studies exploring the use of SnPP and SnMP.","1308":"Treatment of the child with congenital heart disease continues to challenge the medical profession. Although advances in technology have improved survival statistics over the past two decades, dealing with the effects on the family of the birth of a child with congenital heart disease has received minimal attention. Most nursing interventions focus on the immediate needs of the family related to the death of their child. Nurses must increase their awareness of the effects of the diagnosis itself on the family. To better help the family in crisis, nurses must understand the concept of death of the \"normal\" child and must also recognize the effects this diagnosis can have on personal relationships.","1309":"","1310":"","1311":"It is important for all nurses to apply research findings to their practice.

In the study, which used an exploratory design, data were collected from mothers (n = 14) of infants admitted to the neonatal unit with a primary diagnosis of low birth weight. Participants were interviewed using a semistructured interview guide. Transcripts were analyzed using the constant comparative method. Four themes illustrating the value perceptions of mothers related to their low birth weight infants and the neonatal intensive care experience were identified. The emergent themes describe the mothers' desire to parent their children and the mothers' values related to the integration of technology and human interaction in the environment of the neonatal intensive care unit.","1317":"Home care is replacing the traditional hospital stay for a variety of acute and chronic illnesses. The delivery of home antibiotic infusion therapy is an innovative treatment approach for stable term infants with suspected or confirmed infection. Neonates are a unique group of home i.v. therapy recipients, and programs specific to the needs of this population must be developed.

To evaluate the use of these patient care models in the neonatal population, one Level III NICU compared data on 146 infants who ranged in gestational age from 24 to 33 weeks. Nine clinical benchmarks were identified as serving to define the infant's progress. These nine benchmarks were back to birth weight, extubation, discontinuation of hyperalimentation, discontinuation of NCPAP, feeding trial via orogastric tube, weaned to open crib, discontinuation of oxygen, full oral feedings, and discharge home. Gestational age was consistently observed to be the dominant determinant of the infant's readiness to achieve these physiologic tasks. The result of this project is a neonatal care map, based on gestational age. This care map outlines the expected treatment and response of the neonatal patient. It serves as a guide for both clinicians and families.","1337":"To implement three aspects of developmental care: lower noise levels, decreased light levels, and flexed, midline positioning.

A qualitative study utilizing artifact collection, participant observation, and semistructured interviews. Seven families that went to the clinic. What parents did and did not like about the clinic and what they would change about the clinic. Parent concerns included lack of information about the clinic prior to the first appointment, length of wait prior to seeing the physician, preference for more appropriate toys for use during the wait, desire for additional explanations during the exam process, uncertainty about the effects of prematurity on their child's development, and need for more developmental and parenting information. ","1344":"Severe congenital nemaline myopathy is an uncommon but often fatal muscular disease. Dealing with this disorder can be devastating to both family and NICU staff. It can be difficult to diagnose because symptoms often mimic symptoms of a postasphyxial insult. Continued dependence on mechanical ventilation in the absence of severe brain damage or other cardiac or respiratory disease may be the only indication of this disorder. This article records the author's personal experience of caring for an infant with the severe form of nemaline myopathy.","1345":"Capillary blood sampling via a heelstick is a common procedure performed on hospitalized neonates. If not performed properly, a heelstick can lead to complications. The clinical and financial impact of complications and redrawing of blood can be significant.

Most are benign and 70 to 80 percent regress by age seven. Some hemangiomas are life threatening--1 in 300 is associated with coagulopathy. Kasabach-Merritt syndrome (KMS), associated with hemangioma, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, microangiopathic anemia, and thrombocytopenia, can have profound sequelae. Morbidity and mortality are influenced by the anatomic location and size of the hemangioma. Untreated KMS has a 10-37 percent mortality rate. Bleeding secondary to the consumptive coagulopathy is the primary cause of death in these patients. As of 1997, there have been approximately 205 cases of KMS reported in the literature.

Twenty-two preterm infants were assigned to experimental and control groups using a randomized, matched-pair design. Over a three-week period, infants in the experimental group were provided a 1 1\/2-hour nap period four times a day during which their beds were covered and they were left undisturbed. Control infants received standard nursing care. The infants in the experimental group had more apnea at the start of the study than the control infants but showed a significantly more rapid decline in the incidence of apnea. These infants also gained significantly more weight per day than the control infants. Thus, a simple modification of nursing care that involved minimal increases in nursing time had a beneficial effect on preterm infants.","1353":"Certain congenital heart defects require surgical intervention if the neonate is to survive. In some cases, the correction involves open heart surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass. A Level III NICU implemented a program to prepare itself to accept neonates directly from the OR for recovery. The benefits of caring for these infants in the NICU include staff's expert knowledge of neonatal anatomy and physiology, experience in supporting the family, and an awareness of the developmental needs of the neonate. A needs assessment of the NICU identified areas to address in preparation for this initiative. An extensive program was implemented to strengthen staff knowledge of pathophysiology, enhance technical skills, and purchase necessary equipment. This investment has resulted in close to 100 infants successfully recovered in the NICU. With meticulous planning, the NICU can be the unit of choice for providing excellent care to these critically ill neonates and their families.","1354":"Severe congenital neutropenia, or Kostmann syndrome, describes a rare autosomal recessive disorder in which the neutrophils fail to reach a mature and functional state. The infant with SCN often presents with severe infections beginning in the first month of life. Recently, treatment with recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor has been found to be effective in reducing the mortality and morbidity of this often fatal disorder.","1355":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is one of the most significant sequelae of prematurity, affecting the pulmonary and cardiovascular structures especially. From the first weeks of life, there exists a close anatomical and functional relationship between these two systems. Changes in intrathoracic pressure or pulmonary vascular resistance greatly impact both the left and right sides of the heart. In turn, increasing afterload and decreasing preload affect blood flow through the lung, as well as the state of oxygenation and ventilation. BPD affects the function, growth, and development of the heart and lung, due to the hypoxia, acidosis, hyperoxia, and fibrosis associated with the fibroproliferative repair process. Significance of clinical findings and the role of the bedside caregiver are also discussed.","1356":"Providing a developmental care approach does not mean you must have all the latest positioning aids and the best technology for reducing light and noise in your nursery. Providing a developmental care approach means realizing that you are going to communicate with the baby and that the baby will communicate with you as you care for him. As you observe the baby and watch what he tells you, you can adjust your care to those messages. You will feel different about your care, and you will be enriched beyond your expectations.","1357":"Although reliable hemostasis screening in the newborn is difficult to obtain, the information gained from such testing is essential in differentiating the inherited from the acquired bleeding disorder. Sick infants are at risk for developing hemorrhage or thrombosis in response to a variety of diseases or injuries. Screening tests must be interpreted using appropriate normal ranges for term or preterm infants. Neonates are particularly susceptible to DIC because of their underdeveloped reticuloendothelial system and their tendency to develop acidosis, hypothermia, hypoxia, and shock. Bleeding is commonly the results of intravascular coagulation or decreased synthesis of clotting factors by the liver. Criteria based on clinical and laboratory findings have been determined in adults; however, these criteria are not necessarily applicable to neonates. A study reviewing 74 cases of newborns with suspected DIC reported that the most reliable diagnostic tests are the platelet count, D-dimer or FDP, PT, PTT, and fibrinogen. Whatever the test, the nurse's accurate assessment of the neonate, careful collection of blood, and reporting of abnormal results remain paramount in obtaining timely, appropriate care.","1358":"During my trip to China, I saw how many factors interact to influence maternal and child health. These factors cover a broad scope of biologic, behavioral, environmental, and socioeconomic issues. The experience proved to be invaluable. It has helped me to understand how these factors differ--and how they are alike--in China, Canada, and other cultures.","1359":"","1360":"","1361":"A Neonatal Integrated Home Care Program was developed to cross-train NICU staff nurses to provide follow-up care for high-risk neonates in the home. Implementation required collaboration of the NICU and the Center for Home Care and Hospice. Initial target populations were premature infants in transition to oral feeds and oxygen-dependent neonates. Staff, parent, and insurer enthusiasm for this innovative program resulted in expansion to serve infants and families with many other care needs. Continuity of care provides an invaluable resource for families at home with their high-risk infants. Outcomes include reduction in NICU length of stay and readmission for this population. The NICU home care team shares experiences with staff, increasing awareness of and sensitivity to family strengths and discharge realities. The program has fostered revisions in practice regarding preparation for discharge and education of families, facilitating the transition to home following NICU hospitalization.","1362":"Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the primary cause of infant death outside the neonatal period. The etiology of SIDS has been studied extensively but remains unclear. In 1992, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) responded to international research that suggested an association between SIDS and prone sleeping patterns. Controversial guidelines on infant sleep position were issued at this time, advocating supine or sidelying positions. The AAP modified their initial guidelines in 1996, recommending supine as the preferred sleep position during infancy. The AAP stressed that both sidelying and supine positions place an infant at less risk for SIDS than the prone position, but that supine offered the lowest risk of SIDS. The AAP reaffirmed that these guidelines were intended for healthy newborns only, and also modified some of the original recommendations to reflect the latest research on SIDS. This article provides a brief overview of SIDS and the events leading to the current AAP stance on infant positioning. Parent education is addressed, with specific recommendations for discharge teaching.","1363":"A systematic computerized search of all databases was performed to review the scientific evidence in support of the efficacy of cisapride in reducing feeding intolerance in premature infants. Reference lists from these articles were used to identify relevant scientific literature to address important aspects of the use of cisapride. Three open prospective, uncontrolled studies were found. All studies reported improved clinical outcomes as evidenced by decreased gastric residuals, decreased incidence of vomiting, increased feeding volume, decrease in all reflux parameters measured, and increased weight gain. These observational studies reflect the current state of knowledge and have important research and clinical implications because of the profound effects of feeding intolerance on infant growth and development and on length of stay within NICUs.","1364":"Signs of congestive heart failure can be subtle and vary in the time frame of presentation. As a result, this diagnosis is often missed in its early stages. This article reviews risk factors for myocardial dysfunction in the newborn period. Additionally, there is a comprehensive overview of cardiac physiology as it relates to the presentation of symptoms of congestive heart failure. This information is presented to provide a foundation of knowledge related to physiologic changes involved in congestive heart failure so that the health care provider can recognize congestive heart failure early.","1365":"","1366":"","1367":"","1368":"It is the position of the National Association of Neonatal Nurses that an essential component of early discharge of the high risk neonate must be neonatal follow-up care. Broad guidelines for neonatal follow-up care have been outlined. Neonatal follow-up care must be performed by qualified health professionals and experienced neonatal registered nurses knowledgeable in the specialized needs of the high risk neonate. If follow-up care is an unavailable service of the unit, the neonate's care after discharge should be coordinated with the nearest existing program. Successful follow-up care will result in improved neonatal and family outcomes.","1369":"It is the position of the National Association of Neonatal Nurses that in order for the neonate's specialized needs to be met in this era of early discharge, broad guidelines must exist for such discharge. Discharge preparations and follow-up care must be performed by knowledgeable and experienced neonatal registered nurses who can determine readiness for discharge and home care needs. Early discharge may be appropriate and safe if all discharge and teaching criteria are met to assure positive neonatal and family outcomes.","1370":"Hypoglycemia is a common problem among neonates. Transient in nature, it usually resolves with an increase in glucose intake. However, as clinicians, we must recognize that prolonged hypoglycemia may be caused by increased insulin production. Nesidioblastosis is one cause of persistent hyperinsulinism of the newborn. This case study reviews fetal physiology, neonatal presentation, and treatment.","1371":"A retrospective study of the stool patterns of 68 infants was conducted. The sample included 34 infants who developed necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and 34 infants who did not. The objective was to compare the stool patterns of the two groups. Data regarding number and characteristics of stools; time, types, and methods of feeding; feeding additives; and demographic information were extracted from inpatient medical records. Length of time between the passage of the first stool and initiation of the first feeding in the two groups was compared using the Wilcoxin Rank Sum Test. Findings were statistically significant (p = .008). Numbers of stools were compared using the Fisher Exact Test. Findings were significantly greater for the NEC group. Infants in the NEC group had 26 percent more stools and more than twice as many seedy stools as infants in the non-NEC group.","1372":"The neurologic examination of the newborn infant is not easy. The nurse or physician must have technical skill in handling infants and be familiar with eliciting, scoring, and interpreting reflexes. Because it is too costly to conduct full neurologic exams on all newborns, a screening can be performed to help select infants for whom detailed examination is indicated. Given the trend to discharge term newborns within 12 to 24 hours following delivery and the importance of being sure that abnormalities have not been overlooked prior to discharge, completing a neurologic screen during this early time period is warranted. Although professionals have been trained and certified to conduct Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) exams for more than 20 years at NBAS Training Centers, the NBAS text does not adequately explain how to perform reflex assessments so they can be administered reliably across multiple examiners. This article describes how to perform these reflex assessments so they can be used consistently by nurses and physicians as a neurologic screen in a variety of settings.","1373":"Timely and accurate interpretation of blood gases is of paramount importance in providing comprehensive neonatal care. Disorders of acid-base balance may evolve quickly in respiratory problems or develop over time with metabolic imbalances. In many cases, the interpretation of acid-base disorders may be complicated by the mixed metabolic and respiratory origins of the disorder. An overview of the underlying physiology of acid-base balance and oxygen transport helps the nurse understand the causes and subsequent treatments of the various disorders. Such an overview was presented in part I of this series (Vol. 16, No. 5). This article presents a discussion of the four basic types of acid-base disorders. A systematic plan for blood gas evaluation is presented, along with several case studies illustrating the principles of blood gas analysis.","1374":"The clinical course of a newborn can be rendered more complex by the sudden development of a disturbance in heart rhythm and conduction. The caregiver's ability to recognize a particular dysrhythmia and its most probable mechanism is crucial for optimal management. During the past 15 years, there has been significant progress in the understanding of the electrophysiologic basis of rhythm disturbances in the newborn period. This understanding has led to more precise diagnosis and effective treatment regimens for infants with dysrhythmias. Using recent case studies from one intensive care nursery as illustrations, this article discusses the clinical presentation and electrophysiologic mechanisms of three common forms of rhythm and conduction disturbance. The discussion pertains to disturbances of rhythm in association with tachycardia only. Emphasis is placed on the electrocardiographic diagnosis and clinical management of these infants.","1375":"","1376":"Clinical exemplars enable nurses to demonstrate the critical thinking and decision making that define the delivery of excellent patient care. Exemplars are an important tool for making the invisible work of nursing visible to nursing colleagues, other health care professionals, and the health care consumer. In today's climate of health care reform, nurses must showcase their skills and talents if they are not to be replaced with less well trained, unlicensed health care personnel.","1377":"","1378":"The purpose of this research was to examine the effect of behavioral state activity during nipple feeding on feeding success for a group of 20 preterm infants. The infants, fed per hospital policy at scheduled three-hour intervals, were observed during four early nipple feedings. Nine of the 20 infants were able to successfully nipple their four nipple feedings; the other 11 infants were unable to successfully complete their nipple feedings. The 9 successful feeders exhibited significantly more awake behavior during feeding than unsuccessful feeders (F = 7.82; p = .012). The unsuccessful feeders spent 53 percent of their feeding in sleep states; successful feeders were in sleep states only 30 percent of their feeding time. Along with other research, these findings suggest that infant behavioral state may be a key consideration for nipple feeding success in preterm infants.","1379":"Care of the pregnant woman with diabetes and the infant of that mother presents a challenge to both perinatal and neonatal nurses. This article reviews the pathophysiology of diabetes in pregnancy; discusses various complications of the fetus, newborn, and child; outlines management strategies aimed at decreasing complications and improving outcomes; and addresses specific nursing responsibilities related to these management strategies.","1380":"Accurate interpretation of blood gases is paramount in clinical management in the NICU. This interpretation should be based on a sound understanding of acid-base physiology. Acid-base homeostasis depends on a series of complex chemical reactions controlled by the kidneys and the lungs. The maintenance of a blood pH within the narrow range required for normal cellular reactions requires a balance between acid production and excretion. Somewhat separate but equally important to blood gas interpretation is an understanding of oxygen transport. Included in this is the relationship between oxygen and hemoglobin. This article, the first in a two-part series, discusses the physiology of acid-base balance and oxygen transportation. The second article provides an approach for systematic interpretation of blood gases.","1381":"Advances in technology over the past 15 years have given birth to a new field of multidisciplinary cardiovascular care and research, that of perinatal cardiology. Today's neonatal nurse must become familiar with the battery of tools that may be enlisted to assist in the assessment, diagnosis, intervention, and evaluation of cardiac disorders and therapeutic maneuvers in the neonate. In the first part of this two-part article, the standard initial examination of the history and physical, the chest x-ray, and the electrocardiogram were reviewed.

Forty-four mothers of three-year-old prematurely born children were interviewed as part of a longitudinal study. Data from maternal interviews were analyzed using the analytic inductive method. Findings support the hypotheses that were based on the Parental Stress in the ICU model. Three years after the birth of their premature infants, mothers reported vivid memories of stress related to the appearance and behavior of their infants, the pain and procedures the infants endured, alterations in their role as parents, and stress related to the infant's illness severity and uncertainty about infant outcomes. Prenatal problems, such as high-risk pregnancy or birth, infant loss, and disturbances in family support, were also recalled as sources of stress. Findings have implications for family-centered nursing care in NICUs.","1392":"Cerebral palsy (CP) can be identified and classified by thorough evaluation using multiple assessment techniques. Clinical signs, symptoms, associated disorders, and methods used to evaluate developmental disorders have been described. Because some of the previously used evaluation methods have not been adequate tools, new ways of measuring outcome have been proposed. Multidisciplinary treatment protocols have been recommended. Simplistic plans of care will not be appropriate because of the complexity of the disorder(s) and the unique characteristics of the individual and family. Therefore, thoughtful and individualized plans of care that may include multiple surgical and nonsurgical interventions must be developed for each child with CP.

Suggestions are also made for implementing this concept in the normal new-born nursery, utilizing Lewin's change theory.","1400":"Painful procedures may lead to both long- and short-term complications in low birth weight (LBW) infants. This study investigated neonatal pain responses (grimace, slight cry expression, increased cry expression, and knee\/leg flexion) during six painful and three nonpainful procedures. The 30 LBW infants studied were less than 48 hours of age and less than 34 weeks gestation, with a mean birth weight of 1,320 gm. The design was comparative; data analysis included repeated measures of analysis of variance, independent t-tests, and paired t-tests. The four pain responses were found to be present 75 to 100 percent of the time after painful procedures (suctioning, skin puncture, dressing change or removal, discontinuation of intravenous line, and insertion of a nasogastric tube). They were also found to be present 49 to 69 percent of the time after nonpainful procedures (total position change, addition\/withdrawal of fluid from umbilical catheter, and IV administration of medication).","1401":"The neonatal nurse is a vital link in the recognition and management of infants born with congenital heart disease. This article examines the acyanotic cardiac defects with increased pulmonary blood flow: patent ductus arteriosus, atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, and endocardial cushion defects. The hemodynamics, clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, surgical repair, and medical management of each defect are presented. Parental teaching needs are identified and discussed.","1402":"Cerebral palsy (CP) is a nonprogressive disorder of motor function. Although it has been recognized for more than a century, much remains unknown regarding its etiology. It has been estimated that 17 to 60 percent of the cases of CP have no known perinatal or neonatal complications. Undocumented antenatal events may cause brain damage or increase the infant's vulnerability to future events. The prevalence of CP has remained relatively constant; however, its incidence in the preterm population has increased with the improving survival of the very low birth weight infant.","1403":"","1404":"","1405":"","1406":"Bedside whole blood glucose screening in the NICU has been an accepted method of care for several years. Meters or visually read reagent strips are used in bedside screening, but the reliability and accuracy of these methods are not always established before they are implemented as routine practice in the NICU. A study was conducted to determine which method of bedside whole blood glucose screening was the more accurate: visually read Chemstrip bG reagent strips or the One Touch II meter method. The values obtained were compared with lab analysis of serum glucose, and a correlation study was performed to compare the accuracy and reliability of the values produced by the two methods. One hundred samples were obtained from 38 NICU infants; 63 percent of the 100 samples were compared with lab values. Results revealed that the One Touch II method was more reliable (r = .92) than the Chemstrip bG method (r = .87). Furthermore, the One Touch II results correlated better with lab values when the meter was not operated in the neonatal mode. This study revealed that the One Touch II method appears to provide safe and accurate screening of bedside blood glucose in a high-risk neonatal population.","1407":"This study evaluated the effects of an occlusive (OpSite Flexigrid) dressing on bacterial growth over excoriated and the surrounding intact skin of eight premature infants. Cultures were obtained before placement and four days after dressing placement. An analysis of variance demonstrated significant increases in coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and overall total skin. No significant differences in bacterial growth occurred between intact skin underneath the dressing and that on the opposite side of the body post-dressing placement. Significant increases were found in bacterial concentrations for both intact and excoriated skin post-dressing placement. Small sample size and no between-subject design hinder generalization to the neonatal population.","1408":"Neonatal hypoglycemia is a common phenomenon in the newborn infant. The neonatal nurse has the primary responsibility for identifying infants at risk and early warning signs. This article outlines the definition, central nervous system symptomatology, incidence, risk factors, etiology, and pathophysiology of low blood glucose levels. An understanding of the three basic mechanisms of glucose homeostasis-glycogenolysis, glycolysis, and glyconcogenesis-is crucial for the nurse caring for any newborn infant, particularly those at risk. All personnel involved in blood sampling must be carefully trained; proper screening and laboratory blood sampling techniques for glucose measurement cannot be overemphasized. Inaccurate results produced by faulty techniques can lead to misdiagnosis and improper treatment. A plan of care including glucose screening on initial assessment and follow-up must be, considered whenever hypoglycemic symptoms are observed or risk factors are present. Knowledge of appropriate interventions and outcome evaluation for hypoglycemia is the responsibility of the neonatal nurse.","1409":"In utero, there is increased pulmonary vascular resistance favoring minimal pulmonary blood flow and right-to-left shunting of blood through the ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale. Delivery initiates a series of complex biochemical and structural changes whereby the neonate assumes those processes critical to survival. This article reviews fetal circulation, the characteristics of the fetal cardiopulmonary system, and the transition from fetal to neonatal circulation. It also discusses the consequences of disrupted transition to extrauterine life and the relationship between fetal cardiopulmonary anatomy and congenital heart disease.","1410":"","1411":"","1412":"","1413":"","1414":"Blood pressure measurements are a common indicator of cardiovascular status. The two most frequently used methods of obtaining this measurement in the NICU are direct measurement using an umbilical arterial catheter and indirect measurement with a cuff. Cuff values obtained from the upper arm or thigh are reported to correlate with umbilical arterial measurements. It is common practice in some NICUs to utilize the calf of the infant's leg to obtain cuff blood pressure readings. The goal of this pilot investigation was to determine if blood pressure values obtained from the left calf of neonates weighing at least 800 gm correlate with measurements obtained from the umbilical arterial catheter. A descriptive correlational design was used for this investigation. A convenience sample of 20 infants was obtained. Data were analyzed using the Pearson r with a significance level of .01.","1415":"The cardiovascular system is the first major organ system to develop in the embryo, being fully formed and functioning by the eighth week of gestation. This early, rapid development may explain the prevalence of congenital heart disease. Infants with congenital heart disease require considerable nursing skill and an understanding of the particular diagnosis. Nurses who understand basic cardiac embryology will better understand the various defects, how they occur, and how they affect cardiac physiology and functioning. This article discusses development of the heart and major vessels arising from the heart and relates stages of development to corresponding congenital heart defects.","1416":"A descriptive study was conducted to identify sources of parental stress in two types of NICUs. Data were collected from 212 parents and a single interview was done within three weeks of the infant's admission. Parents completed the Parental Stressor Scale: NICU, Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Life Events Scale, and Parent Questionnaire. Data extracted from the infant's chart were used to complete the Neonatal Morbidity Scale and Baby Data Sheet. Data were analyzed using multiple regression techniques. Findings indicate that mothers and fathers differed in their responses to this experience. How parents perceived the severity of their infant's illness was the most powerful variable associated with their stress scores. Trait anxiety, desire for the pregnancy, and where and when parents first saw the baby were other variables significantly correlated with stress scores.","1417":"Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a disease characterized by the destruction of the skin, subcutaneous fat, and fascia, with or without inflammation of the muscle tissue. NF carries a mortality rate in excess of 50 percent in neonates. Rapid diagnosis and initiation of antibiotics, along with meticulous nursing care, can provide an acceptable outcome for the neonate. This article reviews the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of NF; presents a case study; and provides a nursing care plan that supports treatment of this disease process.","1418":"Pulmonary hypertension, though quite normal in the fetus while the burden of oxygenation is on the maternal placenta, can be rapidly fatal if severe resistance to pulmonary blood flow continues as the infant attempts to make the transition to extrauterine life. This article reviews the pathophysiology of and current management priorities for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn.","1419":"","1420":"","1421":"","1422":"Generally, cardiac lesions with increased pulmonary blood flow demonstrate cardiomegaly, increased pulmonary vascular markings, and pulmonary congestion on the chest x-ray. These findings occur as a result of the following: 1. A left-to-right shunt or mixing lesion in which excess volume of blood flow causes dilation of cardiac chambers, resulting in the appearance of cardiomegaly, and in which increased pulmonary artery blood flow causes increased pulmonary vascular markings 2. Obstruction of blood flow that produces pulmonary venous hypertension and resultant pulmonary edema The next article in this series will address cardiac lesions with decreased pulmonary blood flow.","1423":"","1424":"","1425":"","1426":"Multiple gestations account for 10 to 12 percent of perinatal deaths. Of all intrauterine deaths in twins, 73 percent are associated with monochorionic placentation. Monochorionic twins have higher rates of perinatal mortality, birthweight discordancy, and intrauterine growth retardation than do dichorionic twins. Follow-up studies indicate that twins remain at a disadvantage for subsequent growth and intellectual achievement. The history and hospital course of a set of discordant twins is presented, describing the extensive morbidity and prolonged hospitalization.","1427":"Over the past 20 years, there has been a dramatic change in the way nursing care is delivered in this 52-bed community hospital NICU. In the early 1970s, technologic and medical innovations produced a significant improvement in infant survival. The nurse's role at that time was to deliver the various prescribed treatments and master the array of new gadgetry. This approach escalated until the mid 1980s, when it was recognized that something very important was missing from nursing practice. This realization began an internal process in a small group of nurses that eventually expanded to include the majority of staff. The process is outlined in the text, and the outward changes that resulted from the internal process are outlined in the tables.","1428":"Identification of inherited or genetic disorders has important implications for the prognosis and treatment of affected infants. This article addresses the three most common categories of genetic disorders--single-gene defects, chromosomal abnormalities, and multifactorial conditions. The principles of transmission, risk of inheritance, and clinical significance of each category are discussed, with examples of inherited disorders in each category.","1429":"Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections in the neonate can be acquired during pregnancy and during and following the birth process. The most common mode of transmission is from exposure to the virus in the birth canal at the time of delivery. HSV is among the less common infections in neonates. This often leads to delay in diagnosis and treatment, increasing the risk of a poor or fatal outcome. Clinically, HSV infection often presents in preterm or term infants with signs and symptoms similar to those of bacterial sepsis. Their immature immune systems puts preterm infants at higher risk for serious disease. A positive maternal history of HSV is not needed to support diagnosis; typically the mother is asymptomatic. Primary maternal infection usually leads to more serious disease in the neonate. It is important that caregivers recognize the subtle signs and symptoms of HSV infection so early diagnosis and prompt treatment can be instituted.","1430":"","1431":"","1432":"","1433":"Preterm infants frequently require resuscitation in the delivery room. Under the intense circumstances of providing lifesaving interventions, caregivers may be unaware of the amount and kind of touch an infant receives. The purpose of this qualitative, ethologic study was to describe the kinds of touch that occur during resuscitation of premature infants immediately after delivery as viewed on videotape. The convenience sample consisted of ten videotapes of premature infant resuscitation performed at a tertiary care center. Using Spradley's Developmental Research Sequence, a description of kinds of touch--including mechanical and human touch--was developed. Descriptive research conceptualizing touch promotes awareness of current practice and may lead to alterations in clinical practice that best support the adaptive response in the depressed infant.","1434":"Over a five-month period eight breastfed infants required readmission to Wesley Long Community Hospital in Greensboro, North Carolina, within 48 hours of discharge from the newborn nursery. The primary diagnoses upon readmission included hyperbilirubinemia and suspected sepsis. At discharge from the intensive care nursery, mild dehydration secondary to inadequate breastfeeding was deemed a significant factor in precipitating the need for readmission. This increase in readmissions represented a significant change from the past year. An intensive review of each initial hospital stay was conducted to attempt to identify causative factors and to develop a profile of infants who might be at risk for readmission in the future.","1435":"Anemia of prematurity (AOP) affects almost all infants that are born prematurely. Excessive phlebotomy in the NICU setting has exacerbated this condition. Until recently, erythrocyte transfusion has been the only therapy for AOP. Recombinant human erythropoietin (rh-EPO) has been shown to be effective in reducing erythrocyte transfusions in premature infants with AOP. Various studies have utilized rh-EPO as a treatment modality or as prophylaxis for AOP. The results of these studies have shown that rb-EPO is a complementary strategy along with restriction of phlebotomy and less liberal transfusion policies, to decreasing the number of transfusions that an infant may need. Trials are necessary to document the cost-effectiveness of rh-EPO as well as its long term effects on the premature infant.","1436":"Infection is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in high-risk neonates. Because infection has many nonspecific signs and symptoms, the neonatal nurse plays a crucial role in the early recognition of infection. The interpretation of the white blood cell (WBC) count and differential can be difficult and must take into account many factors, including gestational age, weight, and postconceptional age. This article focuses on those factors that affect WBC interpretation, as well as steps nurses can take to minimize specimen and sampling errors.","1437":"Traits seen in the neonate are a direct result of the expression of genes donated by parents at the time of conception. This article discusses the configuration of genetic material in humans, explains how an individual's genetic composition is unique, and demonstrates the importance of genetic information in determining traits related to health, disease, and individuality.","1438":"","1439":"","1440":"","1441":"","1442":"","1443":"The purpose of this study was to determine whether normal saline (NS) is as effective as 10 units heparin\/ml saline (HS) in maintaining patency of intermittent intravenous devices (i.v. locks) in neonates. We conducted a prospective, double-blind, randomized study of 118 24-gauge catheters used exclusively as i.v. locks and removed consequent to catheter failure. Subjects were infants, including premature infants, less than one month of age, admitted to a Level II NICU. Catheters were observed for length of patency as well as incidence of phlebitis, occlusion, infiltration, and leaking. There was no statistically significant difference in average duration of patency between NS-flushed catheters and HS-flushed catheters. Phlebitis, occlusion, infiltration, and leaking occurred with equal frequency for both solutions.","1444":"The use of corticosteroids as a treatment for chronic lung disease is increasing in newborn intensive care units. The anti-inflammatory mechanism of steroids suppresses the pulmonary inflammatory response, leading to improved pulmonary compliance and often a successful extubation. However, side effects, including sepsis, hypertension, glucosuria, and heme positive stools, have been reported. Caregivers must appreciate the multisystem biochemical effects of corticosteroids and anticipate the potential side effects when administering this medication. The article reviews the biochemical processes of dexamethasone, a synthetic corticosteroid, and presents a case study of an infant receiving dexamethasone. A question-and-answer format is interpolated throughout the case study and is intended to challenge the reader's knowledge of the pathophysiology of chronic lung disease and the biochemical actions of corticosteroids. Implications for nursing assessment and management of infants receiving this medication are reviewed.","1445":"Increasing numbers of neonates are receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). ECMO is an invasive, lifesaving technique used to treat respiratory failure when other technologies have failed. The pharmacokinetics of various drugs administered during ECMO are unclear. Drug clearance is altered during ECMO. Evidence exists for binding of multiple drugs to the ECMO circuit tubing. Also, the administration route of medications to neonates on ECMO varies, potentially impacting drug disposition. Questions exist regarding the effect technical components of ECMO might have on drug pharmacokinetics. Because little clinical information is available, nurses must have a heightened awareness of drug effects and the potential for untoward events while administering medications to neonates receiving ECMO This article reviews what is currently known regarding ECMO and pharmacotherapy.","1446":"The widespread use of indwelling intravascular catheters, such as central venous lines and umbilical vessel catheters, has resulted in an increased number of thrombotic complications and subsequently a growing need for specific thrombolytic therapy. The use of thrombolytic agents that have a high incidence of systemic fibrinolysis is of concern, however, especially in premature neonates. Tissue plasminogen activator is a locally acting thrombolytic agent that occurs naturally in the body. Tissue plasminogen activator can now be mass-produced through recombinant DNA technology. Reports of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator use in neonates are beginning to appear in the literature. This thrombolytic agent appears to be promising for the local lysis of clots within systemic coagulopathy. However, there is a need for controlled studies of thrombolytic agents in the neonatal population.","1447":"The recent production of recombinant human growth factors has expanded the neonatal clinician's armamentarium for treating sepsis and anemia of prematurity (AOP). Agents that may prove useful in the premature neonate include recombinant human erythropoietin (rh-EPO), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF), and CSF). Within the neonatal population, research utilizing these agents is still relatively new. Appropriate clinical trials are still needed to elucidate the optimal dosing regimen for both rhG-CSF and rh-EPO, as are studies to address the issue of long-term safety. Use of rhG-CSF in sepsis and of rh-EPO for AOP is still considered experimental, but in instances where conventional treatments are not proving beneficial, these agents may provide a therapeutic alternative. Their potential for improving care of the premature neonate must also be assessed.","1448":"","1449":"","1450":"","1451":"","1452":"","1453":"","1454":"","1455":"To assist the parents of preterm infants at Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Canada, we have developed a unique and creative method of individualizing parent information: The parent information binder (PIB). This method has supported a shift from nurse-directed education to parents as partners in their own education. Parents and health care professionals utilize the PIB collaboratively to facilitate organization and collection of information, which is individualized according to the infant's level of wellness and the parents' readiness to receive the information. This approach empowers parents to be active and integral participants in decisions regarding their infants' hospital care.","1456":"The neonatal nurse practitioner (NNP) role at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire, has been in place since 1989. As part of the professional growth and development of this NNP group, the necessity for a useful evaluation instrument emerged. This instrument needed to be congruent with the job description, practice philosophy, and strong commitment to peer review. The literature search and institutional survey failed to uncover an acceptable option, so an evaluation instrument was developed, tested, and refined. This instrument captures the diverse scope of NNP practice and incorporates a continuum of novice to expert competencies based on the work of Patricia Benner. This evaluation mechanism has had a profound effect on our group, encouraging the development of a shared vision of the NNP role and stimulating professional growth.","1457":"This study describes the role of the neonatal nurse practitioner (NNP) in current practice and identifies facilitators and constraints to practice perceived by individuals currently practicing as NNPs. The 7-point scale used in this study allowed respondents to identify specific conditions of NNP practice, from highly facilitating (+3) to very constraining (-3). Each item was followed by a clarification section. The questionnaire was mailed to 1,521 individuals holding current NNP certification in the U.S. Data were analyzed using a total facilitation score. The possible range for this score (+225 - (-)225) is based on the numerical range of the scale (+3 - (-)3) multiplied by the 75 items in the facilitation section of the questionnaire. Actual scores ranged from +195 to -114, indicating that NNPs are more facilitated than constrained in their practice. Empirical data generated by this study will help in developing a theoretical model for NNP practice and provide important information for shaping the future role of the NNP.","1458":"Emergence of the neonatal nurse practitioner role in the 1970s was influenced by improved care for high-risk neonates, the expanding role of neonatal nursing, medical staff shortages, and the nurse practitioner movement. The role continued to evolve in the 1980s and 1990s. This article chronicles the development of the neonatal nurse practitioner role, education, and certification.","1459":"","1460":"","1461":"","1462":"","1463":"","1464":"","1465":"","1466":"","1467":"","1468":"In response to current trends in maternity care, nurses are assuming a major role in providing quality care for new mothers and their babies postdischarge through follow-up home care. Jaundice has been identified as the most commonly encountered cause of morbidity among healthy infants during the first week of life, and nurses must possess accurate neonatal assessment skills. Unlike nurses who work in hospital settings, those who provide home care do not have ready access to colleagues for consultation and validation of assessments. The result of unrefined assessment skills of nurses may be requests for unnecessary invasive procedures for infants and, consequently, monetary charges to patients for unnecessary lab work. A quasi-experimental design was used to determine whether the use of a jaundice meter to validate nurses' visual assessments would help them develop more accurate assessments of neonatal jaundice. Findings revealed high correlations between visual scale rankings of jaundice and jaundice meter readings (RS = .85, p &lt; .01). The results of this pilot study indicate that the use of a jaundice meter may be a noninvasive as well as a cost-effective way to validate nurses' visual assessments of neonatal jaundice in the home.","1469":"A randomized control design was used to compare the effect of swaddling to standard positioning on neuromuscular development in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (&lt; 1,250 gm). The outcome of neuromuscular development was measured at 34 weeks postconceptional age using the Morgan Neonatal Neurobehavioral Exam (MNNE). The sample included 50 infants who met criteria for birth weight, age and who were classified as appropriate for gestational age. Exclusion criteria were also used. The infants were randomly assigned to the experimental group or the comparison group. Data analysis included descriptive and inferential statistical techniques. The results demonstrated that swaddled infants had higher total scores on the MNNE as compared to infants with standard positioning. Swaddling appears to be a positioning technique that can enhance neuromuscular development of the very low birth weight infant.","1470":"The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the differences between nasopharyngeal catheter and nasal cannula oxygen delivery systems in infants. Eleven subjects requiring supplemental oxygen were enrolled in the study. All infants received both therapies at three separate gas flow rates (0.5, 0.3, and 0.2 liters per minute). Infants had higher heart rates when receiving nasal cannula oxygen than when receiving nasopharyngeal catheter oxygen (p &lt; .05). There were no significant differences between the two therapies when comparing pulmonary mechanics, hypopharyngeal oxygen concentrations, and respiratory rates. However, when oxygen was delivered at the higher flow (0.5 liters), heart rate, tidal volume, and oxygen concentration were higher, and respiratory rates were decreased for both methods (p &lt; .05). Because minimal differences were found between these two methods, either may be an appropriate choice for delivering supplemental oxygen.","1471":"The development of clinical pathways has paralleled the national movement to control health care dollars. This movement is particularly intense in states with extensive managed care plans, such as Arizona. Early infant discharge with minimal home nursing support is a reality that forces parents to anticipate their discharge needs well in advance of the actual discharge date. The 59-bed NICU at Phoenix Children's Hospital uses neonatal individualized predictive pathways (NIPPs) as a discharge planning tool with parents of premature infants less than 32-weeks gestation. The NIPPs were developed after an extensive retrospective record review identified time frames for a variety of medical therapies and clinical milestones. Parent and nursing staff expectations are specified on a weekly basis opposite the medical therapies. This article discusses the positive parental response to the NIPP and identifies future areas for development.","1472":"","1473":"","1474":"","1475":"","1476":"","1477":"","1478":"","1479":"","1480":"Over the past two decades, awareness of the importance of social support for individuals faced with a major life transition or a stressful event has increased. The purpose of this study was to identify the perceptions of mothers and fathers of critically ill infants about the helpfulness of support provided to them by family, health care professionals, and other when their infants were in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Social support in this study is conceptualized as the interpersonal transactions that parents of preterm infants perceive as helpful in reducing their stress and coping with their child's illness. Data were collected using the Illness Support Scale, on which subjects rated the helpfulness of support from individuals across their network. Findings indicate that these parents experienced a moderately high level of support and perceived NICU nurses as very helpful. Nurses need to continue to develop their role in helping families by identifying specific supportive interventions.","1481":"Despite advances in neonatology, some infants do not respond to current pharmacologic and ventilatory techniques. Others suffer chronic lung disease, require prolonged ventilatory support, and experience significant morbidity during infancy due to the elevated inflation pressures used to treat their respiratory problems. Over the past 30 years, results of studies in premature animals as well as clinical trials have demonstrated that ventilation with oxygenated perfluorochemical (PFC) fluids provides effective gas exchange and improved lung mechanics. PFC fluids are biologically inert, have a high gas solubility and a low surface tension, and are nonbiotransformable. With liquid ventilation, alveolar pressures are low because the high surface tension of the gas-lung interface in eliminated. Potential neonatal applications include surfactant deficiency, persistent pulmonary hypertension, meconium aspiration, diaphragmatic hernia, pneumonia, and a vehicle for drug delivery. In order to develop a nursing care plan for the liquid-ventilated infant, nurses need knowledge of the physiologic changes involved in liquid ventilation, as well as its mechanics.","1482":"Percutaneous central venous catheters (PCVCs) have been used in neonates since the 1970s. During the 1980s, they were introduced in many NICUs. Most studies published to date employ a descriptive methodology. There are very few randomized clinical trials with PCVCs in neonates, and no integrated literature reviews have been published to date. Furthermore, infection in neonates with PCVCs has become a major concern. This integrated literature review was conducted to delineate the scope of the problem of sepsis in neonates with central venous catheters and to identify current research directed at methods to reduce catheter-related sepsis (CRS) in high-risk neonates. Twenty-five references were found and analyzed for this review. The definitions used to identify CRS in neonates varied greatly among studies. The method of calculating the CRS rate varied as well. The CRS rates ranged from 0 to 29 percent or from 0 to 15.3 infections per 1,000 catheter days. Strategies employed to reduce CRS rates are presented along with recommendations for future research.","1483":"Neonatal intensive care has become a widely accepted component of our health care system. Its acceptance and growth are related to increased technology and specialization. However, little consideration has been given to the process of making decisions about the use of neonatal intensive care from the perspective of the patient's family. This article reviews the existing literature related to parents' opinions and perceptions of care in the NICU and proposes a framework for the exploration of the value systems of parents of infants requiring neonatal intensive care.","1484":"","1485":"","1486":"","1487":"","1488":"Managing the care of the very preterm infant can become a maze of diagnoses, treatments, and tests that blur progress and expectations along an infant's extended course in the NICU. Yet the health care environment demands that comprehensive, high-quality, cost-effective care be provided each infant and family entrusted to our care. Critical pathways based on gestational age at birth and postconceptional age throughout the hospital stay facilitate the necessary goal-oriented, interdisciplinary approach to infant care by providing consistency, flexibility, and quality management.","1489":"","1490":"","1491":"A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the effects of gentle human touch (GHT) provided for 15 minutes a day to preterm infants from day 7 to day 12 of life. The study suggested that GHT has no adverse effects on the oxygen saturation or heart rate levels of small preterm infants and that GHT has a soothing effect as evidenced by decreased levels of active sleep, motor activity, and behavioral distress. These results can provide NICU nurses with a basis for guiding parents in their early interactions with preterm infants in the NICU.","1492":"This pilot study was designed to test an instrument measuring mothers' perceptions of the quality of the back-transfer experience from a neonatal intensive care unit in a tertiary medical center to a community hospital. Forty-one mothers completed a questionnaire that contained the 24-item NICU\/Community Hospital Transfer Quality Scale, a 1-item measure of stress associated with the overall experience, and other variables that might affect the transfer experience. Transfer quality was strongly correlated with the overall stress of the transfer (r = .61, p &lt; .001). That is, the higher the perceived transfer quality, the less stress the mother associated with the transfer. This instrument had a test-retest reliability of r = .82 (p &lt; .001, n = 23) and a Chronbach's alpha of .84. Comments made by mothers indicated that communication with health care providers is a very important but sometimes inadequately addressed component of the transfer experience. Nurses can play a key role in facilitating communication between the family and health care providers in both the tertiary and community settings. Four goals for enhancing communication between parents and health care providers are described.","1493":"The ductus arteriosus is a communication between the main pulmonary trunk and the descending aorta. In utero, the ductus arteriosus allows blood flow to be diverted from the high-resistance pulmonary circulation to the descending aorta and the low-resistance placental bed. Functional closure of the ductus arteriosus occurs soon after birth but can be delayed in premature infants and in certain situations. Patency of the ductus arteriosus results in alterations in blood flow to many different organ systems. This article describes the physiologic effects, as well as symptoms, diagnosis, and management of a patent ductus arteriosus in the preterm infant.","1494":"A correlation study was conducted to examine the relationship between results from LifeScan's One Touch II blood glucose monitoring system and laboratory analysis of serum glucose values in neonates. A total of 327 blood samples was obtained from newborn infants in a Level III NICU. The comparison of the paired results showed that the r value was .902. The overall results suggest that the LifeScan One Touch II set in the neonatal mode gives results showing good agreement with standard serum glucose values in neonates with serum glucose values &lt; 100 mg\/dl (5.6 mmol\/liter).","1495":"","1496":"","1497":"","1498":"","1499":"","1500":"","1501":"Most newborns born in Western countries spend their first transitional hours in hospital nurseries. Noxious noise levels in the nursery can interfere with neonatal efforts to achieve physiological and behavioral homeostasis. Literature indicates that music has been used to induce relaxation states and reduce stress responses. This study used a one-group, pretest, posttest design. A convenience sample of 20 term, Caucasian neonates was recruited. The number of high arousal behavioral states and the number of state changes of the newborns was recorded for a control and an experimental period. Soothing, lyrical music was played in the baby's bed during the experimental period. The data was compared using McNemar's test statistic. A significant difference (p &lt; .01) was observed. The results suggest that soothing music may be a feasible intervention to help newborns demonstrate fewer high arousal states and less state lability.","1502":"As smaller infants are cared for in our NICUs, maintaining skin integrity and preventing epidermal stripping have become key aspects of neonatal nursing care. This article describes a research utilization project in which research-based knowledge, expert information, and scientific practice guided a practice change in one NICU. The implementation process, based on the Iowa model, included the following steps: identification of triggers; review, critique, and evaluation of the literature; determination of the soundness of the research base; identification of alternate strategies; making the practice change; and evaluation of the outcomes. Initial monitoring suggests that the recommended interventions can be successful with very low birth weight infants.","1503":"A six-pound infant may be 33 weeks, 43 weeks, or term, each with a different set of medical and developmental needs, requiring different nursing care. Gestational age determination is important for anticipating each infant's medical risks, preventing complications, distinguishing the infant's developmental capabilities in feeding, sleep, and interactive behaviors with the parents, and establishing the infant's nursing care needs on a timely basis. This article reviews the history of gestational age assessment, gestational age classifications and associated risks, and the accuracy of current tools and provides instruction for performing a gestational age assessment.","1504":"This article reports a study of the nurse's choice of level of management and factors influencing that choice in three ambiguous clinical situations related to neonatal nursing. A nationwide mail survey, using a Likert scale, was conducted on a random sample of the membership of the National Association of Neonatal Nurses. The findings of this research suggest that nurses have clearly defined choices related to the degree of intensity of management of infants, based on consideration of the information available to the nurse in the neonatal setting. These findings have implications for nursing practice and education and consequences for the quality of nursing care provided to infants and their families.","1505":"Infants must have effective pain management in the postoperative period. A Level III NICU evaluated its current practice and identified barriers to effective pain management. Action was then taken to eliminate the identified barriers. This included developing a pain management team, testing and implementing an objective postoperative pain tool, employing a new flow sheet that incorporates the pain tool, offering multidisciplinary educational activities, and involving nurses in research. These actions have broken down the barrier to effective postoperative pain management and provided direction for a new standard of care.","1506":"Nitric oxide has recently been introduced to the world of neonatal pulmonary medicine. The discovery of endogenous nitric oxide production has stimulated extensive research into vascular biology to find the relation of nitric oxide to the transition of circulatory patterns at birth. Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) has long been recognized as a neonatal complication to a variety of disorders. Traditional treatments for PPHN have been associated with adverse effects. Nitric oxide is considered the only selective pulmonary vasodilator to date. Nitric oxide therapy does not produce systemic hypotension, often associated with the use of intravenous vasodilators. This new therapy may possibly reduce or eliminate the need for invasive life-saving procedures such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. This article discusses in great detail nitric oxide chemistry and physiology and the procedure for nitric oxide delivery by inhalation and reviews the results of recent research.","1507":"","1508":"","1509":"","1510":"","1511":"","1512":"Appropriate and effective nursing intervention is an essential element in determining how the family responds to the monitor in the home. Accurate assessment of the family system and dynamics provides the basis for a plan of care. The family's and infant's specific needs must be addressed. Careful implementation of the plan allows for changes and unexpected outcomes. Frequent evaluation of monitoring is necessary to determine if a change in the plan of care is needed. Recent changes in home apnea monitoring technology are rapidly altering the care of infants at risk for apnea and SIDS. The advent of the documented or recording monitor has the potential to demystify the events occurring while the infant is being monitored. Parents can get answers about their infant as quickly as a telephone call. The clinician can differentiate between a true and a false alarm and reassure the parents accordingly. Documenting false events and shallow-breathing alarms will potentially reduce the duration of monitoring, decreasing costs to the entire health care system. Documented monitoring is a valuable tool for nurses. For the staff nurse, clinical observation can be validated through trending and print out of events can be done at the bedside. For the advanced practice nurse, management of care can become more efficient through remote monitoring via modem. Patient teaching can be followed with immediate feedback. Monitors may assist in allaying anxiety in families who have lost children to SIDS or had an unexpected death in a previous sibling. Families may feel less anxious about having an \"at risk\" child in the home if the events are continuously being recorded. Length of hospital stay may decrease initially, with fewer rehospitalizations. Nursing research in these areas is necessary. Evaluating events occurring in the home may also help shed light on the enigma of SIDS. Several SIDS deaths have been recorded on documented monitors. If we can pinpoint exactly what takes place prior to and immediately after a SIDS episode, the enigma that has had physicians puzzled for so long may finally begin to unravel.","1513":"Mothers of premature infants have difficulty maintaining their milk supply as a result of the separation that occurs between the mother and the baby. The hypothesis in the present investigation is that use of a bilateral (simultaneous) breast pumping system will increase the volume of milk expressed in these mothers. Thirty-two breastfeeding mothers of premature infants were randomly assigned to either the control (single) or the experimental (bilateral) breast pump group. Mothers pumped at least four times a day. Data collection included a daily milk production log, weekly serum prolactin levels, and a weekly State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Participation lasted from four to six weeks. Data analysis included average STAI scores; average prolactin levels; and weekly averages for number of pumping sessions, hours of pumping, and milk production in milliliters. The two groups did not differ on several demographic characteristics, STAI scores, prolactin levels, number of pumping sessions per week, or weekly milk production. The amount of time spent pumping, however, was statistically less for mothers who used the bilateral pump (7.6 +\/- 3.0 hours\/week) versus those who used the single pump (11.1 +\/- 3.1 hours\/week) (p = .003). Although use of either the single pump or the bilateral electric pump resulted in similar milk production, the bilateral pump significantly reduced the time invested in pumping. Health professionals should advocate use of the bilateral pump for mothers of premature infants. Additional studies are needed to determine strategies for increasing milk production in this population.","1514":"Many patients the neonatal nurse cares for daily have the potential for abnormal blood glucose levels. Recognizing infants at risk can facilitate timely and appropriate interventions. The quality of the information received from tests and observation depends on decisions made by the nurse. Therefore, knowledge of glucose kinetics and monitoring techniques is essential.","1515":"Hemochromatosis is the excess accumulation of iron in tissue affecting a variety of organ systems leading to hepatic fibrosis and multiorgan system failure. When excess iron accumulation occurs in utero, as with neonatal hemochromatosis, the infant may be stillborn or present with advanced, overwhelming liver disease. Hepatic failure in the newborn encompasses a wide variety of disease entities, and formulation of a differential diagnosis presents a challenge for the clinician. This article reviews one case of neonatal hemochromatosis that was diagnosed and successfully treated. Iron metabolism and overload are discussed, as well as clinical manifestations, current treatment, and the potential for prenatal diagnosis in the future.","1516":"","1517":"","1518":"","1519":"","1520":"Many clinicians believe that infants with chronic lung disease display more irritability and react more negatively to care than other preterm infants. Therefore, the sleep-wake states and behaviors displayed by 31 high-risk preterm infants without chronic lung disease and 20 infants with chronic lung disease during four-hour observations conducted in intermediate care between 32 and 36 weeks postconceptional age were compared. Separate analyses were conducted for times when infants were alone and when they were with nurses to determine whether behavioral differences might be greater during handling. There were very few differences between the groups in either situation. Sleep-wake states did not differ. The infants with chronic lung disease exhibited more jitters at every age, but only when they were alone. Infants with and without chronic lung disease showed isolated differences in five behaviors when they were alone but in only two behaviors when they were with nurses. Thus, there is no evidence that 32- to 36-week preterm infants with chronic lung disease are more irritable or react more negatively to care than other preterm infants.","1521":"This descriptive study evaluates and compares the effectiveness of music, presented both aurally and vibrotactilely, in reducing agitation and physiological instability following a stress-producing intervention (suctioning) in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Heart rate, oxygen saturation levels, level of arousal, stressful facial expressions, and autonomic indicators were recorded for each of four preterm infants. All infants experienced a reduction in the level of arousal during the taped music intervention when compared with the control condition. Three infants spent an increased amount of time in a quiet alert state and had improved oxygen saturation levels during the vibrotactile intervention. All infants spent more time sleeping during the taped music condition than without music or with the vibrotactile intervention. Results suggest that music is effective in reducing stress-related behaviors for some infants.","1522":"Allergy to latex has been increasing as the use of latex products has grown. The increase is disproportionately occurring in those people with myelodysplasias, those who have undergone multiple surgical procedures, and health care providers. Within those groups, the most susceptible to latex allergy are people with other allergies. Early identification of high-risk individuals and their avoidance of products containing latex can minimize the occurrence of this allergic response. Heightened awareness among health care providers is needed because latex is very common in hospitals and clinics. Inadvertent exposure places latex-sensitive individuals in danger of anaphylaxis. Nurses caring for infants and children are able to modify the environment of those at risk for latex allergy, reducing exposure to this potentially dangerous substance. Teaching families of children at risk will help them avoid latex in the home; many common household substances contain latex and are likely to trigger allergic responses.","1523":"Jaundice is a common physiologic problem seen in both term and preterm infants. Normal transitional changes in bilirubin metabolism lead to physiological jaundice in many infants. In some infants these normal changes at birth may be exaggerated, such as occurs with immaturity, or may interact with health alterations (pathologic jaundice), resulting in the accumulation of excess bilirubin and development of hyperbilirubinemia. Caregivers must appreciate the processes and the basis for physiologic jaundice and hyperbilirubinemia and recognize infants at risk for these disorders. This article reviews neonatal bilirubin metabolism as a basis for understanding the causes and treatment of physiologic jaundice and hyperbilirubinemia arising from either physiologic or pathologic causes. Patterns of bilirubin in breast fed infants are discussed along with other issues related to breast feeding and jaundice. Treatment of hyperbilirubinemia and implications for nursing assessment and management of infants under phototherapy are also described.","1524":"","1525":"","1526":"","1527":"","1528":"Congenital leukemia is a rare hematological disorder. The initial manifestation of the disease may be the presence of blue or gray skin nodules. The presence of these nodules along with hyperleukocytosis, anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, and central nervous system leukemic involvement are characteristic of the disease. Treatment involves the administration of chemotherapy by protocol. Response to the chemotherapy is generally poor. Infants with Down syndrome may have a transient manifestation of leukemia known as a leukemic disorder; this will resolve without chemotherapy. Other neonatal disorders can also mimic congenital leukemia; the infant must be evaluated for these, in addition to the definitive diagnosis made via bone marrow aspiration and examination. There are many nursing care interventions for the infant with suspected congenital leukemia. The family of an infant with a suspected or diagnosed leukemia requires concrete information and psychosocial support because the prognosis for these infants is grave. We describe the level of care and subsequent outcome for a premature infant who was diagnosed with congenital leukemia and treated with chemotherapy in a Level III nursery.","1529":"","1530":"","1531":"High-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) was developed to meet the need for adequate ventilation while avoiding the adverse consequences of conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV). HFJV can be beneficial to infants who have failed CMV. Some infants may need the additional support of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). To be optimally transported to a center that offers this treatment, the infant may need to be ventilated using HFJV. For the transport team, delivery of the infant to the receiving hospital in optimal condition is the goal. The challenges of overcoming the environmental hindrances inherent in transport combine with the challenge of caring for an acutely and critically ill infant. When the infant is transported on HFJV, these challenges are magnified. This article briefly discusses HFJV and examines the preparations and equipment required for transport, as well as special considerations for managing the infant on HFJV during transport.","1532":"Neonates' response to pain after venipuncture was studied by observing, recording, and measuring physiological and behavioral responses. The measurement used was the National Individualized Developmental Care Assessment Program (NIDCAP). Data were recorded from a convenience sample of 30 neonates required to have a venipuncture as part of their routine treatment for 20 minutes before and 20 minutes following the procedure by a person certified as reliable in administering the NIDCAP. Both behavioral and physiologic changes were observed. Most of the infants (93 percent) moved abruptly into a hyperalert or crying state in response to venipuncture, skipping several states without transition and showing disorganized behavior. The heart rate, oxygen saturation, and skin color showed significant changes when data recorded just prior to venipuncture were compared to data recorded immediately following the procedure. Nursing implications, including the unit environmental elements, are discussed.","1533":"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a disease characterized by ischemia and necrosis of the gastrointestinal tract frequently leading to perforation of the intestine. It occurs primarily in the premature infant and is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in the low birth weight infant. Careful nursing and medical care can greatly reduce the incidence and severity of this disease, thus decreasing both the associated morbidity and mortality. This article reviews the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of NEC; presents a case study; and provides a nursing care plan for treatment of this disease.","1534":"","1535":"","1536":"","1537":"","1538":"The comprehension of fluid and electrolyte and acid-base homeostasis is essential for the nurse caring for critically-ill neonates. This article discusses the means by which the kidney regulates fluid, sodium, and potassium, and its role in acid-base regulation. Under normal circumstances, the neonatal kidney is able to maintain homeostasis in these areas. However, the more premature an infant, the less able they are to maintain normal electrolyte, bicarbonate, or fluid balance. The understanding of renal filtration, absorption, and excretion requires knowledge of renal anatomy and the structure and function of the nephron unit. Regulation of glomerular filtration and renal blood flow plays an important part in determining the kidney's ability to maintain homeostasis (see Part I). Perhaps the greatest factor in determining renal function is the degree of maturity. Nephrogenesis is not complete until the 34th week of gestation. This, along with other factors, has a profound effect on glomerular filtration, renal filtration and absorption, and the nephron's sensitivity to hormonal control. The structural and functional differences in the neonatal kidney must be considered when evaluating renal function and devising a plan of care.","1539":"Measurement of weight in the neonatal intensive care unit demands accuracy and precision. To date, however, no studies exist that independently document the accuracy of infant incubator bed scales. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the Airshields-Vickers Warm Weigh internally mounted incubator bed scale with foam and water mattresses using 500 gm and 1,500 gm standard weights to ascertain the precision of electronic bed scales and to evaluate the differences between nurse weighers. Two experienced neonatal nurses evaluated new incubator bed scales. Each nurse independently collected data and kept the results masked. Eight measurements were obtained from each incubator. Results indicated error beyond +\/- 2 gm at 500 gm with the foam mattress and in both weight groups with the water mattress using the Technical Error Measurement (TEM) method. This indicates that the bed scales did not perform within the manufacturer's rated accuracy of +\/- 2 gm at the smallest weights found in the clinical area. Weight errors were not judged to be clinically significant by a group of NNP experts.","1540":"The purpose of this study was to describe the intra- and interexaminer reliability of weight measurements obtained from critically ill infants on an in-bed electronic scale. Weight measurements were obtained using the in-bed scale (Smart Model 35, Olympic Medical, Seattle, Washington) for 32 infants; 16 were in an incubator, and 16 were under a radiant warmer. Two nurses each obtained two weight measurements for each infant for three consecutive days, for a total of 96 data collection sessions. The nurses were blinded to their own and to the other nurse's weight measurements. The average mean absolute difference for individual nurses' weight measurements (interexaminer reliability) was 12.58 gm for weights obtained in the incubator and 19.19 gm for weights obtained under the radiant warmer. The average mean absolute difference for pairs of nurses' weight measurements (interexaminer reliability) was 14.29 gm for weights obtained in the incubator and 24.42 gm for weights obtained under the radiant warmer. The average mean absolute differences for weights obtained in the two bed types differed significantly for both intra- (Z = -2.46, p = .0141) and interexaminer (Z = -3.11, p = .0019) reliability. The number of pieces of equipment that had to be held during the weight measurement was weakly correlated with both the intra- (rs = .1878, p = .0091) and interexaminer (rs = .1600, p = .0266) mean absolute differences. These findings suggest that weight measurements of critically ill infants obtained using the Smart Model 35 in-bed electronic scale are sufficiently reliable for calculation of medication, parenteral fluid, blood replacement, and nutritional requirements.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1541":"The incidence of infants born with congenital heart disease (CHD) is about 0.8% of all live births. Out of this at-risk population, approximately one-third will develop life-threatening symptoms of critical CHD within the first few days of life. These infants present the neonatal team with a variety of challenges, and require early identification along with proper stabilization and treatment to survive. The neonatal nurse plays a vital role in recognizing the first signs and symptoms of cardiac distress. This article discusses the most common life-threatening congenital cardiac lesions, reviews their pathophysiology, and outlines the initial medical and nursing management. A through understanding of these concepts can help the nurse improve patient outcomes.","1542":"To assess, plan, and implement care of the critically ill neonate, the nurse must have a thorough understanding of renal embryology and physiology. This articles focuses on the developmental and anatomical structure of the kidney and the general physiological activities of the renal components. Renal embryological development begins during the 1st week of gestation and continues until around the 36th week of gestation. Functional capacity, although not mature, begins around the 6th week of gestation. Infants born premature have underdeveloped structures and decreased renal function. Comprehending renal anatomy and physiology requires a complete understanding of a single nephron, the functional unit of the kidney. Each nephron consists of a glomerulus, Bowman's capsule, and tubules, which work together to maintain ion balance for cellular function and elimination of unwanted substances from the plasma. Renal blood flow, controlled by either autoregulation or hormonal control, must remain both rapid and constant for glomerular filtration to occur. Alterations in any of these components of renal anatomy and physiology will alter the condition of the neonate. Renal evaluations are done based on output, urine chemistries, and serum chemistries. These evaluations lead to a diagnosis on which the nurse can base her plan of care.","1543":"","1544":"","1545":"Opioids, particularly morphine sulfate and fentanyl, continue to be the most commonly used agents for analgesia. Morphine provides greater sedation, and there is less of a problem with rigidity of the chest wall than with fentanyl. Morphine also has a higher level of tolerance than does fentanyl. Table 2 provides considerations for administration of morphine and fentanyl. Sedation for the relief of pain without analgesia is not acceptable. Sedation and analgesia together may be in the baby's best interest. Before any plan of care is implemented, the baby should be evaluated for need based on the amount of current respiratory support versus spontaneous respiration. There is evidence in the research literature that narcotic administration can be safely carried out in the preterm when using intravenous caffeine simultaneously to offset the risk of apnea. Others state that there really is no safe therapeutic window for narcotic administration in the preterm infant, yet the benefits outweigh the respiratory depressant effect. The complication of respiratory depression can be readily dealt with through the administration of neonatal Narcan via the intramuscular, intratracheal, or intravenous routes.","1546":"","1547":"","1548":"","1549":"","1550":"","1551":"","1552":"","1553":"This study examined potential predictors of postnatal head molding in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants.

Measurements were obtained at four days of age (baseline) and weekly until discharge. Increasing gestational age, higher birth weight, and delivery by cesarean section predicted larger OFC at three weeks of life. Only baseline AP:BP measurements significantly predicted AP:BP measurements at week 3 and 5. Within-group t-tests indicated that the severity of head molding (as indicated by AP:BP ratio) increased throughout the first six weeks of life. Results indicate that postnatal head molding can be reliably predicted and that neonates with higher AP:BP ratios at birth are at greater risk for continued narrow, elongated head shape.","1554":"Health care professionals who care for neonates must be able to recognize early signs\/symptoms that suggest acute illness.

Ninety-four percent of the infants had no gross signs of skin breakdown on the side under the barrier for as long as 21 days. In contrast, 80 percent of the same infants had gross signs of skin breakdown within five days on the side of the face where the tape was applied directly to the skin. The results indicate that a pectin-based barrier should be applied when tape must be used to anchor equipment in premature infants.","1556":"Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a common eye disorder occurring in preterm infants. Formally known as retrolental fibroplasia, ROP is defined as a vasoproliferative disorder that occurs in the developing retina of premature infants' eyes. Until recently, cryotherapy was the recommended treatment for infants diagnosed with advancing ROP. Now laser surgery is being used as an alternative treatment. This article reviews the pathophysiology, etiology, and classification of ROP, considers the pros and cons of laser surgery versus cryotherapy, and outlines the experience with laser surgery in our NICU.","1557":"The potential adverse effects on the neonatal\/pediatric population of administering concentrated intravenous medications are a concern. After an adult minibag was successfully converted to a syringe pump system, a similar system for neonates and children was developed. Additional factors considered with this conversion included: osmolarity, fluid volumes, and i.v. administration procedures. Charts that provided information on appropriate final concentrations of commonly used drugs were developed for nursing and pharmacy staffs. Inservice education was given to ensure understanding and compliance with the charts as well as the procedures developed for this delivery system (such as i.v. line setup, flushing procedures, and tubing changes). When this system was implemented, aminoglycosides were administered in a uniform manner. Previously, each area had its own method of aminoglycoside administration, which was not conducive to reliable therapeutic drug monitoring.

This study investigated card sort as a teaching aid. Proposed by many investigators to improve the effectiveness of nurses' teaching interventions, card sort is based on Q-technique, once used in research, now adapted as a teaching tool. Card sort involves parents in sorting out topics of information according to their own priorities. A pilot study was designed to test this method in the NICU. Ten parents and seven nurses participated in this trial. The parents were asked to sort a set of 17 colorful 5 x 7 inch cards into three piles (from least important to most important); each card was labeled with a discharge teaching topic. The nurses working with these parents also sorted the cards, and their responses were compared to those of the parents. Although parents' and nurses' discharge teaching priorities differed, both groups ranked CPR and signs and symptoms of illness as priorities. There are many advantages of the card sort method in relation to adult learning and social cognition theory. Parents are clearly the best source for determining their own teaching needs, and card sort is a useful tool that involves parents in discharge teaching through self-assessment of needs.","1582":"Death is a reality in the neonatal intensive care setting. This adds to the job stress nurses experience. Although the literature is replete with topics on death and dying, few of these articles are empirically based. The purpose of this study was to determine the stress associated with taking care of babies who die in NICU settings. The responses\/coping mechanisms of NICU nurses were also identified. Fifty-nine nurses in an upper mid-western state participated in this study. Nurses reported feelings of helplessness and intense sorrow when a baby dies. As a result, they experienced the physio-emotional responses of chronic fatigue, decreased interest in exercise, irritability, and being overcritical. The greatest help in coping with grieving came through discussion with coworkers, a chaplain, the patient's family, and the nurse's own family. For some, attending the funeral or memorial services also helped. Implications for practice include fostering planned discussion sessions and continued education to improve counseling skills related to bereavement.","1583":"The vast amount of growing and changing literature and knowledge available today regarding the pathophysiology and care of the critically ill neonate can provide a confusing and overwhelming picture to the neonatal nurse. Coupled with advanced technology and new clinical research, the comprehension of neonatal pathophysiology requires an organized scheme to understand a newborn's response to illness. The concept analysis approach is one way to master learning and nursing care. Concept analysis is an eight-step process for investigating and organizing a neonate's response to illness, which is the basis for planning and managing nursing care.

Therefore, accurate health histories for purposes of case finding and referral for genetic counseling are important components of nursing care for any obstetric patient. NICU nurses should be aware of this rare disorder. When it presents in its most severe forms, it is important that NICU nurses provide accurate information and emotional support while diagnosis is confirmed. It is crucial that parents and families of affected infants be referred for genetic counseling so they can make informed decisions about future pregnancies.","1585":"Nursing case management is a model of care delivery that focuses on achieving optimal patient outcomes in expected time frames while containing costs.

Rectal temperatures were higher than axillary predictive temperatures by 0.5 degrees F and higher than axillary monitoring mode temperatures by 0.7 degrees F. Ranges of variation of +\/- 0.8 to 1.1 degrees F were similar in comparisons of rectal with axillary predictive and monitoring mode measurements. The results of this study support the use of axillary measurement in the predictive mode for clinical measurement of temperature in neonates.

To assist those wishing to implement a similar program in their institution, details of program development, content, implementation, evaluation, and future goals are discussed.","1596":"New and improved technology in the NICU has assisted in supporting critically ill neonates, especially those born at very low birth weights. These small patients require the dedicated hand of the NICU staff, but also the love and support of their parents. Family bonding in the NICU is often a very difficult process, which is interrupted by separation of parent and child at birth and continued by the physical constraints of this highly complex critical care environment. Neonatal nurses are most often the front line managers and coordinators of family care in the NICU. They are charged with the challenge of understanding and providing \"state of the art\" technological care in an environment that must also adapt to the ever changing needs of parents and families who cannot be considered visitors, but an integral part of their infants' care and survival. Each infant and family in the NICU requires individualized assessment and nursing care. This article reviews the process of parental bonding as it relates to the premature or ill infant and provides for nurses a plan of care written to foster and support family bonding in the NICU. Stages of bonding with a sick or premature infant are explored in the context of a theoretical framework of adaptation provided by Sister Callista Roy.","1597":"The purpose of this study was to explore the possible protective effect of nonnutritive sucking (NNS) against the development of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). A retrospective chart review was conducted to examine the histories of 12 preterm infants who were enrolled in a longitudinal study of the effects of NNS on energy expenditure, weight gain, and feeding readiness. Six infants were enrolled in the control group; they did not receive NNS but did develop NEC. Six infants were in the experimental group and did not develop NEC. The groups were compared on the basis of clinical correlates associated with NEC. These included race, gender, birth weight, five-minute Apgar, maternal bleeding, maternal age, and length of ruptured membranes. For infants who developed NEC, the number of clinical correlates ranged from one to four. For infants who received NNS, the range of clinical correlates was from one to five. It is not possible to conclude from this study that NNS protects preterm infants from NEC. Prospective studies of larger sample sizes that involve examination of the effect of NNS on gastric motility and enzyme and hormone secretion are needed.","1598":"As a member of a neonatal air transport team, whether fixed-wing or rotary-wing, you must have a basic understanding of flight physiology. The negative effects of altitude on the human body can be very detrimental, if not fatal, for the compromised neonate. This article looks at the physiologic stressors of air transport such as hypoxia and gas expansion. It also discusses environmental stressors such as noise, vibration, motion, temperature, and humidity. The key to successful neonatal air transport is the transport team knowing what physiologic changes to expect, properly assessing the infant, preventing stressors if able, and properly intervening as necessary.","1599":"","1600":"","1601":"","1602":"","1603":"St. Louis Children's Hospital has a self-contained, designated neonatal and pediatric transport team. In 1990, this team initiated a formalized death follow-up program.

The program differs from the traditional morbidity and mortality conference, which provides an educational and review forum only. Death follow-up meetings are held quarterly, and 61 follow-ups were done between January 1990 and December 1993.

The neonatal transport medical director and team coordinator developed a system that addressed problematic issues in providing back or return transports to the community hospitals. This system was devised, implemented, and adjusted to provide a more organized approach to the overtaxed system already in place. With efficient use of supplies, human resources, and teamwork, the prescheduled neonatal return transport process was put into effect. The system provided an easier mechanism for the coordination of return transports and helped decrease frustration levels in community hospital staff, referring nursery staff, and transport personnel. All or portions of this plan can be utilized in other neonatal transport services that find their present resources inadequate to meet the referral region's needs.","1605":"Research has shown that infants who receive developmentally supportive care during the course of medical treatment in the NICU have improved long-term developmental outcomes. Developmentally sound interventions should be implemented as early as possible in the hospital course and can be incorporated successfully into the care provided during transport of sick neonates. If developmental interventions are planned and implemented thoughtfully and consistently throughout the transport course, it may be possible to reduce or prevent neurodevelopmental complications.","1606":"The transport of a critically ill neonate from a community hospital to a regional intensive care unit requires the expertise of a specially trained team and a transport environment that addresses the unique needs of critically ill neonates. Utilization of ground vehicles for the transportation of neonates as compared to air transport seems to be increasing on a national basis. Traditional ambulance design falls short of meeting the distinctive needs of a neonatal transport service.

Continuous reassessment of temperature, respiration, heart rate, blood pressure, color, tone, and behavior during the initial four-hour postnatal period is crucial for the infant's survival and the preservation of an intact central nervous system and cardiopulmonary function. The complexity of the admission process should not jeopardize the nursing care of other infants in a busy neonatal intensive care unit.

Using qualitative methods, we separately interviewed ten mothers and nine primary nurses about their relationships, their views on each other, and the mothers' infant care. The tape-recorded interviews were transcribed verbatim, themes were extracted, and categories were developed for coding the data. As issues emerged, they were further explored in follow-up interviews. We identified four stages in the process of transferring the care of the infant from nurse to mother. The mother-nurse relationships were influenced by both the nurses' and the mothers' typical interactional patterns. Nurses had definite ideas about who was an \"ideal\" mother. To the mothers, the nurses' competence and caring attitude toward their infants were most important. The process by which the nurse and mother interact to provide care for the infant and alter their roles during the course of the hospitalization is linked to various factors and aspects of the nurse-mother relationship.","1640":"The introduction of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) to the intensive care nursery has stimulated us to develop infant care protocols for babies so treated.

Informed parental consent for study participation was obtained for eight infants who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit and required analgesic\/sedative therapy as part of their medical management to support mechanical ventilation. An intravenous loading dose (0.2 microgram\/kg) was administered over 20 minutes, followed by a continuous infusion (0.05 microgram\/kg\/hour). Whole blood samples were collected prior to onset of sufentanil therapy, immediately following the loading dose, and 24 hours after the start of the continuous sufentanil infusion for analysis of beta-endorphin and sufentanil serum content. Heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure were recorded as a routine part of medical management. The ventilatory efficiency index (VEI) and ventilation index (VI) were calculated before and after sufentanil therapy. Four male and four female infants were admitted to this study; the mean gestational age was 37 weeks, and weight was 2,970 gm. Sufentanil therapy appeared to be well tolerated, as evidenced by a lack of nursing observations noting changes in heart rate or mean arterial pressure. VEI values increased in four subjects, and VI values decreased in six subjects. Overall, the mean increase in VEI was 19 percent; the decrease in VI was 27 percent. The beta-endorphin serum content decreased in all subjects, and nurses did not report any signs of patient discomfort. Serum sufentanil content was undetectable. Sufentanil appears to be a suitable agent to provide analgesia\/sedation in the neonatal patient under the experimental conditions of this study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1651":"Accurate monitoring of respiratory status is of vital importance for the bedside nurse caring for the critically ill neonate. Pulmonary function testing can be utilized to effectively diagnose and quantitate lung disease in infants. Data obtained can be integrated into the nursing assessment and facilitate appropriate nursing interventions. The case studies provided in Part III of this series illustrate the utility of such testing in neonates with a range of illnesses and different diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas. Case study one is an infant with chronic lung disease complicated by bronchospasm, case study two is an infant with bronchomalacia, and case study three demonstrates fine tuning of the ventilator in an infant with respiratory distress syndrome. Every study describes the usefulness of pulmonary function testing on a specific patient, each with different pulmonary pathology. These case studies, and the discussion in parts I and II of this series, illustrate the value of integrating pulmonary function data with ongoing clinical assessment to optimize the care of the sick or convalescing neonate. Tests ordered on a routine and\/or as-needed basis will provide detailed information on the infant's pulmonary status that may be readily available at the infant's bedside. The neonatal nurse's involvement in requesting, performing, and interpreting these tests may enhance the treatment of the infant in intensive care.","1652":"Although pumps may seem readily available in the community, their effectiveness, as measured by the amount of negative pressure they generate and their cycling pattern of pressure and release, must be considered when recommending a particular model to the breast feeding mother of a premature infant. The neonatal nurse needs to assist the mother as she selects a breast pump by helping her pick the one that works best for her and by instructing her in its appropriate use. Such use needs to be oriented to obtaining maximum milk volume with minimal expenditure of energy without incurring breast or nipple pain or trauma. Sound breast pump recommendations and pumping instructions based on a clear understanding of the anatomy and physiology of the breast and knowledge of the lactation process will enable many women to give their infants the best possible nutritional and emotional start in life even before direct breast feeding begins.","1653":"It is generally agreed that the infant communicates physiological and psychological distress to caregivers by crying. Crying that is atypical in amount, intensity, duration, or quality could signal a physiological problem before the problem becomes obvious in other ways. Thus, cry analysis could soon become an important tool in early identification of infants at risk. To better assess neonatal cry sounds, nurses need some background in cry physiology. This article describes the evolution of cry sound production, presents the contemporary theories on the physiology of cry sound production, explains how cries are acoustically categorized and analyzed, and highlights the implications for infant caregivers.","1654":"A wide range of acute pain management strategies is used in various patient populations throughout the United States. A guideline, developed by an interdisciplinary panel convened by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, offers health care providers a \"coherent yet flexible approach to pain assessment and management for use in daily practice.\" The goal of the guideline and application to daily practice in the NICU are described.","1655":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic respiratory disease of multifactorial etiology that develops in some premature neonates who survive hyaline membrane disease (HMD). The role of corticosteroids as a cause of ongoing secondary damage in BPD remains speculative, but strategies to control this reactive inflammation form the basis for the use of corticosteroids. In several controlled clinical trials conducted to assess the role of corticosteroids in BPD, dexamethasone has been administered at a dose of 0.5 mg\/kg\/day, followed by a tapering regimen. Consistent benefits of corticosteroid use have been a decrease in the number of ventilator days and a facilitation of extubation. Common, often transient, side effects include hypertension, hyperglycemia, and poor weight gain. More serious side effects include myocardial hypertrophy, suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, perforated gastric ulcers, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The long-term effects on growth and development are unknown. The role of corticosteroids in the management of BPD still remains controversial. The dosage, timing, duration of therapy, and length of tapering period for dexamethasone treatment remain unresolved issues. The current literature supports the judicious use of corticosteroids to decrease the number of days on the ventilator and to facilitate extubation in selected infants with BPD. Further controlled clinical trials are necessary before the routine use of corticosteroids in the management of BPD can be recommended.","1656":"Nosocomial infections increase neonates' morbidity, hospital costs, and mortality. These infections occur most commonly in very low birth weight infants, who frequently required plastic intravascular catheters and parenteral nutrition. Diagnosis often relies on a combination of laboratory tests and nonspecific clinical signs. Criteria for diagnosing nosocomial infections have been published by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and should be used to standardize the identification of cases. Initial antibiotic therapy depends on (1) the bacterial species most likely to cause infection, (2) antibiotic resistance patterns in one's own hospital, (3) the patient's clinical condition, and (4) previous antibiotic therapy. Antibiotic coverage of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria is necessary. Following laboratory identification of the infecting organism and the antibiotic susceptibility results, the patient should be reevaluated and definitive therapy prescribed. Multiple antibiotics may be needed as definitive therapy if (1) the infecting organism is likely to develop resistant mutants during therapy (e.g., Pseudomonas species), (2) higher bactericidal serum activity is required than can usually be achieved with a single agent (e.g., enterococci, Listeria), (3) the patient is neutropenic or otherwise severely immunocompromised, or (4) blood cultures are persistently positive for bacteria despite appropriate therapy with a single agent. Attempts to prevent nosocomial bacteremias by routinely administering prophylactic vancomycin may hasten the development of vancomycin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci or enterococci and should be avoided.","1657":"During the past decade, an increasing incidence of staphylococcus organisms resistant to penicillinase-resistant penicillins has necessitated the use of vancomycin. This increased utilization has revitalized research concerning efficacious vancomycin dosing regimens for premature neonates, infants, and children. Vancomycin dosing in neonates is variable because this patient population has decreased renal clearance and a larger volume of distribution than infants, children, or adults. The observation of the variability in vancomycin clearance and volume of distribution in infants with the same postconceptional age (PCA) but different gestational age (GA) suggests that the rates of maturation both extrauterine and intrauterine for disposition mechanisms of vancomycin are similar when PCAs are equal. Conditions such as patent ductus arteriosus, respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and asphyxia may further complicate the renal maturation process. Few investigations suggest vancomycin dosing regimens. Most of these studies propose dosing regimens based on retrospective analysis of vancomycin pharmacokinetics obtained from regimens based on physician discretion. To ensure efficacious and rational vancomycin dosing for premature neonates and infants, regimens should consider PCA as well as body weight.","1658":"Except for overdose ingestions, excessive theophylline serum concentrations can be attributed predominantly to therapeutic misadventure. Utilizing medico-legal case reports as a core, this article considers how theophylline toxicity is manifested in several major organ systems and discusses drug\/disease interactions with theophylline that may alter serum theophylline concentrations, necessitating dose adjustments. Theophylline overdose is associated with significant morbidity and mortality risks. Overdose treatment, based on use of serum concentrations, is addressed. An understanding of all these factors can help caregivers avoid theophylline morbidity and mortality in neonatal patients.","1659":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia has been well described in premature infants requiring mechanical ventilation. Systemic steroids are one of many treatment modalities used in the management of these infants, but these agents have been associated with a number of adverse effects. Aerosolized therapy has been proposed as an alternative in order to minimize the systemic complications that occur with the parenteral route. The initial reports of inhaled steroids, although limited, have shown promising results with minimal side effects. This article addresses the mechanism of action, the role in therapy, and potential complications associated with the use of inhaled steroids in the treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","1660":"Pulmonary function testing is an important diagnostic tool in neonatal intensive care. These tests provide a detailed assessment of an infant's pulmonary status that can be used in several ways: to monitor the progression of lung disease, to streamline ventilator management, and to assess the infant's response to new treatments, such as surfactant replacement therapy or bronchodilators. In some settings, these tests are performed by specially trained nurses, and the results are available immediately for planning nursing care. This relatively noninvasive and low-risk assessment can be performed on all infants, whether on mechanical ventilation or breathing spontaneously. A comprehensive pulmonary function evaluation can be performed at the bedside in less than 60 minutes and is generally well tolerated. In this article, the determination of pulmonary \"vital signs\" tidal volume, minute ventilation, respiratory rate, pulmonary compliance, resistance, resistive work of breathing, and functional residual capacity-are discussed. The esophageal balloon technique for measuring dynamic pulmonary mechanics and energetics, as well as the helium dilution technique for measuring functional residual capacity, are described.","1661":"Two types of electrodes were evaluated over a six-week period in a neonatal intensive care nursery. Babies requiring monitoring were alternately assigned to either of two groups: Klear-Trace (n = 37) or Sentry (n = 51). Nursing staff monitored a range of variables daily. Klear-Trace electrodes, although slightly more expensive, lasted significantly longer than Sentry electrodes (p &gt; .0001). Factors such as incubator temperature and the weight of the neonate did not affect results, nor was there any difference in the frequency of repositioning electrodes between the two products. Because Klear-Trace electrodes last three times as long as Sentry electrodes (six days as opposed to two days), there may be cost advantages in using Klear-Trace electrodes.","1662":"","1663":"This study examines relationships between the actual severity of the premature infant's medical condition, maternal perception of the severity of the infant's illness, the infant's birth weight, and maternal anxiety levels. Subjects for this study were 44 mothers who were part of a larger study of parental stress in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). The premature infants of these mothers were hospitalized in the NICU of a large southeastern university medical center at the time of data collection. Mothers completed a severity perception scale and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Data about actual severity of each infant's illness and about the infant's characteristics were collected from the medical chart. The findings indicate that maternal perceptions regarding the severity of their premature infants' illness are complex and are influenced by different factors at different points in time. A significant relationship was not found between the mother's recollection of infant severity at NICU admission and maternal perceptions at the time of the interview, two to five days after admission. Although maternal recall of the severity of the infant's illness on admission is not related to anxiety, perceptions of severity at the time of the interview (two to five days after admission) are related to anxiety scores.","1664":"Theophylline intoxication has become an important clinical problem in the NICU, in large part because of its increased and extensive use for treatment of neonatal respiratory diseases.

By using suitable initial dosing guidelines and aggressive early serum concentration monitoring, practitioners can use theophylline safely and effectively in neonates.","1665":"Expressed mother's milk (EMM) provides innumerable immunologic and nutritional benefits. However, the nutritional value of EMM, especially the calorie-rich lipids, may be reduced during continuous gavage infusion (CGI). The purpose of the study was to compare the differences in lipid loss of EMM for two types of CGI tubing: standard bore and minibore. In an experimental design, 30 specimens of EMM were infused using a simulated CGI apparatus with a syringe pump; each of the 30 specimens was aliquotted to infuse through both types of CGI tubing. Preinfusion and postinfusion lipid concentrations were measured by the creamatocrit technique. The mean preinfusion creamatocrit value was 6.57 percent (SD = 2.09) with minimum and maximum values of 3.41 and 10.72 percent respectively (mean caloric content of 22.91 Kcal\/oz). The mean postinfusion creamatocrit for standard bore tubing was 4.98 percent (SD = 1.59), with minimum and maximum values of 1.90 and 9.38 percent respectively (mean caloric content = 20.14 Kcal\/oz). Mean percent of decrease in lipid concentration between preinfusion and postinfusion values for standard bore tubing was 1.59 percent (SD = 1.10) (mean caloric loss 2.77 Kcal\/oz). The mean postinfusion creamatocrit value for the minibore tubing was 5.24 percent (SD = 1.77) with minimum and maximum values of 2.55 and 9.68 percent respectively. This equates to a mean caloric content of 20.59 Kcal\/oz. Mean percent of decrease in lipid concentration between preinfusion and postinfusion values for minibore tubing was 1.34 percent (SD = 1.02) (mean caloric loss of 2.32 Kcal\/oz).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1666":"Thermoregulation is a critical physiologic function that is closely related to the transition and survival of the infant.

Pulmonary function testing can effectively diagnose, quantify, and qualify the dysfunction so as to better define a prognosis and guide appropriate therapy. Recent advances in computer-assisted technology and miniaturization of equipment now allow simple, reproducible, and rapid neonatal pulmonary function assessment at the bedside. The indications for, and benefits of, pulmonary function testing vary with gestation, age, and clinical condition of the infant. The overall description of the pulmonary function profile is discussed in this article. The general questions and approaches utilized for routine testing, the initial pulmonary function profile, and evaluation of the acutely ill infant and that of the convalescing preterm are addressed. The expertise of the intensive care nurse is invaluable in ensuring that safe, accurate, and reproducible data are obtained. The nurse can then use the data to alter the infant's care plan and to determine the necessity and timing for retesting. Specific information on methodology and examples of specific tests are given in related articles (Parts II, Vol. 13 No. 2 and III, Vol. 13 No. 4, respectively). A complete knowledge of pulmonary function assessment is important for any nurse caring for critically ill neonates.","1668":"","1669":"","1670":"Nurse researchers share one common characteristic: They all use statistical tests to provide the answers they are seeking. For others to correctly interpret research, it is important to understand what choices of tests are available and why a test was used. As nursing becomes more sophisticated in the research arena, the ability to read, interpret, and critique reported research findings becomes an important component of professional practice. This month's column contains a description of commonly used statistical tests. Researchers are often interested in differences between groups and relationships between variables. Examples of these two types of research are provided to illustrate use of the various tests. One common part of statistical tests examining differences between groups is the number of degrees of freedom. Degrees of freedom are usually defined as the number of observations (number of subjects or categories) minus the number of limitations placed on those observations. Examples of this concept are provided throughout the pertinent tests.","1671":"Occlusion of small-bore central venous lines with a calcium\/phosphate precipitate during medication administration is a concern for NICUs attempting to provide adequate nutrition for extremely low birth weight infants. This case presentation provides data for and reports the investigation of one central venous line precipitation incident. It also examines calcium\/phosphate solubility in parenteral nutrition solutions and explores the effects of heparin, aminophylline, and L-cysteine on solubility. The role of L-cysteine as an essential amino acid for neonates is addressed, and recommendations for reducing the likelihood of a central venous line occlusion are given.","1672":"This article describes the introduction of the neonatal nurse practitioner (NNP) role into a neonatal intensive care unit and reports the opinions and attitudes of physicians, registered nurses, and families regarding the NNP role. In addition, an overview of NNP education and credentialing mechanisms is presented. Surveys were used to assess the opinions and attitudes of obstetricians, pediatricians, family practitioners, registered nurses, and parents. The response rate ranged between 42 percent and 56 percent depending on the group surveyed. In general, both professionals and families were very satisfied with the clinical skills, knowledge base, and contributions to patient care that the NNP provided. Several different advantages and disadvantages to the NNP role in the NICU were identified by each professional group and by the parents.","1673":"Results of two studies of the effects of 2 to 3 hours of kangaroo care (KC), one a randomized trial of 25 premature infants in open-air cribs and the other a pilot of 6 premature infants who were at least 24 hours postextubation, who were cared for in incubators are reviewed. Both studies incorporated a pretest\/posttest control group design. Heart rate and abdominal skin temperature rose for KC infants during KC. Heat loss did not occur during KC, and infants slept more during KC. Kangaroo care had a comforting effect on infants and their mothers. Apnea and periodic breathing episodes dropped during KC for incubator infants. Suggestions and guidelines for selection of infants and practice based on these studies are presented.","1674":"Chest x-rays provide information that can help the clinician evaluate the newborn with respiratory distress.

To gather the data, we delivered questionnaires to all 75 NICU registered nurses at a southeastern regional hospital. The nurses were told the study was to learn \"about nursing practice in relation to gavage feedings.\" Thirty-five percent (26) of the questionnaires were completed and returned within the two-week data collection period. Although the literature recommends refeeding gastric aspirates to premature infants prior to gavage feedings, only two (8 percent) of the respondents indicated that they do this at least half the time. Many (54 percent) indicated that they knew refeeding residuals benefited preterm infants. However, more than half (58 percent) selected \"doctors in this hospital do not order\" as their rationale for not refeeding. More studies with larger sample sizes need to be done to assess accurately the reasons that nurses do not refeed gastric residuals. The findings of this study suggest (1) inservice educational programs should be developed regarding the value of refeeding residuals and (2) nurses' awareness of their decision-making ability should be increased.","1685":"This study assess the usefulness of the tympanogram as a screening tool for identifying otitis media and serous otitis media in preterm infants. Twenty-six infants from the NICU were assessed on the same day by two examiners using tympanometry and pneumatic otoscopy. The results were recorded separately and compared after all infants were tested. An audiologist independently interpreted each of the tympanogram strips. There was very little agreement between tympanometry and otoscopy results. The tympanogram was not found to be a repeatable or a reliable screening tool for assessing otitis media and serous otitis media in the NICU population. It was concluded that the NICU nurse must be aware of the signs and symptoms of otitis media and serous otitis media. If this diagnosis is raised for an infant in the NICU, careful visualization of the tympanic membrane should be carried out along with referrals to ear, nose, and throat and audiology experts.","1686":"Short- and long-term side effects of vancomycin, or the combination of vancomycin and gentamicin, were retrospectively evaluated for 65 treatment courses in 47 premature infants who were exposed to high vancomycin serum concentrations. Thirty-five treatment courses involved treatment with the combination; 30 courses involved treatment with vancomycin alone. No immediate side effects were noted. Nephrotoxicity, defined as an increase in serum creatinine 0.5 mg\/dl or more above baseline, was found in only 1 patient receiving vancomycin as the only antibiotic; that patient had pre-existing renal dysfunction. Three treatment courses involving the vancomycin-gentamicin combination resulted in nephrotoxicity; renal function returned to normal by 14 days after treatment. Thrombocytopenia was noted in 5 patients, but none exhibited clinical bleeding. Low platelet counts persisted throughout treatment, but by two weeks after treatment, this was resolved. In conclusion, the use of vancomycin or the combination of vancomycin and gentamicin in seriously ill premature infants is usually safe. The adverse effects noted were reversible, and monitoring creatinine and platelet counts during treatment is recommended.","1687":"Central hypoventilation syndrome (CHS) is a disorder characterized by little or no ventilatory or arousal sensitivity to hypercapnia and variable reactivity to hypoxemia, with little or no hypoxic arousal responsiveness. CHS may be congenital or acquired and can be idiopathic or secondary to a known central nervous system abnormality. Infants often present with life-threatening apnea during quiet sleep and develop severe respiratory acidosis because of the inadequate response to hypercapnia and hypoxia. Long-term treatment usually involves use of mechanical ventilation during sleep.","1688":"Understanding chest x-rays is an important aspect of nursing care. It enables the nurse to (1) recognize and report abnormal findings that may be life threatening, (2) follow the progression of a disease process, and (3) optimize patient care. A systematic approach is necessary when reading a chest x-ray to reduce the possibility of missing important features, especially in the presence of an obvious or striking abnormality. This article discusses several factors to consider when reading a chest x-ray. It also reviews the clinical and radiographic manifestations of some neonatal respiratory disorders.","1689":"","1690":"","1691":"","1692":"","1693":"","1694":"Infants with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) present special nursing challenges. This article reviews signs and symptoms of this disease process and explores the implications of care for the referring facility during transport and subsequent tertiary care. An overview of basic physiology, fetal circulation, and diagnostic testing is incorporated. Associated complications and future trends are addressed.","1695":"Participation of NICU staff in special education teacher training is discussed as a method for improving follow-up care of high-risk infants and for helping agencies comply with Public Law 99-457, which mandates services for disabled preschoolers and encourages intervention for infants and toddlers. Through a collaborative training program involving a medical center and a university, education students spent 15 to 20 hours in the NICU. Nurses gained a greater understanding of community-based early intervention programs and available providers and made referrals with more confidence. Student teachers witnessed the medical conditions and treatments experienced by NICU patients, gaining an understanding of the types of medical histories their future clients would have. The collaborating hospital developed working relationships with agencies that provide follow-up care to NICU graduates. The article discusses medical and educational models of care, implications and benefits of incorporating developmental care into NICU practice, effects of the law on early intervention programs, and features of the model collaborative program.","1696":"Accuracy of glucose values is crucial in the management of the critically ill neonate. Sampling for these values may be obtained from an umbilical artery catheter (UAC), but dextrose solutions infused through these catheters may contaminate samples obtained for glucose determination. An in vitro study was conducted to evaluate the effect of blood withdrawal amount and normal saline irrigation on the accuracy of glucose measurements obtained from a UAC. Methods included randomization of blood withdrawal amounts and irrigation with normal saline solution prior to obtaining the blood for glucose measurement. Two hundred and eighty glucose samples were obtained. Results revealed a significant difference between measured and baseline glucose values for all withdrawal amounts and varying flush volumes. This inability to approximate the baseline glucose values could mean that a UAC sample may not reflect the neonate's actual glucose value.","1697":"Gram-negative sepsis contributes significantly to neonatal morbidity and mortality. Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic used in the treatment of gram-negative infections. However, developmental differences of the neonate (compared with the older child or adult) influence the drug's disposition in the body. Administration, distribution, elimination, as well as susceptibility to toxicities may be altered in the neonatal period because of these pharmacokinetic differences. A literature review reveals pharmacokinetic differences of the neonate that affect gentamicin dosing. Nursing considerations affected by the developmental differences of the neonate include knowing appropriate dosages and routes of administration, pathophysiological and pharmacological conditions that affect gentamicin disposition, serum monitoring, and evaluation of adverse reactions and toxicities.","1698":"","1699":"","1700":"","1701":"","1702":"Mothers of 47 very low birth weight ( &lt; 1,500 gram) infants were interviewed concerning their feelings and views about interactions with them. Interviews were conducted within the first ten days and again three to five weeks after birth. Over the first month of the baby's hospitalization, mothers significantly increased their pleasure in interacting, knowledge of infant cues, and perception that their infants were responding. The most frequently mentioned behaviors were maternal talking and touching and infant eye opening and body activity. Many mothers appeared to be utilizing their infants' behaviors as a guide for their own behaviors and reported that their infants' behaviors had specific meanings. However, an equal number of mothers were not ascribing meaning to their infants' behaviors and did not appear to be using behavioral cues. These findings have implications for interventions by neonatal nurses.","1703":"The objectives of this study were to (1) develop a behavioral assessment tool for the measurement of pain in the preterm and full-term neonate; (2) establish the construct and concurrent validity, interrater reliability, and internal consistency of the tool; and (3) examine the relationship between the pain scores and infant characteristics. Thirty-eight infants contributed to the 90 procedures videotaped for the study. The Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) was used to score behavioral responses before, during, and after each intrusive procedure. The significant difference in NIPS scores over time indicates that the scale provides a measurement of intensity of infant responses to intrusive procedures. Concurrent validity was established by correlations, ranging from .53 to .84, between NIPS scores at each minute of observation and scores on the Visual Analogue Scale. Interrater reliability was high: Pearson correlations ranged from .92 to .97 across successive minutes of observation. The six component scores of the NIPS had high internal consistency: Cronbach's alphas were .95, .87, and .88 for before, during, and after the procedures, respectively. Although gestational age and five-minute Apgars were positively associated with NIPS scores over time, there was no association between these factors and responsiveness to pain, as measured by change in NIPS scores from before to during the procedure. Results are discussed in terms of the use of the NIPS in clinical trials and its clinical application in a neonatal intensive care unit.","1704":"","1705":"Skin-to-skin holding has been reported to be a useful technique for helping mothers feel close to their nonintubated infants hospitalized in the NICU. This article describes our experience with skin-to-skin holding of 25 intubated infants in the NICU. We found this technique was safe for the intubated infant and promoted parental attachment, even in parents who were at high risk for attachment impairments. Our experience suggests that skin-to-skin holding with small intubated infants may offer some parents an effective method to overcome some of the barriers to attachment imposed by the infant's hospitalization. In addition, our observations raise several questions regarding parent-infant interaction.","1706":"The role of patient advocate is not easily implemented with infants in the neonatal intensive care unit because there is no way of knowing what the infant would wish to be done. Many of the nurse's actions are based on the concept of the \"best interests of the infant.\" However, although widely used, this concept is rarely defined or described for the neonatal population. The purpose of this qualitative study was to identify themes related to the professional nurse's interpretation of the concept of advocacy. A case study design and inductive data analysis consisting of constant comparison and triangulation methodologies were used. This research resulted in multiple perspectives of a single phenomenon based on the similarities and differences in the nurse's perspective related to the concept of interest.","1707":"Every newborn infant should be screened for congenital hypothyroidism before discharge from the nursery. Neonatal screening for hypothyroidism was introduced to North America in 1972 and has been demonstrated to be cost effective in the prevention of neurological damage in children. Interpretation of diagnostic test results from such programs is based on understanding the physiology of the thyroid gland and recognition that neonatal hypothyroidism primarily stems from an embryological disorder of thyroid development rather than central causes involving the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Early diagnosis of hypothyroidism is dependent on proper timing and collection of blood samples and an efficient screening program reporting accurate results. A thorough maternal and family history in conjunction with clinical signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism, biochemical tests, and radiological findings should be used to rapidly establish the diagnosis. Early detection and treatment with thyroxine normalizes skeletal maturation, physical growth, cognitive functioning, and motor development of affected newborns. Nurses play an important role in identification, management, and supportive care of infants with hypothyroidism so that maximal potential is achieved.","1708":"Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM) is an infrequently seen abnormality. The pathology of the various types has been well described, but the pathogenesis of the defect is less clear. A review of the literature revealed a lack of nursing information relevant to the disease itself. This article presents a review of the pathophysiology of CCAM, medical management, and differential diagnosis in addition to the intricate care involved in nursing an infant with this defect.","1709":"The premature infant is more vulnerable to the NICU environment than a full-term infant due to neurologic immaturity and physiologic instability. Studies have been done on the effects of long-term decreases in environmental light, but none have been done on the immediate effects. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between immediate changes in environmental illumination and oxygen saturation in preterm neonates and whether these were affected by gestational and postnatal age. The oxygen saturations of 27 sleeping infants (2 to 56 days of age) between 26 and 37 weeks gestation were continuously recorded for 40 minutes utilizing a Nellcor N200 oximeter. After recording baseline saturations for 5 minutes with the room lights at 100 footcandles, the illumination level was lowered to 5 footcandles. At the end of 30 minutes, lights were increased to the previous level. Oxygen saturations were recorded at one and five minutes after illumination decreases and increases. There was a statistically significant interaction between repeated measures of saturation at baseline and one and five minutes after lights were increased and covariates gestational, corrected gestational, and postnatal age (p = .02, p = .008, p = .005). Repeated measure analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) revealed no statistically significant changes in oxygen saturations after the lights had been lowered for babies who were younger in gestational or postnatal age. The results of this study suggest that rapidly increasing illumination may be a cause of stress to the younger gestationally and postnatally preterm neonate.","1710":"","1711":"","1712":"","1713":"","1714":"","1715":"This article uses a paradigm case from clinical practice to isolate an abstract nursing concept. After identifying the concept, active advocacy, the article first defines it and then analyzes it in depth. The purpose of the article is to show how understanding abstract nursing concepts contributes to greater insight into the nuances of providing bedside care and contributes to the development of expert clinical practice. The article demonstrates how nurses in clinical practice can relate their own paradigm cases to other nurses as a way of sharing knowledge and information.","1716":"The purpose of this study was to compare the average duration of catheterization of percutaneous venous catheters (PVCs) with Teflon catheters placed in peripheral veins of neonates, and to describe the incidence of mechanical or infectious complications associated with their use. The sample consisted of twelve subjects with a total of 52 catheters--17 PVCs and 35 Teflon catheters. The results of the study indicated both a significant increase in the duration of catheterization (p = .001) and a significant reduction in the incidence of complications (p = .004) when PVCs were used. The mean duration of catheterization for PVCs was 178.6 hours and for Teflon catheters 41.9 hours. Although 80.8 percent of all the neonates studied suffered some complication leading to early catheter removal, such complications were observed most frequently with Teflon catheters (91 versus 59 percent of PVCs). However, the one subject who experienced the complication of catheter-related sepsis did have a PVC in situ for 313.5 hours. For this sample of neonates, the PVC was the most efficacious mode of IV therapy.","1717":"The grief response of parents following loss of an infant from a multiple gestation pregnancy was explored to describe the experience, compare and contrast mother's and father's responses, and analyze the properties of the Perinatal Grief Scale. Twenty-seven parents participated. Parental responses were complex and variable. Most parents disagreed with experiencing difficulty coping and despair. Confrontive, self reliant, and supportant coping strategies were used most frequently, while supportant, confrontive and optimistic strategies were reported the most effective. Anxiety, depression and alterations in activities of daily living were reported. The total impact of life events was slightly positive for this group. Although the instruments were reliable in this population of parents, sensitivity was reduced. A model of grief associated with multiple gestation perinatal loss was generated. Selection and effectiveness of coping strategies appear to be not only interrelated, but dependent on the time since the infants death and the length of the infants life. The length of an infant's life and time since death were affirmed as related to both the strength and type of relationship between variables associated with the grief response and to use and effectiveness of coping strategies. Responses of mothers and fathers appear to be similar.","1718":"Very low birth weight (VLBW) infants often develop postnatal head molding (PHM)--an elongation of the skull--when a standard, firm mattress is used. This study was undertaken to determine if a pressure relief mattress (PRM) might reduce the severity of PHM. One hundred twenty-eight infants (birth weight range 567-1,490 gm, mean 1,084; gestational age range 24-36 weeks, mean 28.5) with no congenital or acquired anomalies affecting head growth were randomly assigned to a control group (standard, firm mattress) or a study group (PRM). Study infants were placed on the PRM within 72 hours of birth. Occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) and anterior-posterior (AP) and biparietal (BP) diameters were measured at day four, seven, and then at one week intervals of life until the infant reached 2,000 gm or was discharged. An electronic digital caliper with an accuracy of 0.025 mm was used to obtain the AP and BP measurements. T-tests revealed no significant differences in head shape between the two groups. In conclusion, the pressure relief mattress did not reduce PHM in VLBW infants.","1719":"Adenosine is a purine nucleoside that impairs conduction through the AV node and is thus effective in terminating tachycardias involving the AV node. Gaining acceptance as the drug of choice for neonatal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), it is given IV as a rapid bolus with an initial dose of 0.05 mg\/kg and can be increased in increments of 0.05 mg\/kg every one to two minutes until termination of SVT (to a maximum of 0.25 mg\/kg). Because of its half-life of 0.6 to 10 seconds, adenosine will not prevent reinitiation of SVT, therefore other medications should be considered if prophylaxis is required. An advantage of the short half-life is the transient nature of adverse effects, which can include flushing, nondistressing alterations in respiratory pattern, irritability, sinus bradycardia, and varying degrees of AV block. Administration to critically ill infants, including those requiring mechanical ventilation, has been reported. The infant's blood pressure, electrocardiogram, respiratory status, and capillary refill should be monitored before, during, and after adenosine administration.","1720":"","1721":"","1722":"","1723":"","1724":"","1725":"Many nurses have recognized the need for sibling visitation and education in maternity units, but few sibling programs have been initiated for premature or ill infants. This article describes a model neonatal intensive care unit sibling education and visitation program that was designed and implemented by nurses practicing in a 60 bed NICU. The program strives to strengthen family functioning and bonding by involving siblings in the family experience of the hospitalization and care of a premature or ill infant. Over 100 children, ages three to eight years old, have attended the program since its inception and both the children and their parents have reported high levels of satisfaction with the program. Since the idea and implementation of NICU sibling education is so new, nursing research needs to be initiated in this area to determine the effectiveness of such programs.","1726":"When infants are admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit, the parents are immediately confronted with the crisis surrounding a critically ill newborn and often require additional support. Parents experience feelings of anxiety, fear, anger, and guilt over this unanticipated event. In addition, parents often describe the withdrawal of friends and the denial responses of well-meaning family members during their infant's illness. In an effort to address the NICU parents' need for support, Butterworth Hospital in collaboration with Michigan State University initiated a demonstration and research project focused on parent-to-parent support. The primary goal of the program is to improve parenting outcomes by providing emotional, informational, and role modeling support to parents of high-risk infants utilizing experienced volunteer parents. The program model includes professional program coordinators who recruit and train volunteer parents with past NICU experience. Volunteers are then matched to new NICU families based on infant's diagnosis, similar geographic location, and other characteristics. Volunteers provide support through hospital visits, phone contact, and home visits during the infant's hospitalization and throughout the infant's first year of life. The program was evaluated by analyzing the differences between a treatment group and a comparison group of parents. Significant differences between groups were found on measures of maternal mood states, maternal-infant relationships, and home environment. Services to over 900 families by 110 volunteer parents have convinced staff that the volunteer parents are a valuable and indispensable component of the services at Butterworth Hospital and that families of high-risk infants benefit from past experiences and ongoing support of volunteer parents.","1727":"Respiratory compromise remains a predominant problem of neonates in intensive care units, producing significant morbidity and mortality. Recent advances in therapy for these infants have focused on diminishing pulmonary inflation pressures. Liquid ventilation, a technique that has been extensively explored in animal models for over 20 years, may have a role in the treatment of pulmonary diseases. This technique utilizes perfluorochemical liquids, which are inert, clear, and odorless, and have a very high solubility for respiratory gases. Liquid ventilation has been studied in numerous animal species under many different conditions. Recent clinical trials have shown the feasibility and potential of this modality in human preterm neonates. This article reviews this technology specifically for the treatment of neonatal pulmonary disease. Potential advantages in respiratory distress and aspiration syndromes, persistent pulmonary hypertension, pneumonia, as well as other entities are discussed. The experience with liquid ventilation to date indicates that this technology may significantly benefit many neonatal lung diseases. Documentation of its efficacy and safety is necessary, however, before this modality will assume in clinical medicine.","1728":"In 1981, the Food and Drug Administration approved prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) for use in the treatment of neonates with congenital heart disease. PGE1 is commonly used in neonatal and pediatric intensive care units to maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus in those cardiac lesions that depend on the ductus for either systemic or pulmonary blood flow. Early recognition of hemodynamic instability and prompt initiation of PGE1 therapy is vital to survival in neonates with ductal-dependent cardiac lesions. Administration of PGE1 allows delay of palliative or corrective surgery until stabilization or transfer of the neonate to a tertiary care facility is achieved. It is also used as a bridge to heart transplantation in neonates in whom this treatment is an option. Congenital anomalies requiring treatment with PGE1 are those that restrict pulmonary blood flow (cyanotic or right-sided outflow tract obstructions) and systemic blood flow (acyanotic or left-sided outflow tract obstructions). Prostaglandin E1 is excreted by the kidneys, and elimination is almost complete within 24 hours after administration; 80 percent of it is rapidly metabolized after one pass through the pulmonary bed. Therefore, a continuous infusion and adequate intravenous access are necessary. Nurses caring for these neonates must have knowledge of all its potential side effects. Some of the most common side effects include cutaneous vasodilation, bradycardia, tachycardia, hypotension, seizure-like activity, hyperthermia, and apnea.","1729":"Chlamydia trachomatis infections are the most prevalent of all sexually transmitted diseases and can be transmitted to the neonate during the birth process. Neonatal chlamydial infections include inclusion conjunctivitis and chlamydial pneumonia. These infections cause no reported mortality but are associated with a high incidence of morbidity in the newborn. Nursing care is vitally important in prevention, early detection, and management of neonates with chlamydial infections. A knowledge of Chlamydia, its risk factors, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment will assure an improved outcome for the entire neonatal population.","1730":"","1731":"","1732":"","1733":"Cardiac size is only one parameter in the evaluation of the cardiovascular system on the neonatal chest x-ray examination.

The woman who abuses drugs may have a complex social history and high resistance to change. Drug use may be intergenerational and long-standing. Although cocaine may be a drug of choice, there is often polydrug abuse, complicating the assessment of the newborn who may be suffering from an overall unstable intrauterine environment due to poor general health and lack of nutrition, inadequate prenatal care, and risk of exposure to contaminants from street drugs and of infection, including Hepatitis B and HIV. Infants must be thoroughly assessed and treated as any newborn at risk. Drug screening and child welfare issues are discussed. Hepatitis B immunization is recommended. Ongoing assessment of the infant and intervention techniques are described. Since many drug-exposed infants go home with their mothers, an integrated plan of care for mother and infant may contribute to a therapeutic relationship, facilitate maternal attachment behaviors, and motivate maternal rehabilitation. For nurses caring for these demanding families, burnout prevention and self-care strategies are discussed.","1738":"Many childhood diseases can be prevented by proper immunization. The purpose of this article is to provide information about the risks and benefits associated with vaccines used in the United States for children under one year of age. Vaccines can be made from live or killed organisms and can stimulate both local and systemic immunity. The immunization schedule recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics is presented. Information about the use of routine vaccines, their risks and the diseases they prevent, is presented. Vaccines included are diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, poliomyelitis, Haemophilus influenzae, influenza viruses and hepatitis B. Research is ongoing to develop new vaccines and improve those currently in use.","1739":"Feasibility and safety of skin-to-skin contact through the Kangaroo method of care in a modern American tertiary intensive care was studied, as well as effects of this innovative care on mother's emotional reactions. Eight mother infant dyads participated in skin-to-skin contact a minimum of 4 hours each day for six days per week during a period of three consecutive weeks. The cognitive adaptation framework was used to identify themes in maternal responses. During the first week, mothers were preoccupied with childbirth events in attempts to understand their sense of loss and victimization. During the second week, maternal emotions intensified and manifested in fears for the baby's well-being and a need to discuss negative and positive emotional reactions to having a premature and sick baby. All mothers requested respite time from skin-to-skin contact, so they could deal with their emotional crises. By the third week, mothers had an increased sense of meaning, mastery, and self-esteem about what had happened to themselves and their infants. Themes of reconciliation and healing occurred when mothers placed their infant skin-to-skin in the Kangaroo position over the three consecutive weeks that this type of nursing care was experienced.","1740":"Ureaplasma urealyticum, a species of mycoplasma organisms, is a sexually transmitted organism which can cause a pneumonia in premature neonates. Ureaplasma urealyticum infection in the neonate occurs secondary to maternal transmission of the organism to the neonate. Recent studies show very low birth weight neonates with Ureaplasma urealyticum pneumonia are approximately two times more likely to develop chronic lung disease. Clinically Ureaplasma urealyticum pneumonia presents in a premature neonate and is often coexistent with hyaline membrane disease, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and continued respiratory distress without identification of a causative organism. Diagnosis is generally by tracheal aspirate or spinal fluid culture. Ureaplasma urealyticum requires specific culture media to grow, and recovery of the organism can take several weeks. Clinical management of the infant includes administration of erythromycin and meticulous pulmonary toilet. A case study which represents the typical presentation of Ureaplasma urealyticum pneumonia is included.","1741":"Amniotic band syndrome is a disease process that is unfamiliar to many neonatal nurses. It's presentation is variable in both type and severity, and pathophysiology and etiology still mystify those who have studied it in depth. Although better understood today, there remain many unanswered questions. A review of the current literature revealed an abundant supply of medically-based information and also a lack of resources focused on nursing-oriented information. This paper addresses the nursing implications of caring for an infant with amniotic band syndrome. A knowledgeable nurse will be able to assist in the diagnosis of amniotic band syndrome and have a better understanding of how to care for both the infant and his family. Both nursing and medical research needs to continue in this area to gain more knowledge about this complex disease process.","1742":"","1743":"The general principles of evaluating lung fields have been presented.

To fully utilize research findings, apply them to your own unique practice and then set up your own study using the original work as a starting place.","1748":"The parental stresses caused by a premature birth and the NICU experience may create problems in the parent-child relationship. These problems may lead to subsequent difficulty in bonding or parenting, and may even be related to child neglect and abuse. The NICU staff is in a unique position to help minimize parental stress by providing information, support, and understanding to facilitate coping with fear and uncertainty. Parents need help in adjusting their expectations to reality, especially during the early days in the NICU. While the mother is still hospitalized, the father is in an especially vulnerable position, as he may be unprepared to be a primary caregiver, threatened by the female staff, and expected to assume a focal role while he may need comfort himself. Information that is most helpful to parents is that which helps return some control to them. Involving parents in the child's caregiving and in decision making also helps increase parental feelings of control and decrease feelings of stress. Attention should be paid to the questions and nonverbal communication of the parents to ascertain when communication is especially important. Key times during which communication is typically crucial are identified.","1749":"It is necessary to decrease environmental stimuli in order to provide developmentally supportive care to the very low birthweight (VLBW) infant, thereby enhancing the sleep\/wake cycle and possibly physiologic stability. The purpose of this study was to determine if it was possible to decrease the noise level in the Developmental Unit, and promote sleep states in infants on the unit. After determining control noise levels and infant state, the last hour of each shift was designated a Quiet Hour. During this time, noise levels were monitored in the room in five locations. Infant sleep states were also noted. The results indicate that noise levels decreased significantly on two of the three shifts. Fewer infants were crying during the Quiet Hour than the control period (2.4 vs 14.3 percent), and more were in deep or light sleep (84.5 vs 33.9 percent). This study demonstrates that noise levels in Developmental Units can be significantly decreased, and that the decreased noise levels positively impact infant state. By enhancing sleep states, nurses can enhance the long term developmental outcome of the VLBW infant. However, the reduction of noise is highly dependent on the collaborative efforts of all health care providers within the unit.","1750":"The infant with a congenital diaphragmatic hernia presents many challenges to those caring for him. A thorough understanding of both anatomic and physiologic components can enable the caregiver to accurately assess the patient and employ interventions which will minimize complications. Part I of this article discussed the incidence, mortality, embryology, diagnosis, pathophysiology, and conventional management. This article discusses alternatives to conventional management, outcome predictors, current research and follow-up of the infant with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Recent advances in the use of non-conventional treatment, especially ECMO, for infants with diaphragmatic hernias have proven successful. Infants having risk factors associated with 100 percent mortality prior to the advent of ECMO are now surviving. In addition to ECMO, pharmacologic therapy, fetal surgery, lobar transplant, and ventilatory management research show promising results for treatment of the infant with a congenital diaphragmatic hernia.","1751":"Although survival of very low birth weight infants has improved with advancements in technology and neonatal care, the risk of periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage (PV-IVH) may be as high as 61 to 70 percent for this vulnerable population. Nursing can play an important role in reducing risk factors that contribute to PV-IVH, particularly during the first week of life, when a germinal matrix hemorrhage and its extension is most likely to occur. The pathophysiology of PV-IVH and a table of nursing interventions are presented to aid nurses in the assessment and planning of care for these tiny patients, who are at greatest risk for PV-IVH.","1752":"The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore parents' perceptions and the concepts involved in their preterm infant's back transport from a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit to their home community hospital. A convenience sample of fourteen parents were interviewed five to seven days after the back transport. Following data collection, the analysis of the parents' perceptions regarding the back transport of their premature infant identified a crisis theme that was influenced by several concepts. The subject's positive or negative meaning of the back transport during the pre-crisis phase defined the extent of the crisis during a three day transition period which led to an acceptance of events in the resolution phase. The subjects' perceptions of the previous events of hospitalization and communication of information regarding back transport influenced the meaning of the back transport for them. The extent of crisis during the transition phase was influenced by subjects' perceptions of medical complications, caretaking practice changes, environmental changes, feelings of powerlessness or empowerment, personal coping resources, and support systems available. Resolution in all cases occurred with an acceptance of events. Implications for practice and future research can be identified such as developing and testing education programs to prepare parents for the transition and strengthening the relationship between tertiary and community hospitals.","1753":"This article describes the objectives, content, teaching strategies, and evaluation methods for the Rural Perinatal Traineeship Program (RPTP). The RPTP is a five-day outreach education program sponsored by The Children's Hospital, Denver for perinatal RNs in the Rocky Mountain, western Great Plains region. The program emphasizes nursing assessment, recognition, stabilization, and transport of the high-risk pregnant woman and sick newborn. The goal is to enhance the nursing care of pregnant women and newborns provided by community hospital RNs by increasing knowledge, reviewing equipment, and updating care practices\/skills. To assess effectiveness of the RPTP, participants took a pre, post, and follow-up test. Additionally, follow-up questionnaires, which identified changes in care practices and equipment acquisition, were sent at three different intervals to 299 nurses who participated from 1980-89 and their nursing directors. Overall, 105 participants (36 percent) and 110 of the 127 nursing directors (86 percent) responded to the questionnaire. Results from 86 participants who took all three tests indicated an increase in pre- to post-test scores from 76 percent to 89 percent (p &lt; .001). Follow-up test scores averaged 85 percent (p .001). According to the nursing directors, participants suggested changes in 136 care practices, with 77 percent implemented; and 68 pieces of equipment of which 90 percent were acquired. Suggestions from past participants and nursing directors continue to influence the RPTP in the 1990s.","1754":"The care of sick premature infants at home is evaluated in terms of the benefits related to the health outcome of infants. The home care was provided by trained pediatric nurses through a service-oriented community agency. Pediatric nurses delivered home care 24 hours or less to sick very low birth weight infants discharged from the neonatal intensive care unit in lieu of continued hospitalization. Nursing care at home is described along with a sample nursing care plan for an infant with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The efficacy of home care on medical utilization indicated that there were less hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and visits to the specialty clinics than previously reported in the literature. Home visitation appeared to improve the health of high-risk premature infants, is cost effective, and may be less stressful for parents.","1755":"The infant with a congenital diaphragmatic hernia presents many challenges to those caring for him.

The documentation system utilizes flow sheets to document physiological functioning. The nursing progress note\/individualized patient care plan provides for a narrative note and continuous update of the patient care plan, keeping it current and meaningful. Previous care plans have involved massive writing about nursing actions.

When these systems are well integrated, the infant is able to interact with the environment without disruptions in autonomic, motor, and state functioning. As a result, he will not experience alterations in vital signs, color, state, or digestive functions that may compromise his future growth and development. Infants who can maintain or regain physiologic and behavioral organization will conserve energy for growth, provide caregivers with clear behavioral cues that indicate their needs, facilitate the establishment of parent-infant attachment, and use self-consoling or habituating behaviors when interacting with an environment that is too stimulating. As a result, developmental outcomes can be enhanced, particularly in infants who are at risk for neurobehavioral sequelae and developmental delays. Nurses can help infants achieve and maintain organization by providing an environment that supports their physiologic and behavioral organization.","1883":"Seizures in the newborn are different from those occurring in older children and adults. Health care professionals may find it difficult to recognize neonatal seizures because of their sometimes subtle manifestations. Convulsive behavior has many etiologies; some are associated with a favorable and some with a poor prognosis.

The problems facing the infant of a diabetic mother antenatally, intrapartally, and neonatally relate directly to the sequence of maternal hyperglycemia, fetal hyperglycemia, and subsequent fetal hyperinsulinemia. Antenatally, intervention is aimed at identifying and preventing macrosomia and sudden fetal demise. Intrapartally, screening and monitoring are used to identify cephalopelvic disproportion and shoulder dystocia to prevent birth trauma and fetal asphyxia. During the neonatal period, a thorough assessment should be made to identify respiratory distress, birth trauma, problems with metabolic transition, and congenital anomalies.","1928":"Human milk remains an important nutritional source for the low-birthweight infant, although supplementation may be necessary.

The interviews with the head nurses identified some common themes within their unique programs that centered around families, the NICU atmosphere, and the promotion of sibling activities. A liberal visiting policy was recognized in all the units, promoting the concept of family-centered care and allowing parents, siblings, and grandparents the opportunity to be supportive together. The flip side of having such a liberal visitation program was the sibling's exposure to a noisy, hurried atmosphere and parents' high anxiety level and the staff's concern about the preterm infant being subjected to a noisier, brighter, more stressful environment and possible exposure to infectious disease. The promotion of sibling activities was a recurring theme in all the head nurse interviews. Examples varied from unit to unit, but the implementation of growth and development principles, along with creativity and innovation, indicated that the overall efforts of these units in promoting sibling involvement was commendable.","1930":"","1931":"","1932":"","1933":"","1934":"","1935":"","1936":"The options for decision making in this situation are reviewed in step 8.

Have I had experience caring for a mother and infant in a similar situation? If so, to what extent did my previous experience influence my choice of action in this situation? Can I implement the decision? If not, why? This series of questions can assist the nurse or other health professional in actually making a decision and thinking about their personal reaction to implementing it (accountability). Critical thinking and taking time to analyze one's decision-making process are important tools that help each of us make morally appropriate decisions in clinical practice. The results are better patient care and the personal satisfaction of knowing you have done your best to promote the best interests of infants assigned to your care.","1937":"","1938":"Routine newborn circumcision cannot be widely advocated until large prospective studies thoroughly document its prophylactic value.

There are several million members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the US, and 70% of the population of Utah is Mormon.  Family life is the basic unit of the religion, with women expected to serve as childbearers while men preside over the family and provide for the physical and spiritual needs of the children. Both premarital sex and adultery are prohibited, and marriage below the age of 18 years is rare.  In keeping with the Mormon belief that heaven is full of millions of spirits awaiting an earthly body, birth control and abortion are also forbidden.  Since the female body is regarded as the tabernacle of the spirit and the residence of God's spirit children, a high priority is given to prenatal care.  Most Mormons adhere to the hegemonic model in the US physician visits in the prenatal period and delivery in a hospital.  In the postpartum period, Mormon women are relieved of routine household and child care duties by extended family and church ward members.  Breastfeeding is encouraged for both its health and bonding advantages.  From a young age, Mormon children are given responsibilities such as household duties and the tending of younger siblings.  Mothers play a key role in their children's religious education, and parents who do not rear their children strictly according to Mormon gospel are condemned.  Since most deliveries of Mormon infants occur in hospitals, neonatal nurses should be mindful of the patriarchal structure of the family, expect parents to process medical information in spiritual terms, grant requests for priesthood blessings, requests for priesthood blessings and not advocate contraceptive usage.","1941":"","1942":"","1943":"Use of a conceptual model of nursing for the minimal handling protocol provides organization and a theoretical basis for nursing care standards. Levine's principles of conservation of energy, structural integrity, personal integrity, and social integrity provide a concrete approach for making nursing care judgments.

The etiology of the specific disorder is directly related to its risk of occurrence\/recurrence, which can be theoretically or specifically calculated. Suspicion of genetic disease in an unborn child is heightened by a history of disease in blood relatives and by the presence of multiple miscarriages and\/or increased maternal age. Current prenatal screening tools include maternal\/fetal sampling (tissue, cells, amniotic fluid) and fetal visualization. All these tests have specific complications and limitations. Families undergoing prenatal testing are likely to experience anxiety, which may continue throughout the pregnancy despite a diagnosis of an unaffected fetus. Such anxiety can interfere with attachment to the unborn child. The aware clinical nurse specialist is in a position to help all parents by providing clear and accurate information, sensitive emotional support, and by optimizing social support systems.","1945":"","1946":"","1947":"The implications of cocaine use during pregnancy include an increased incidence of stillbirths, abruptio placentae, and an increased risk of other delivery complications. The neonate born to a woman using cocaine may show a lack of definite physical stigmata, absence of consistent withdrawal patterns, and high incidence of irritability during the neonatal period. Nursing implications for promoting optimal pregnancy and neonatal outcome primarily involve early pregnancy intervention, consistent care, education, and delivery management. During the neonatal period, the nurse should work to reduce stimulation, position to promote optimal interaction, educate the parents, and initiate follow-up care for continued developmental assessments. At this time, available data merely suggest associations between cocaine use and negative perinatal outcomes; they do not imply causal relationships. Because the adverse effects to the fetus and newborn are not conclusively documented in the literature, it can be difficult to educate the preconceptual or pregnant woman about the risks of cocaine use during pregnancy. Despite this obstacle, the nurse must use the information available to present as clear a picture as possible of the risks of exposing the fetus to cocaine.","1948":"","1949":"","1950":"","1951":"","1952":"","1953":"With increased understanding of the feeding needs of high-risk sick neonates, nurses can facilitate adequate weight gain and promote earlier discharges.

Nurse researchers have identified the value of human touch and stimulation to the development of premature infants. Although the fragile premature infant may not always appear to respond overtly, the weight gain, and social and mental development of the cuddled babies give testimony to the effectiveness of human attention. The infants' improved well-being and subsequent earlier hospital discharge as a result of cuddling are convincing rationale to implement a cuddler program. A well administered hospital volunteer program is an excellent resource for cuddlers. Volunteers tend to be readily attracted to a neonatal nursery and their services have proven to be safe and therapeutic. After determining the type of service needed, nurse administrators and directors of volunteer programs may team together to develop their strategy. A literature review about cuddler programs and the development of the premature infant contain valuable information of research findings and experience of other nurses. Staff nurse and physician involvement in the program are essential for overall success as well as identifying an effective person to coordinate the plan. The team of planners need a program development and implementation schedule, a volunteer job description and a training plan. Orientation of all nursing staff to the program may occur simultaneously with volunteer recruitment. Evaluation of a cuddler program utilizing predetermined criteria should occur at scheduled intervals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1966":"The etiology of renal failure in the newborn infant is multifactorial. The increasing survival of low-birthweight infants and the aggressive drug management of pathophysiological disease states such as pulmonary hypertension and patent ductus arteriosus has resulted in an increase in the number of infants presenting with acute renal failure. Experience in our intensive care unit has proved that early intervention with peritoneal dialysis is safe and may significantly reduce both morbidity and mortality in such patients.","1967":"","1968":"The data presented in this review of the history of premature care in the United States is limited to published material available within the local area. Additional manuscripts, records, and oral histories, would provide a more comprehensive perspective. The period from 1900 to the early 1940s represents the beginning of premature care in the United States characterized by efforts to provide an intrauterinelike environment. Energies were focused on the three identified basic needs of temperature support, nutrition, and protection against infection. The idea of caring for prematures in an especially designated area in the hospital evolved, and premature stations or wards were created. Advances in technology resulted in sophisticated systems for providing warmth for infants and some interventions for respiratory support using oxygen and an infant ventilator. The dangers of cold stress during transport were addressed with attempts to provide warmth using an especially designed transport incubator. A revolutionary growth in technology combined with the nationwide coordinated effort for organizing regional care has characterized this past 30-year period of premature care (1950-1980). The infant is now surrounded by sophisticated life-support systems and receives medical care from a much broader knowledge base than was available in the past. The environment for premature care has truly surpassed any expectations that health care professionals of the past may have held when the concept of an incubator emerged. Nursing of premature infants has expanded with the level of sophisticated equipment and the knowledge of the premature infant's physiologic needs. Nurses are no longer the gatekeepers of a sanctuary against infection. They care for the premature and the family by providing support, information, and caring during an emotionally stressful time. As the premature's physiological condition stabilizes, the nurse helps the family learn to care for the infant and thus transfers the responsibility of providing warmth, nutrition, and protection to the parents. Nurses are now gatekeepers of a very special sanctuary--the sanctuary of caring.","1969":"Current research suggests that the secretion of beta-endorphin from the pituitary gland may be associated with the refractory hypotension seen in patients with septic shock. Extensive animal research and a few clinical studies have demonstrated that naloxone, a narcotic antagonist, can increase MAP, cardiac output, and cardiac contractility and improve survival in victims of endotoxic shock. The ability of naloxone to improve MAP, however, appears to decrease with prolonged persistent hypotension (greater than eight hours). Studies also suggest that a synergistic effect exists between naloxone and the steroid methylprednisolone in improving the hemodynamics of these patients. In the future, naloxone may prove to be essential in the management of patients in the early stages of septic shock, but more complete clinical trials are warranted. It is imperative that nurses be involved in this type of clinical research.","1970":"","1971":"","1972":"","1973":"This variety of rightness--the end, the means, personal moral development--is a reminder of the need for tolerance of several \"right\" actions.

Tolerance is a major aspect of American history--tolerance for a variety of religious traditions, tolerance for a variety of ethnic and cultural traditions, tolerance for a variety of interpretations (values) of life and its meaning. We grow up with variety in religious beliefs, values, ethical principles, or theories (ethical pluralism). We also function at varying levels of moral development at different times, which influences our choice of what is right or good in nursing care. The variety of \"right\" actions can be confusing. We know firsthand the complexity of trying to choose among several morally right actions, one of which is in the best interests of the neonate and his family.
