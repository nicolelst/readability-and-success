cultural and social norms in India stipulate that family and preferably children of the older person, provide the support and care that is needed. In recent years, we have witnessed an overall upsurge in interest in informal care from all countries in the developed world considering their ageing populations. The older people living alone group is, especially interesting in this matter, since it seems to deviate from the expectations of extended family living. The aim was to describe older persons' experiences of informal care when living alone in India. The study has a hermeneutic design, analysing interviews of older persons living alone in India. Findings revealed informal care as the thematic patterns: Informal care as a fundamental human responsibility, an obligation and thereby a way to act in 'common sense'. It was a way of 'paying-back' care that they had received from others in their life history, motivated by governmental care was not presented as an option. Informal care also created safety by the provision of alert and actionable care by loved ones, including spatial safety. Most of the informants experienced themselves as informal caregivers assisting others in need even if they themselves were old and fragile. Providing self care was also seen as a part of informal care conducted by capable and worthy persons. They also pointed out their own obligation to seek informal care and even to listen to the suggestions of younger generations regarding the type and scope of care. Informal care in India is not only dependent on having children who ensure that you receive the care you need. Extended family, neighbours and friends feel a basic human obligation to care for the older people in their environment. This responsibility is deeply rooted even within the older people who become fragile in old age. ","4":null,"5":null,"6":"Many people living with dementia will move to specialist care facilities as the syndrome progresses. Psychological formulation offers a promising non-pharmacological approach to managing behaviours that challenge in dementia care. However, little is known about how formulation is viewed by non-qualified care staff who are responsible for the day-to-day care of residents. Therefore, the present study aimed to explore the experiences of care staff in relation to formulation as an approach to managing behaviour in dementia care. This was a qualitative design involving semi-structured, individual interviews. Interviews were conducted with 13 care staff with experience of psychological formulation from five care facilities. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Three themes emerged from the data that offer an insight into the factors contributing to care staff's perspectives of formulation-led care. The themes were defined as expectation, working together and understanding. The findings suggest that formulation-led care approaches are viewed by care staff as a favourable approach to supporting people living with dementia who present with behavioural difficulties. Psychologists can aid care staff's investment within formulation approaches through managing expectations and fostering effective working relationships with care teams to develop understanding of the context around behaviours that challenge. By aiding effective, collaborative communication between nursing and psychology team members and providing clear feedback to aid nurses' understanding of formulations, this study highlights that consideration of biopsychosocial factors when attempting to understand behaviour offers a safe, person-centred alternative to pharmacological approaches. ","7":"Although families are increasingly seen as allies to improve delirium management and reduce its consequences, their involvement in the postcardiac surgery setting is challenging considering patients' critical state and short hospital stay. To our knowledge, no theory-based nursing intervention exists that optimally supports the involvement of families in delirium management in the context of postcardiac surgery. We aimed to develop MENTOR_D, a nursing intervention to support the involvement of families in delirium management. MENTOR_D was developed based on Sidani and Braden's (2011) intervention development framework. Narrative literature reviews paired with the clinical experience of an expert committee were used to inform these three steps: (1) develop an understanding of the problem under study; (2) define the objectives of the intervention and identify a theoretical framework for highlighting strategies to be used in the intervention; and (3) operationalize the intervention and identify its anticipated outcomes. As a result of the three steps, the MENTOR_D nursing intervention relies on a caring-mentoring relationship between a nurse and the family. The aim of MENTOR_D is to increase the presence of the family at their relative's bedside and their involvement in delirium management. MENTOR_D's content is delivered over three phases that are organised around the visits of the family at the patient's bedside. During these phases, families used their knowledge of the patient to tailor the delirium management actions. These actions include orientation and reminiscence and were aimed at diminishing anxiety and increasing sense of self-efficacy in families and diminishing delirium severity and improving recovery in patients. A deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms of an intervention is key in its success to reach the targeted goals of effectiveness in practice. This understanding can be achieved through the careful development of a theory of the intervention before the operationalisation of its components and its testing. The proposed paper presents the theory of the MENTOR_D intervention, that is, its conceptualization and proposed mechanisms of action. As delirium continues to be a major complication, this intervention is a promising solution to increase families' involvement in delirium management and highlights the support that nurses can offer to facilitate this involvement. With its use in future studies and practice, it can be further refined. ","8":"Mobility challenges may indicate functional decline and are a relevant problem faced by older people. An individual's perception of mobility is affected and moderated by several factors and varies significantly from one community to another. Providing an improved understanding of how older people perceive and experience mobility is a step towards better preparing nurses for roles they are increasingly expected to play. The purpose of the study was to investigate perceptions and experiences of mobility in a group of Brazilian community-dwelling older people living with mobility challenges. Data were generated between June and October 2018 through in-depth interviews, socio-demographic surveys and field notes. Purposive sampling strategies were used to recruit 23 Brazilian older people to participate in this focused ethnographic study. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Perceptions of Brazilian community-dwelling older people living with mobility challenges were culturally learned and influenced by the social, physical and health environments. Participants' previous experiences with mobility had significant implications on values they attributed to mobility challenges. In addition, older people's experiences with mobility challenges were an integral part of sense of self and strongly related to contextual factors. This study contributes new information to the field of inquiry on mobility of older people as it focuses on the perceptions of a specific age group and culture and attends to the interrelationships between health conditions and contextual factors affecting the mobility of older people. This study's particular contributions to the nursing discipline are related to improving care by revealing the significance of the context of mobility in which nursing actions are applied. ","9":"Person-centred care is a growing imperative in healthcare, but the documentation of person-centred care is challenging. According to the Gothenburg Framework of Person-centred Care, care should be documented in continuously revised care plans and based on patients' personally formulated goals and resources to secure a continuous partnership. This study aimed to examine care plans produced within a randomised controlled trial that tested a person-centred care intervention in older people with acute coronary syndrome. Nurses with training in the theory and practice of person-centred care had written the care plans. We conducted a secondary analysis of care plans developed in a randomised controlled trial for assessing person-centred care in patients with acute coronary syndrome (Myocardial Infarct [MI] or unstable angina pectoris). The study sample included 84 patients, with three care plans for each patient from inpatient (T1), outpatient (T2) and primary care (T3), that is, a total of 252 care plans. We conducted a descriptive quantitative content analysis of the care plans to examine the reported patients' life-world and medical\/health resources and goals. The analysis illustrates the differences and overlaps between life-world and medical\/health goals and resources. The documented goals and resources change over time: life-world goals and resources decreased with time as medical\/health goals and resources documentation increased. This paper illustrates that in the setting of a randomised controlled trial, nurses with training in person-centred care recorded fewer life-world and more medical\/health goals over time. Placing life-world goals at the top of the goal hierarchy enables alignment with medical\/health goals. Further research should explore whether the goals and resources documented in care plans accurately reflect patients' wishes as they transition along the care chain. Swedish registry, Researchweb.org, ID NR 65 791. ","10":"Dementia affects a large proportion of society and places a significant burden on older people and healthcare systems internationally. Managing symptoms at the end of life for people with dementia is complex. Participatory action research can offer an approach that helps to encourage implementation of evidence-based practices in long-term care settings. Three evidence-based guidance documents (pain assessment and management, medication management, nutrition and hydration management) were introduced in three long-term care settings for older people. Data generated from work-based learning groups were analysed using a critical hermeneutic approach to explore the use of participatory action research to support the implementation of guidance documents in these settings. Engagement and Facilitation emerged as key factors which both enabled and hindered the PAR processes at each study site. This study adds to the body of knowledge that emphasises the value of participatory action research in enabling practice change. It further identifies key practice development approaches that are necessary to enable a PAR approach to occur in care settings for older people with dementia. The study highlights the need to ensure that dedicated attention is paid to strategies that facilitate key transformations in clinical practice. ","11":"Hospitalised older persons with dementia are commonly discharged with intensified sleep disturbances. These disturbances can impede the recovery process. Nurses are well-positioned to assist persons with dementia and their family caregivers in managing sleep disturbances during the transition from hospital to home. To describe the development of a multi-component intervention to promote sleep. We applied three stages of the intervention mapping method to develop a non-pharmacological, multi-component sleep intervention. The first stage involved a review of the literature to generate an understanding of the determinants of sleep disturbances experienced by persons with dementia in hospital and home settings. The second stage consisted of a literature review to identify therapies for managing commonly reported determinants of sleep disturbances. The third stage entailed delineation of the intervention components. The most common determinants of sleep disturbances experienced by persons with dementia in hospital and home settings were: physiological changes associated with ageing, sleep environments non-conducive to sleep, limited exposure to light and engagement in physical activity, stress and sleep-related beliefs and behaviours. Therapies found effective included: light therapy, physical activity therapy, sleep hygiene, and stimulus control therapy. These therapies were integrated into a multi-component sleep intervention to be provided using the teach-back technique, during and following hospitalisation. Consistent with the principles of patient engagement, the multi-component sleep intervention will be evaluated for its acceptability and feasibility. The intervention has potentials to improve sleep during the transition from hospital to home.

The purpose of this study was to determine how social networks influence therapeutic self-care behaviours and health among community dwelling older people living with multiple long-term conditions. Explanatory sequential mixed-methods. Community dwelling older people living in the Northeast United States. A cross-sectional sample of eighty-nine people aged sixty-five and older participated in telephone surveys. A nested sample of twelve participants completed a follow-up open-ended interview. Descriptive statistics, bivariate correlations and regression statistics were used to examine the associations between social network features and functions with the dependent variables of therapeutic self-care behaviours and health. Qualities that emphasised the contexts of the relationships were integrated in the data analysis. The strength of the social network and level of social support influenced the outcomes of therapeutic self-care and mental health. Thematic analysis expanded this explanation of self-care in relation to social network size, psycho-social support, activation of support, interaction frequency and type. In supporting older people living with multiple long-term conditions, this nursing research offers new ways to understand close social relationships influence on self-care in developing systems of care at the community level. Designing care systems that include small trusted formal and informal caregivers that integrate social network members could improve health outcomes and improve access to supportive resources.

In Nepal, the number of older people with dementia is rapidly rising, and there is a need for knowledge of how to provide quality dementia care in OAHs. An exploratory hermeneutic design, employing qualitative interviews with eleven HCPs caring for residents with dementia in a total of five OAHs. The analysis showed that HCPs found limited educational training in dementia-specific care to be a critical challenge leading to reduced quality in caregiving practice. Insufficient HCP competence in dementia-specific care undermined adequate coping with residents' cognitive disturbances and the behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia (BPSD). Poor HCP\/medical doctor (MD)-to-patient ratio was perceived as a critical challenge preventing proper diagnostic examination, treatment and dementia-specific care practice. Limited educational training, sparse competence in mastering residents' cognitive disturbances and BPSD, and insufficient resources to ensure sufficient numbers of HCPs and MDs for proper diagnostic examination, treatment and dementia-specific care were identified as critical challenges restricting quality dementia care in these Nepalese OAHs. The study findings indicate a need for a clear Nepalese policy and a national plan for dementia care in OAHs that includes strategies for HCP educational training and how to provide resources to ensure a sufficient workforce of HCPs and MDs for proper diagnostic examination, treatment and dementia-specific care.

To inform practice and research directions, the aim of this integrative review was to identify and synthesise previous knowledge about the characteristics of chronic wounds in PLWD, in terms of chronic wound types, prevalence, setting and interventions. A literature search was conducted for publications in English using PubMed, Web of Science and CINAHL. The minimum information required for inclusion was how many PLWD enrolled in the study had wounds. This integrative review followed the Whittemore and Knafl methodology. Data extraction and synthesis were guided by a directed content analysis, with a coding structure based on an initial review of the literature. Thirty-six articles met the inclusion criteria. The majority were missing characteristics of PLWD including severity of dementia and race\/ethnicity\/nationality, and none mentioned skin tone. Most focused on pressure injuries in the nursing home and acute care setting. Few included information on interventions. Only one discussed challenges of wound care for a PLWD exhibiting aggression. There is a gap in the literature regarding PLWD and chronic wounds other than pressure injuries that are common in older adults (e.g. diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers). Research is warranted among those PLWD who live alone and those who receive wound care from family caregivers to understand experiences. Knowledge can inform the development of future novel interventions for wound healing. Future research is needed regarding chronic wounds in those who exhibit behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia. Nurses that care for chronic wounds in PLWD can contribute their knowledge to include information in guidelines on best care practices and contribute their perspective to research teams for future research.

However, effective care strategies to promote a good death for PwD remain unclear. This study aimed to explore nurses' perceptions of a good death for PwD in LTC settings for older adults. Interviews were conducted with 19 nurses providing end-of-life care in LTC settings for older adults in Japan. The transcribed texts were analysed using inductive content analysis. We identified two themes: (1) ambiguity and (2) preparedness. Participants perceived that there was ambiguity regarding a good death for PwD and emphasised the need for preparedness of those around PwD for a good death. Five categories represented preparedness: (a) reaffirming the original personality before dementia; (b) respecting that PwD change; (c) interpreting and fulfilling obscure desires, feelings, and sensations; (d) providing care consistent with an agreed-upon natural death process; and (e) maintaining relationships. Long-term care nurses should encourage families and multidisciplinary team members, including the nurses themselves, to prepare for a good death of the PwD. Future research should focus on healthcare professionals' perspectives on advance care planning in the early stages of dementia, as well as the perceptions of PwD, their family members and other healthcare professionals regarding the natural death process. ","30":null,"31":"In Finland, care plans at long-term care facilities (LTCF) for the older persons should be based on information from Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI) assessments and the principles of structured data. Hence, managers are responsible for ensuring that the RAI system is used to a satisfactory extent, the provided information is used in care planning, and that staff members are competent at composing high-quality care plans. To explore the congruence between first-line managers' assessments of the extent to which care plans include RAI information and separately observed RAI-related contents of care plans. The study was based on a descriptive, cross-sectional survey of first-line managers (n = 15) from three LTCF organisations and a randomly selected sample of care plans (n = 45) from two LTCF organisations in Finland. Manager responses and analysis of care plans were reviewed at a general level. The data were gathered in 2019 and analysed using statistical methods and content analysis. First-line managers' assessments of the extent to which their units' care plans included RAI information did not match the observed care plan contents. The care plan analysis revealed that managers significantly overestimated the extent to which care plans included RAI-related content. Managers at LTCF organisations need more training to be able to sufficiently support their staff in using RAI information to draft high-quality care plans. Care plans must include a higher level of information related to RAI assessments. To develop competencies in drafting high-quality care plans, training related to RAI information utilisation on all aspects of the care plan should be emphasised and training should be provided to first-line managers and more broadly across the nursing staff. ","32":"It is estimated that there are 101 million older care-dependent people (60+). This group is expected to double by 2050 due to the ageing of the world's population and the rise in life expectancy. Although people tend to live longer, there is little evidence that they live their later years in better health. In the future, this might put even more stress on an already overburdened acute care health system. Hospitals therefore need to focus on preventive measures to avoid rehospitalisation of older people. Family participation could be part of the solution. This study aimed to gain insight into the preferences of family caregivers, patients and nurses towards family caregivers taking up care tasks during hospitalisation, after receiving education. Data were collected using a cross-sectional survey of nursing staff, family caregivers and older patients in nine wards for older people within three hospitals. Data collection ran from October 2019 till March 2020 using a questionnaire of 25 care tasks with three answer options (perform alone, together with a nurse, do not perform). A consecutive sample of 330 patients and 133 family caregivers (81 dyads could be formed) next to a convenience sample of 67 nurses was obtained. Patients (65%) are more prepared to let their family caregiver perform tasks alone than family caregivers (59%) and nurses (52%). Only few patients (3.8%) and family caregivers (13%) prefer the family caregiver to perform a task together with a nurse. The latter answer thus rather dichotomously, while nurses answer more dynamically over the three answer options. Of all family caregivers, 50% indicate willingness and ability to perform tasks on a regular basis. Significant correlations indicate that patients, family caregivers and nurses agree on which care tasks would be more preferable to be performed by a family caregiver. Looking at the dyads, preferences of a patient are not suspected to be more similar with his family caregiver than with a random family caregiver. Patients, FCGs and nurses indicate to be prepared to engage in family participation. Further research needs to concentrate on the different attitudes and perceptions towards performing care tasks through qualitative research and how a successful implementation can be set up. Our study indicates that implementation of family participation in physical care within the hospital could be viable.

","33":null,"34":"As the population of older adults is estimated to double by 2050, the growing demand for nurses to provide care to older adults will grow. Internationally, attitudes among nursing students towards caring for older adults range from negative to slightly positive. The purpose of this qualitative descriptive study was to examine undergraduate nursing students' thoughts, feelings and perspectives towards older adults residing in nursing homes prior to their clinical experience. Students enrolled in a clinical component of a course within a baccalaureate nursing programme were prompted to write a one-page reflection on their thoughts and feelings toward caring for older adults in a nursing home. Artefacts from 72 undergraduate students' were examined, and data saturation was obtained at 20 cases. Utilizing a one-time inquiry approach, we identified eight categories that emerged from the data: Range of emotions when anticipating clinical, building rewarding relationships with older adults, preparing for my nursing career, student pre-existing attitudes, providing the best care possible, relationships with grandparents, experience(s) in nursing homes and older adults 'have so much to teach us'. Two themes encompassed all the others: '[Older adults] have so much to teach us' and 'providing the best care possible'. A strong majority of students expressed enthusiasm for their upcoming clinical in a nursing home. Students' attitudes were significantly more positive than those in prior studies. The results offer essential insight for nursing faculty who teach and design clinical experiences for undergraduate nursing students in nursing home facilities. Faculty should take account of their students' prior experiences, thoughts, and feelings to prepare them appropriately to care for older adults in their future nursing careers. Increasing staffing and retention of staff in nursing homes facilities remains a priority for stakeholders in long-term care of older adults. Nursing educators must continuously assess students' knowledge and attitudes assists to identify knowledge gaps and misconceptions, which must be addressed to teach student nurses how to provide high-quality, effective and culturally sensitive care to older adults. As students become more competent in caring for older adults, their desire to pursue a nursing career in gerontology care may increase. Early experiences of student nurses with older adults will prepare nursing students for their future career. Understanding students' thoughts and feelings will assist faculty in tailoring clinical orientation, designing clinical experiences and post-conference debriefings that address students' concerns. This research contributes to the knowledge of perceptions of nursing students and will assist to design educational experiences. Nursing educators who understand nursing students' attitudes toward caring for older persons can facilitate therapeutic interactions between nursing students and older adults. Designing experiences with these research results in mind may facilitate the development of positive attitudes towards caring for older adults. ","35":"Moving to a residential aged care facility involves living far from family and a familiar environment, and leaving behind the social support system of relatives, friends, and society. The pressure to find and develop new and meaningful connections in a residential aged care facility can be significant for older adults. To provide a theoretical explanation of how older adults seek and maintain connections in a residential aged care facility. A grounded theory study was conducted. A total of 17 residents were recruited from two Nepalese residential aged care facilities using theoretical sampling. Face to face in-depth, semi-structured interviews and observation within interviews were conducted. Data analysis included the process of open, axial, selective coding, and constant comparative analysis as per Corbin and Strauss' variant of grounded theory. This study identified that the process of seeking connections in a residential aged care facility was forward-moving, and involved \"identifying sources,\" \"developing connections,\" and \"appraising responses.\" By seeking connections, residents built new connections. Similarly, the study found that maintaining connections was a continuous process of \"sustaining connections with co-residents,\" \"preserving connections with nurses\/caregivers,\" and \"continuing connections with inner-self and higher being\/s.\" Maintaining connections led residents to balance shifting connections. Furthermore, it was found that the process of seeking and maintaining connections was conditional on facility arrangement i.e. the way residents were placed, rules, regulations, co-residents' language, gender, religious affiliation, attitudes, the attitudes and practices of nurses\/caregivers, decreasing physical abilities of residents, increasing illness of residents, illness or death of co-residents, and retirement or resignation of nurses\/caregivers. The current study provides unique insights into the process of seeking and maintaining connections in a residential aged care facility. Facility arrangement, rules, regulations, and caregiving practices should resonate with residents' socio-cultural expectations and spiritual belief system to support their process of seeking and maintaining connections. The findings can be beneficial for managers, nurses, caregivers, and spiritual advisors in developing interventions that promote the development of meaningful connections in a residential aged care facility.

However, communication breakdowns can occur that can impact care and outcomes. The aim of this paper is to describe a feedback approach to developing a communication tool for residents and families to guide information sharing during care discussions with the healthcare team in long-term care. Development of the communication tool included consultation with key stakeholders for their feedback and input. Following initial development of the tool template by our research team, we invited feedback from our study collaborators. Next, individual interviews and a focus group were conducted with family members, followed by individual interviews with selected residents from two long-term care homes in Ontario, Canada. Participants were asked to provide input and feedback on the tool's content and usability and to share ideas for improving the tool. Content analysis was used to analyse the interview data. Feedback from residents and family included suggestions to enhance the tool's content and use of plain language, and suggestions for potential application of the tool. Feedback highlighted the value of engaging residents and family members in the development of a communication tool.

The aim of this study was to identify and synthesise nursing support for older people's autonomy in residential care. An integrative review was carried out by searching the CINAHL, Philosopher's index, PubMed, SocINDEX, Scopus and Web of Science databases, supplemented by manual searches. The searches focused on peer-reviewed scientific empirical research papers published in English, without date limitations. The constant comparison method was used for the analysis. The review identified 24 papers, and these showed that older people's autonomy was based on dignity. Nurses protected older people's autonomy in eight different ways. They protected their right to make their own decisions, acted as advocates, respected their wishes, provided opportunities for autonomy, fostered independence, gave information to residents and relatives, provided individualised care practices and protected older people's safety. However, there were also barriers that needed to be overcome. Nurses used multiple, individually tailored activities to support older people's autonomy, but they also had different reasons for supporting or hindering it. Work and leadership structures are needed to ensure that older people's autonomy is driven by ethical practices. The results of this review can help nurses who provide residential care for older people to recognise the different nursing activities that can be used to support older people's autonomy and to develop strategies to apply them in different daily care situations. However, further research is needed to determine how these activities can be realised in daily care and how they cover different aspects of older people's lives in residential care.

Despite this, staff may feel this care focus is separate to their roles. Consequently, this study explores and makes visible how palliative care is understood in long term residential care facilities for older people. It focuses on how relationships with residents and families are experienced by nurses and health care assistants and how this influences the introduction and provision of palliative care to older people in long term care facilities. To develop an understanding of what palliative care means to staff caring for older people in residential care. A co-operative inquiry action research approach was used. A total of 18 healthcare assistants and 16 registered nurses in two older person long term care facilities participated in co-operative inquiry groups. Co-inquirers reflected on deaths that occurred over a 6-month period and generated narratives on their relationships in the context of palliative care. Three themes were identified to describe relationships which were immersed in an ethos of person-centred care. These were living, loving and letting go. Living rather than dying was the predominant focus of care. Loving described deep engagement with older people and families while letting go navigated the dying process. Staff in nursing homes experience deep attachments to residents when delivering palliative care and end of life care. There is a need to understand these relationships and how they impact on the understanding and integration of palliative care in older person residential care as well as acknowledging and addressing staff's grief processes to enhance resilience.

To increase service users' access to these approaches, healthcare professionals from nursing and allied health disciplines are being trained to use them. However, little is known about healthcare professionals' experiences of implementing biopsychosocial approaches in everyday practice. To explore nursing and allied healthcare professionals' views of using the \"Newcastle Model,\" which is a biopsychosocial approach to understanding behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia. Thirteen community mental healthcare professionals from nursing, social work and occupational therapy backgrounds were interviewed about their views and experiences of using the Newcastle Model to understand and work with behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Five themes were identified. The first theme reflected the perceived positive value of taking a more psychosocial approach to understanding behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia. The second theme reported participants' expressions of low confidence in using the approach, as well as their reported difficulties in prioritising it. The third theme highlighted the perceived time-consuming nature of the approach, and the adaptations that some staff made to increase its practicality. The fourth theme highlighted the importance of working in collaboration with those who provided direct care and support to the person with dementia. The final theme reflected participants' positive view of the effectiveness of the approach for delivering person-centred care CONCLUSION: Community healthcare professionals valued the integration of a biopsychosocial approach into their practice, although identified key implementation barriers. Formalising this approach within professional role descriptions; increasing collaborative working within multidisciplinary teams; and increasing carers' psychological understanding of dementia, are key ways in which this biopsychosocial approach could be implemented more effectively. ","46":"Despite older people being the largest demographic accessing health care, nurses often lack knowledge about how to work with them and may hold ageist perceptions towards them. Previous research has identified the gaps in their education program and offered suggestions on what and how to fill those gaps in education related to older people. E-learning activities to fill these gaps were developed. The aim of this study was to determine if nursing students' perceptions about older people could be improved through an e-learning activity focused on communication and understanding older people. A quasi-experimental pre-post design was used to test whether the understanding and communication with older people e-learning activity improved student nurses' perceptions about older people. A feedback survey was also analyzed using descriptive statistics to understand students' perceptions of the learning activity. There was a statistically significant decrease in participant's negative perceptions towards older people after completing the e-learning activity. Participants enjoyed the activity and believed that it improved their knowledge of older people, their confidence in working with older people, and their perceptions about older people. The strength of the e-learning activity in this study is that the educator need not be an expert in order to use the activity in their course. In this way, knowledge about older people is facilitated despite the dearth of nurse educators with gerontological expertise. More research to test this activity in other universities is needed. Improved understanding and communicating with older people could improve person-centered-care. The flexible delivery of this learning activity could facilitate practicing nurses understanding and communication strategies if offered to them.

A large number of registered nurses work in these settings; however, many challenges exist in their recruitment and retention. To explore professional identities and emerging discourses of registered nurses working in older person residential care settings. This study employed a discursive-based research methodology with a central focus on the role language, and discourses play in identity construction. Fourteen in-depth narrative interviews were completed with registered nurses in residential care settings in the Republic of Ireland. Thematic analysis was underpinned by a critical discursive psychology framework. Four key identities and related discourses emerged: 'skilled professional identity', 'person-centred identity', 'subordinate identity' and 'product of healthcare reform identity'. Discourses presented contrasting professional identities held by nurses in residential care settings; on the one hand, they employed positive professional and person-centred discourses, while on the other hand, tensions associated with healthcare reform and a subordinate identity exist. This study presents unique insights into how registered nurses in residential care construct their professional identity and in doing so, enhances opportunities to promote recruitment and marketing in this setting. Equally, the challenges and opportunities of healthcare reform require sensitive management so that the professional identity of nurses working in residential care is enhanced and protected. How registered nurses working in residential care settings view their professional identity directly impacts on attitudes and behaviours and the subsequent delivery of care. Greater understanding and insight into how they construct their professional identity may enhance recruitment and retention initiatives. Study results also provide an opportunity for policymakers and service providers to create more positive working environments that promote professional identity development for this nursing group. ","52":"The study describes experiences of registered nurses and general practitioners when using the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) to assess acute functional decline in older home nursing care patients. Acute functional decline is common among older home nursing care patients; typically characterised by nonspecific symptoms and a mix of manifestations. Early warning score systems for detecting clinical deterioration have been thoroughly evaluated in hospital settings, but few studies have evaluated these systems used with older people in a community care setting. A descriptive exploratory research design and a qualitative approach. 36 nurses and eight general practitioners were purposively sampled. Data were collected in seven mixed focus groups and analysed using an inductive thematic content analysis in an iterative process that moved between text, codes, categories and themes. The COREQ checklist was used. Two main themes were developed in the analysis. The first theme derived, was that the MEWS along with medical-technical equipment and clinical judgement, was used to support nurses' and general practitioners' clinical decisions in assessing older deteriorating patients. The second theme referred to nurses' and general practitioners' experiences with several adjustments when using the MEWS with the older patient group and in complying with its trigger recommendations. The use of the MEWS when assessing older patients in home nursing care is potentially useful in supporting clinical reasoning. However, the tool's usefulness is limited because it is not experienced as sufficiently adapted to neither the home nursing care services nor to older patients. This study increases our knowledge of how the MEWS tool is used in a community care setting and highlights the importance of adjustment of assessment procedures for older persons with acute functional decline. ","53":"Previous research suggests that person-centred care is positive for people living in nursing homes, but less is known on what motivates people working in nursing homes to be person-centred. Previous research has focused on person-centred care in relation to people in need of care, which may lead to a risk of viewing person-centred care as a means to achieve quality of care, and not as a means in itself. Therefore, this study aimed to illuminate meanings of being person-centred as narrated by people working in nursing homes. A total of 23 persons working in a nursing home in rural Australia participated in group and individual interviews, conducted and interpreted in respect to a phenomenological hermeneutic approach. The thematic structure as emerging from structural analyses of the text indicated that being person-centred involved a joint effort to think differently on what you do and why you do it interpreted as; Doing what you know and feel is the right thing to do, Being a person with and for another person, and Striving to do and be better together. The comprehensive understanding of these findings was that being person-centred means becoming part of an upwards spiral of doing person-centred actions and being person-centred to become even more person-centred and to feel a sense of belonging to a person-centred culture. Denoting the importance of being more of a person in one's professional role, this study highlights health aspects of being person-centred from the perspective of people working in nursing homes, and complements previous research that describes the impact of person-centred care on people in need of care. The findings could be applied to facilitate person-centred care in nursing home contexts, and to develop prevention strategies to diminish negative impacts on person-centred doing, being, becoming and belonging.

This study aimed to investigate whether components of successful ageing (i.e., diseases and complications, functions and engagement with life) differ according to hospitalisation experience in community-dwelling older adults. A secondary data analysis with the Korean national survey was performed. Using propensity score matching, 1812 older adults with hospitalisation experience were matched to 1812 older adults without hospitalisation experience. Sampling weight of the survey was considered for all statistical analyses. The hospitalisation experienced group had more chronic illnesses, malnourishment, impairment in physical function, and depressive symptoms, and less activity in terms of working and social activities. There were no differences in cognitive function or religious activities. Older adults with hospitalisation experience were less likely to experience successful ageing. To facilitate successful ageing of community-dwelling older adults with hospitalisation experience, nursing interventions for effective transitional care to encourage the use of community resources and participation in social activities are needed. ","56":"The common practice of making fun of aging and older people demonstrates that ageism towards older people is socially acceptable. It is so accepted that even those of us who are aging or have moved into the 'third act' believe and fear the negative stereotypes that growing old is linked with physical and mental deterioration, dependence, and less social value. Ageism is evident in work places, family relationships, when older people purchase goods and services, in health and social institutions and extends throughout professions that work with older people. We explore how nurses-the largest group of healthcare professions- may be inadvertently perpetuating negative perceptions about older people in nursing practice, nursing education, and through common misconceptions about what gerontological nursing means. This is discussion paper using the literature. We suggest that nursing education is well situated to diminish negative perspectives of ageing by incorporating theories of life-course and harmonious aging into the holistic perspective of individuals that nursing is well known for. Greater understanding about the diversity of ageing and the context that have influenced older persons could encourage nurses to treat them holistically with dignity, which would ultimately improve older people's experiences. Improving older persons' experiences is like paying it forward, as we all are ageing and if we are to have a different experience when we are old, it is necessary to diminish stereotypes about ageing, and work towards inclusion of older people in social and healthcare institutions. It is important for nurses, particularly those in nursing education, to support the incorporation of a life course and harmonious view of aging in which the social, political, and environmental context of individuals are viewed as part of the difference of ageing. ","57":"Due to the rapid ageing of the population, there is increasing demand for long-term care in the people's home environment. Such care aims to allow the people to stay at home and avoid hospitalisation or other institutional care. In home health care, care must be provided at the highest possible quality, with the focus on the people's needs and experiences. This study explores the experiences and needs of frail older people receiving home health care. An exploratory descriptive qualitative approach was chosen. Audio-taped semi-structured interviews were conducted with fifteen older people receiving home health care. A content analysis was used to analyse the data collected. The content analysis identified one main theme, three categories and seven subcategories related to frail older people's needs and experiences of home health care. The main theme was quality of care. The first category, Safe and Secure Care, consisted of three subcategories: Education and Experience of Nurses, Information, and Continuity of Care in terms of personnel continuity and regular care. The second category, Autonomy, contained two subcategories: Decision-making and Self-sufficiency. The last category, Relationship with Professionals, consisted of two subcategories: Personality of Nurse and Partnerships. Older people are able to express their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with home health care. The results of this study revealed that the quality of care is crucial for frail older people. The provision of home health care is inherently highly specific; home care nurses should work to provide the highest possible quality of care. In particular, nurses should focus on ensuring that the care they provide is safe, effective, timely, efficient and person-centred.

However, anecdotal evidence suggests that the concept of ACP and ADs is not widely known to the public and healthcare professionals. To examine and synthesise currently available research about ACP and ADs for older people in mainland China, and to discuss implications for future nursing practice and research. An integrative literature review. A systematic search was conducted in seven English electronic databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE, ProQuest, Cochrane, JBI, Scopus and Wiley) and four Chinese electronic databases (CNKI, Wanfang, VIP and CBM). Eligible articles were critically appraised using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). From various groups including older people, families and healthcare professionals, low levels of knowledge and awareness about ACP and ADs are reported. Demographic characteristics such as age, gender, education and clinical conditions were related to positive or negative attitude towards ACP. The main reason people cited for being 'reluctant\/fairly reluctant' to make an AD was that they were 'Not familiar with it'. Given that older people showed positive attitudes towards ACP, policy support and practice guidelines about ADs and ACP are necessary to respect their wishes and to guide healthcare professionals in mainland China. ","67":"The increasing numbers of older people (age 65+) make it important to understand how to attract nurses to work with this population. A secondary analysis using qualitative descriptive methods was used to understand how student nurses' perceptions about older people may influence their desire to work with older people. Student nurses perceive a generational divide between them and older people, regardless of practice settings. They believe working with older people is heavy work, and not high acuity, and although good to learn skills as a student, not a population they want to work with until they are close to retirement themselves. It is important to enhance nursing education so that students understand the older generation, how to communicate with them and the prevalence of older people in healthcare settings, so that they are more likely to choose to work with older people.

A cognitive assessment in primary care is offered to persons with suspected dementia with subsequent referral to a specialist clinic if required. The assessment process, with the likelihood of receiving a dementia diagnosis, is surrounded by uncertainty with long waiting times. Although NPS are common among persons with cognitive impairment persons are not routinely asked about these symptoms during a cognitive assessment. Interviews were held with 18 participants who had completed a cognitive assessment. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory [NPI] was incorporated into one of the interview questions enabling participants to self-report NPS, if present. Interview data were analysed using Interpretive Description. Two main themes were identified: a matter of trust and making sense of a cognitive diagnosis. Experiences of the assessment process ranged from feeling valued to abandoned with variations of trust in the process. A diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment was experienced as an abstract diagnosis devoid of follow-up support. A lack of preparedness for the assessment existed among participants. Some experienced the process as standardised. One half of participants self-reported the presence of one to four NPS, regardless of neurocognitive diagnosis. Irritability and depression were most common NPS identified. Experiences of a cognitive assessment varied from feeling valued by society to abandoned in the absence of follow-up support. The assessment was viewed as a standardised procedure failing to see the person behind the testing. Diagnosis disclosure conversations were experienced as diffuse with participants unprepared for a dementia diagnosis. The NPI enabled participants to identify and report the presence of NPS which otherwise could go undetected during the cognitive assessment, impacting on the person's well-being and daily life.

A survey instrument was developed to investigate nursing home staff experiences in using call light technology. A survey instrument was developed and distributed to staff in two nursing facilities in Up-State, New York (N = 278). The strength and direction of relationships between pairs of variables were measured using Pearson correlation and analysis of variance to investigate the perceived effect of staff's perception of the call light system on the work system's elements, process and staff outcomes. The study found correlations between the job-level workload and the noise in the unit (r = 0.272, p = .000), between job-level workload and the ease of locating call lights (r = 0.154, p = .023), and between job stress and burnout (r = 0.176, p = .009). Only 64% of nursing home staff believed that the call light system reflected urgent needs, with younger staff relating to this group. The staff gave the work environment a high score, which corresponds to excessive noises caused by the call light alarm, according to 74% of the staff. These associations stem from gaps caused by a lack of user feedback in the design and acquisition process, leading to usability issues that reduce performance and satisfaction over time. The study found that the type of call light system used is associated with usability challenges that often impeded the performance of the nursing home staff's response to residents. These insights can improve the selection of a new call light system that avoids usability issues and challenges identified by end-users. ","74":"Advance care planning (ACP) is critical to ensure better quality end of life care, and older adults are often a target of ACP. However, ACP interventions and their outcomes are neither standardised nor conclusive. To synthesise existing ACP systematic reviews and identify the types and outcomes of ACP interventions for older adults in community-based settings. An umbrella review of systematic reviews. The Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewer's Manual was followed. Relevant systematic reviews were searched by utilising bibliographic databases, grey literature sources, and manual searches between April and July, 2019. Nine systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria. Critical appraisal on the selected reviews was conducted. Data were independently extracted using a data extraction tool by two researchers and synthesised based on consensus. The systematic reviews suggest the critical features of ACP interventions for older adults in community-based settings including clinicians' face-to-face communication with patients and their family members, comprehensive and individualized decisional aids, a proper intensity of ACP interventions, and professional training. When categorising ACP outcomes according to Sudore et al.'s (Journal of Pain and Symptom Management, 55, 2018, 245) framework, action outcomes (e.g., documentation, discussion) were frequently measured with positive outcomes. Quality of care outcomes such as congruence with care preference and healthcare outcomes such as health status were not reported sufficiently. The reviews suggested essential features of ACP interventions, which were often omitted in ACP interventions for older adults. Although the outcomes were generally positive, it is inconclusive as to whether ACP interventions eventually improved quality of end of life care or health status of older adults in community-based settings. For ACP interventions to be effective and comparable in their outcomes, we recommend adopting the key intervention components identified in this study. As the effects of ACP interventions are inconclusive, further investigations are warranted.

Staff working in these environments often help residents (particularly those with more advanced dementia) with their personal care needs, including maintaining mouth care and health. Poor oral health is associated with many difficulties, including increased risk of respiratory problems, pain and discomfort. Yet, concerns have been raised that staff may not have the knowledge and skills to effectively support residents with oral care and health. There is therefore an important gap between what is known about the importance of maintaining oral health (scientific evidence) and daily practice in long-term care environments. To work with care home staff: (1) to create a learning culture to address how to promote mouth care for residents, particularly when a resident resists support with this aspect of care; and (2) to effect mouth care practice changes (if required) using participatory and inclusive research cycles. We conducted a participatory research project to address this important area of care. Four participatory research 'cycles' were conducted. Cycle one explored existing literature to develop accessible guidance on strategies that staff could use to support residents to maintain and improve oral care, particularly when a resident may resist such care. Cycle two built on this review to determine knowledge levels within the care team. This highlighted deficiencies in staff knowledge, skills and competence for providing mouth care and their need for training to address this. Cycle three identified evidence-based strategies to develop staff understanding and knowledge. Cycle four brought together experts from nursing, dentistry, behaviour change, systematic reviews and care homes research to develop a grant application to progress this work further. This paper provides an example of the processes undertaken in a participatory research project, bringing together science and practice to improve an essential area of care. Using participatory research approaches in this setting can allow the effective translation of uncertainties in care and practice into questions that can be addressed by research, leading to meaningful outcomes for those living and working in care homes.

The culturally safe dementia care (CSDC) research team, composed of researchers, decision makers and Secwepemc Elders, was formed to address this. To increase the capacity of nurses to care for First Nations Elders with memory loss in a culturally safe way. Our community-based research used purposive sampling and mixed methods to create, implement and evaluate an education programme for nurses. Thirty-four Elders from six Secwepemc communities participated in roundtables to share views and stories of dementia and nursing care. These data were used to create four teaching stories for the storytelling sessions and talking circles with Elders which, together with the Indigenous Cultural Competency (ICC) training, comprised the CSDC education programme. Thirty-eight nurses (healthcare aides, licensed practical nurses and registered nurses) working in Central British Columbia began the CSDC study and 15 nurses took part in the education programme, evaluated the storytelling session and completed the three pre- and post-measures (Approaches to Dementia Questionnaire (ADQ), ICC knowledge quiz and self-assessment, and Care Plans). The pre- and post-tests were scored, and the data were analysed statistically. The data from the roundtables and talking circles were analysed thematically through a collaborative process. The scores for the ADQ Hope sub-scale, the ICC knowledge quiz and the Care Plans increased from pre- to post-test. All nurse participants judged the storytelling session to be effective and their learning outcomes reflected culturally safe dementia care.

This study aimed to create a conceptual framework depicting the types of meaning that are seen as stemming from occupation. Six electronic databases were searched (CINAHL, PubMed Central, PsycINFO, Embase, AMED, ASSIA) using a pre-specified search strategy to identify qualitative studies relating to meaningful occupation for people living with dementia. From 114 eligible full-text articles, six qualitative studies were identified as sufficiently rich, topically relevant and explicit in their definition of meaningful activity. A further 14 were purposefully sampled for their ability to refute or advance the emerging conceptual framework. The synthesis is based on meta-ethnography and is reported following eMERGe guidance. We found the fundamental purpose of occupation is to support the person living with dementia to feel they are living a meaningful and fulfilling life. Three overlapping concepts were identified: (i) catalytic environment, (ii) meaningful life and (iii) occupation as a tool. The framework proposes how occupation could support meaning in multiple ways and considers how these forms of meaning were influenced by the worldviews and values of the individual, and context in which they were experienced. The conceptual framework offers a consistent theoretical grounding with which to measure effectiveness of meaningful occupation for people living with dementia.

The importance of providing a well-designed physical environment for older people is supported by the research literature. There is limited research of the physical environments of long-term care settings from the perspective of nursing science and nor is there much research into the instruments for assessing them. A descriptive, correlational and observational study. Forward and back translation process was used followed by structured observations with S-SCEAM-Fin in 20 long-term care units in intensive residential care facilities for older people with 24-h nursing assistance and with extensive support for daily activities. Spearman's rho correlation, Cohen's kappa, percentage of agreement and Kuder-Richardson formula coefficients were calculated to assess psychometric properties of the translated S-SCEAM-Fin. S-SCEAM-Fin standardised scores were calculated to describe the current status of the environmental quality. Inter-scale (domain) correlations showed low to moderate correlations between the domains. Consistency was acceptable in four of the domains. Cohen's kappa values indicated good (0.796 and 0.648) intra-rater and inter-rater (0.910 and 0.553) reliability. The overall mean of the standardised scores was 57.00, but there was variation between domains. Small units received the highest scores in the six domains. S-SCEAM-Fin was useful in assessing environmental quality. Assessment of the environmental quality disclosed deficiencies in ensuring settings adequate for older people. The increasing numbers of older people with health conditions are residing in long-term care settings. It is essential to create supportive physical environments. The instrument can be useful when planning new facilities or proposing new recommendations for institutional living environments.

Previous studies have mainly focussed on foot problems in the adult population whilst the evidence of foot health in the older population is scarce. The aim of the study was to analyse self-assessed foot health and associated factors in older people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The study applied a descriptive cross-sectional survey design and recruited older people with RA from the member register of one patient association. We collected the data in January 2019 with the Self-administered Foot Health Assessment Instrument, and sociodemographic and foot-related background questions and analysed the data with descriptive and inferential statistics. Older people with RA had many self-reported foot problems. The most common problems were foot pain, dry skin and thickened toenails. In addition, structural deformities of the foot were prevalent. The level of foot health associated with the amount of daily walking or standing, and using walking or running shoes outdoors. Individuals who had consulted a physician due to their foot problems had more structural deformities in the foot. Foot problems limited their ability to perform daily activities. This study demonstrates that older people with RA not only live with a long-term health condition, but they also live with complex foot problems. Older people with RA need healthcare services due to their foot problems. There is a need to develop and implement care practices to alleviate foot pain and support and promote foot health and functional ability in older people with RA. Understanding the nature and consequences of foot problems in older people with RA allows healthcare professionals to perform more accurate clinical foot evaluations and develop effective interventions to prevent further foot problems. ","87":"To explore nurses' experiences of caring for persons with dementia experiencing responsive behaviours in an acute hospital. Caring for persons with dementia who have an acute medical illness and are experiencing responsive behaviours in acute hospitals can be challenging for nurses. While existing research has explored the experiences of nurses in providing dementia care in this setting, there is limited knowledge about the specific care experiences of nurses when working to meet the needs of persons with dementia who experience responsive behaviours alongside an admitting diagnosis. A qualitative descriptive design was implemented. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with nine nurses working in medical and surgical wards. A thematic analysis approach was used to analyse the data. Ethical approval to conduct the study was received from the writers' university. Three themes were found: (a) challenges encountered, (b) a person-centred response and (c) dementia preparedness. Key findings about challenges encountered by nurses included: the acute hospital environment; increased need for enhanced knowledge; and emotional challenges. Person-centred responses such as working in partnership with others and reminiscence were identified as strategies to address the challenges. Finally, nurses identified particular interventions that were supportive to them in enhancing their preparedness to meet the needs of persons with dementia who experience responsive behaviours. Persons with dementia who are acutely unwell and are experiencing responsive behaviours, within acute hospitals, have specific and individualised care needs. Nurses working in these settings must therefore be supported in developing competence in managing these frequently complex clinical cases, while also providing person-centred care. Nurses' narratives demonstrate that they continue to experience challenges in the presence of responsive behaviours. There is a consequent need for dementia-specific education on person-centred ways to address responsive behaviours within acute hospital settings.

Shared decision-making has been an important patient-centred approach to nursing care since the 1990s, yet it is becoming increasingly evident that it is still not the reality in aged care facilities fifty years on. Currently, it is not well understood how adult children participate in shared decision-making and the types of decisions they are required to make. A review of original research papers using Kable, Pich and Maslin-Prothero 12-step systematic approach to documenting a search strategy. The researcher screened 597 articles from four databases, published in the English language, during the period 1985-2019. The researcher used the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool version 2011 to determine the methodological quality of the included studies. The Joanna Briggs Institute QARI data tool was used to appraise the seven selected articles and thematically analyse findings, respectively. Four themes were highlighted: communication; staffing; being involved; and staff-family relationships. Despite these themes being apparent, families have limited opportunities to participate in shared health decision-making in regard to their parents' care. The findings from this literature show how shared decision-making is affected by the RACF environment. There is a need to find out and understand what is important from a family member's point of view to optimise shared decision-making and nursing care of the family member in residential aged care settings. The limited findings specific to the SDM experiences of adult children of parents in RACFs in this review could help staff and RACFs to develop strategies and staff training to encourage and facilitate the implementation of shared health decision-making with staff and families on older people's care.

The aim was to explore and describe the staff learning process from the first to the second year when adopting person-centred care into clinical practice in a nursing home for persons with dementia. The data consisted of poster texts from staff and written notes by researchers obtained from the group discussions. The study involved 24 care units (200 staff). Content analysis was chosen as method to explore the learning process. The staff described the actions that they took during year 1 and year 2, in which five categories emerged, activities, environment, information, priorities and staff routines. With researchers' analysis the categories together created the learning process and formed a sub-theme. They further formed an overarching theme from simplicity to complexity and consensus. Staff changes year 1 pertained more to planning and doing, while year 2 changes constituted a larger complexity of person-centred care with reflection, collaborative learning and a mind-set change. Staff chose the development area, and the learning process was illuminated by the researchers. This underscores the value to visualise and verbalise the steps of change as well as include these steps in the design of an implementation process. The concept of person-centred care could be viewed on different levels. The findings may contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of staff learning process when implementation of person-centred care. Making staff's learning process visible can be a guide for improvement and change from a generic care towards person-centred care.

This study examined the impact of two implementation strategies, that is external facilitation (EF) and educational outreach visits (EOVs), on the organisational context and individual factors when implementing nutritional guidelines in a nursing home (NH) setting. The EF strategy was a one-year, multifaceted (including support, guidance, a practice audit and feedback) intervention given to four NH units. The EOV strategy was a three-hour lecture about the nutritional guidelines given to four other NH units. Both strategies were directed at selected NH teams, consisting of a unit manager, a nurse and 5-10 care staff. A questionnaire was distributed, before and after the interventions, to evaluate the prerequisites for the staff to use the guidelines. Three conditions were used to examine the organisational context and the individual factors: the staff's ability and willingness to implement the nutritional guidelines and their understanding of them. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation models were used for the data analysis. The results indicated that on average, there was a significant increase in the staff's ability to implement the nutritional guidelines in the EF group. The staff exposed to the EF strategy experienced better resources to implement the guidelines in terms of time, tools and support from leadership and a clearer assignment of responsibility regarding nutrition procedures. There was no change in staff's willingness and understanding of the guidelines in the EF group. On average, no significant changes were observed for the staff's ability, willingness or understanding in the EOV group. A long-term, active and flexible implementation strategy (i.e. EF) affected the care staff's ability to implement the nutritional guidelines in an NH setting.

Due to its magnitude and impact on global health, this health crisis exposes several shortcomings in their health systems and emphasizes their shortcomings and deficiencies. These deficiencies have quickly affected the most frail citizens, such as older people.

The nature, speed and extent gave rise to an accelerated and more extensive collaboration between various nursing homes and Ghent University Hospital. Before this crisis, the level of integrated care between nursing homes and hospitals was mostly limited. But setting up a strong collaboration model and integrated care between nursing homes and hospitals enables the nursing homes to manage this specific and complex care in their own environment. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This case study shows that integrated care is possible and that both the hospital and the nursing homes benefit from such a system.

Whilst disparities in the evidence base persist, specialist high-intensity, team-based hospital-at-home services were significantly more likely to reduce hospital admissions than standard care. An individual case management services that incorporated self-help education for chronic disease management also reduced hospital admissions. Financial data suggest that whilst high-intensity services are costly, they can lead to significant efficiency savings in the longer-term. This topic remains an important area for further investment, managerial support and research because of the risks faced by older people when admitted to hospital, for whom health, quality of life and independence are vital considerations.

The perceptions of nurses who have recently graduated from a nursing programme can provide insights into what they wished they knew about working with older people before they graduated. A qualitative descriptive study design examined recently graduated registered nurses' reflections on their education preparation to work with older people. Content and thematic analysis was used to develop the themes of first impressions and preparation to work with older people. Key findings were that nurses did not recognise the importance of learning about older people until they had graduated. Only then did they realise that the ageing population was so complex and prevalent. They perceived a lack of education particularly related to working with older people with dementia and their behaviours, as well as learning how to communicate to an older population. Participants perceived that as students, it was up to them to fit in learning about working with older people without the support of faculty. Faculty need to be supported in learning how to best incorporate content about older people into their curriculum. This could include the development of learning activities that dispel negative stereotypes about ageing and facilitates interest in older people, as this is the population, students are most likely to work with when they graduate.

This is the first Asian study conducted on enrolled nurses' perceptions of nutritional care. To explore enrolled nurses' perceptions of providing nutritional care to hospitalised older people in Singapore's acute care setting. This is a qualitative descriptive study. Individual face-to-face semi-structured interviews using an interview guide were conducted with 15 enrolled nurses from September 2017 to January 2018. The collected data were analysed using content analysis.

This study provided insights to the perceived roles of enrolled nurses in nutritional care. It also outlined the enablers and challenges faced by the enrolled nurses and their suggestions to improve nutritional care provision. One critical finding was the need to better engage families and domestic helpers in nutritional care of older people.

Internationally shared guidelines for daily oral care are needed to complement the optimised oral health section of the interRAI suite of instruments. The modified Delphi approach started with the preparation of an initial draft. Subsequently, an online survey and a face-to-face discussion were conducted with international experts.

CA is considered by many to be essential to person-centred care. This paper explores how staff assignment practices impact the caregiving experience from the perspectives of resident care aides (RCAs), residents and family members and, by doing so, describe the nuanced conditions under which CA may or may not be beneficial to all, and why. Data are drawn from 40 in-depth interviews conducted as part of a larger institutional ethnography exploring the social organisation of care in three purposively selected LTC homes in Western Canada. Data analysis was based on the principles of constant comparison. RCAs, residents and family members described the primary benefit of CA as being able to 'get to know' each other well and form meaningful relationships. However, the RCAs also indicated that CA can contribute to feelings of isolation, which has negative effects on worker comfort and satisfaction, care team dynamics and communication, and resident care. Management initiatives are needed to ensure that the implementation of CA does not result in the unintended consequences of decreasing RCAs' experience of teamwork, decreasing RCAs' exchange of individualised resident care information, or negatively impacting RCAs' ability and desire to care for each other as well as the residents. The staffing practice of consistent assignment in long-term care homes provides increased opportunities for the development of stronger staff-resident and staff-family member relationships. Findings from this study enable us to offer several, evidenced-based recommendations for ensuring the successful implementation of consistent assignment, such that it may be beneficial to all. ","118":null,"119":"To explore staff perceptions of the impact of weekly music and movement sessions involving older patients and staff on the wards where 'Dance for Health' sessions take place. Dance for Health is a programme of weekly group dance sessions, which take place on wards in an acute hospital setting. Recent research demonstrates the value of creative arts activities in clinical settings across the globe. However, there is little research exploring the impact of dance programmes for frail older people in acute hospital settings, or healthcare professionals' perceptions of the impact of these sessions on patients, staff and the ward environment. A qualitative descriptive approach was used. Twenty-one semi-structured interviews were conducted with staff who had supported patients participating in Dance for Health and the ward managers where the sessions took place. Data analysis was undertaken using a thematic analysis approach. The sessions challenged staff assumptions about older patients' musical preferences and the level of physical activity patients were able to undertake. Staff felt that the shared experience and interactions within the group enhanced staff-patient relationships. Staff taking part in the sessions reported feeling pleasure seeing their patients enjoying themselves and valued being a part of delivering the sessions. The Dance for Health programme in an acute hospital setting has the potential to promote person-centred care through encouraging self-expression and individuality. It is a meaningful and enjoyable activity, which encourages physical activity and social interaction and enriches the aesthetic experience of the hospital environment. This is the first study reporting on the use of dance sessions for older people in an acute hospital setting. Dance for Health had a positive impact on staff attending the sessions and enhanced staff-patient relationships. Staff support is key for effective delivery. ","120":"Given the increase in the number of deaths within long-term care facilities (LTCFs), the need for palliative and end-of-life (EOL) care education among such facilities has been increasing. As such, a systematic synthesis of global palliative and EOL care educational approaches and evaluation can aid further educational development. To synthesise the current literature on palliative and EOL care educational interventions for staff working in LTCFs and identify barriers to, and facilitators of, intervention implementation. The study used an integrative review framework wherein indexed databases, namely, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Japan Medical Abstract Society, were systematically searched for studies published in English and Japanese between 2007 and 2019. Search terms that are related to palliative care, LTCF, and education were combined to increase search sensitivity. The quality of the papers was assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools and the Mixed-Methods Appraisal Tool. A total of 52 studies were included in the review. Our results suggested that although studies in this area and setting have been evolving, suboptimal developmental research and educational practices, global variability and unstandardised approaches to education and lacking viewpoints from service users have remained. Barriers to intervention implementation were also reported due to the specific characteristics of LTCFs, which include high staff turnover and considerable variation in professional skills and experience. Given the different LTCF types, systems and policies across each country or region, further research on standardised educational interventions with contextual considerations using large-scale studies with robust methodology is needed to meet the increasing demand for palliative and EOL care among the global ageing population. Palliative and EOL care educational intervention for LTCF staff need to include more consideration of context, organisational culture and the user involvement throughout the process of education and research to enhance the quality of care in this complex setting. ","121":null,"122":null,"123":"As many as one-quarter of all residents in nursing facilities have cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) as a documented choice in the medical record, despite the likelihood of limited medical benefit in this setting. The aim of this study was to understand the perspectives of healthcare providers and nursing facility residents regarding CPR decisions. We used qualitative interviews to examine the perspectives of residents with a documented decision for CPR in the medical record. We then compared residents' views with those of healthcare providers who routinely conduct advance care planning (ACP) conversations in the nursing facility setting. Five themes emerged from the interviews: (a) Resident versus Provider Concerns, (b) Offering Information versus Avoidance, (c) Lack of Understanding of CPR, (d) Lack of Awareness, and (e) 'Don't Keep Me on Machines'. Residents held misconceptions about CPR and\/or exhibited an overall poor understanding of the relationship between their own health status and the likelihood of a successful CPR attempt. Although healthcare providers offer information and health education in an attempt to address knowledge gaps, these efforts are not always successful or even accepted by residents. Resident viewpoints and priorities differed from healthcare providers in ways that affected communication about CPR. Unrecognised differences in perceptions between providers and residents affect key aspects of ACP communication that can impact CPR decision-making. The concerns and priorities of institutionalized older adults may differ from those of healthcare providers, creating challenges for engaging some residents in ACP. ACP communication models and training should be designed not only to explore nursing facility residents' goals, values, and preferences, but also to elicit any underlying differences in perceptions that may affect communication. Healthcare providers can identifying the primary concerns of residents and assist them with integrating or reframing these issues as a part of ACP discussions. ","124":"More older couples are living independently while managing chronic health conditions. Though research is replete in identifying the influence of spouse's behaviours on each other's health, there is little known of the specific factors underlying the older couples' relational processes to explain this dynamic. Knowledge development is needed to provide a grounding for interventions to address such influences to improve health and well-being. The aim of this study was to advance the understanding of older couples' experiences of living with chronic health conditions to gain insights into the potential benefits of 'being a couple' to manage behavioural health and life adjustments. A hermeneutic-dialectic phenomenology design based on Newman's theory of Health as Expanding Consciousness was used. Fourteen older couples were jointly interviewed. The interviews were non-structured and designed to capture their experience as a couple. Three themes emerged (a) living meaningfully through mutual caregiving, (b) a pattern of spousal movement facilitating change and (c) co-creating as an older couple to move forward. The study supports reframing older couple's care as a 'dyad of care'. This approach provides an opportunity to leverage the couples' mutuality to support health management as a couple. A motivation to action process between the spouses appeared to enable mutual caregiving, a reliance of each spouse on the another for identity, socialisation, health and daily living, which facilitated an evolving understanding of their lives and its meaning. Mutual caregiving should be acknowledged as a significant relational dynamic within older couples, as a dyad of care, when managing health and well-being. ","125":"Rising numbers of older people with obesity living in care homes is an international phenomenon. Addressing dietary management of residents with obesity is a cause of debate and controversy. On one hand, the 'obesity paradox' suggests obesity protects against morbidity in frail older people. On the other hand, obesity reduces functional status and restricts activity for this group. This paper considers care home staff's experience and views of supporting dietary management and choice for residents with obesity within the context of this controversy. In this qualitative study, 33 staff from seven care homes in the North East England participated in focus groups, and data were analysed using Braun and Clarkes's (2006) six-phase thematic analysis approach. Findings indicate that participants' support of dietary management and choice for residents with obesity may be strongly influenced by the care home environment. Care priorities, dietary management approaches, care home life and family involvement in residents' dietary intake facilitate and encourage weight gain, and as such, pose challenges for staff attempting to support weight management of residents with obesity. Findings suggest that in the care home setting, nutrition policy, guidelines and service commissioning processes and staff nutrition education should include management of obesity. Furthermore, families should be supported to understand the implications of their own caring behaviours on residents' nutritional status. ","126":"Given that most dementia care is provided at home by family caregivers, caregivers' health and outdoor activities may influence persons with dementia (PWDs)' mobility. At the same time, PWDs' functional deterioration and mobility changes might affect mobility behaviours in their caregivers. The aims of this pilot study were to examine the relationship of PWD's life-space mobility (LSM) with their caregiver's LSM and to investigate the role of caregiver and PWD characteristics in determining the level of LSM in both PWDs and caregivers. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 26 caregivers providing dementia care at home. Caregivers were used as proxy for assessing sociodemographic, clinical and physical function in PWDs. Caregivers' sociodemographic characteristics, LSM, social support, depressive symptoms, caregiving burden and preparedness for caregiving were measured. The level of LSM in caregivers was correlated with the PWD's LSM level. Caregivers who perceived high levels of social support and readiness for caregiving tended to report high levels of LSM. PWDs' age and independence in instrumental activities of daily living were correlated with caregivers' LSM. The study findings suggest that the caregiver's LSM influenced and was affected by the PWD's LSM. This underscores the need for additional research that examines the role of caregivers' psychosocial and physical health on PWDs' mobility and the context of dementia care and its influences on how dementia care dyads decide and participate in mobility behaviours. The findings of this pilot study will be helpful in identifying a target for interventions designed to delay the onset of mobility disability and maintain and improve social participation in PWDs. To minimise the effects of mobility limitations in PWDs, it is critical to examine their mobility issues from multilevel perspectives, including their caregiver's LSM levels and characteristics that have implications for both research and clinical practice. ","127":"The aim of this integrative review was to identify nurses' perspectives of their role in influencing the functional status of hospitalised older people. An integrative review using Whittemore and Knafls' method was conducted using EBSCOhost CINAHL, Ovid MEDLINE(R), EBSCOhost, Social Gerontology, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses data bases. Only studies with nurses' perspectives, or beliefs about their role in function-focused care were included. Content analysis was used to develop the themes nurses' role in function-focused care and barriers to functional care. The review found 12 relevant articles. Nurses believed that they were responsible for function-focused care, yet functional care tasks were often missed. Organisational contexts created many barriers to providing function-focused care for patients. Nurses felt powerless to address these overarching problems in their organisations. Nurses understand the importance of functional care yet often fail to carry out functional care interventions. Lack of organisational support creates a workplace that is short on staff, time and equipment and does not prioritise functional care needs. Nurse leaders and healthcare organisations need to reprioritise function-focused care for the good of patients, families and healthcare budgets. ","128":"This study aimed to investigate the psychometric properties of the Carers' Fall Concern Instrument (CFC-I) for measuring carers' concern for older people (care recipients) at risk of falling. Family carers are crucial in preventing older people from falling at home. Their concerns for older people at risk of falling have severe implications on carers' psychological well-being and ability to prevent falls. However, there is no validated instrument measuring this concern. A cross-sectional study was used to examine the validity and reliability of the CFC-I. Carers looking after older people living at home completed the 17-item CFC-I and provided information about their care arrangements and the older people's fall history. Construct validity was tested using exploratory factor analysis and hypothesis testing. Internal consistency was determined by calculating Cronbach's alpha coefficient. 143 carers completed the survey either by face-to-face or by online. After deleting one item with an item-total correlation of below 0.3, the remaining 16-item CFC-I reported a Cronbach alpha of 0.93. Construct validity was supported by strong item-total correlations (0.51-0.76), mean inter-item correlations (0.47) and factor loadings (0.557-0.809). Factor analysis revealed three factors that include concerns about care recipients' health and function, living environment and carers' perception of fall and fall risk. The 16-item CFC-I can discriminate between carers of older people with and without recurrent (fallen 3\/ more times) falls. The 16-item CFC-I is a valid and reliable scale for measuring carers' concern for the older people's risk of falling. Future analysis of test-retest and inter-rater reliability of the instrument will further support its clinical use for carers. The newly developed multi-item CFC-I can be used to quantify the carers' level of fall concern and inform targeted interventions for carers when caring for older people who are at risk of falling.

Increased adiposity and reduced muscle mass are identified as key contributors to many chronic diseases in older adults. Understanding the role they play in the development of comorbidities in older populations is of prime importance. To identify the optimal body shape associated with three common functional performance tests and to determine which anthropometric and functional performance test best explains comorbidity in a sample of older adults in Hong Kong. A total of 432 older adults participated in this cross-sectional study. Researchers assessed their body height, body mass index, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, handgrip strength (kg), functional reach (cm) and results in the timed-up-and-go (TUG) test (seconds). The Charlson Comorbidity Index was used to assess comorbidity. Allometric modelling indicated that the optimal body shape associated with all functional performance tests would have required the participants to be taller and leaner. The only variable that predicted comorbidity was the TUG test. The inclusion of body size\/shape variables did not improve the prediction model. Performance in the TUG test alone was found to be capable of identifying participants at risk of developing comorbidities. The TUG test has potential as a screening tool for the early detection of chronic diseases in older adults. Many older people are unaware of their own co-existing illnesses when they consult physicians for a medical condition. TUG can be a quick and useful screening measure to alert nurses in primary care to the need to proceed with more detailed assessments. It is an especially useful screening measure in settings with high patient volumes and fiscal constraints. TUG is low cost and easy to learn and is therefore also relevant for nurses and health workers in low-resource, low-income countries.

In hospital, the number of Plwd continues to rise; however, their experiences of care remain problematic. Negative experiences of care are likely to contribute to poorer mental and physical health outcomes for Plwd while in hospital and after discharge. Experiences of the hospital staff who care for Plwd can also be poor or unrewarding. It is important to understand the experiences of staff in order to improve staff well-being and ultimately the experience of care for Plwd while in hospital. Systematic review and evidence synthesis of qualitative research. We searched 16 electronic databases in March 2018 and completed forward and backward citation chasing. Eligible studies explored the experiences of paid and unpaid staff providing care in hospital for Plwd. Study selection was undertaken independently by two reviewers, and quality appraisal was conducted. We prioritised included studies according to richness of text, methodological rigour and conceptual contribution. We adopted approaches of meta-ethnography to analyse study findings, creating a conceptual model to represent the line of argument. Forty-five studies reported in 58 papers met the inclusion criteria, and of these, we prioritised 19 studies reported in 24 papers. The line of argument was that Institutions can improve staff experiences of care for Plwd by fostering person-centred care (PCC). PCC aligned with staff perceptions of 'good care'; however, staff often felt prevented from providing PCC because of care cultures that prioritised tasks, routines and physical health. Staff experienced conflict over the care they wanted to give versus the care they were able to give, and this caused moral distress. When staff were able to provide PCC, this increased experiences of job satisfaction and emotional well-being. Person-centred care not only has the potential to improve the experience of care for Plwd and their carers, but can also improve the experiences of hospital staff caring for Plwd. However, without institutional-level changes, hospital staff are often unable to provide PCC even when they have the experience and knowledge to do so. Institutional-level areas for change include the following: training; performance indicators and ward cultures that prioritise psychological needs alongside physical needs; adequate staffing levels; inclusive approaches to carers; physical environments that promote familiarisation, social interaction and occupation; systems of documentation about individual needs of Plwd; and cultures of sharing knowledge across hierarchies.

A systematic literature review was conducted in five databases per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses criteria. Primary or secondary peer-reviewed articles published between 1987 and October 2018 describing the experiences of family caregivers caring for older adults with delirium or delirium superimposed on dementia were included in the review. Mixed Method Appraisal Tool (MMAT) was used to evaluate the methodological quality. A thematic synthesis of results was conducted to extract relevant data as per the aims of the study. Eighteen articles met the eligibility criteria, which were reviewed and analysed in regard to purpose, sample, research design, variables and results. Seven themes emerged in the process. The current challenges and gaps in our knowledge of this phenomenon have also been highlighted, which should be helpful to inform best practices, and finally, an agenda for future research is proposed. Family caregivers are an important partner in the detection and management of delirium. The impact of caring for an older adult with delirium on the family caregivers should not be overlooked. This paper highlights the dearth of research on family caregiver's experience of caring for older adults with delirium and even less in the context of delirium superimposed on dementia. More research is required to further understand the family caregiver's experience and their challenges in order to support them in their caregiving role and to determine their needs and preferences of being involved in the plan of care. These findings suggest that family caregivers are a valuable resource in the recognition and management of delirium and should be included as care partners in the health care team, while also catering to their health and well-being in the process. ","141":"The aim of this review was to identify and synthesise literature reporting on support needs of older male caregivers, who are providing care for a chronically ill spouse\/partner at home. Traditionally, informal caregiving has been perceived as a feminised activity. Consequently, caregiving research has been dominated by female samples, and male caregivers are grossly under-represented. Given the growing recognition of caregiving as a gendered concept, and the rise in number of male caregivers, particularly in later life, the need for better understanding of the needs of male caregivers is important in order to plan effective support for this population. A systematic literature review. Four electronic databases and grey literature were systematically searched. The systematic search resulted in 3,646 papers, eligibility criteria were applied to the full texts of 104 papers, and 11 papers met the inclusion criteria. Two core themes were identified: the need to maintain masculinity and the provision of social support. Findings suggest that men may have a gendered approach to caregiving based on dominant masculine norms. This can be manifested in a reluctance to ask for or accept help and a desire to retain control over caregiving. Findings also revealed isolation and loneliness experienced by older male caregivers, along with a preference for support to address this within a male-specific context. It is suggested that healthcare professionals should be cognisant of the male caregiver approach and should have an increased awareness of male caregivers support preferences, and of their own gendered assumptions, in order to provide effective support for this population. Nurses have a key role in providing family support. Findings from this review suggest that nurses should be aware of the specific needs of older male spousal caregivers if they are to provide effective care and support to this population group.

This systematic review aimed to synthesise the available evidence on adverse health outcomes for people with dementia in acute care settings. A systematic search of CINAHL, PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Scopus databases for primary research articles in English language, published from 2000 to 2017, was conducted. A protocol for the review was registered on the PROSPERO database. The initial search identified 5,520 records. Following removal of duplicates and assessment against inclusion criteria, 13 studies were included in the final review. Findings identify associations between patients with dementia, longer length of hospital stay and higher mortality in some situations. Heterogeneity across studies in data reporting and outcomes prevented meta-analysis; therefore, results are presented narratively. Certainty of findings from this review is impacted by variation in patient condition and data reporting. Additional rigorous studies on health outcomes for people with dementia during acute hospitalisation will contribute to the evidence. These findings along with further research examining outcomes for patients with dementia in acute care settings will inform provision of safer, quality care and optimal health outcomes for this vulnerable population.

A scoping research literature review was done to identify factors currently associated with early retirement and contemporary strategies to encourage and support longer working lives. Using the PRISMA-ScR Checklist, we searched the Directory of Open Access Journals and EBSCO Discovery Service for published 2013-2018 research articles using the keyword\/MeSH term \"early retirement\"; 54 English-language articles in peer-review journals were reviewed. Seven early retirement factors were revealed: Ill health, good health, workplace issues, the work itself, ageism, social norms and having achieved personal financial or pension requirement criteria. Six suggested solutions, none proven effective, were identified: Occupational health programmes, workplace enhancements, work adjustments, addressing ageism, changing social norms and pension changes. The evidence base on early retirement prevention is not strong, with qualitative investigations needed for in-depth understandings of early retirement influences and mixed-methods studies needed to test early retirement prevention solutions for their effects. Until more evidence is available, every organisation should perform an early retirement risk assessment and identify current versus needed policies and programmes to encourage and enable more middle-aged and older people to work longer.

However, it is still unclear how falls and related injuries or FoF by themselves explain general and specific ADL dependence. To investigate the relationships between falls and related injuries, FoF and physical dependence on ADL in community-dwelling older adults, controlling for age, gender, physical activity and physical fitness as confounders. This cross-sectional descriptive study assessed 588 community-dwelling older adults. Falls and fall-related injuries, ADL dependence on basic, instrumental and advanced activities, FoF, demographic characteristics and health conditions were assessed through a questionnaire. Physical activity was measured through the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Physical fitness was assessed by the Senior Fitness Test and the Fullerton Advanced Balance Scale. Body composition was measured through bioimpedance. Severe injuries occurrence increased the likelihood of moderate and high physical dependence by 3 and 6 times, while FoF increased this likelihood by 3 and 7 times, respectively. Also, the occurrence of previous falls, resulting in severe injuries, increased the likelihood of dependence in two instrumental ADL (3 and 4 times), while FoF increased this likelihood in numerous basic, instrumental and advanced ADL (2-3 times). The FoF was shown to explain overall physical functioning dependence, by itself, representing a constraint on the performance of most basic, instrumental and advanced ADL. The FoF showed to be a greater threat to ADL dependence than falls and related injuries. Assessment guidelines for older adults living in the community should include the FoF in clinical evaluation. Understand the isolated interplay of FoF and previous falls and injuries on ADL dependence among older adults allows healthcare professionals to perform more accurate clinical evaluations and develop more successful interventions to prevent further dependence. ","150":"The findings presented in this manuscript address two key research questions: (a) What factors contribute to the initiation and maintenance of the caregiving role as performed by the grandparent-caregivers; and (b) What are the perceived benefits of caregiving as reported by grandparent-caregivers? Grandparents in sub-Saharan Africa have cared for their grandchildren for generations, yet little is known about this role in the context of the HIV epidemic. Although the impact of the epidemic is overwhelmingly negative, specifically in Uganda, knowledge of familial context and underlying motivations and rewards that incentivise grandparent-caregivers remains limited in the literature. Using a constructivist grounded theory approach, we explored the experiences of 32 Ugandan grandparents of grandchildren affected by HIV. Data were collected using a semi-structured and open-ended interview guide, participant observation and fieldnotes. Data analysis included open, focused and axial coding. The data revealed the influences of extended familial structures and of cultural and gender expectations on the decision-making processes and rewards of caregiving as perceived by the grandparent-caregivers. These findings provide a broad foundation for policy, practice, research and education interventions needed to support grandparents so they can enjoy the benefits of raising their grandchildren.

In addition, this study also explores the prevalence of ageist attitudes among healthcare professionals. An ageist environment may potentially increase internalisation of stereotypes by older adults, which in turn may have a negative impact on care outcomes. In this quantitative correlational study, a questionnaire was completed by 100 older patients hospitalised in a rehabilitation department of a geriatric medical centre located in North-Central Israel, and 87 healthcare professionals working in the same department. The attitudes of older patients towards their peers were neither definitely positive nor definitely negative, as were the attitudes held among healthcare professionals working in the facility. Patients with lower knowledge about old age, women and patients born in former Soviet Republics had more ageist attitudes. Older patients' satisfaction with care was relatively high and was not associated with ageist attitudes towards their peers. Both healthcare professionals and older patients held ageist attitudes to some extent. Certain older patients' sociodemographic characteristics, as well as lower knowledge about old age, have been found associated with more ageist attitudes towards their peers. In contrast, satisfaction with care does not seem to affect older patients' attitudes towards their peers. Healthcare professionals working in a geriatric facility should be aware of the prevalence of ageism among older patients. The findings highlight the importance of educational interventions among healthcare professionals to increase awareness of the prevalence of ageism among older patients in a geriatric setting.

As most persons with dementia live in their own homes, dementia affects not only the person with the disease, but also family, commonly the partner. Research shows that spousal carers feel as though they are losing their partners since they can no longer share thoughts, feelings and experiences as a couple. The aim of the study was to describe the sense of togetherness of the spouses when one spouse has dementia. The sample consists of 18 recorded conversations between 15 persons with dementia and their spouses. The filmed conversations were transcribed verbatim and then analysed using qualitative content analysis. One overarching theme arose: Dementia preserved and challenged the value of \"us.\" It can be challenging for a couple in which one partner has dementia to preserve a sense of togetherness and to have the relationship they wish for. Based on our results, we suggest that practitioners should help couples to strengthen their bond as a couple so as to maintain a sense of well-being. Future studies should examine couplehood under differing conditions, such as long- versus short-term relationships. Prior relationship quality may also be a factor that influences the sense of couplehood following a serious health challenge, such as dementia. When spouses were able to live together, their relationship was enriched at many levels. Their love for each other strengthened them as a unit - as an \"us\" - where togetherness seemed to be strong. Future studies need to examine whether the sense of couplehood varies depending on the length of the relationship (i.e., a relationship of many years or a relatively new relationship).

While the literature provides estimates of how many older people are affected by negative aspects of ageing, it is not known to what extent and why some older people experience gerotranscendence, despite the challenges they encounter throughout their lifetime. A cross-sectional survey. A 55-item questionnaire was distributed to 109 older people between March and June 2017. Univariable and multivariable linear regressions were conducted on the four question group sum scores to identify factors associated with gerotranscendence. Older people aged 65-93 who live in a community in Korea reported the experience of gerotranscendence. Age and religion showed a statistically significant association with gerotranscendence. Religiosity showed a statistically significant association with beliefs about death and dying. Age and beliefs about death and dying have significant relationship with the experience of gerotranscendence. Older people who have more positive views about death and dying are more likely to experience gerotranscendence. The study results provide nurses and other healthcare professionals with new understandings and insights about the factors potentially related to positive ageing process. It is essential for nurses to investigate their own beliefs about death and dying, and their understanding of gerotranscendence which will contribute to developing education programs and practice guidelines as an essential part of promoting gerotranscendence and positive ageing. ","159":"The objective of this study was to explore the influence of the environmental landscape on the physical activity of older persons experiencing frailty. This manuscript describes the second phase of an unpublished larger study in the northern province of Lampang, Thailand. Phase One revealed that 14% of 1,788 older persons surveyed were found to have experienced frailty according to Fried's frailty phenotypes, and low physical activity was associated with frailty. In the light of frailty, how older persons experience physical activity in their day-to-day living environments warrants in-depth exploration. This was a qualitative study guided by narrative inquiry. In-depth interviews and observations were conducted with 13 older persons living with frailty. The method of analysis was thematic and performance analysis. Two broad themes relating to the environmental landscapes were as follows: (a) limiting environmental landscapes and (b) engaging environmental landscapes. These landscapes, which change across time, refer to physical and social spaces, and beliefs of older persons and their family that have either positive or negative impacts on physical activity of frail older persons. Complex interactions between physical and social spaces and beliefs of older persons and family influence the physical activity behaviours of older persons living with frailty. This study warrants education and policy aiming at creating optimal environmental landscapes to promote physical activity in frail older persons.

This has the potential to impact not only on the well-being of individuals but also on the sustainability of healthcare systems. The aim of this study was to explore the views and experiences of frailty from the perspective of primary care professionals, including nurses, who work directly with older people within the community. A qualitative approach with a descriptive phenomenological methodology was used, which focused on exploration of primary care professionals' current experiences of early detection and prevention of the onset of frailty. Four multi-professional focus groups were held with a total of thirty-three primary care professionals who worked with older people as part of their daily role. Participants included district nurses, general practitioners, home care workers, physiotherapists and social workers. Professional views encompassed typical patterns of ageing, loneliness, presence of comorbidity, disability and end of life, with social conditions prevalent in most frailty they encountered. Three main themes emerged: the psychosocial nature of frailty, late detection of frailty and barriers to the feasibility of prevention. Physical frailty was considered a constituent part of ageing, which recognised the presence of a skills gap related to the detection of the early signs of frailty. Present health and social care systems are not designed to prevent frailty, and the competencies required by health and social care professionals are not usually included as part of their training curricula. This may hinder opportunities to intervene to prevent associated decline in ability of older adults. To enhance the early assessment of frailty and the planning of preventive multi-factorial interventions in primary care and community settings, training and effective detection strategies should be incorporated into the role and daily care activities of primary care professionals. Using a multidimensional assessment instrument can help primary care professionals to identify older people who are frail or may become frail. In order to be able to carry out this properly strong inter-professional collaboration is needed. In addition, interventions aimed at preventing frailty or adverse outcomes of frailty should be tailor-made and thus should meet the needs and wishes of an older person.

A total of 508 older adults enrolled in a cross-sectional study. For the assessment of risk factors, the research team collected basic data and health-related information and performed morphofunctional evaluations (strength and flexibility of lower body and dynamic balance). A significantly greater proportion of women experienced fall episodes within the past year. Additionally, certain chronic diseases were significantly more prevalent in the fall subgroup compared to the non-fall subgroup. The non-fall subgroup showed significantly better scores of lower body strength and dynamic balance than the fall subgroup. Multivariable regression analysis revealed that gender and lower body strength seem to be the main risk factors for fall event (s) within the past year in community-dwelling older adults from the Portuguese region of Alentejo. Differences in fall risk factors due to gender, ethnicity and geography must be taken into account in clinical practice. Nurses must identify the environmental, social and individual risks that constitute health threats and trigger protective intervention programs. Nursing care for older people must also meet needs related to physical activity (e.g., strength-training exercise), since lower body weakness is strongly associated with falls. ","165":"Nurses are increasingly expected to provide care for older persons; however, there are too few nurse educators with expertise in older person care to ensure students graduate with the requisite competencies. An integrative review, using Whittemore and Knafl's framework, was undertaken to identify and synthesise evidence about factors affecting nurse educators' knowledge, skills or attitudes about older persons and their care. Forty-four articles met the inclusion criteria. All but three papers originated in the USA. Content analysis yielded three central themes: external-level factors, employer-level factors and individual-level factors. Findings demonstrated that external funding from philanthropic organisations and government agencies supported many of the national, regional and site-specific initiatives, which were, in many cases, underpinned by professional regulatory frameworks. Negative attitudes of administrators and reduced budgets of educational institutions impeded the availability of such initiatives. Negative attitudes of individual educators towards older person care and the specialty of gerontology constrained their pursuit of such learning, as did their lack of awareness of current gerontology resources. The lack of educators with gerontology knowledge, skills and requisite attitudes requires a focused effort from external and professional bodies, and from educational institutions to ensure the resources are available to enhance educator expertise in gerontology. Rigorous study addressing the factors influencing educators' knowledge, skills or attitudes towards older persons and their care is required. Addressing the lack of nurse educator expertise in gerontology could help to ensure new nurses have the required competencies to provide quality older person care. ","166":"The study aims to analyse the tensions and the challenges of dementia care that are experienced by people with dementia and their family caregivers in China. China has the largest dementia population in the world; however, dementia care services and related support services are still developing. Caring for a person with dementia is very challenging, as evidenced by many studies. As the majority of people with dementia are looked after by their family in their homes in China, it is very important to understand what people with dementia and their family caregivers are experiencing in the context of dementia care services that are in the process of developing. Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) was used. Semi-structured individual interviews with 24 participants (10 people with dementia and 14 unrelated family caregivers) recruited from a mental health centre in Shandong Province. Three main themes emerged that highlighted unmet need: (a) Lack of support services, (b) Insufficient institutional care and (c) Social attitude and social stigma towards dementia. These themes reveal the challenges that the participants face in the context of dementia care services that are in the process of development in China; and how their lived experiences have been affected by the constraints of social support, public services, healthcare access, long-term care services and social stigma. This study highlights the tensions that are identified by people with dementia and family caregivers. The research recommends that more support services would be beneficial for this group and would also enhance family support dementia care in China. Looking after an older family member is a culturally, socially and legally embodied norm in Chinese society, so it is important to address education for dementia awareness and the sustainability of family support care services in China by providing dementia services and resources to support both people with dementia and family caregivers. ","167":"There is some evidence that healthcare professionals prefer an interprofessional approach to care and this approach is of particular importance to older people due to their complex needs and multitude of chronic conditions. This metasynthesis aimed to synthesise and unearth new understandings of the experiences of interprofessional team members that are caring for older people from a variety of qualitative studies. This review is designed as a metasynthesis based on the method put forth by Noblit and Hare for synthesising qualitative research. A search for qualitative and mixed methods articles that included healthcare professionals' experiences of caring for older people as a member of an interprofessional team was conducted via an electronic database search of CINAHL, PubMed, SCOPUS and PsycINFO. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) the method of the study was qualitative or included a qualitative component, (b) an interprofessional team cared for an older person, (c) data regarding interprofessional team members' experiences were gathered, (d) published in English and (e) between the period of 2000 and 2019. Key metaphors were extracted from the data and juxtaposed until themes emerged. A total of 1807 full-text articles were retrieved and screened via their titles and abstracts. Nine studies were included in this metasynthesis based upon full-text relevance and meeting the inclusion criteria. Six themes emerged describing the experience of interprofessional team members caring for older people: All for One: Unifying the Team for a Meaningful Purpose; The Cast; A Shared Vocabulary; Collaboration and Integration; A Functional-Dysfunctional Family and Appreciate the Lifeworld. Team members appreciated this model of care. The emergent themes suggest potential buy-in from interprofessional team members to this care model for older people. Nursing can assert their unique knowledge and practice into the role as the team leader to mitigate potential barriers and team conflicts. Interprofessional team members caring for older people can improve their experience. Improved experiences for interprofessional team members can lead to better care for older people. Professionals need specialized training prior to practicing interprofessionally.

Integrative review of the literature reporting exercise interventions among people with AD living in the communities. Seventeen studies presented in 24 quantitative papers with 1,068 participants diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease were reviewed. The interventions varied in intervention programme characteristics (e.g. baseline assessments, type of exercise, exercise dose, outcome measurements). Among them, (a) 13 studies appeared beneficial to physical fitness in different areas; (b) 9 studies reported the effects on cognitive ability and two studies showed the positive effects; (c) 12 studies reported the participants' adherence, but only 2 studies reported the participants' adherence using attendance and training intensity. Exercise is proven to be effective in physical fitness among community-dwelling patients with AD. Future studies should verify the effects on cognitive function and possible mechanisms of different exercise types using more sensitive and objective outcome measurements. Additionally, treatment fidelity, cost-effectiveness and long-term effects should be explored. Exercise may be effective and feasible for community-dwelling people with AD, but its effects on cognition need to be verified in the future. This review provided recommendations for assisting nurses and other clinicians in developing, implementing, and\/or evaluating exercise interventions for patients with AD.

Being outdoors has been described as important to older people's well-being. Use of outdoor gardens may increase residents' well-being through experiences of restorative qualities such as being away and fascination. Thus far, there has been little research on restorative experiences of gardens in the care of older people. A descriptive design using behaviour mapping observations integrated with qualitative field notes and recorded conversations. A criterion sampling of two gardens (out of a total of 87) was made based on residents' ratings of restorative values; the two with the highest values were chosen. Eleven residents at the two RCFs took part. Data were collected through behaviour mapping observations, field notes and conversations on five occasions in the respective facilities during residents' visits to the garden. The observations revealed that the main uses of the gardens were to socialise and relax. The conversations also showed that the garden stimulated residents' senses and evoked memories from the past. These restorative values were interpreted as a sense of being away and fascination. Not having opportunities for outdoor visits was reported to result in disappointment and reduced well-being. The findings showed that two basic gardens with different characteristics and views could stimulate residents' senses and evoke memories from the past; this supports the call for residents to be able to spend time in gardens to promote their well-being. First-line managers, nurses and healthcare staff in the care of older people should consider that regular opportunities to spend time outdoors may promote older people's well-being through feelings of being away and fascination.

Older people in RRC have an increased risk of injury-related harm, such as choking and suicide, compared to permanent nursing home residents. However, the opportunities for the prevention of harm during a RRC admission are largely unknown. This study developed recommendations to reduce harm and improve quality of care for older people in RRC. Experts developed, refined and prioritised recommendations through two consultation forums applying the modified nominal group technique and a follow-up online survey. Participants were purposively sampled from an existing network and were selected based on their expertise in aged care practice, nursing, policy, research, caregiver advocacy and quality improvement in the aged and healthcare sectors. Haddon's Matrix, an injury prevention framework, was applied to the recommendations. Final recommendations were released to over 300 organisations for validation and feedback. Five experts were involved in forum one, seven attended forum two, and a further seven completed the survey. Seventeen draft recommendations were developed and refined to 11 final recommendations, four of which were prioritised as most important for implementation. These included the following: (a) a planned preventative care model of RRC; (b) facilities that specialised in RRC; (c) optimising information gathered on RRC residents; and (d) a standardised procedure for admission, handover and discharge from RRC. We received limited feedback from the organisations, which did not alter the recommendations. The recommendations developed in this study provide a valuable basis for the development of strategies to reduce harm and improve care in RRC and are a valuable first step towards improving practice. The next step is to empirically test the suggested recommendations to determine their effectiveness. ","175":"Previous research points to challenges related to the home healthcare of older persons and to the complexity of communication. Although person-centred care has been advocated widely, there remains a need for in-depth knowledge on how to enable person-centred and supportive communication in the care of older persons. The aim of this study was to explore attributes of person-centred communication between nurses and older persons being cared for in their home. A descriptive study with a qualitative approach was conducted. A data set from the COMHOME-study consisting of 77 audio-recorded home healthcare visits between registered nurses and older persons was analysed with a method for qualitative thematic analysis. The findings indicate that the attributes of person-centred communication comprise recognising, inviting and involving older persons. To facilitate this form of communication, attentiveness and responsiveness on the part of RNs seemed significant. Person-centred communication was facilitated when the RNs used verbal expressions to emphasise and acknowledge the older persons' views and were attentive to their emotions and expressions. The nurses' attentiveness and responsiveness seems important for person-centred communication with older persons. Communication skills are needed to recognise, invite and involve older persons in their care and to support their health and well-being. Implication for practice The importance of communication which facilitate a person-centred approach by nurses should be acknowledged when caring for older persons and included in education and training.

The following research questions were addressed: How do home care older persons and family members perceive client-centered care in their home care services? What kind of social mechanisms are realized when home care services are implemented? Several older persons are dependent on home care services for their continued living at home. The fundamental value and best practice of home care is the client-centred care in services. The research method was realistic evaluation. Six families with six older person clients of home care and seven family members were interviewed. In the present study, the interview contained three themes (1) content and services of the home care, (2) activities and practices of the home care and (3) development of client centredness in home care. Research data were analysed with deductive content analysis. Home care service should be based on analysis of older person's individual life situation. Social mechanisms such as interaction, participation, trust and adaptation are realised in implementation of home care services. The most significant outcomes of client-centred service were timely availability of services, safe care relationship and continuity of care, ability to influence on own services and appropriate price of services. Significant factors in quality of service were unhurriedness, kindness and competence of professionals. Social mechanisms, such as participation, trust, adaptation and interaction, should be taken in account in care relationship in home care. Client centredness and methods for evaluating it should be defined in practical work. Client-centeredness competence should also be included in all stages of professional education of home care.

The introduction of consumer-directed care (CDC) emphasises the importance of communication to provide consumers with the opportunity to exercise choice over the care they receive. As consumer-directed care progresses, it is hypothesised that the feasibility of shared decision-making and care planning in residential aged care will be largely determined by the communication opportunities afforded to the residents. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore resident perceptions of the opportunities they have to communicate, including the opportunity to express their care preferences and contribute opinions about their care. A qualitative inductive design was adopted. An individual interview format was used to gather the perspectives of 102 residents. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis to generate themes illustrating patterns in participant views. Overall, residents desired increased involvement in their care planning and increased opportunity for more meaningful communication and social opportunities. Residents described the negative impact of the communication difficulties they face on their communication and the need for support and activities to be tailored to residents' individual communication needs. To facilitate resident participation in CDC and meet resident desire for increased social communication, further investment in resources to support resident-staff communication and accommodate residents' individual communication needs is required. By highlighting communication as a stand-alone activity and a priority of residents, the findings of this study raise the profile of communication and demonstrate the need for explicit allocation of care time and specialist services to support resident-staff communication and social communication in residential aged care. Such support must be tailored to meet residents' individual communication needs and be coupled with increased staff training in providing communication support. Without facilitating resident communication and increasing the opportunity to communicate, shared decision-making and care planning in residential aged care consistent with person-centred and consumer-directed models of care will be limited. ","182":"To describe family members' experiences of living with persons with neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) related to frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The majority of persons with dementia during the disease trajectory develop NPS. Persons with FTD are likely to develop greater levels of NPS than persons with other types of dementias. Research-based knowledge regarding family members' experiences of living with persons with FTD and NPS is limited. Nine family members of persons with FTD were interviewed. Interviews commenced with completion of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Upon completion of the NPI, questions were posed from an interview guide where study participants provided in-depth information about NPS identified. Interview data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Interviewed family members highlighted that persons with FTD had developed between four and eight co-existing NPS. Irritability and disinhibition were the most common NPS, with variations in severity, frequency and distress. From the interview data, two themes emerged: Living with a well-known stranger and Coping and overstepping social norms. Living with a well-known stranger depicted a new co-existence with a loved one with changes in personality and behaviour, which were not inherent to the person or predictable any more. The presence of NPS can threaten the safety of the person with FTD and their family in real world and on social media. Support offered should focus on the person's physical and psychological needs, not on a diagnosis. From a health care perspective it is important to see the person with FTD and their family as unique individuals with specific needs. ","183":"This study aimed to illuminate nurses' experience of continence care for older people receiving home care, either in their own home or in an assisted living facility. Registered Nurses (RNs) have a major role to play in identifying and establishing appropriate actions regarding continence care for older people. However, the crucial nursing care pathway for continence care is commonly described as poor. Interviews were conducted with 11 RNs providing home care, and the transcribed texts were analysed using inductive content analysis. The impressions of RNs were categorised according to four themes: perceptions of continence care, an open approach to continence care, the need for personalised aid fittings and the importance of teamwork in continence care. Key findings were the importance of teamwork; the need for nurses to embrace leadership at the point of care and be more visible in terms of the provision of direct care; substantiation that evidence-based interventions, such as scheduled toileting and prompted voiding, should constitute the norm in continence care within the context of home care; and the need for nurses to support the right of older persons to receive an assessment of their continence problems, deemed to be the minimum standard of quality care. The provision of continence care that is based on key nursing standards, such as evidence-based and person-centred care, as well as individualised continence care that is based on evidenced-based guidelines, would ensure an improvement in the continence care that is presently on offer to older people. Nurses need to embrace leadership at the point of care and to be more visible with the provision of direct care in order to improve continence care for older people receiving home care. ","184":"We will provide insights in the theoretical background and key concepts of a Narrative Care approach, such as narrative cultures, narrative curiosity, narrative co-composition and narrative reflective practice. Care understood as narrative practice underscores the importance of experiences and how these shape identities. Important to the quality of care in institutional care settings is the ability of care providers to cope with complexities and uncertainties in older adults' stories, which can be realised by attending to ways that foster and co-compose evolving and forward-looking narratives. Recognising these ongoing co-compositions means that persons living in institutional care settings and care providers live, tell, retell and relive their experiences. A change in the current institutional culture is necessary to implement care as narrative practice. To support such a change, approaches are needed that foster a focus on experiences and relationships and make relational ethics central to care. The proposed Narrative Care approach is the result of an iterative development process involving a literature review, interviews with, and observations of, care providers, dialogues with an advisory committee, and consultation with experts. The proposed Narrative Care approach aims to help care providers (a) to recognise the importance of curiosity in a person's verbal and embodied narratives-especially for those living with dementia; (b) to take note of individual experiences in all of their complexity and uncertainty; (c) to respect these narratives; (d) to open up spaces to co-compose new narratives; and (e) to allow care providers to engage in narrative reflective practices that shape who they are and are becoming. The introduced approach responds to the need of implementing strategies to think and work narratively in institutional care settings. Narrative Care has the potential to reshape task-oriented, technical notions of care. Concepts such as embodied narratives, relational ethics, narrative co-composition and narrative reflective practice must be integrated in the education of all care providers. ","185":"Nurses who care for acute patients with dementia in a hospital setting report a variety of challenges in regard to meeting the complex needs of their patients. In particular, known barriers to optimal care include a lack of knowledge about dementia, lack of dementia-friendly acute clinical environments, lack of time to care for the individual patient and a prioritised focus on the medical issues that triggered the hospitalisation. Research to date has not specifically focused on nurses' experiences of caring for people with dementia in orthopaedic wards. This study investigates nurses' experiences of caring for people with dementia, in an acute orthopaedic hospital ward setting. Qualitative interviews. This qualitative study employs hermeneutic phenomenological research methods. Eight Danish nurses were interviewed in an orthopaedic ward about their experiences in caring for orthopaedic patients with dementia. Nurses with various levels of expertise were selected for interview so that a full range of nursing experiences could inform the research study. The results of the study revealed two major themes: \"Nurse communication and patient information\" and \"Care compromise\", with three and four sub-themes, respectively. These findings are used to illustrate how, and why, nurses' experiences of caring for patients with dementia contribute a discontentment and negative preconceived perception by some nurses towards their acute care of patients with chronic dementia. The results are discussed in the context of Interactional Nursing Practice theory and describe the challenges experienced by acute care orthopaedic nurses who care for patients with dementia. Orthopaedic nurses find it challenging and professionally difficult to provide person-centred care for patients with dementia during an acute orthopaedic hospital admission. Orthopaedic nurses should work to adopt a positive attitude, and person-centred approach, towards dementia care. It is also recommended that the electronic patient record should be supplemented by oral dissemination to some extent, as information, plans of action and knowledge about the care situation for patients with dementia has a tendency to drown in chronological data presentation.

Reablement services have been implemented in a number of municipalities in Scandinavia. To our knowledge, there are a few studies focusing on home care service providers experience working within the frame of reablement. To provide knowledge regarding how home care service providers working with reablement in the home care setting describe their experiences. The study had a qualitative design and included five focus group discussions with 25 healthcare professionals working in community health care in two municipalities. The data were analysed using a grounded theory approach. The analysis illustrated how the participants experienced both engagement and challenges working with reablement. This was identified by the two categories: creating sustainable change and negotiating the line between helping and enabling. The first described how increased focus on enabling participation among the service recipients created sustainable changes for the older adults and was considered a positive change for both the recipients and the health professionals. The latter showed how the participants found working with reablement as a process of negotiation. This was what the health professionals found most challenging with reablement. Working within the frame of reablement offered the service providers, a framework for being more flexible in meeting the fluctuating needs of the older adults. This was done by increasingly utilise ones' clinical skills and changing from providing passive care to working on increasing the older persons' participation in everyday activities. Working with reablement also created challenges. This was related to the health professionals perceived expectations of what some of the older adults expected home care to be and caused ambivalence. Nurses and healthcare workers should focus on older adults' resources and goals in order to give services that enhance participation in daily activities.

Such behaviour causes stress for both resident and caregiver. Many non-pharmacological interventions have been studied, but these interventions disregard the resident's unfulfilled needs and are executed by a single, designated caregiver. This study tests a non-pharmacological intervention, applied by the entire team and based on the resident's underlying needs. A pretest and post-test interventional study design was used, in which 65 residents with dementia who expressed agitated or aggressive behaviour. Data were collected from December 2016 until March 2017. The ABC method and the Senses Framework were used to assign residents to either therapeutic touch, group music sessions or a meaningful individual activity. All staff members applied the interventions. Data were collected by use of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home version (NPI-NH) and the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI). The frequency of aggression, loss of decorum, depression and the severity of aggression decreased for all three interventions. However, the overall severity of fear also increased. The overall prevalence of agitated of residents decreased for the therapeutic touch, group music sessions and individual activities. This study shows the possibilities of designing individualised interventions on the Senses Framework and the ABC method for addressing agitated and aggressive behaviour amongst nursing home residents with dementia.

This qualitative study aimed to investigate the perceptions of older adults in a New Zealand setting towards the term \"frail\". Twelve participants identified as frail based on unrelated comprehensive geriatric assessment were approached and interviewed in their own homes. Interviews were transcribed ad verbatim and analysed by general inductive approach. There was a diverse conceptualisation of frailty among the participants, across physical, cognitive and social dimensions, which differed from professional definitions of frailty. Participants maintained a neutral stance towards the concept of frailty and, however, reject its application to themselves. They also highlight the importance of independence and resilience in the staving off of frailty and the maintenance of quality of life. This study suggests health professionals should shift focus on clinical encounters with the older patient, away from the deficits of frailty and towards independence, resilience and autonomy. Frail older adults often reject the term frailty when used about themselves, therefore using this term in communication with older adults may have negative consequences.

Data were generated through semi-structured interviews. A purposive sample of ten Registered Nurses in a charge nurse role, diverse in experience, age, gender and background, was recruited from five LTCFs in Ontario, Canada. The study used a combination of conventional and direct qualitative content analyses. All tasks performed by the charge nurses were categorised in four dimensions: clinical, supervisory, team support and managerial. Administration was a cross-cutting sub-dimension which has gained presence over the years. Depending on the shift worked and the organisational structure of the facility, each dimension gained or lost weight as part of the overall role. These findings suggest that the charge nurse role is in a state of flux and lacking standardisation within and across facilities. LTCFs would benefit from increasing recognition of the role according to the wide range of tasks performed and responsibilities assumed, and by recruiting their charge nurses accordingly.

Smart home technology can support living at home, but synthetised knowledge of previous studies about their suitability for the everyday lives of older people is rare. Data for this integrated review were obtained by searching the PubMed, CINAHL and Scopus databases from 2012 to 2019, based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, and then carrying out quality appraisals of the papers that were selected. We identified 944 papers, and 16 were included in the review. According to our analysis, smart home solutions for older people focused on devices for daily and healthy living and older people's safety. The smart home solutions they discussed were used to help older people carry out everyday activities and lead healthier and more fulfilled lives, by improving their physical safety and social communication. Older people reported that smart homes improved their sense of security, quality of daily life and activities and provided them with information about the care they could receive. However, research on older people playing an active role in developing smart home technology was lacking. The existing literature focused on evaluating daily activities with routine measurements. There has been a lack of research that has focused on older people's experiences as the end users of this technology. However, the papers lacked data on how older people could maintain their social relationships and become more proactive in daily living. With further development, smart homes can be used to support older people to perform daily activities and help them maintain their social relationships.

","202":"To investigate, from the staff perspective, residents' self-determination during the palliative phase while in residential care. Residential care facilities have a high prevalence of palliative care needs and dependency. The ability of residents to make and execute decisions may be hindered by their cognitive and physical limitations. There is a need to investigate how residents' self-determination is affected during the palliative phase in residential care. Twenty individual, semi-structured interviews with Registered Nurses, enrolled nurses and physicians working in residential care facilities were analysed with inductive qualitative content analysis. The overarching main theme, Balancing between maintaining and overriding the residents' self, illuminated how strengthened self-determination affected the residents' self in a positive way, while undermined self-determination affected the residents' self in a negative way. Factors that strengthened self-determination were facilitating the residents' own decision making, acting in accordance with the residents' wishes and acting as the residents' spokesperson when necessary. Factors that undermined self-determination were residents' dependence, others setting the terms, for example, being controlled by routines, insufficient communication, for example, lacking end-of-life care planning and others crossing the boundaries of one's personal sphere. There are serious threats to residents' self-determination but also strategies to cope with these threats. Physical and cognitive frailty and other people setting the terms hinder both making and executing decisions. However, staff can strengthen residents' self-determination and assist in the presentation of residents' self by adopting a relational view of autonomy and by taking personal preconditions into account. There is a need to come to terms with the lack of end-of-life care planning and to give residents a voice in these matters. Implementing a palliative approach early in the illness trajectory could facilitate communication about end-of-life care both within the group of staff and among the residents, relatives and staff. To maintain residents' self-determination and protect their self, staff need knowledge about residents' life stories and personal preconditions. This in turn requires continuity of care and spending time with residents to build relationships. Implementing an early palliative approach with a focus on factors that promote quality of life for each resident might facilitate communication and enhance decision making both in everyday life and in planning for end-of-life care.

Care home staff are pivotal to this experience, responsible for the provision of meals and eating assistance, but also for establishing a positive mealtime culture valued by residents. Despite this, mealtimes can be task-focussed, as the pressure on staff to perform multiple duties in limited time, or a lack of knowledge and awareness, means that resident needs and preferences risk being neglected. A staff-focussed training programme aimed at improving social interaction, and resident choice was developed and delivered in a workshop. Intervention feasibility was assessed using a qualitative survey and workshop observations. A combination of descriptive and content analyses was conducted on the data. Thirteen women and one man took part in the workshops, representing multiple roles within two homes in the South West UK. The workshops were found to be deliverable and practicable. Participants responded positively to the workshops, anticipating that improvements to the mealtime experience would result from their workshop outputs. This study suggests that staff training workshops based on improving the mealtime experience are feasible to deliver within the day-to-day running of a care home and are acceptable to staff. Positive changes resulting from these workshops could improve the health and well-being of residents. Mealtimes in care homes may be improved by increasing social interaction and by providing residents with greater choice. Management-faciltated staff training may be a useful tool to encourage staff to reflect on current practice and develop their own strategies to improve the mealtime experience for residents.

The system could improve communication between residents and caregivers, thus reducing staff response time and improving residents' safety. Across the country, nursing homes are often cited as having serious quality and safety issues. Deficiencies in the communication systems that connect residents with caregivers significantly impact the quality of care. Most nursing homes still use traditional call light systems, that give visual and auditory cues to caregivers, who may or may not be in proximity to the system. This study evaluates a smartwatch communication system developed to quickly relay a resident's requests for assistance to staff anywhere in the nursing home. Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs) employed by nursing homes were recruited to perform routine tasks using both a traditional system and a smart system. Response time to call lights, staff performance and outcomes were measured through direct and recorded observations and through the surveys of participants. The smartwatch system reduced staff response time to call lights from bedrooms by 40%, from bathrooms by 58% and from bed exit alarms by 29%. The smartwatch system also reduced perceived workload by about 50% and was highly accepted by the CNAs. A smartwatch-based notification system may increase staff performance and decrease workload, thus leading to greater staff and patient satisfaction, which could ultimately lead to better quality of care and patient safety. This study provides empirical evidence for the usefulness of smartwatches in facilitating the notification and communication processes in healthcare settings and is also among the first to actually examine a smartwatch system in a healthcare setting.

Valuing expert professional knowledge and skills is central to the achievement of improved care in NHs. This study developed and prioritised recommendations to prevent deaths of NH residents (NHRs) with UAs. Two expert consultation forums using the modified nominal group technique to develop recommendations were conducted, followed by an online survey to prioritise the most important recommendations for implementation. A framework applying the temporal dimension (\"pre-event,\" \"event\" and \"post-event\") of an internationally accepted injury prevention framework, Haddon's Matrix, was applied to the recommendations. Participants were purposively sampled and identified via aged care organisations; and were selected based on their experience in aged care practice, policy, research, elder rights, seniors' law, or missing persons search and rescue (SAR). Forum one comprised six, and forum two comprised nine experts from mixed disciplines. Seven participants completed the online survey. Twenty recommendations to prevent future injury and death were developed, five of which were prioritised for implementation in the aged care sector. In order of priority, these include: universal UA definition; mandated SAR plan, early assessment of NHRs; unmet needs behavioural assessments; and participation in decision-making. The recommendations cover the broad spectrum of complex issues raised in managing unexplained absences, and are a vital first step towards informing care providers, governments and SAR teams about how to prevent injury and death of NHRs in residents with UAs. Future research should explore how to translate and evaluate the recommendations into practice.

Integrative review of literature. Literature search was conducted using CINAHL Plus with Full Text via EBSCO, Scopus, PubMed, PsychInfo, Web of Science, and ProQuest Social Science Databases from March to December 2017. This integrative review utilised the Whittemore and Knafl framework and PRISMA in the selection of eligible articles. Quality of the articles was evaluated using the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool. Seven articles were reviewed and analysed. There is limited evidence \\and no agreed definition of spiritual needs and care of older adults living in residential care facilities. Spiritual needs of older adults in residential care facilities is a psycho-social, religious and existential construct. Spiritual care in residential care facilities is linked to information gathering, religious guidance, maintaining family connections, providing companionship, discussing end of life issues, and providing counseling. Older adults highly value the role of nurses and caregivers in fulfilling their spiritual needs and providing spiritual care. However, nurses and caregivers perceived arranging a referral to a religious advisor as the main aspect of spiritual care. Therefore, nurses', caregivers', and older adults' views on spiritual care differed to some extent. The practical aspects of spiritual needs assessment and spiritual care provision requires further investigation, which is essential to improve the effectiveness of service delivery in residential care facilities.

Through this concept analysis, we hope to empower nurses to more accurately identify guilt in caregivers and tailor interventions to specifically reduce these symptoms of guilt. Individuals with dementia are often cared for by relatives, friends and neighbours. Many caregivers express feelings of guilt, increasing the risk of depression and psychological burden. In turn, this impacts their availability to render care. Concept analysis according to Walker and Avant (Strategies for theory construction in nursing. Boston, MA: Prentice Hall; 2011). A literature search was completed utilising the following databases Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, PubMed, PsycINFO and Google Scholar for the years 2003-2017. Common definitions and lay usage were also considered. The identified critical attributes of guilt experienced by caregivers to individuals with dementia include the following: (a) The expectation of a moral responsibility to care for the individual with dementia; (b) a negative, subjective appraisal of one's own caregiving performance, including neglecting other roles and responsibilities and self-neglect; and (c) a sense of transgression or violation of a moral standard as a caregiver to the individual with dementia. These defining attributes were then applied in three cases: model, borderline and contrary. Pertinent antecedents and consequences to the concept of guilt in caregivers to individuals with dementia were identified. As a result of the guilt, the caregiver may experience poor mental and physical health, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and a greater sense of caregiver burden. A new, comprehensive conceptual definition of guilt in caregivers to individuals with dementia is described. A conceptual definition of guilt in caregivers of individuals with dementia allows nurses to assess and identify caregivers at risk for, or currently experiencing, guilt and help direct caregivers to appropriate interventions and supportive services.

With an increasing ageing population, the need for high-quality care provision is set to rise and will require nursing staff with the desired knowledge, skills and values. However, multiple concerns have been identified when considering the development of nurses working in care homes. Moreover, challenges in the care home sector have also contributed to a situation where some nurses view care home work as being of low status and choose this work to fit around other commitments, rather than viewing it as a viable career pathway. A qualitative approach based on the principles of Appreciative Inquiry. Fifteen participants working in five care homes with nursing, based in England (UK), took part in this study. Data were collected during 2016-2017 and involved managerial, qualified and unqualified staff. Data analysis revealed three distinct themes: an effective learning environment; the care home as a nursing student placement; and the need for financial investment. These themes were found to have the most influence on the development and education of care home nursing staff. This research provides important insights into the care home as an educational environment, not only for nursing students but also for those employees already working in such settings. Exploration of the ways in which higher education organisations and care home teams could collaborate more closely could be mutually beneficial to the quality of care and to raising the profile of care home work. Care homes can provide a rich learning environment for both staff and nursing students. Collaboration and appreciative ways of working enhance opportunities for developing practice and care.

This model does not fit the needs of older people because it emphasises efficacy and a narrow definition of patient safety, but does not prioritise functional needs. Nursing care is provided around the clock within the context of fiscal restraints as well as negative societal and nursing perspectives about ageing and old people. Yet, nursing perceptions of managing safety and potential harms to older patients within these hospital institutions are not well understood. An integrative review was conducted to examine nursing perspectives of safety and harm related to hospitalised older people. The majority of included papers focused on restraint use. Findings reveal that nurses are using restraints and limiting mobility as strategies to manage their key priority of keeping older patients safe, reflecting a narrow conceptualisation of safety. Policy, administrative support and individual nurse characteristics influence restraint use. Safety policies that nurses interpret as preventing falls can encourage the use of restraints and limiting mobility, both of which result in functional losses to older people. This complex issue requires attention from clinical nurses, leaders, policy makers and researchers to shift the focus of care to preservation and restoration of function for older people in hospital as a safety priority. Clinical leaders and nursing teams should engage in developing processes of care that incorporate maintaining and restoring older people's function. ","232":"Grounded in Self-Determination Theory (SDT), the aim of the study was to define an autonomy supportive environment through the perceptions of different healthcare professionals in three geriatric care units within French public and private hospitals. Four focus groups were conducted with healthcare professionals. Each focus group was videotaped and audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. An inductive approach was used, and data analysis was carried out using NVivo 10 software for Mac-QSR International. Three themes were highlighted (a) building a relationship of trust with older people; (b) encouraging them to express themselves and (c) promoting progress. The present study provides some information and a reflection for healthcare professionals who might be interested in using a more autonomy-supportive motivating style in their practice. ","233":"To develop and prioritise recommendations to prevent the use of physical restraints among nursing home residents. This study comprised two expert and stakeholder consultation forums using a modified nominal group technique and a follow-up electronic survey to rank the final set of recommendations. There were 15 recommendations formulated to prevent the use of physical restraint among nursing home residents. The three recommendations ranked as most important were that: a single definition be mandated for describing \"physical restraint\"; use of physical restraint acts as a trigger for mandatory referral to a specialist aged care team; and nursing home staff profile and competencies are appropriate to meet the complex needs of residents with dementia and obviate the need to apply physical restraint. Future studies should investigate the feasibility of implementing these recommendations and whether the proposed interventions reduce the use of physical restraint. Implementation of recommendations to prevent the use of physical restraint may assist nursing home staff, providers and policy makers to deliver improved care that is more aligned with contemporary views of human rights. ","234":"A Community Wellness Team was implemented in North East England in 2014, in line with national policy directives to support frail older people in the community. The service provides a comprehensive and integrated care package, which aims to reduce avoidable admissions, inappropriate service use and enable patients to stay at home. A realist design combining a review of the literature and primary data collection from service providers and patients was used to develop programme theories explaining the links between the Team interventions and expected outcomes. Five programme theories were developed, detailing: trust development and relationship building; risk minimisation in the home environment; advice on self-management; referral to preventative services; and coordination of services. The programme theories explain the role and impact of the Community Wellness Team. These programme theories are interrelated and impact one another; a hypothesised progression of programme theories indicating how the Community Wellness Team \"works\" is discussed. Of particular importance was the comprehensive initial assessment, which leads to the alteration of the social and physical environment within which older people live. Severely frail older people present cases that are complex socially, medically, financially and environmentally. In order to meet these needs, the Team coordinators are adopting a complex and flexible person-centred approach. This study paves the way for further research into the care networks surrounding severely frail older people living in the community, and how they can most effectively be implemented.

Care partners face significant challenges in their care role and they often feel unsupported. An understanding of their experiences may help improve home care to support their needs. An exploratory qualitative approach was used. The study is based on the SRQR and COREQ reporting guidelines. In-depth interviews were conducted with six Norwegian care partners from two municipalities. Data were collected during 2012-2013 and 2016. The data were analysed using Gadamer's hermeneutics. Three themes were identified: \"invisible cornerstones,\" \"dimensions of collaboration\" and \"unwanted roles.\" Few or no routines for collaboration exist between care partners and home care, and the care partners seem to have little knowledge of legal rights. They request more information, spare time and the opportunity to remain in their original family role. However, their main focus is for the patient to receive the necessary help from home care. Home care have restricted resources for meeting these needs and share a sense of powerlessness and lack of influence over their own everyday life with the care partners. There is a need for a systematic, person-centred approach to collaboration. A correlation is necessary between what is communicated at the system level and the means of realising this in practice for home care to meet care partners' needs. ","238":"The aim of this study was to describe how EL was eased, as narrated by frail older people. Existential loneliness (EL) is an unavoidable part of the human condition. It is a complex phenomenon that has been described as disconnection from life. If EL is acknowledged in the care of older people, the experience of EL can be reduced. In this qualitative study, we used an exploratory and descriptive design. The study was based on 22 narrative interviews with frail older people, 76 to 101 years old, who were receiving long-term care and services. We analysed the data using conventional content analysis. Being acknowledged by others, that is, being the focus of others' concern, eased the experience of EL, as did encountering intimacy and having meaningful exchanges of thoughts and feelings. Further, EL was pushed into the background and eased when participants could bracket negative thoughts and feelings, that is, when they could adjust and accept the present situation, view life in the rear-view mirror, be in contact with spiritual dimensions and withdraw and distract themselves. Existential loneliness can be eased by experiencing meaningful togetherness with others and oneself when something else comes to the forefront, pushing EL to the background. Frail older peoples' opportunities to ease EL may be facilitated by health care staff (HCS) providing person-centred care and create possibilities for solitary time and meaningful togetherness. If frail older people's ongoing processes of adjusting and accepting their situation are understood and confirmed by people in their environment, for example, by nurses, family and friends, the experience of living a meaningful life can be supported, which, in turn, can ease EL. ","239":"The incidence of sedentary behaviour and cardiovascular disease impacts the health of older people, potentially leading to serious and negative health consequences. The purpose of this umbrella review was to identify the systematic reviews that explore the association between sedentary behaviour and cardiovascular disease specific to older people. An umbrella review was undertaken to systematically search five databases. Papers included were published between 2011 and 2015. A search yielded 2,163 results. Six reviews met the inclusion criteria. While all six systematic reviews included older people in the overall sample, only one systematic review focused on an entirely older person population. Three of the six systematic reviews provided a meta-analysis, but none of the reviews reported a separate subgroup analysis for a discrete sample of older people CONCLUSION: This umbrella review demonstrates that while sedentary behaviour is associated with cardiovascular disease, a gap exists in the analysis on the relationship specific to older persons. Interventions aimed at reducing sedentary behaviour may improve cardiovascular health and well-being among older people. ","240":"Federal regulations require nursing homes in the United States to support residents in directing their own care rather than having their care plans developed for them without their engagement, but knowledge of person-directed approaches to care planning in nursing homes is limited. The purpose of this study was to advance understanding of person-directed care planning (PDCP). A multidisciplinary research team conducted a scoping review on individual and family involvement in care planning, including literature from a variety of care contexts. Search results were systematically screened to identify literature that addressed individual or family involvement in care planning as a primary concern, and then analysed using thematic content analysis. Several themes were identified, including definitions of the concept of PDCP, essential elements of PDCP, barriers, facilitators and outcomes. The concept of PDCP is informed by multiple disciplines, including humanist philosophy, disability rights and end-of-life care. Essential elements of PDCP include knowing the person, integrating the person's goals in care planning and updating care plans as individuals' needs or preferences change. Limited time for care planning in nursing homes hinders PDCP. Facilitators include regulatory mandates and humanist social trends. Outcomes of PDCP were found to be positive (e.g., increased independence), but were inconsistently assessed across studies. This study offers pragmatic information that can support PDCP within nursing homes and insights for policy reform that may more effectively support PDCP. These findings can be used to guide implementation of PDCP. ","241":"Defining the components of emotional competence in caring for older people in Iranian hospitals. People of older age are the largest recipients of healthcare services in hospitals. Thus, it is essential to establish what characteristics of emotional competence are required for nursing older people. This qualitative descriptive-exploratory study was conducted in Iran from September 2015 to April 2016. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 participants (nine nurses, 12 nurse managers, four clinical instructors), chosen by purposive and snowball sampling based on saturation. Data were analysed by content analysis method. Qualitative content analysis identified two core categories and seven subcategories from the data: (a) Individual emotional competence with five subcategories of positive attitude, spiritual maturity, emotional self-control, adherence to professional ethics and creativity and innovation, and (b) social emotional competence with two subcategories of relationship management and compassionate care. Emotional competence was identified as one of the main components of nursing skills when caring for older people. Gerontological nurses should demonstrate emotional competence in caring for older people and include a positive attitude, spiritual maturity, emotional self-control, adherence to professional ethics, creativity in care, successful relationship management and compassionate care in their practice. These findings can be used to guide development of emotional competencies for nursing older people. ","242":"Falls are a common and often a devastating health hazard for older people, causing suffering, morbidity and mortality. Falls are costly for society in terms of both resources and direct medical costs. Although knowledge about falls and fall prevention is well known, falls among older people are still a major problem. The aim was to estimate the prevalence of the risk of falls among older people receiving municipal health care. A further aim was to investigate the consistency between fall risk factors and preventive nursing interventions. A cross-sectional register study. Data containing risk assessments based on the Downton Fall Risk Index (DFRI) and planned interventions by the municipal health care were collected from the Swedish national quality registry, Senior Alert. Data were analysed using descriptive and analytic statistics. In the sample of 5,427 older people, the prevalence of the risk of falling was 79%. There was a difference in prevalence between the different types of municipal health care, sex and age. The most common preventive intervention was environment adjustments, and the least planned intervention was information\/education about falls. Physical activity as an intervention was planned among 13.2% of the participants. Approximately 27% of the older people did not have any planned interventions despite being at risk of falling. Planned interventions did not always correspond with the risk factors; for instance, only 35.4% of those at risk of falling due to medication obtained pharmaceutical reviews as a preventive measure to decrease the risk. The risk of falling is common among older people, and the preventive interventions do not sufficiently follow current evidence. This implies that systematic implementation of fall-prevention guidelines is needed in municipal care. A better match between identified risk factors and preventive interventions is warranted.

With the increase in average life expectancy and related growth of the elder population, addressing geriatric care needs has become an increasingly vital issue. However, the frontline workforce faces major challenges in meeting these needs, including a lack of trained professionals entering the field. A qualitative inductive design was used. A descriptive, qualitative study using focus group interviews and content analysis. The findings revealed that HCAs are active in an area facing challenges due to an older home-dwelling generation. Transfer of tasks should be reviewed considering changes to the workforce's skill mix brought on by task shifting. Certain prerequisites are needed to enable unlicensed assistive personnel to perform a good job; they also need to receive affirmation that they are a crucial workforce carrying out multifaceted tasks. To improve and maintain the pull factors of social care work, it is crucial to clarify how older people's requirements influence the daily care relation. The findings highlight HCAs' blurred responsibility when providing nursing and care to older people with multiple chronic conditions and functional disabilities. Increasing expectations are placed upon HCAs to cope with practical situations that are theoretically outside the bounds of social care. The findings contribute knowledge to further development of collaboration between social and health care providers as well as the important affirmation of this unlicensed personnel group in transition. A long-term plan is therefore needed to provide HCAs with the skills and tools they need to deliver care and support to older people with a variety of needs.

Older persons make up the majority of healthcare recipients, and they are at risk to experience significant decline in their mobility once hospitalised. This can result in longer hospitalisations or nursing home admissions. Currently, it is not well understood how nurses maintain and restore mobility of hospitalised older persons. An integrative literature review using key concepts related to hospitalised older people, mobility and nursing care was conducted. Whittemore and Khalf's five-stage methodological framework for integrative reviews was utilised. Two reviewers screened 1640 resources from four computerised databases published in English during 2000-2017. Reviewers used the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) and CASP quality appraisal tools to assess the thirteen included articles. The findings of this review reveal that little is known about how frequently nurses are mobilising, that many nurses perceive mobilising older patients to be physiotherapy's responsibility and that education about mobilisation can improve nurses' willingness to mobilise people. By investing in education and training programmes targeted for nurses, nurses can feel empowered in their ability to mobilise patients and are encouraged to take ownership of their patient's functional needs. In order to facilitate mobility, adequate staffing levels are necessary for transferring and ambulation, mobility assistive devices such as walkers and canes and environments with adequate space to mobilise. More research is needed to better understand and overcome barriers that nurses face in mobilised older people in acute care. The nursing team can work together to prioritise mobilisation to assist in restoring and maintaining the function of hospitalised older people. Educators could review their mobility programmes to increase graduate nurses' confidence and self-efficacy in mobility assessments and thus prepare graduate nurses for the realities of practice. ","249":"The purpose of the study was to evaluate the usefulness of the \"Managing Medicines for People with Dementia\" (www.dementiameds.com) website for informal carers. The management of medications for individuals living with a dementia by informal carers is a neglected area of care. We know that informal carers find it difficult accessing reliable and comprehensive information about medications. We also know that the Internet is a contemporary and growing medium through which consumers access health information. This study was unique in that it brought these two elements together through an interdisciplinary study about the usefulness of a new website providing information on medication management. Data collection consisted of focus groups with informal carers of individuals living with a dementia. Data were analysed through content analysis. Four themes were generated from the data to explain the evaluation of the website by informal carers: (1) Suitability of the website; (2) Presentation of the website; (3) Unexpected benefits of the website content; (4) Future enhancements for website. Participants overwhelmingly agreed the content of the website filled a gap in information needs about medication management for individuals living with a dementia. This qualitative evaluation demonstrated the value of the website as a resource for informal carers of individuals living with a dementia. The resource could also be used by community nurses and other healthcare practitioners to help informal carers better manage the medication regimes of individuals living with a dementia. The resource has the potential to reduce complications associated with mismanagement of medications and contribute to new policies for implementing safe medication practices. ","250":"To investigate older patients' perceptions of respect in hospital nursing care and to test a newly developed instrument measuring the phenomenon. Respect manifests itself in the older patient-nurse relationship in terms of nurses being with and doing for the patient. Empirical studies investigating respect from the older patients' perspective are rare. There is a need to maintain respectful behaviours and attitudes within hospital-based nursing practice. Furthermore, there is a lack of instruments measuring respect in the care provided by nurses. A descriptive, cross-sectional explorative survey design was used. Data were collected between February and May 2016 by interviewing face-to-face 196 older patients in two hospitals in Finland. Respect was measured using the ReSpect scale (Parts A and B) developed for this study. Respect is based on the two dimensions of respect, nurses' Being with and Doing for patients. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistical methods including the psychometric testing of the new instrument. Older patients perceived respect in their care frequently and to a great extent, although there were also shortcomings. The findings highlight the need to improve respect to patients in care delivery by showing an interest in their views, acknowledging them positively and supporting their individual capacities. A two-factor structure of the ReSpect scale Part A and a four-factor structure of the Part B were confirmed. Findings from this study suggest that older hospital patients perceived respect by nurses overall, but the area where there is the most room for improvement is that of listening and encouraging. The psychometric analysis demonstrated that the ReSpect scale shows promise in measuring respect. The ReSpect scale could be a useful tool to measure respect, an important element of value-based health care.

In line with worldwide changing demographics, conditions for older people in need of home care are changing. In Sweden there is a stay-in-place policy and older people are expected to live and be cared for in their own home as long as possible. Home care, instituted by different laws, is a challenge affecting the older person when the private home becomes a workplace. This study uses a qualitative design with a lifeworld approach. The study having been conducted in Sweden in 2016, the researchers interviewed 12 older persons that live alone and receive home care. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. The findings illustrate four sub-themes: adapting to a caring culture, feeling exposed, unable to influence care and forced relations. The overall theme reveals that older people experience a life-changing situation when receiving home care and they become a guest in their own home. Becoming older with increased needs means to disrupt one's life when one's private home becomes a public arena. The gap between an older person's rights by law and the older person's experiences of receiving home care needs to be highlighted to meet the oncoming challenges in providing a home care that includes participation of the older themselves. Only then can care be offered that enables older people to have a sense of control and experience their home as their own. The findings emphasise the need to view older people as being self-determinant and independent. Older people receiving home care need to be seen as individuals, and their entire life situation should be considered by also acknowledging the important role played by relatives and caregivers.

Unregulated care providers in Canada assist older adults with personal support and activities of daily living in a variety of care settings. As the care needs of an aging population become increasingly complex, the role of unregulated care providers in healthcare delivery has also evolved. Currently, many unregulated care providers are performing tasks previously performed by regulated health professionals, with potential implications for quality of care and patient safety. Information is fragmented on the role, education and employment standards of unregulated care providers. A scoping review was conducted following the methods outlined by Arksey and O'Malley (International Journal of Social Research Methodology, 8, 2005, 19) and Levac, Colquhoun, and O'Brien (Implementation Science, 5, 2010, 69). An iterative search of published and grey literature was conducted from January 2000 to September 2016 using Medline, CINAHL, SCOPUS and Google. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to identify relevant studies published in English. The search yielded 63 papers for review. Results highlight the evolving role of unregulated care providers, a lack of recognition and a lack of authority for unregulated care provider decision-making in patient care. Unregulated care providers do not have a defined scope of practice. However, their role has evolved to include activities previously performed by regulated professionals. Variations in education and employment standards have implications for quality of care and patient safety. Unregulated care providers are part of an important workforce in the long-term care and community sectors in Canada. Their evolving role should be recognised and efforts made to leverage their experience on interprofessional teams and reduce variations in education and employment standards. This study highlights the evolving role of unregulated care providers in Canada and presents a set of recommendations for implementation at micro, meso, and macro policy levels. ","255":"To gain an in-depth understanding of the decision-making processes involved in the discharge of older people admitted to hospital from home and discharged to a care home, as described in the case records. The decision for an older person to move into a care home is significant and life-changing. The discharge planning literature for older people highlights the integral role of nurses in supporting and facilitating effective discharge. However, little research has been undertaken to explore the experiences of those discharged from hospital to a care home or the processes involved in decision-making. A purposive sample of 10 cases was selected from a cohort of 100 individuals admitted to hospital from home and discharged to a care home. Cases were selected to highlight important personal, relational and structural factors thought to affect the decision-making process. Narrative case studies were created and were thematically analysed to explore the perspectives of each stakeholder group and the conceptualisations of risk which influenced decision-making. Care home discharge decision-making is a complex process involving stakeholders with a range of expertise, experience and perspectives. Decisions take time and considerable involvement of families and the multidisciplinary team. There were significant deficits in documentation which limit the understanding of the process and the patient's voice is often absent from case records. The experiences of older people, families and multidisciplinary team members making care home decisions in the hospital setting require further exploration to identify and define best practice. Nurses have a critical role in the involvement of older people making discharge decisions in hospital, improved documentation of the patient's voice is essential. Health and social care systems must allow older people time to make significant decisions about their living arrangements, adapting to changing medical and social needs. ","256":null,"257":"The aim of this study was to clarify the concept of self-care among older people living with chronic health conditions. This concept clarification will assist nurses in addressing self-care among older people through research, policy and practice in offering an expanded conceptual model. Several policy influences over the past decade directly relate to the increased importance and economic necessity to require self-directed care for older people living with chronic health conditions to maintain their care at home in the community. A selective review of literature on the concept of self-care included 31 sources. The Norris Concept Clarification method (1982) was used for clarification. The phenomenon is described historically according to its antecedents, attributes and consequences. A proposed definition is provided based on the clarification of this concept. A conceptual model is presented through an ecological framework. Self-care among older people living with chronic conditions is multidimensional and has multilevel influences (individual, community, system levels) and is mediated by the contexts and processes of ageing. Self-care originates along one's life course and is learned. Self-care responses are based on care needs when living with chronic health conditions. Self-care is an individual capacity, disposition and activity older people manifest in living with multiple chronic conditions. These features (capacity, disposition, action) influence one another and are hierarchical and continuous. Research, practice and policies that promote self-care among older people can focus on these features to improve health outcomes and promote new models of care consistent with personal development and chronic care needs in older age. This concept clarification can offer a model to support self-care among older people living with chronic conditions. ","258":"Care of older adults in the community is becoming increasingly complex. However, nursing staff often has insufficient knowledge and skills to adequately address the needs of frail older adults. There is therefore a need for nurses with advanced qualifications. To meet this need, advanced geriatric nursing has been introduced in Norway. This study aimed to describe the experiences of nurses with their new role as advanced geriatric nurses in care of older adults and to determine what strategies the nurses considered important in the development of their new role. This study applied a descriptive, exploratory design. In-depth interviews were conducted with 21 nurses who had undergone an educational programme to become advanced geriatric nurses in Norway in 2016. Content analysis was used to analyse the data. The participants described a complex and extensive nursing role, which they related to a new understanding of the patients, relatives and the system in which they worked. This new gaze had developed based on a combination of their new knowledge, their skills, experiences and professional interests. The opportunities to use their role depended on their workplace conditions. They related to contextual challenges at their workplace in different ways to optimise the use of their new gaze. Common for all participants was a broader and deeper understanding of the patient's health and life situation, which guided participants' actions. The key issue in developing the new role was developing effective strategies to foster role integration. Advanced geriatric nurses should collaborate with their managers to create a role that takes advantage of their knowledge and skills, as well as collaborate with colleagues to enhance understanding of utilisation of their role. ","259":"The purpose of this study was to describe healthcare providers' experiences, knowledge and attitudes in relation to the assessment of oral health in older adults. Oral health is an important element in the care of older adults. An increasing proportion of older people need the help and support of community-based healthcare services, which are responsible for providing oral health assessment for this group. Although oral care is an important part of nursing care, studies show that it is often an overlooked area in the care of older people. An inductive qualitative description design was used. The participating healthcare providers were selected from a municipality in western Sweden. Purposeful sampling was employed and data were collected through focus-group interviews and were analysed with content analysis. The analysis resulted in four categories: healthcare providers' knowledge and attitudes to oral health; routines affect flexibility; challenges in assessing and performing oral care and ethical dilemmas. The results showed that oral health was neglected because of several factors. Lack of knowledge, inadequate procedures and time constraints were most prominent. The healthcare providers' own attitudes affected the performing of oral health assessments. Ethical dilemmas related to the attitudes of those people in receipt of care and their relatives, and their integrity and autonomy, could be seen as complicating factors. The healthcare providers expressed that they did not have the necessary knowledge of oral health that was required in their area of responsibility. In addition, they described their own attitudes as being important when attending to the patients' oral health. The healthcare providers themselves identified lack of knowledge and their own attitudes as being especially important factors in the oral care of older adults, and further research in this area is needed. ","260":"","261":"In this study, we describe the development of evidence- and theory-based fall prevention educational material and its evaluation from the users' perspectives. To reduce risk factors for falling in nursing homes, nursing staff must enact multifactorial fall prevention intervention programmes. A core component of these programmes is to educate residents and their family members, both verbally and in a written form. However, users can only benefit from educational material if it is based on current scientific evidence, easy to understand and process and customised. We followed a structured procedure during the development process, while considering various aspect of quality. To assess the understandability and usefulness of the resulting educational materials, we conducted a qualitative content analysis study. The educational materials development process incorporated several iterative steps including a systematic literature search and the application of frameworks for designing and writing the materials. To evaluate the material, we performed six focus group discussions separately with residents, family members and nursing staff from two nursing homes (total of 32 participants). Residents' brochures included clear information on avoiding external risks as well as coping strategies after a fall event. Family members' brochures were more comprehensive, including both concrete tips and outlining the advantages and disadvantages of interventions. Residents and family members had no difficulties understanding the material and tried to apply the content to their individual situations. Nursing staff commented on some ambiguities and incongruities relating to current nursing care practice. By involving users in the development of evidence-based educational materials, nursing staff can achieve a high acceptance rate for the materials and motivate users to address the topic. The involvement of users is essential for developing educational material that meets users' needs.

To (i) describe person-related conditions among older people in STC, (ii) describe and compare perceptions of the quality of oral care (including perceptions of care received and the subjective importance of such care), within and between older people who have the ability to perform oral self-care and those who are dependent on help with oral care and (iii) examine the relationship between person-related conditions and the quality of oral care. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 391 older people in STC units in Sweden based on self-reported questionnaire and clinical assessments. The older people were assessed as having normal oral health (2%), moderate oral health problems (78%) or severe oral health problems (20%). When comparing older people's perceptions of quality of oral care in terms of perceived reality and subjective importance, significant differences appeared within and between groups. Psychological well-being had a significant relationship with perception of the quality of oral care (both perceived reality and subjective importance), and gender and oral health status had a significant relationship with subjective importance. Older people's perceptions of areas for improvement regarding quality of oral care is a new and important knowledge for nursing staff in STC units. Older people want personalised information regarding oral health and oral care. Registered Nurses who take the responsibility in nursing care for older people's oral health may avoid unnecessary suffering by older people caused by oral health problems. Older people's perspective is an important component for quality work and might lead to improvements in the quality of oral care in STC.

Acute hospitals must meet the increasingly complex needs of older people who experience multiple comorbidities, often including cognitive impairment, either directly related to their admission or longer term conditions, including dementia. A focus on physical illness, efficiency and tasks within an acute care environment can all divert attention from the psychosocial well-being of patients. This focus also decreases capacity for person-centred approaches that acknowledge and value the older person, their life story, relationships and the care context. The importance of arts for health and wellness, including responsiveness to individual need, is well established: however, there is little evidence about its effectiveness for older people in acute hospital settings. We report on a collaborative arts in health programme on an acute medical ward for older people. The qualitative study used collaborative enquiry underpinned by a constructivist approach to evaluate an arts programme that involved participatory art-making activities, customised music, song and illustration work, and enlivening the unit environment. Data sources included observation of art activities, semi-structured interviews with patients and family members, and focus groups with staff. Data were transcribed and thematically analysed using a line by line approach. The programme had positive impacts for the environment, patients, families and staff. The environment exhibited changes as a result of programme outputs; patients and families were engaged and enjoyed activities that aided recovery from illness; and staff also enjoyed activities and importantly learnt new ways of working with patients. An acute care arts in health programme is a carefully nuanced programme where the skills of the arts health worker are critical to success. Utilising such skill, continued focus on person-centeredness and openness to creativity demonstrated positive impacts for patients, families, staff and the ward environment. This study affirms the contribution of an arts in health program for older persons in an acute care setting in challenging the dominance of a task based medical model and emphasising person-centred care and outcomes. ","265":"To describe and critically analyse the thinking that led to the concept of an association between incontinence, care dependence and elder abuse. Coercive or abusive continence care practices include chastising a person for their incontinence and overriding their attempts to resist continence care. Neglect in continence care is characterised by withholding or delaying responding to requests for help to maintain continence or to manage incontinence, and restricting a person's access to toileting assistance, incontinence aids or hygiene care. Contemporary biomedical understandings about incontinence and influencing concepts from the fields of sociology, psychology and nursing were analysed to inform the design of a conceptual model that elucidates possible associations between incontinence, care dependence and elder abuse. Ideas generated from an analysis of the concepts led to the development of a model termed the \"Model of Attributes to Abuse of Dependent Elders in Continence Care\" (MADE-CC). The MADE-CC theorises factors that cause and contribute to abuse in continence care. Carer factors include physical and emotional exhaustion, frustration related to the inability to control or predict incontinence, resentment associated with constraints imposed by care dependence, disgust associated with physical contact with urine\/faeces, limited knowledge and skills about incontinence and ethical conflicts concerning care. Care recipient factors include frequent and severe incontinence, cognitive impairment and a history of physical or psychological trauma. Social factors that are theorised include the stigmatised nature of incontinence, social taboos and cultural norms and the private nature of continence care. The MADE-CC illuminates the potential risk of elder abuse posed by incontinence and care dependence. It should be used to improve ethical care of older people and stimulate debate about everyday ethics in the care of older people who are care dependent and to optimise their participation in decisions about their health and well-being. Nurses and carers should be aware of the multiple interrelated factors that contribute to the risk of elder abuse in the caregiving encounter, including the role of emotions.

Challenges experienced when supporting people with advanced dementia who express problematic behaviours include understanding their needs and ensuring a dignified life for them. Data were gathered using an ethnographic approach based on participatory observation. Nussbaum's capability approach was then used as a framework for the analysis. Four women diagnosed with advanced dementia who also expressed problematic behaviours were recruited from a nursing home in Northern Sweden. The data collection was performed during 2015. Individuals with advanced dementia had difficulties in participating in the planning of their lives and achieving the human capability of practical reasoning. They were also at risk of being placed outside the social group, thus hindering them from attaining the human capability of affiliation. A dignified life for individuals with advanced dementia requires nursing staff to be present and to provide adapted support to ensure that the individual can actually pursue human capabilities. Creating opportunities for the human capabilities of practical reasoning and affiliation is essential as they permeate all other human capabilities. For these individuals, it was crucial not only to create opportunities for human capabilities but also to attend to their expressions and needs and to guide and steer them towards a dignified life. The normative structure of the capability approach described by Nussbaum can ensure that nursing staffs move beyond fulfilling patients' basic needs to consider other capabilities vital for a dignified life.

Among the plethora of available self-report pain assessment tools, there is no synthetised evidence which tools are indicated for use among cognitively intact older adults. To understand documented self-report pain assessment tools that have been used among cognitively intact older adults, and to describe their characteristics including overall performance as well as studies demonstrating their use. A systematic search of the indexed databases PubMed, PsycINFO and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL Plus) was conducted to identify documented self-report pain assessment tools through peer-reviewed papers, including citations from January 1990 to December 2015. Thirty-five percentage of abstracts were independently evaluated by two raters according to specific criteria. Among identified tools, the Iowa Pain Thermometer, the 6-point Verbal Descriptor Scale, the Numeric Rating Scale, the short form Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and the Geriatric Pain Measure (GPM) may be suitable tools for self-reported pain by cognitively intact older adults based on the statement of the literature. Only two self-report tools (the GPM and the Geriatric Painful Events Inventory) were designed specifically for older adults. More studies are needed to evaluate pain measures' psychometric performance across different settings, racial\/ethnic groups and disease categories. Since 80% of older adults have at least one chronic disease, multidimensional tools such as the GPM may need to be used more often for accurate self-report of pain. Examining the psychometric properties of comprehensive self-report pain assessment tools informs recommendations for the selection of tools to be used in clinical practice.

Decreased mobility in advanced ageing is further reduced when entering a residential care facility. Interventions such as the sit-to-stand activity have been shown to have a positive effect on the mobility of older people. There is evidence to suggest that healthcare aides are able to support residents to complete the sit-to-stand activity as part of their daily work routines; however, little is known about how healthcare aides actually do this with residents living in residential care. A qualitative interview study included seven purposively sampled HCAs working in residential care facilities. Semistructured interviews were analysed using inductive qualitative content analysis. The HCAs' experience with the sit-to-stand activity was represented by the following four categories: Resident participation, Feeling misunderstood and disrespected, Time and workload, and Management involvement. HCAs identified three strategies to help them support residents to complete the sit-to-stand activity: Motivating residents, Completing activity in a group and Using time management skills. HCAs reported some encouragement from managers and cooperation from residents to complete the sit-to-stand activity with residents; however, they also felt constrained by time limitations and workload demands and they felt misunderstood and disrespected. HCAs were able to identify several strategies that helped them to integrate the sit-to-stand activity into their daily routines. This study highlights the challenges and supportive factors of implementing the sit-to-stand activity into the daily work routine of HCAs. The study also identifies the strategic role of nurse managers when implementing interventions in residential care facilities. ","275":"The purpose of this study was to explore the meaning of patient-nurse interaction for older women receiving care in healthcare settings. Older women are often overlooked or misunderstood by the nurses caring for them. Some research exists on nurses' perception of their interaction with patients, yet few studies have described the meaning of such interaction from the patients' perspective. This was a pilot study using qualitative description as a methodology. Data were filtered through a lens of critical feminist theory to interpret interactions taking place in healthcare settings that are often characterised by paternalism. Seven women between the ages of 66 and 81 were interviewed using a semi-structured guide. Participants had a distinctive perspective on the experience of caring. Their expressions include stories of being cared for themselves by nurses as well as historical recalls of being the one-caring for family members. In these combined stories, the contrast between the nurses who held caring in primacy and those who were distinctly uncaring sheds light on the importance of cultivating a moral ideal of caring and respect for personhood. A population of older women who potentially face disabling conditions must rely on direct, meaningful, interaction with nurses to successfully navigate the healthcare system. The findings suggest that these women did not have consistent access to such interaction. The gathering and interpretation of new narratives about patient-nurse interaction for older women could lead to a deeper understanding of power and civility as it impacts a caring relationship. Further research using a theoretical lens of critical feminism has implications for improving healthcare delivery for older women worldwide.

It then introduces the gerontological nurse and researcher to the Our Voice framework for engaging older people as citizen scientists in order to empower them as agents of change in improving their local built environment and ultimately advancing community health. Community-level strategies to promote successful ageing in place are critical both to optimising health outcomes and containing healthcare costs. Such strategies must take into account the influence of the built environment both on individual health behaviours and on overall community health. At the same time, the perspectives and experiences of older people themselves ought to inform policies and practices in a systematic way. Integrative literature review. A wide scan of English language articles published in the EMBASE, PubMed and CINAHL bibliographic databases was conducted. Additional articles were sourced by mining relevant reference lists (i.e., snowball sampling). Papers included were published between 2005 and 2016. Three distinct components emerged from the review: the impact of the built environment on health-in particular the health of older persons; citizen science and its applicability for older people research; and the promise of the Our Voice citizen science framework to activate changes in the built environment that improve older peoples' health. The ageing of the world's population brings with it an increased population-level risk of chronic disease and disability. We present the Our Voice framework, developed by researchers at Stanford University, as a promising strategy for engaging and empowering older people as citizen scientists, as a framework to apply to gerontological nursing and improving community health. Gerontology nurses are encouraged to: (i) Recognise the impact of the built environment and other community-level factors on the health of their patients. (ii) Encourage older adults to take an active role in documenting features of their environments that promote or hinder healthy living. (iii) Support policies and programmes that promote healthy environments.

The healthcare system cannot rely solely upon nurses' prelicensure education to prepare them to meet the evolving needs of hospitalised older patients. Over the past decade, there has been a dramatic rise in the proportion of older people in hospitals, yet many nurses do not have specialised knowledge about the unique care needs of this population. A multimethod pre-to post-design was employed. Between September 2013 and April 2014, data were collected via surveys, focus groups and interviews. Thirty-two Registered Nurses initially enrolled in the programme of which 22 completed all data points. Three managers also participated in interviews. One-way repeated-measures ANOVAs were conducted to evaluate the effect of the programme and change over time. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis. Survey results indicated improvements in perceptions about nursing care of older people but no changes in knowledge. Themes generated from the qualitative data focused on participants' experiences of taking part in the programme and included: (i) relevance of content and delivery mode, (ii) value of participating in the programme and (iii) continuing education in the context of acute care. This study illustrated the potential role of workplace continuing education in improving care for hospitalised older people, particularly the potential to change nurses' perceptions about this population. Nurses prefer learning opportunities that are varied in delivery of educational elder-focused content and accessible at work. Organisational leaders need to consider strategies that minimise potential barriers to workplace continuing education. Workplace continuing education can play a key role in improving quality of care for hospitalized older adults and ought to be a priority for employers planning education for nurses. ","284":"Within contemporary medical practice, Parkinson's disease (PD) is treated using a biomedical, neurological approach, which although bringing numerous benefits can struggle to engage with how people with PD experience the disease. A bio-psycho-social approach has not yet been established in PD; however, bio-psycho-social approaches adopted within dementia care practice could bring significant benefit to PD care. This paper summarises existing bio-psycho-social models of dementia care and explores how these models could also usefully be applied to care for PD. Specifically, this paper adapts the bio-psycho-social model for dementia developed by Spector and Orrell (), to suggest a bio-psycho-social model, which could be used to inform routine care in PD. Drawing on the biopsychosocial model of Dementia put forward by Spector and Orrell (), this paper explores the application of a bio-psycho-social model of PD. This model conceptualises PD as a trajectory, in which several interrelated fixed and tractable factors influence both PD's symptomology and the various biological and psychosocial challenges individuals will face as their disease progresses. Using an individual case study, this paper then illustrates how such a model can assist clinicians in identifying suitable interventions for people living with PD. This model concludes by discussing how a bio-psycho-social model could be used as a tool in PD's routine care. The model also encourages the development of a theoretical and practical framework for the future development of the role of the PD specialist nurse within routine practice. A biopsychosocial approach to Parkinson's Disease provides an opportunity to move towards a holistic model of care practice which addresses a wider range of factors affecting people living with PD. The paper puts forward a framework through which PD care practice can move towards a biopsychosocial perspective. PD specialist nurses are particularly well placed to adopt such a model within routine clinical practice, and should therefore be encouraged within PD services.

Aggressive behaviour symptoms among older people living with dementia are reported to be prevalent. As aggressive behaviour includes both verbal and physical behaviours, such as kicking, hitting and screaming, it causes an increased burden on formal caregivers. Professionals experiencing this aggression perceived it as challenging, causing physical and psychological damage, leading to anger, stress and depression. A systematic review was conducted. A search of published research studies between 2000 and 2015 was conducted using appropriate search terms. Eleven studies were identified and included in this review. The analysis resulted in four categories: formal caregivers' views on triggers of aggression, expressions of aggression, the effect of aggressive behaviours on formal caregivers and formal caregivers' strategies to address aggression. The results show that aggressive behaviour may lead to negative feelings in formal caregivers and nursing home residents. The results of this study suggest that having the ability to identify triggers possibly assists caregivers with addressing aggressive behaviour. Aggressive behaviour might also affect quality of care. Results from this systematic review indicate that caregivers prefer person-centred strategies to handle aggressive behaviour among older people, while the use of pharmaceuticals and coercion strategies is a last resort.

This will contribute new insights into how falling is perceived by the older community. Falls are a major problem for older people and healthcare services across the world. Accidental falls in the community are a persistent problem that is generally recognised as an intrinsic risk of ageing. This review provides a new synthesis of evidence that considers older people's perception of falls in the community as new insights are needed if the increasing problems of falls are to be addressed. Synthesis of the qualitative literature employing Noblit and Hare's method of reciprocal translation. CINAHL, Medline, EMBASE, PsychINFO and BNI were searched 1999-2015. Noblit and Hare's method of reciprocal translations was used to conceive this meta-ethnographic synthesis. The ENTREQ statement was employed as a tool for reporting the synthesis of qualitative research. The PRISMA statement was used for reporting the different phase of the literature search, and the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme qualitative research checklist was used as an appraisal framework. Eleven papers fit the inclusion criteria and revealed a series of themes. These were falls as a threat to personal identity, falls as a threat to independence, falls as a threat to social interaction and carefulness as a protective strategy. Many older people reject the label of \"at risk of falling\" because of the perceived implication of dependency and incompetence. To be considered \"at risk\" of falling is perceived as threatening the identity of individuals who are comfortable maintaining their own independence. However, there are also those who accept the risk of falling and in doing so choose carefulness as a personal strategy to manage the risk. For the majority of older people, maintaining independence is the key motivator influencing their actions. Independence to pursue social interaction safeguards against loss of identity, social isolation and negative feelings of dependency. Falling in the community is a problem that persists, despite intervention of local health teams. This article contributes to a body of evidence on older people's experience of falling in the community with the aim of providing new insights for nurses as they approach the issues with patients. Management of falls risk improves through constructive, proactive health behaviour. Promoting a positive attitude towards living well encourages older people to engage in healthy, risk reducing behaviours. Older people reject the designation of \"at risk of falling\" due to a perceived association with dependency and incompetence. The negative association is a barrier to engaging at-risk populations with fall prevention interventions.

Cross-sectional study using 2009-2012 hospital risk-standardised 30-day readmission data for Medicare fee-for-service patients hospitalised for all three conditions and nursing home performance data from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services Five-Star Quality Rating System. Medicare-certified nursing homes and acute care hospitals. 12,542 nursing homes and 3,039 hospitals treating 30 or more Medicare fee-for-service patients for all three conditions across 2,032 hospital service areas in the United States. Community-specific hospital 30-day risk-standardised readmission rates. Community-specific nursing home performance measures: health inspection, staffing, Registered Nurses and quality performance; and an aggregated performance score. Mixed-effects models evaluated associations between nursing home performance and hospital 30-day risk-standardised readmission rates for all three conditions. The relationship between community-specific hospital risk-standardised readmission rates and community-specific overall nursing home performance was statistically significant for all three conditions. Increasing nursing home performance by one star resulted in decreases of 0.29% point (95% CI: 0.12-0.47), 0.78% point (95% CI: 0.60-0.95) and 0.46% point (95% CI: 0.33-0.59) of risk-standardised readmission rates for AMI, HF and pneumonia, respectively. Among the specific measures, higher performance in nursing home overall staffing and Registered Nurse staffing measures was statistically significantly associated with lower hospital readmission rates for all three conditions. Notable geographic variation in the community-specific nursing home performance was observed. Community-specific nursing home performance is associated with community-specific hospital 30-day readmission rates for Medicare fee-for-service patients for acute myocardial infarction, heart failure or pneumonia. Coordinated care between hospitals and nursing homes is essential to reduce readmissions. Nursing homes can improve performance and reduce readmissions by increasing registered nursing homes. Further, communities can work together to create cross-continuum care teams comprised of hospitals, nursing homes, patients and their families, and other community-based service providers to reduce unplanned readmissions.

Involving patients in the development of the hospital environment can be a way to create more responsive services. To date, few studies have involved the direct voice of patients with dementia about their experiences of the hospital environment. Using an action research approach, we worked with patients with dementia and a team of interdisciplinary staff on a medical unit to improve dementia care. The insights provided by patients with dementia in the early phase shaped actions undertaken at the later stage to develop person-centred care within a medical ward. We used methods including go-along interviews, video recording and participant observation to enable rich data generation. This study explores the perspectives of patients with dementia about the hospital environment. The participants indicated that a supportive hospital environment would need to be a place of enabling independence, a place of safety, a place of supporting social interactions and a place of respect. Patient participants persuasively articulated the supportive and unsupportive elements in the environment that affected their well-being and care experiences. They provided useful insights and pointed out practical solutions for improvement. Action research offers patients not only opportunities to voice their opinion, but also possibilities to contribute to hospital service development. This is the first study that demonstrates the possibility of using go-along interviews and videoing with patients with dementia staying in a hospital for environmental redesign. Researchers, hospital leaders and designers should further explore strategies to best support the involvement of patients with dementia in design and redesign of hospital environments. ","292":"To investigate what prevents undergraduate nursing students from choosing gerontological nursing as a career option. This study utilised an integrative literature review, which allows the inclusion of previous studies with diverse research designs to gain a broader view of the reasons why nursing students do not choose a gerontological nursing career. An electronic database search of CINAHL (Ebsco), Scopus and Eric elicited 251 scientific peer-reviewed empirical studies, published from 2006 to March 2016 in English. After meeting the inclusion criteria, 97 qualified for closer examination. Following exclusion, the final analysis and synthesis included 21 articles. Four main themes described nursing students' contributing reasons for not selecting gerontological nursing as a career option: socio-demographic factors; experiences, perceptions and knowledge about ageing; perceptions concerning the nature or status of gerontological nursing; and theoretical studies and practical education of nursing curriculum. Lack of positive experiences with older people before and during nursing students' studies led to their disinterest in gerontological nursing as a career option. The nursing curriculum also reinforces the perception of modern nursing as technical, with more emphasis on acute and critical care. The findings emphasise the need to implement an age-friendly curriculum and have nurses that specialise in gerontology to serve as mentors and role models. It is important to assist nursing students in identifying the potentials for career advancement in terms of gerontological nursing. There is also a need for nursing faculties to liaise with other stakeholders to develop or improve upon the clinical atmosphere for nursing students during gerontological nursing placement. Nursing faculties must review their curriculum to ensure that there is sufficient focus on the needs of older people within the curriculum for every student. Furthermore, respected role models who are knowledgeable and enthusiastic about issues related to older people must teach gerontological nursing courses. ","293":"Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are very common among older people, and previous studies showed that BPSD affects eating behaviour negatively, possibly resulting in undernutrition. In a previous study, we constructed a set of 11 items based on direct observations of older people with dementia during mealtime and named them 'SSADE: signs and symptoms accompanying dementia while eating'. This study aimed to conduct a factor analysis to clarify the structure of the set of 11 SSADE items and to analyse the relationship of the SSADE with nutritional status. We sampled 259 older people from 14 institutional facilities in Japan. To assess the status of the SSADE, we quantified each item according to its frequency and severity, using a 5-point scale. We also collected information regarding characteristics and nutritional status (body mass index [BMI], dietary intakes, body weight change, serum albumin level). We performed an exploratory factor analysis on the SSADE. In addition, associations between grouped factor scores and nutritional status were analysed. Exploratory factor analysis indicated four factors. 'Hypoactivity' including 'dietary agnosia' and 'drowsiness' correlated negatively with BMI and serum albumin levels. 'Hyperactivity' including 'agitation', 'delusion', 'wandering' and 'eating too rapidly' correlated negatively with BMI. 'Obsessiveness' including 'food refusal' and 'fad eating' correlated negatively with BMI, dietary intake and body weight change. 'Aberrant behaviours' including 'eating apraxia', 'pica' and 'stealing food' correlated positively with dietary intake. The identified factors of the SSADE were related to nutritional status, which may suggest acceptable factorial validity. We expected the SSADE to contribute to the prevention and improvement of undernutrition, through the development of a concrete strategy for nutritional care planning by professional teams including dietitians in long-term care facilities.

Nurse researchers have demonstrated that older person who age in place have better physical, psychological and cognitive outcomes. Less, however, is known about older persons who are \"aging out of place,\" meaning out of their country of origin. With the growth of home health care, there is a need to understand the older immigrants' meaning of home when ageing out of their country of origin. An inductive, qualitative descriptive research design was used. Seventeen Hispanic participants, ranging in age from 65 to 83 years were interviewed using a semi-structured interview protocol. Two major finding of the study focused on participants' descriptions of home in their country of origin and in the USA. The majority of participants described their home in their native country as the community, countryside or town (pueblo) and in the U.S.A. as family. The level of social isolation and loneliness among participants was evident. Older Hispanic immigrants who are \"aging out of place\" integrate their past experiences of sense of place in their native country with their present experiences of home in the USA. The need to understand the role of the community and the family in the provision of nursing care in the home may be more important than the physical structure or setting in which it is delivered. Further intra- and cross-national studies are needed to provide a framework for understanding the issues of ageing and immigration globally. Gerontological nurses need to recognise the complexity of family relationships for older Hispanic persons who are ageing out of place of origin and their risk of depression, social isolation, and loneliness. ","295":"The aim of this secondary qualitative descriptive analysis was to examine how nurses construct a definition of older peoples' safety risks and provide care while working within organisational contexts that are focused on diminishing patient risks. Numbers of older patients are increasing in acute hospital contexts-contexts that place their focus on patient safety. Nurses need to manage tensions between older peoples' risks, evidence-informed practice decisions, limited resources and organisational emphases on patient falls. To date, their practice dilemmas have not been well examined. A secondary qualitative descriptive analysis was conducted using data that were collected between June 2010 and May 2011 to examine nursing practice with hospitalised older people. All field notes and transcribed data were reviewed to generate themes representing 18 Registered Nurses' perceptions about safe care for hospitalised older people. The first author generated categories that described how nurses construct definitions of safety risks for older people. All authors engaged in an iterative analytic process that resulted in themes capturing nurses' efforts to provide care in limited resource environments while considering older peoples' safety risks. Nurses constructed definitions of patient safety risks in the context of institutional directives. Nurses provided care using available resources as efficiently as possible and accessing co-worker support. They also minimised the importance of older people's functional abilities by setting priorities for medically delegated tasks and immobilising their patients to reduce their risks. Nurses' definitions of patient risk, which were shaped by impoverished institutional resources and nurses' lack of valuing of functional abilities, contributed to suboptimal care for older adults. Nurses' definitions of risk as physical injury reduced their attention to patients' functional abilities, which nurses reported suffered declines as a result. Leaders need to examine how organisational emphases on particular areas of patient safety and resource constraints contribute to suboptimal care of older people. Nurses understanding of patient risk must incorporate older patients' functional abilities. ","296":"To evaluate the impact of the CCSEP on care home staff in two care settings for older people in one nursing home and one residential home. Care homes provide personal care and accommodation for older people. The English Dementia Strategy aims to improve the quality of service provision for people with dementia. This includes specific mention of improving the quality of life in care homes and as such includes objectives related to developing the workforce knowledge and skills. The Ladder to the Moon Culture Change Studio Engagement Programme (CCSEP) is a staff training approach based on the Positive Psychology framework that uses theatre- and film-based activities. This study used a wait-list controlled design. However, the data analysis plan was amended to reflect difficulties in data collection, and a quasi-experimental case study approach was consequently utilised. Outcome measures for staff attitudes and beliefs were as follows: Sense of Competence in Dementia Care Staff; Approaches to Dementia Questionnaire; Job Satisfaction Index; Brief Learning Transfer System Inventory; and Scale of Positive and Negative Experience. The Quality of Interaction Schedule (QUIS) was used to observe changes in staff-resident interaction. Fifty staff in two care homes completed the questionnaires and forty-one undertook formal CCSEP training. In Home A (nursing home), there was no significant change in any of the measures. In Home B (residential home), the QUIS showed an increase in positive interactions post intervention; a significant increase in the Building Relationship subscale of Sense of Competence; and a significant increase in staff sense of hopefulness towards people with dementia. The Brief Learning Transfer System Inventory showed a significant decrease post-intervention. The intervention did not significantly affect the happiness or job satisfaction of care home staff. The results of this study provide tentative evidence about the efficacy of this staff training programme. Some significant improvement in staff attitudes to people with dementia, staff sense of competence and positive staff-resident interactions were found in one of two homes. It is likely that the organisational problems affecting the other care home limited the implementation and therefore efficacy of the intervention there. The results therefore suggest that when a supportive management structure is in place, CCSEP may be more effective in improving staff attitudes, sense of competence and interactions with residents.

The aim of this integrative review was to identify the competence needed for older people nursing in licensed practical nurses' and registered nurses' work in care and nursing homes. Integrative literature review. We performed an integrative review using Whittemore and Knafl's method. The CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, SocINDEX and Scopus databases were searched for studies published from 2006 to April 2016. We assessed the quality of the studies using Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools and analysed the data by applying qualitative content analysis. Ten articles were included in the review. Most of the studies focused on registered nurses' work. We identified five competence areas that are needed for older people nursing in registered nurses' work in care and nursing homes: attitudinal and ethical, interactional, evidence-based care, pedagogical, and leadership and development competence. Empirical evidence of competence requirements related to licensed practical nurses' work in these facilities was scarce. The competence required for registered nurses and licensed practical nurses should be clearly identified to support competence management in the care and nursing home context. Well-educated nursing staff are needed in care and nursing homes to provide high-quality care because comprehensive and advanced nurse competence is required to meet the needs of older people.

All the interviews were recorded and typed, and conventional qualitative content analysis was used, eliciting common themes. There were four common themes: communication isolation, resource change, monotone institutional life and negative emotional response. Participants lost their previous support systems when transitioning to an aged care home and were not able to establish new ones. Routine care was provided by formal caregivers with little attention to individual needs, and minimal support was given to help maintain the older person's independence. These losses gave rise to negative emotions in some of the participants, depending on their previous lifestyle and accommodation arrangements. The extent and intensity of psychosocial changes occurring in most of the participants following their transition to an aged care home indicates the need for a review of Iranian aged care services. To assist older Iranian people adapt more readily when making the transition to aged care home and to meet their unique psychosocial needs, a family-centred approach to service delivery is recommended.

A move to and a life in a nursing home while being close to death is a reality for many older people in Sweden. Being able to express thoughts and feelings about death has been described as both crucial for sustaining personhood as well as for establishing a meaningful existence at the end of life. Important are the experiences of older people living in nursing homes who are approaching death. Six older people were interviewed on one to four occasions. A total of 16 interviews were conducted with the participants. An interpretative approach was chosen. The main interpretation, Feeling lonely in an unfamiliar place, is based on three themes (i) Waiting for death, with the subthemes death as a release and thinking of oneself as dead; (ii) Subordinate oneself to values and norms of the staff, with the subthemes feeling offended and feeling trapped; and (iii) Keep the courage up. The older people's lives were characterised by feelings of aloneness in an unfamiliar place which contributed to a sense of existential loneliness. They experienced few opportunities to discuss their thoughts of life and death, including preparations for passing away. It is of importance for professionals to be able to meet older people as they are and respect them as human beings in their transitions, before, during and after the move to a nursing home. It is important to find ways to support older people's wellbeing and identity near death. ","310":"","311":null,"312":null,"313":"There is a recognised need to improve staff training in care homes. The aim of this study was to conduct a qualitative evaluation of the Ladder to the Moon Culture Change Studio Engagement Programme (CCSEP), a staff training programme aimed at enhancing staff-resident communication. Focus groups were conducted with residents able to provide consent; staff and relatives and managers were interviewed in two care homes. A theoretical framework was developed to interpret the impact of CCSEP using Framework Analysis. Residents noted that the programme appeared to result in staff interacting more with them, as well as enjoying working together as a team. Staff reported an improved sense of teamwork, developing more positive attitudes towards residents, as well as their concerns about using theatrical techniques in the care setting. Relatives identified care home organisational aspects as being barriers to implementation, and some regarded CCSEP simply as 'entertainment' rather than 'creative care'. This study provides an insight into the potential of this staff training programme to improve staff-resident interactions. However, participants' varying views of CCSEP highlight the need to brief staff, residents and relatives before implementation so as to enable full understanding of the aim. ","314":"The purpose of this study was to explore how nurses provide bedtime oral hygiene care, how they decide on interventions provided, and what factors influence their ability to provide oral care. Current evidence links poor oral hygiene to systemic and infectious diseases such as pneumonia. Hospitalised patients, who now retain their teeth into older adulthood, often rely on nurses to provide oral hygiene care. Nurses have the potential to impact oral health outcomes and quality of life by controlling plaque. However, oral hygiene care practices of nurses in postacute hospital settings are relatively unknown. A qualitative, exploratory multiple-case study was conducted with 25 nurses working on five inpatient units at different hospitals. Nurses were accompanied on their evening rounds to observe oral care practices, the physical environment and workflow. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the case study data including transcripts of guided conversations, field notes and documents. Within-case analysis was followed by cross-case analysis. Findings indicate that (i) nurses often convey oral hygiene care to their patients as being optional; (ii) nurses are inclined to preserve patient autonomy in oral hygiene care; (iii) oral hygiene care is often spontaneous and variable, and may not be informed by evidence; and (iv) oral hygiene care is not embedded into bedtime care routines. Oral hygiene care is discretionary and often missed care. Nurses need knowledge of the health benefits of oral care, and skills related to assessment and approaches to oral care. Availability of effective products and supplies facilitates provision of oral care. The evidence for oral hygiene care practices, outcomes of nurse-administered oral care and nursing's role in influencing the oral health literacy of patients require further study.

Physically and psychologically aggressive behaviour symptoms by older people with dementia have been associated with occupational stress among care workers in the United States and other Western countries and may contribute to staff turnover. However, few studies related to this issue have been conducted in Japan, where care worker reaction to physically and psychologically aggressive behaviour symptoms might be different because of cultural and customary differences in how care is provided for older people. This study reports on the results of three open-ended questions that were part of a larger study that explored Japanese care workers' experiences with aggressive behaviour symptoms in persons with dementia. Convenience sampling was used to recruit 137 care workers in 10 nursing homes in the northern and western areas of Japan. The answers to the open-ended questions were analysed using a content analysis. Most of the participants indicated that they believed that physically and psychologically aggressive behaviour symptoms came from residents' stress from dementia. Approximately, one-fourth of the participants responded that Japanese values such as chu (loyalty) and joge (hierarchy) influenced their work with residents with physically and psychologically aggressive behaviour symptoms. Seventeen participants (12%) commented either that they respected older people or that they respected older people as persons who had had many experiences in life. Interestingly, 43 responses (41.0%) indicated that physically and psychologically aggressive behaviour symptoms influenced quality of care positively, while, not surprisingly, about 30 responses indicated that those behaviour symptoms influenced quality of care negatively. Findings from this study indicate that the training and education needs to focus on understand and preventing the effects of stress for individuals living with dementia to reduce aggressive incidents and increase recruitment and retention of care workers.

The perception of personal control plays a critical role in an older person's health and well-being. Little is known about factors that facilitate or hinder older people's autonomous decision-making in their own homes. The study has been carried out as a literature review. The following databases were used: CINAHL, PubMed, PsykInfo, Cochrane, SweMed, Embase. Research studies range from 2009 to 2014. The review includes 12 publications. Four core themes are generated: older person's autonomy in their own home; autonomy and relationship; the balance between autonomy and dependency; older people's autonomy and the organisation of home care. Older people have a strong inner drive to maintain autonomy in their own home. The autonomy is challenged when the person becomes increasingly dependent on help. The relationship with carers is of vital importance with regard to the person's ability to make autonomous decisions. The organisation of home care restricts older people' scope for autonomy. Older people's own perspectives on autonomous decisions can contribute to the ongoing debate about how nursing care can be developed with respect to their autonomy. Nursing care demands attention to an older person's desire for autonomy despite dependency. A framework for systematic ethical discussions among carers may improve awareness about factors that facilitate or hinder good personalised care. The organisation of nursing care needs to be shaped in line with best practice for older people. ","321":"The aim of this review was to explore the concept of carer engagement in the hospital care of older people and to build theory to inform future research and practice. Carer engagement can help to improve the delivery and continuity of care provided to older people in hospital. However, definitions, guidance and structures for carer engagement in hospitals are lacking and there can be tensions and conflicts about the role of carers in hospitals. Integrative literature review. Literature searches identified 2745 peer-reviewed articles and studies published between January 1990 and November 2015 in the following databases: PubMed, Cochrane, Medline, EMBASE and CINHAL. After applying inclusion\/exclusion criteria, the sample (103 articles) was subject to thematic analysis. Current evidence on carer engagement is dispersed across different research literatures on clinical conditions and contexts. Six distinct components of carer engagement were identified: patient caregiving, information sharing, shared decision-making, carer support and education, carer feedback and patient care transitions. Hospitals can adopt a more consistent and comprehensive approach to carer engagement for older people by developing and supporting the different components of carer engagement identified. The integrated model of carer engagement developed here could help staff and hospitals to develop strategies, staff training and resources that work with rather than against carers. The findings can inform future research on carer engagement interventions and associated outcomes for patients, carers and staff. ","322":"To assess the effectiveness of health education programmes to improve foot self-care practices and foot problems among older people with diabetes. The complications of diabetes among older people are a major health concern. Foot problems such as neuropathy, ulcer and ultimately amputation are a great burden on older people with diabetes. Diabetes foot education programmes can influence the behaviour of older people in practising foot self-care and controlling the foot problems. However, the educational approaches used by the educators are different. Therefore, it is important to assess the education programmes from various evidence-based practices. Six databases, EBSCOhost medical collections (MEDLINE, CINAHL, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection), SAGE, Wiley Online Library, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink and Web of Science, were used to search for articles published from January 2000 to March 2015. The search was based on the inclusion criteria and keywords including 'foot', 'care' and 'diabetes'. Fourteen studies were assessed and reviewed in the final stage. Health education programmes varied according to their design, setting, approach, outcome measured and results. Foot assessment, verbal and written instructions and discussion were proved to improve the foot self-care and foot problems. Subsequent follow-ups and evaluations had a significant effect. An improvement was observed in foot self-care scores and foot problems (such as neuropathy, foot disability, lesion, ulcer, tinea pedis and callus grade) after implementation of the health education programme. The findings of this study support the claim that a health education programme increases the foot self-care scores and reduces the foot problems. However, there were certain methodological concerns in the reviewed articles, indicating the need for further evaluation. In future, researchers and practitioners must implement a vigorous education programme focusing on diabetes foot self-care among the older population.

The value of creative writing techniques as part of reflective practice in nursing and caring for older people with dementia needs further exploration. To introduce creative writing techniques to health professionals as part of dementia-related reflective practice. A local experienced author facilitated creative writing workshops with nine preregistration nursing students (general and mental health), one family carer and five care professionals working with people with dementia. The student nurses reported that the creative writing exercises felt more 'real' than the reflective practice models they had used in their academic and practical studies. Workshop participants also reported they had learnt some creative writing techniques to reduce work-related stress and anxiety. They also saw the impact of writing activities with people living with dementia, which can enable creativity and 'alleviate the common symptoms of depression and anxiety'. Creative writing techniques can support insightful, reflective dementia focused practice. Creative writing, as a tool in reflective practice, may enable health professionals and family carers to become confident and creative partners in older people's care. The added value, time and investment needed to introduce creative writing need to be articulated and acknowledged from within supervision and staffing teams.

Research indicates that lesbian, gay and bisexual older people experience significant health disparities. Yet there is a lack of understanding on what factors contribute to successful ageing in this population. Nursing has lagged behind other disciplines in investigating the health of lesbian, gay and bisexual older people. A concept analysis using Rodgers' evolutionary method. Twenty studies were retrieved by searching PubMed, CINAHL, PsycInfo, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Scopus for English-language peer-reviewed studies published from January 2004 to March 2014. The antecedents, attributes and consequences of the concept were identified through the Rodgers' method of concept analysis. Attributes included support from families of origin and\/or families of choice, access to lesbian, gay, and bisexual-friendly services and crisis competence. Self-realisation of lesbian, gay and bisexual identity (coming out to oneself) and age &gt;50 were identified as antecedents. Three consequences of successful ageing in lesbian, gay and bisexual older people were social engagement, optimism and resilience. Successful ageing in lesbian, gay and bisexual older people is defined as a subjective and multifactorial concept that is characterised by support from families of origin\/families of choice, access to lesbian, gay, and bisexual-friendly services and the development of crisis competence skills which impact the ageing experience of LGB individuals. Successful ageing models can provide a roadmap for developing culturally competent interventions to address key healthcare issues present in this population. The nursing profession's multidisciplinary knowledge and competence in providing health promotion makes nurses well positioned to take a leading role in reducing disparities of lesbian, gay and bisexual older people. ","332":"To gain a better understanding of nurses' perspectives on factors that influence their readiness to provide appropriate care for hospitalised older people. Hospitals have consistently been criticised for failing to address the unique, complex needs of older people. Research suggests that multiple issues have led to this situation, including a lack of educational preparation for nurses, limited attention to environmental factors, and an absence of organisational preparedness that ensures hospitals are adapted to meet the needs of older people. An exploratory, qualitative approach was used. Forty-one Registered Nurses participated (24 point-of-care nurses; 17 organisational leaders). Six focus groups and one individual interview were conducted. Thematic data analysis was employed to generate the main study findings. An overarching theme of 'Poor Fit' emerged. While participants identified the shifting needs of patients towards more complex and relational care, the broader organisational and societal contexts were, largely, unchanging. This resulted in nurses recognising the factors needed to be ready to care for older patients and their families, but working in hospitals that were not suited to these needs. The findings identify factors at the point-of-care, the organisational level, and in broader societal attitudes that shape nurses' readiness to care for hospitalised older people. However, many of these factors are modifiable and care for older people could be improved through quality improvement initiatives and nursing leadership. This study offers insight into ways to re-imagine nursing care that can be responsive to older people's complex needs in hospitals. With a growing contingent of hospitalised older people, it is imperative that nurses, who comprise the largest workforce in this setting, be included in the planning and delivery of healthcare services to ensure readiness to meet the needs of this population.

The issues families bring to the Palliative Care Case Conference, their level of distress prior to the conference, the extent to which these issues are addressed by staff and family satisfaction with this process are described. In most developed countries, up to 30% of older people die in long-term care. A palliative approach generally refers to the resident and family as the 'unit of care'. Interventions, which include family in palliative care, are required in this setting. Descriptive and thematic results from the intervention arm of a pre-post, sequential mixed method study. Examination of documents of 32 resident\/family dyads participating in a Palliative Care Case Conference, and interviews with the residents' family postintervention. Main concerns raised by family members prior to a Palliative Care Case Conference were physical and medical needs, pain, end-of-life care planning and nutrition and hydration. Families rated a high level of concern, 7.5 on a 10-point rating scale, prior to the Palliative Care Case Conference. A formalised Palliative Care Case Conference process ensured issues relating to end-of-life care planning, pastoral care, pain and comfort and physical and medical needs were well documented by staff. Issues relating to care processes and the family role in care were less well documented. All families, interviewed postintervention, recommended Palliative Care Case Conferences; and over 90% of families felt their issues were addressed to their satisfaction. Families also reported an increased understanding of the resident's current and future care. The Palliative Care Case Conference in long-term care provides an important platform for family to voice concerns. Palliative Care Case Conference documentation indicates that staff are attending to these issues, although more reference to concerns relating to care processes and the family role could be made. Increased communication between staff and family, in the form of a Palliative Care Case Conference, may reduce stress, anxiety and unwanted hospitalisations during the palliative phase.

Research on the use of MMC shows that healthcare providers saw the patients' resources and needs more clearly and achieved increased awareness of their own skills. An action-oriented research including a three-phase strategy was applied: the mapping phase, the intervention phase and the evaluation phase. During the 5-month mapping phase, two researchers conducted participant observation of a total of 50 hours. The intervention phase consisted of lectures, clinical supervision in MMC and seven reflection groups and lasted 12 months. In the six-month evaluation phase, participant observation of a total of 48 hours was conducted. Four focus group interviews took place during the whole study period of 2 years. The staff went through a process of change described by the following themes: from challenging behaviour to challenging interaction; from generalised skills to contextualised relational care; and from personal challenges to a professional community. As a result of MMC, the healthcare providers realised the value of taking into account the patients' context in dementia care and of being active participants in the patients' world. The focus changed from regarding challenging behaviour as symptoms of a disorder to being a challenge to interaction. Marte Meo Counselling should be combined with continuous reflection to improve healthcare providers' interaction with people who live with dementia.

Reminiscence work refers to the recall of past occurrences in a client's life with the intention of enhancing well-being, social skills and self-image. The design of the historical reminiscence tool was informed by the model of intervention design developed by van Meijel et al. starting with problem definition followed by the accumulation of building blocks for the intervention, the design of the intervention and, lastly, a validation of the intervention. Two studies were designed to develop the historical reminiscence tool. Study 1 was a focus group interview, conducted in 2008, aimed at generating knowledge about current practice and to develop the historical reminiscence tool. Eighteen women who identified themselves as reminiscence workers participated in three focus groups. Study 2 was a telephone survey, conducted in 2012 by the first author, serving the purpose of validation. The results provided information about the use of such a historical reminiscence tool. Participants understood reminiscence work primarily as meaningful activity, working with personal experience and honouring the individual's memories and life story. The historical reminiscence tool containing information about important historical events and everyday life in the period 1925-1955 was welcomed by the participants. They provided numerous suggestions for improvement of the draft. Reminiscence work in Iceland is of the social or meaningful activity type rather than a therapy. A historical reminiscence tool containing pertinent historical information was considered helpful in strengthening reminiscence workers' knowledge of the social and historical background of their clients and person-centred care.

Nine professionals - experts in exercise, dementia care and relevant policy development - and nine dyads of people with dementia and their family caregivers all recruited using purposive sampling. Semi-structured interviews subjected to thematic analysis. Three themes emerged: how exercise was defined, perceived benefits of exercise and how exercise should be implemented. Professionals recognised three exercise elements: aerobic exercise plus balance and strength training. Dyads recognised home-based activities (e.g., housework) and walking. Both groups recognised benefits of exercise in maintaining health and function and improving mood and sleep. Only health professionals identified falls risk reduction. There was limited appreciation of benefits for caregivers by maintaining function in care recipients. Professionals deemed that exercise should address all three elements, using easily accessible low-cost resources. The need for safety was emphasised, and there was agreement that in-home exercise was appropriate. Family\/cultural values were evident that could present barriers to exercise implementation. Changing health-related behaviours requires an understanding of individual perspectives, which exist within a cultural context. This study has illuminated the Thai context and has implications beyond this. Findings emphasise a need for potential benefits to be sufficiently understood by family caregivers to overcome any culturally based reluctance to promote exercise in older people.

Quality of life for older people living in care homes is traditionally reported in the literature as a Westernised construct and so far little is known about its meanings from an Arabic cultural perspective and context. There is also a knowledge gap about the conditions of older people living in care homes in Lebanon. The study was a qualitative exploration of perspectives of quality of life of older residents, care staff and family caregivers. Two care homes for older people situated in Beirut took part in the study. Between 2010 and 2011 semi-structured interviews were undertaken with a sample of 20 residents, eight family caregivers and 11 care staff. Data were analysed using the constant comparative method. Four categories emerged from this analytical process: (i) maintaining family connectedness; (ii) engaging in worthwhile activities; (iii) maintaining and developing significant relationships; and (iv) holding and practicing spiritual beliefs. The emergence of these categories confirmed the complex, interrelated and multidimensional nature of quality of life for residents and other stakeholders. The findings supplement an emerging body of knowledge about the composition of quality of life for older residents in Lebanon. Improving the quality of life of older residents will require action in respect of all of the domains identified in study. Moving nursing practice from task-based care to relationship-centred approaches was seen as pivotal in helping to develop quality of life for residents living in the participating care homes. The findings have implications for education, nursing practice and research in Lebanon and help start an evidence base for care.

These behaviours place large burdens on carers, family and on the individual themselves. This systematic review explored the use of interventions that could be used within practice to reduce the occurrences of disruptive vocalisation in people with dementia. Three online databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE and EMBASE) were searched for papers published after 1997 against two concept criteria of dementia and disruptive vocalisation. Any person diagnosed with dementia or suspected of having dementia symptoms were included identifying any interventions. Studies were appraised and data extracted using the Joanna Briggs Institute frameworks. This systematic review identified eight relevant papers for inclusion, and these assessed the implementation of eight separate interventions that could be used within practice. Three interventions were found to be supported by statistically significant research: a staff training programme, a behavioural management technique using cue cards and hand massage. The overall conclusion is that the evidence base is insufficient to make recommendations for practice. However, the studies gave some indication of how research and practice might develop in this area. In particular, five elements were identified that appear to promote the best patient outcomes. These include making sure interventions are person-centred, individualised, adaptable, with the use of multiple approaches, carried out by staff trained in the identification of disruptive vocalisation and ways to avoid triggering these behaviours. Triggers which lead to older people with dementia expressing disruptive vocalisation should be identified.

Leadership factors are an important element of the psychosocial work environment in old age care. The physical distance between leaders and nursing assistants is larger in home help services than in nursing homes. Therefore, it is important to study leadership separately in nursing homes and home help services. Assessments from 844 nursing assistants in nursing homes and 288 in home help services (45 nursing homes and 21 home help service units) were analysed. The data were analysed using linear regression. Age, gender, number of staff at the unit, number of years at the current working unit and educational level were controlled in Model 1. Summarised indexes that were based on all independent variables except the main independent variable were additionally controlled in Model 2.

The aim of this study was to describe nursing and support staff's experiences of using ICT for information, e-learning and support of working carers of older people. The study employed a descriptive, qualitative approach conducting a qualitative secondary analysis of two original data sets. In total, seventeen professional staff members from two municipal family carer support units in Sweden that had implemented ICTs were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide consisting of open-ended questions. Two data sets were merged using latent qualitative content analysis. Secondary analysis produced three subthemes and an overall theme, a virtual road as a carriageway for the support of working carers, consisting of both enabling and hindering aspects in family support. This theme provides access points in both directions and is based on caring instruments that enable nursing staff's support role. The staff's sustainability and ability to support is influenced by caring opportunities and barriers. The findings suggest the ICTs to be flexible structures that provided nursing staff with a means and method to support working carers of older people. To overcome barriers to its use, measures to optimise support for working carers and the older person are needed.

The aim of this study was to explore how home-care assistants perceive administration of medication to older people living at home, as delegated to them in the context of social care. Four focus groups consisting of 19 home-care assistants were conducted. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. According to home-care assistants, health and social care depends on delegation arrangements to function effectively, but in the first place it relieves a burden for district nurses. Even when the delegation had expired, administration of medication continued, placing the statutes of regulation in a subordinate position. There was low awareness among home-care assistants about the content of the statutes of delegation. Accepting delegation to administer medications has become an implicit prerequisite for social care work in the municipality. Accepting the delegation to administer medication was inevitable and routine. In practice, the regulating statute is made subordinate and consequently patient safety can be threatened. The organisation of health and social care relies on the delegation arrangement to meet the needs of a growing number of older home-care recipients. This is a crucial task which management within both the healthcare professions and municipal social care needs to address, to bridge the gap between statutes and practice, to create arenas for mutual collaboration in the care recipients' best interest and to ensure patient safety.

These themes illuminated the shared benefits of the practicum experience. Structured conversations between nursing students and older adults within the context of a focused course in gerontological nursing enable the development of mutually beneficial intergenerational relationships. Involving older adults as education partners in undergraduate nursing programmes has benefits for all participants and could form a valuable component of any undergraduate nursing programme. ","359":"Many older spouse caregivers are tied to the home by their caring duties and feel isolated. The values of supporting older caregivers are well known. In rural areas with long distances and decline in essential services, attending caregiver support groups can be difficult. Using Internet-based services can provide an opportunity for rural caregivers to participate in caregiver support, regardless of geographical distances and without the need for physical presence. This study aimed to explore how Internet-based caregiver support may influence the experience of isolation among older spouse caregivers in rural areas. An intervention study where 63 older rural caregivers received an Internet-based caregiver support service. A qualitative interview study based on 31 interviews with open-ended questions, analysed using latent content analysis. Two themes represent the findings from the study: Expanding the concept of place and Developing networks. Even though participants still spent their days in the house, they experienced that daily life was being spent in a variety of places, both physically, virtually and emotionally. The Internet-based support service provided them with a tool to reconnect with family and develop new friends. Internet-based caregiver support may reduce the experience of isolation for spouse caregivers in rural areas. Nurses played a crucial part in the development, by encouraging, educating and inspiring caregivers and supporting their independence. Internet-based services ought to be an option for caregiver support in rural areas as it may reduce feelings of isolation for older spouse caregivers. ","360":"","361":"The specific healthcare needs and concerns for older lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons have not been explored to any degree within Ireland. The aim of this paper, which is part of a larger study, is to detail older LGBT persons' usage, experiences and concerns with accessing healthcare services, disclosing their LGBT identity to professionals, preferences for care and their suggestions for improvement in services, including nursing services. A mixed methods research design combining quantitative survey and qualitative interview approaches of equal significance was used. 144 respondents completed an 84-item questionnaire concerning their use of healthcare services, experiences and needs. The qualitative phase involved in-depth interviews where 36 participants' experiences and concerns around health services were explored more in-depth. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative analysis employed the constant comparative process to generate the leading themes. Only one in three participants believed that healthcare professionals have sufficient knowledge of LGBT issues, and less than half (43%) felt respected as an LGBT person by healthcare professionals. Although 26% had chosen not to reveal their LGBT status for fear of a negative response, many positive encounters of coming out to healthcare professionals were relayed in the interviews. LGBT persons have specific concerns around residential care, particularly in relation to the perception that the Irish healthcare services emanate a heteronormative culture. Irish healthcare services need to reflect on how they currently engage with older LGBT persons at both an organisational and practitioner level. Consideration needs to be given to the specific concerns of ageing LGBT persons, particularly in relation to long-term residential care. Healthcare practitioners need to be knowledgeable of, and sensitive to, LGBT issues. ","362":null,"363":"Physical activity contributes to an older person's health and well-being by maintaining strength, balance and mobility, all of which are important for older people who wish to remain living in their home for as long as possible. It is therefore essential that community nurses and those working with home care clients promote being physically active. To do this effectively requires an understanding of the type of physical activity older home care clients prefer to engage in. The aims of this study were to identify the physical activity preferences of older people who received a home care service and to determine whether being physically active is important to this population. Twenty older home care clients were interviewed using a semi-structured interview schedule. Data were analysed using a descriptive qualitative methodology. Walking, housework and gardening were identified as the activities of choice. The majority of interviewees suggested that it was important to be physically active. Structured exercise programmes are not the activity of choice for older home care clients. Therefore, when community nurses and allied health workers promote physical activity to their clients, they should suggest activities such as walking, housework and gardening and also endorse the benefits of physical activity for well-being and staying independent. Health and community nurses and organisations should routinely encourage home care clients to increase their activity levels, especially utilising those activities they most enjoy. ","364":"Marital relationships in dementia are forged between the person with dementia and the care partner, and such relationships have an impact on the way in which dementia is understood and experienced. The everyday work that underpins the relationship is usually divided between spouses and based on traditional divisions of household chores. The aim was to describe how older women with dementia express the importance of their homes and their chores in everyday life. Seven women with dementia, who were cohabiting with their husbands, were interviewed on up to five occasions at home during a five-to-six-year period on the following themes: the home, their dementia illness, everyday life, their relationships with their husbands and dignity and autonomy. The qualitative analysis showed three different patterns in the women's narratives: keeping the core of the self through the home, keeping the self through polarising division of labour and keeping the self through (re-) negotiations of responsibilities. The feeling of one's home and home-related chores is an essential way to express who you are. The women stated that household chores are the centre of their lives despite their dementia disease and that the home, even though it shrinks, still makes the women see themselves as an important person, namely the 'competent wife'. Nurses need to be aware that 'doing gender' may be a means of preserving personhood as well as of sustaining couplehood in dementia. ","365":"Pain assessment in people living with dementia is a challenge due to the complexity of pain and dementia and the difficulties in self-reporting. In home healthcare, nurses are frequently involved in pain assessment situations and there is a need to explore how home healthcare teams' manage pain assessment in this setting. The study aimed to explore home healthcare teams' experiences of pain assessment among care recipients with dementia. An exploratory qualitative design was used. Open-ended individual interviews were conducted with thirteen registered nurses and ten nursing assistants, working in three different home healthcare teams in one municipality in western Sweden. Philosophical hermeneutics was utilised to interpret the home healthcare teams' experiences. Four interpretations emerged: the need for trusting collaboration, the use of multiple assessment strategies, maintenance of staff continuity in care and assessment situations, and the need for extended time to assess pain. The home healthcare teams recognise pain assessment in people with dementia as involving a complex interaction of sensory, cognitive, emotional and behavioural components in which efforts to acquire understanding of behavioural changes mainly guides their assessments. The solid team coherence between registered nurses and nursing assistants aided the assessment procedure. To assess pain, the teams used multiple methods that complemented one another. However, no systematic routines or appropriate evidence-based pain tools were used. The team members'concern for care recipients when assessing pain is evident and needs to be acknowledged by the organisation which is responsible for the quality of care. Future studies should focus on further exploration of nurses' experiences with pain and dementia in home healthcare settings and address what nurses identify and how they deal with their findings. It is imperative to investigate how organisations and nurses can ensure best practices and how the implementation of evidence-based routines for assessing pain may aid in pain assessment situations. ","366":"This study sought to evaluate the effectiveness of group music therapy (MT) intervention on behaviours of older people with dementia. Reported here are qualitative data from five, semi-structured focus groups; two comprising a total of seven family members and three comprising a total of 23 staff members. A number of core themes emerged: temporality, effect and policy with a number of subthemes. The MT effect is tempered by the temporality of (i) the older person's dementia state, (ii) the session and (iii) the psychosomatic effect on the older person. Music therapy is perceived to (i) evoke memories and facilitate reminiscence, (ii) act as a diversion (has an instrumental value) and it is contentious to discount the (iii) dichotomy between music and therapist in terms of the overall effect. Finally, policymakers need to know that MT is (i) highly prized and more, not less, MT is recommended. Findings from this study illustrate that the timing of the MT session has consequences for the workflow in the residential aged care facility; MT has a psychosomatic effect and participants here evaluate this as temporal. Care providers and family members acknowledge the instrumental value of MT and its helping with cognition and exercise. They have mixed views about the effects of the music and the effect on the older person by the therapist but most definitely want policymakers to ensure more, not less, planned and better funded MT is part of ongoing care in the residential aged care context. Areas for future research and policy are also highlighted. These views on group MT in residential aged care can initiate critical reflection on current practices and systems. Research is needed exploring the timing and scheduling of MT sessions at different times in the day for older person with dementia exhibiting negative behaviours. ","367":"The objective of this study was to evaluate whether care provided in the care programmes matched the needs of older people. Care programmes were implemented in primary-care settings in the Netherlands to identify frail older people and to prevent further deterioration of health. In total, 23 older people participated in in-depth interviews. Within this study, three older people participated as co-researchers; they gathered and analysed the data together with the academic researchers. Content analysis was used to analyse the data. Two categories emerged from the data: 'Losing connections' and 'Receiving support to reconnect.' 'Losing connections' reflects the needs of older people and 'Receiving support to reconnect' reflects their experience and the appreciated aspects of the provided care. A relationship of trust with the practice nurse (PN) appeared to be an important aspect of care, as it fostered the sharing of feelings and issues other than physical or medical problems that could not be shared with the general practitioner. The PNs are experienced as connectors, who help to restore feelings of connectedness and older peoples' access to resources in the community. The relationship with the PN was experienced as valuable because of the feelings of 'connectedness' it created. Through this connectedness, older people could discuss feelings of loneliness, depression and frustration in receiving and acquiring the appropriate resources and services with the PNs. Furthermore, the relationship with the PN helped the older people to gain access to other health professionals and services. The results imply that care for frail older people should include an awareness of the importance of the trusting relationship. Nurses can play a vital role in creating a trusting relationship and are able to bridge the gap between older people and other professionals and services. ","368":"","369":"Malnutrition is common amongst hospitalised older patients and associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Poor dietary intake results from factors including acute illness and cognitive impairment but additionally patients may have difficulty managing at mealtimes. Use of volunteers to help at mealtimes is rarely evaluated. To obtain multiple perspectives on nutritional care of older inpatients, acceptability of trained volunteers and identify important elements of their assistance. A qualitative study 1 year before and after introduction of volunteer mealtime assistants on one ward and parallel comparison with a control ward in a Medicine for Older People department at a UK university hospital. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups, in baseline and intervention years, with purposively sampled nursing staff at different levels of seniority; patients or close relatives; and volunteers. At baseline staff felt under pressure with insufficient people assisting at mealtimes. Introducing trained volunteers was perceived by staff and patients to improve quality of mealtime care by preparing patients for mealtimes, assisting patients who needed help, and releasing nursing time to assist dysphagic or drowsy patients. There was synergy with other initiatives, notably protected mealtimes. Interviews highlighted the perceived contribution of chronic poor appetite and changes in eating patterns to risk of malnutrition. Improved quality of mealtime care attributed to volunteers' input has potential to enhance staff morale and patients'\/relatives' confidence. A volunteer mealtime assistance scheme may work best when introduced in context of other changes reflecting commitment to improving nutrition. (i) A mealtime assistance scheme should incorporate training, supervision and support for volunteers; (ii) Good relationships and a sense of teamwork can develop between wards staff and volunteers; (iii) Impact may be maximised in the context of 'protected mealtimes'.

Covert and overt instances of homophobia are evident within residential care services provided to older lesbian, gay and bisexual people. To explore the perceptions of care staff working in residential care homes towards older lesbian, gay and bisexual people. Critical gerontology formed the methodological foundations for focus group discussions with care staff from seven residential care facilities. Hypothetical vignettes were used to stimulate discussion amongst participants. Thematic analysis of the seven focus group interviews illuminated three themes: 'Knowing me knowing you', 'Out of sight out of mind' and 'It's a generational thing'. Subtle as well as not so subtle forms of homophobia were evident in each of the themes. Care staff felt they were largely unprepared to provide care to older lesbian, gay and bisexual people. This small-scale New Zealand study identifies that the residential care sector is not always supportive, or prepared, to provide a care service to those people identifying as lesbian, gay and bisexual. Findings from this study recommend the implementation of principle-based guidelines, opportunities to participate in ongoing education and partnering with non-heterosexual community organisations in order to provide culturally appropriate care to older lesbian, gay and bisexual people. ","372":"Community care is characterised by a move from institutionalised to home-based care, a large patient population with comorbidities including cognitive failure, and nurses who struggle to keep up with their many competence demands. No study has examined the competence of nurses based on present demands, and an instrument for this purpose is lacking. We conducted a Delphi study based in Norway to develop the substantial content of a new competence measurement instrument. We sought to reach consensus regarding which nursing staff competence is most relevant to meet the current needs of older patients. A total of 42 experts participated in three consecutive panel investigations. Snowball sampling was used. The experts were clinicians, leaders, teachers, researchers and relatives of older people who required nursing. In Round 1, all experts were interviewed individually. These data were analysed using meaning coding and categorisation. In Rounds 2 and 3, the data were collected using electronic questionnaires and analysed quantitatively with SPSS. The experts agreed that health promotion as well as disease prevention, treatment, palliative care, ethics and regulation, assessment and taking action, covering basic needs, communication and documentation, responsibility and activeness, cooperation, and attitudes towards older people were the most relevant categories of competence. The experts showed clear consensus regarding the most relevant and current competence for nurses of older people. Assuming that older people in need of health care have the same requirements across cultures, this study's findings could be used as a basis for international studies. Those who nurse older people require competence that is complex and comprehensive. One way to evaluate nursing competence is through evaluation tools such as the Nursing Older People--Competence Evaluation tool. ","373":"Workplace violence is one of the most complex and significant occupational hazards experienced by nurses in healthcare settings. Verbal abuse and physical violence are particularly prevalent in older person assessment wards, owing to the prevalence of illnesses involving cognitive dysfunction; the high frequency and nature of contact with staff; and the frustration caused by high levels of disability. To determine the frequency, kinds and cues of violence displayed by patients towards nurses in an acute older person assessment ward environment using a structured observational tool - the Violence Assessment Tool (VAT). Observational study. Non-participant structured observations of behavioural cues for violence towards nurses in an acute older person hospital ward were gathered and analysed. One hundred and twelve hours of observations were undertaken, resulting in 95 behavioural cues for violence in 19 patients. Four of these patients subsequently escalated to physical violence. Pacing around the bed was the only commonality in the behavioural cues of patients who became violent. All patients who became violent had previously demonstrated showing. To date, the assessment of potentially violent older patients has not been adequately addressed. The VAT may be one way of addressing this challenge through early identification of the more subtle behavioural cues that could indicate potential for violence. Further research on the VAT using a larger data set could determine its predictability for physically violent acts displayed by older people. ","374":"The development of palliative care in nursing homes in German-speaking countries has gained in importance within the past 15-20 years. Ethical and gender issues are core aspects of a palliative care culture and should therefore be better understood. The aim of this study was to highlight insights regarding ethical and gender issues, based on the experiences of professionals in nursing homes. A 2-year participatory action research study was performed in collaboration with three nursing homes in Austria. The article focusses on 10 group discussions with interdisciplinary professional teams that were conducted to generate ethical narratives. Thematic and narrative analysis was undertaken both individually and within the interdisciplinary research team. Findings and interpretations were validated with practitioners and researchers. A total of 36 narratives were collected and summarised within eight themes concerning the theoretical journey of a nursing home resident with relatives from entry into the house until death. The most burdensome ethical dilemmas are not the ones around death and dying but rather those relating to small-scale everyday work\/life issues. Sharing experiences and feelings in ethical discussions provides relief. Emotions are important facilitators of insight into ethical dilemmas. Gender issues can be observed in care situations as well as in the organisational structure of nursing homes. Opportunities to share experiences and perspectives around ethical questions in interdisciplinary group discussions help professionals to better understand difficult issues and find appropriate ways of managing them. There is a need for communication structures such as facilitated ethical discussions that enable nursing home staff to reflect their everyday decisions. Expression of emotions should be encouraged in ethical decision-making processes in nursing homes. Gender-sensitive reflection supports the development of palliative care as organisational culture. ","375":"Nursing care homes are increasingly the place where frail older people die. However, training in end-of-life care is not statutory. To develop strategies to promote quality end-of-life care in nursing care homes. Action research was used to work collaboratively with the managers and staff in two nursing care homes to develop end-of-life care. There were three overarching phases: an exploratory phase, feedback\/planning of actions and a summative evaluation. Two main actions were inductively derived. One of the actions, reflective debriefing groups following a resident's death, is reported. Ten reflective debriefing groups, led by the researcher (a specialist palliative care nurse), were undertaken. The groups facilitated learning at three different levels (being taught, developing understanding and critical thinking) and enabled staff to feel supported and valued. The use of reflective debriefing groups is a useful mechanism to support experience-based learning about death\/dying in care homes. ","376":"","377":"There is debate worldwide about the best way to manage increased healthcare demand within ageing populations, particularly rising rates of unplanned and avoidable hospital admissions. To understand health and social care professionals' perspectives on barriers to admission avoidance throughout the admissions journey, in particular: the causes of avoidable admissions in older people; drivers of admission and barriers to use of admission avoidance strategies; and improvements to reduce unnecessary admissions. A qualitative framework analysis of interview data from a System dynamics (SD) modelling study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with twenty health and social care professionals with experience of older people's admissions. The interviews were used to build understanding of factors facilitating or hindering admission avoidance across the admissions system. Data were analysed using framework analysis. Three overarching themes emerged: understanding the needs of the patient group; understanding the whole system; and systemwide access to expertise in care of older people. There were diverse views on the underlying reasons for avoidable admissions and recognition of the need for whole-system approaches to service redesign. Participants recommended system redesign that recognises the specific needs of older people, but there was no consensus on underlying patient needs or specific service developments. Access to expertise in management of older and frailer patients was seen as a barrier to admission avoidance throughout the system. Providing access to expertise and leadership in care of frail older people across the admissions system presents a challenge for service managers and nurse educators but is seen as a prerequisite for effective admission avoidance. System redesign to meet the needs of frail older people requires agreement on causes of avoidable admission and underlying patient needs. ","378":"The consistent delivery of compassionate health and social care to older people is a matter of global concern to the nursing profession and the public it serves. The development and evaluation of effective interventions to address this concern is of prime importance. This paper draws on findings from previous research to propose the use of a novel implementation programme designed to improve and support the delivery of compassionate care by health and social care teams. Creating Learning Environments for Compassionate Care (CLECC) is a 4-month implementation programme designed for hospital ward nursing teams caring for older people, but relevant to other teams working with other client groups. The programme focuses on using workplace learning to promote change at unit\/ward\/team level by enabling the development of leadership and team relational practices which are also designed to enhance the capacity of individual team members to relate to older people. Existing research evidence suggests that optimising relational capacity in this way will support the delivery of compassionate care. This evidence-based intervention is designed to develop and sustain the relational work required by managers and team members to support care delivery and has the potential to address widely documented variations in care quality. Attention should now be paid to establishing the feasibility of the intervention in practice. ","379":null,"380":"Entry to long-term care is an emotional time for older people and their families. Poor communication and uncertainty about roles and responsibilities in the post-placement period can cause distress for families and staff, further exacerbating an already difficult situation. However, there are limited studies that specifically address roles and relationships between families and care home staff in the post-placement period. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of families following the nursing home placement of an older relative. A qualitative approach using grounded theory methodology was used to conduct the study. Semi structured interviews were conducted with 29 relatives of nursing home residents in a region of the UK. Consistent with grounded theory methodology, data collection and analysis occurred simultaneously. Data analysis revealed five distinct categories that captured the experience of families in the post-placement period. These were: communication with staff, involvement in relative's care, the importance of 'the little things', quality of care and areas for improvement. Developing caring partnership is crucial if the resources of care home staff and families are to be maximised for the benefit of all concerned. A number of programmes and initiatives already exist to enhance the quality of life of older people in care homes and their families. Serious consideration should be given to more widespread uptake of these initiatives. ","381":"To investigate how often nursing staff perceive caring for nursing home residents with dementia at the end of life as an emotional and\/or physical burden, and to identify associated factors. Postdeath study conducted in 2010 in Flanders, Belgium. Nursing homes were selected through random clustersampling. All residents who died with dementia in a three-month period were identified, and a structured questionnaire was completed by the nurse mostly involved. Nursing staff were asked to indicate how they perceived burden of caregiving for this resident on 10-point scale. Sixty-nine out of 120 nursing homes (response rate 58%) participated in the study. In 37% and 32% of cases, respectively, the nursing staff reported that they perceived themselves as experiencing a high emotional and physical burden. In cases where the resident had capacity for medical decision making during the last week of life and where the nurse had spoken with a relative about wishes for medical end-of-life treatments, they were more likely to report an emotional burden. A physical burden was more likely to be reported where the resident had decubitus ulcers or had developed pneumonia. In one-third of cases, nursing staff experienced a high emotional and\/or physical burden. While experiencing a physical burden seems to be related to the poorer clinical status of the resident, an emotional burden was more likely to be related to greater and closer contact with the resident or a relative and to the nurse being involved in the process of care and decision making in the last phase of life. This study highlights the need to support nursing home staff in providing compassionate end-of-life care for people with dementia and suggests that both the physical and emotional burdens in staff should be monitored regularly to achieve optimal working.

The trajectories of decline that are associated with chronic progressive diseases in advanced old age have few prognostic markers. Consequently, it is difficult to determine when to start palliative or end-of-life care. Mixed methods. Data were collected in three long-term care facilities in Canada. Statistical data were subjected to basic descriptive analysis. Qualitative data were collected using methods commonly associated with ethnography including interviews, focus groups, observations and artefact review. Constant-comparative analysis of qualitative data occurred as data were collected. A 2-stage layered awareness of impending death was identified: first generalised and then clinical awareness. Generalised awareness was characterised by an understanding of human mortality and an understanding of the person's nearness to the end of an expected lifespan. Care routines and use of resources were not influenced by this early awareness. Clinical awareness of impending death was later acknowledged when health status changes suggested that death was likely within a few hours or days. The care then changed substantially to palliative in nature. Despite an awareness that death occurs naturally at the end of a long life and\/or long illness, a serious decline towards death was not noticed or acknowledged until the last few hours or days of life, thus limiting palliative care to late-stage pain and symptom management. Although this late-stage awareness of impending death is arguably the first necessary step for a change in nursing homes to a palliative-oriented approach to care for people who are nearing death in late life, timely acknowledgement of the potential for death is needed to facilitate improvements in care for residents of long-term facilities. ","386":"This study aimed to describe and compare urban and rural family caregivers' reactions to caring for a relative with dementia and to examine the associations between caregiving and socio-demographic factors. Most studies on family caregivers' experiences caring for older people with dementia have been conducted in urban areas, and little is known about the experiences of family caregivers living in rural areas. A cross-sectional study design was used. A total of 102 caregivers (response rate 85%) from urban (n=57) and rural (n=46) areas completed the Caregiver Reaction Assessment (CRA) Scale and demographic information. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics and linear regression models. Overall, family caregivers reported high satisfaction even if they also reported high impact on finances and daily living. Rural caregivers experienced a higher negative impact on finances but reported more support from family members than urban caregivers. Age, gender and relationship were significantly associated with four of the five CRA subscales. Educational level and geographical setting were not associated with any of the CRA subscales. The results of the study raise questions about the financial situation of older female caregivers and on the expectations of built-in family structures in urban and rural areas. Further studies focusing on the meaning and constitution of a family would help us to understand how these factors influence family caregiving both in rural and urban areas. To provide person-centred care and to avoid stereotyped caregiving, a better picture of traditions in family caregiving can improve a more differentiated and appropriate professional caregiving pliable with the cultural context in which it is carried out.

Maintaining personal hygiene for patients is one of the core elements of care in all fields of nursing. However, it is a subject that has been neglected in both research and education. Skin integrity is essential to the health and well-being of older people. Skin cleansing practices can contribute to the maintenance and promotion of skin integrity. It is therefore essential to have a robust evidence base for such practices. Literature review by searches of the electronic databases Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Academic Search Premier, psycINFO, Web of Science, SCOPUS and the Cochrane Library, using firstly key words and exclusion criteria, then citations and reference searches. An integrative review method was used. Studies included were alternative bathing protocol or bathing product interventions. Seven studies met the methodological requirements for inclusion. There is a significant lack of high-quality research studies to provide a framework for guiding evidence-based skin cleansing practice. Current guidance is based on clinical expertise rather than on robust trial evidence. A research agenda has been developed which may become the basis for developing evidence-based, best practice guidelines. Future research must move beyond descriptive studies to include more robust methods of investigation. The lack of intervention studies limits the practice-guiding implications that can be gained from the current body of research. Skin cleansing is one of the cornerstones of nursing practice, however, in the absence of a robust evidence base most such care is currently based on 'custom and practice'. There is a need to conduct further research into cleansing practices that will maintain or enhance skin health and skin integrity. ","390":"","391":"Despite increasing international interest in palliative care, little focus has been given to the role of nursing assistants, nor to research on existential issues. To investigate nursing assistants' experiences of existential issues in palliative care. An explorative study using focus group discussions as data. Seven nursing assistants working in a palliative care unit and a nursing home participated on three occasions. Data were analysed using a content analysis approach. Two overlapping domains were extracted: practical care, interpreted in themes as meeting others, the patient's body and organisational boundaries; and existential issues, interpreted as the difficult part, the valuable part and death and dying. Communication seemed to be a theme central to both domains. The results indicate that nursing assistants may give existential support in addition to practical aspects of care. The intimate interactions inherent in practical aspects of personal care create opportunities for meaningful conversations. Such conversations may constitute existential support for patients and a meaningful task for staff. ","392":"This integrative review of the literature describes the evolution in knowledge and the paradigm shift that is necessary to switch from advance directives to advance care planning. It presents an analysis of concepts, trends, models and experiments that enables identification of the best treatment strategies, particularly for older people living in nursing homes. Based on 23 articles published between 1999 and 2012, this review distinguishes theoretical from empirical research and presents a classification of studies based on their methodological robustness (descriptive, qualitative, associative or experimental). It thus provides nursing professionals with evidence-based information in the form of a synthetic vision and conceptual framework to support the development of innovative care practices in the end-of-life context. While theoretical work places particular emphasis on the impact of changes in practice on the quality of care received by residents, empirical research highlights the importance of communication between the different persons involved about care preferences at the end of life and the need for agreement between them. The concept of quality of life and the dimensions and factors that compose it form the basis of Advance care planning (ACP) and enable the identification of the similarities and differences between various actors. They inform professionals of the need to ease off the biomedical approach to consider the attributes prioritised by those concerned, whether patients or families, so as to improve the quality of care at the end of life. It is particularly recommended that all professionals involved take into account key stakeholders' expectations concerning what is essential at the end of life, to enable enhanced communication and decision-making when faced with this difficult subject. ","393":"The prevalence of dementia diseases is increasing worldwide with advancing age and growing populations. In Sweden alone, which currently has a population of approximately 9 million people, there are about 25 000 persons diagnosed each year with a dementia. Consequently, after such a diagnosis, there is a need for support. The recipients of that support include next of kin who seek a variety of information, including potential lifestyle changes and ways of dealing with personality changes in their loved one who has a dementia. The aim was to explore four couples experiences in long-term ongoing structured support groups. A single-case study using semi-structured interviews supported by 'diary notes' maintained by each participating couple were used. Semi-structured interviews were analysed using content analysis. Three categories represent the findings across the four cases: Knowledge about the disease, Sense of comfort and support, and, Kinship through shared experiences. One category, Longing for kinship was created exclusively for one of the couples. Viewing the emerging categories from a healthy ageing perspective, both comfort and support and kinship through shared experiences can be considered as components of larger themes of support and social interaction. Findings suggest that structured support groups are a good way to encourage discussions, allow persons with dementia to express themselves and support healthy ageing among partners. ","394":"Continuity is crucial when caring for older chronically ill patients. Research has shown that the integration of patients' own perspectives on their situation is of utmost importance for continuity and quality of care. Studies have, however, demonstrated a number of problems with health professionals' communication concerning older patients, leading to lack of continuity and integration of the patient perspective in care and treatment. In spite of these problems being well investigated, they continue to prevail. To examine conditions for continuity and integration of the patient perspective in older, chronically ill patients' care as reflected in nursing staff's communication about the patients. Explorative Participatory Action Research (PAR). An acute, general medical ward at a Danish university hospital. Hospital and municipality nurses (n = 29). Nursing records (n = 12). Field studies: observations, interviews, nursing records audits and logs. Data were subject to manifest and latent content analysis. Participants were aware of the importance of ensuring continuity, a comprehensive approach and integration of the patient perspective in care trajectories of older, chronically ill patients. Although they adhered to these ideals, they rarely pursued them in practice. Hindering factors were: organisational values, episodic focus on patients and lack of time. They felt caught in a value conflict between nursing professional values and system values, which caused a feeling of powerlessness, maintaining status quo in their clinical practice. The prevailing episodic focus and the competing rationales on the ward constituted a barrier to continuity and integration of the patient perspective in a comprehensive way. ","395":"Mobility contributes to the quality of life and independence of residents in nursing homes. To perform resident-centred mobility care, staff need to understand residents' physical capacity and perspectives of care. The aim of the study was to explore residents' perspectives of intrinsic factors influencing their mobility and associations between these factors with a view to informing resident mobility care practice improvements. The study was part of a larger ethnographic project exploring safe resident mobility care in nursing homes. Semi-structured interviews with nursing home residents supplemented by non-participant observations were conducted over a 20-month period from July 2010. Fifteen residents consented to be interviewed in three nursing homes in Melbourne, Australia. Unobtrusive observations of 46 mobility events took place in three nursing homes over 5 months from September, 2011. Participants identified intrinsic factors that influence their mobility including mobility capacity, strategies to cope with mobility loss, motivation and efforts to remain mobile. Three themes related to resident attitudes and responses to mobility loss emerged: acceptance of mobility loss and staff assistance; motivation to remain mobile; and acquiescence and loss of control during mobility events. A conceptual model developed from the study outlined associations between resident attitudes and mobility and quality of life outcomes. Discussion was framed by theories of ageing and adaptation: selection, optimisation and compensation; learned dependency; and learned helplessness. Resident acceptance of mobility loss, and required staff assistance and realistic determination to remain mobile contribute to residents' quality of life. Mobility care based on considerations of resident choice, autonomy and the value of mobility is important. ","396":"Hip fracture is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in older people. Healthcare professionals have a role to identify and respond to challenges and concerns that older people face as they strive to manage risk of future falls and rebuild confidence and independence after discharge. This study aimed to explore the postdischarge concerns of older people after fall-induced hip fracture. Glaser's approach to the grounded theory method guided qualitative interviews conducted with 19 older people in their own homes up to 3 months post discharge, in two health authority areas. A theory of 'taking control' was generated. 'Balancing risk' emerged as a key strategy that older people employed to help them to take control after discharge home. Older people attempted to control or 'balance' their risk of future falls and dependence by implementing two further strategies: 'protective guarding' and 'following orders'. The instinctive strategy of protective guarding and the learned strategy of following orders were implemented simultaneously and were characterised by older people aiming to pace their progress and balance risk safely and appropriately. To apply these strategies, older people required information from healthcare professionals. In circumstances where older people did not receive or did not understand the information provided, they were left 'grasping to understand' and were more likely to miscalculate risk. This leads to damaged confidence and in some cases further falls. The concept of balancing risk aims to help healthcare professionals understand the older person's perspective of hip fracture and to recognise the efforts that people make to guard against further injury and dependence in the early postdischarge period. ","397":"Training nursing staff in communication skills can impact on the quality of care for residents with dementia and contributes to nurses' job satisfaction. Changing attitudes and practices takes time and energy and can affect the entire nursing staff, not just the nurses directly involved in a training programme. Therefore, it seems important to study nurses' experiences of a training programme and any influence of the programme on work climate among the entire nursing staff. To explore nurses' experiences of a 1-year validation method training programme conducted in a nursing home for residents with dementia and to describe ratings of work climate before and after the programme. A mixed-methods approach. Twelve nurses participated in the training and were interviewed afterwards. These individual interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed, then analysed using qualitative content analysis. The Creative Climate Questionnaire was administered before (n = 53) and after (n = 56) the programme to the entire nursing staff in the participating nursing home wards and analysed with descriptive statistics. Analysis of the interviews resulted in four categories: being under extra strain, sharing experiences, improving confidence in care situations and feeling uncertain about continuing the validation method. The results of the questionnaire on work climate showed higher mean values in the assessment after the programme had ended. The training strengthened the participating nurses in caring for residents with dementia, but posed an extra strain on them. These nurses also described an extra strain on the entire nursing staff that was not reflected in the results from the questionnaire. The work climate at the nursing home wards might have made it easier to conduct this extensive training programme. Training in the validation method could develop nurses' communication skills and improve their handling of complex care situations. ","398":"Providing everyday activities is central to high quality residential aged care, but further research is needed on the association between activity participation, person-centred care and quality of life. To explore the point-prevalence of participation in everyday activities for residents with dementia within a national sample of Swedish residential aged care units and to explore if residents participating in everyday activities lived in more person-centred units and\/or had higher quality of life as compared to residents not participating in everyday activities. A cross-sectional design was used to collect valid and reliable questionnaire data on activity participation, unit person-centredness and quality of life in a sample of residents in residential aged care (n = 1266). Only 18% of residents participated in everyday activities such as making coffee, setting or clearing the table, cleaning or watering plants, 62% participated in outdoor walks, 27% participated in parlour games, and 14% and 13% participated in excursions and church visits, respectively. Those residents who had participated in everyday activities lived in more person-centred units, had significantly higher quality of life and higher cognitive scores as compared to those residents who had not participated in everyday activities. Even though the prevalence of resident participation in everyday activities was low, resident participation was significantly associated with unit person-centredness and resident quality of life. It seems that everyday activities that are routine and commonplace to residential aged care can be potent nursing interventions for promoting resident quality of life. ","399":"Aortic stenosis in older adults can lead to symptoms of breathlessness, dizziness, syncope and angina. While surgical AVR is the optimum treatment, it is not suitable for frail older people who may have other significant comorbidities. TAVI provides a safer alternative. There is evidence that aortic valve replacement reduces mortality and morbidity, but less is known about its effect on quality of life (QoL) in older adults. To carry out a narrative review of the existing literature on quality of life (QoL) after surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVI) with the aim of identifying what is known about QoL pre- and postvalve replacement. There is some evidence that QoL improves after aortic valve replacement, but there are significant gaps in our knowledge. There are no studies that compare QoL after TAVI vs. surgical AVR; thus, we do not know the relative effect of the different procedures on QoL. The literature does not adequately explore why some people have improved QoL after aortic valve replacement and others do not. There appears to be some evidence that the existence of comorbidities may negatively influence QoL after valve replacement, but there is not enough consistent data on comorbidities to explore this further. Study designs are heterogeneous and prevent any meta-analysis of findings. Decision-making processes regarding the suitability of patients for aortic valve replacement should include an assessment of the potential effects on overall QoL, rather than just relief of cardiac-related symptoms. Consideration of patients' social, emotional and physical needs both before and after valve replacement is essential if health services are serious about improving QoL as well as mortality and morbidity. ","400":"","401":"In keeping with worldwide demographic changes and an ageing population, people with intellectual disabilities are living longer and all the evidence suggest that this trend will continue. This 'new' population of older people and their carers will pose challenges for health and social care providers. This paper presents a review of the literature on key issues influencing caregiving for older people with intellectual disabilities and their ageing family carers. The review was undertaken using a framework adapted from the NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. Papers were identified through the use of databases including CINAHL, Science Direct, PsychoInfo, Blackwell Synergy, the Cochrane Library and MEDLINE. The key themes which emerged from the literature and which consequently form the basis of this review include: ageing family carers, future planning and support services. In the context of family caregiving, older people with intellectual disabilities represent a unique group insofar as they are unlikely to be married and therefore have no spouse or dependents to care for them in later life. As a result, parents (usually mothers) have to continue caring for their son or daughter with an intellectual disability as they both grow older, often resulting in a mutually dependent relationship. The caregiving situation is further complicated by poor emergency and future planning and by a lack of appropriate services for this group of individuals. In light of the emergence of a 'new' population of older people with intellectual disabilities, there is an urgent need to develop services and support structures which will enable these individuals and their ageing carers to 'age in place' and when this is no longer possible, to have appropriate alternatives that recognise the duality of their needs as older people and as people with intellectual disabilities. Opportunities for supervision could be one way to increase individuals' awareness of their own role in the team. ","402":"In Western society and increasingly elsewhere, death has become medicalised and 'hospitalised' even when people are enduring deteriorating terminal conditions such as dementia and heart failure. In an attempt to rationalise and dignify the place and manner of death, evidence is emerging that the adoption of end-of-life care pathways and models can improve the experience of the end-of-life care across a range of care settings. Each of these demands skills and knowledge in the assessment and prediction of the dying trajectory. In this study, we report complexities facing relatives, residents and nursing home staff in the awareness, diagnosis and prediction of the dying trajectory. Data were collected and analysed within a broadly qualitative methodology. The contexts were two nursing homes in the Greater Manchester area, each at different stages of implementing 'Gold Standards Framework' approaches to planning end-of-life care with residents and their relatives. From 2008 to 2011 and with appropriate consent, data were collected by a mixture of interviews and participant observation with residents, relatives and staff. Appropriate ethics approvals were sought and given. Key emerging themes were diagnosis and awareness of dying in which there is no substitute for experience. Significant resource is needed to engage staff, residents and relatives\/carers with the idea of advance care planning. Talking to residents and relatives about their feelings and wishes for care at the end of life remains especially difficult, but education and training in key skills and knowledge can engender confidence. Challenges include diagnosing and predicting dying trajectories. Advance care planning can reduce the distress from and number of inappropriate hospital admissions, but requires determination and consistent application of the approach. This can be very challenging in the face of staff rotation and the unpredictability both of the dying trajectory and the decision-making of some out of hours medical staff. ","403":"A link between 'quality of life' and 'connectedness' is emerging in the literature. However, there has been little debate on what 'connectedness' means and how it can be fostered in long-term care settings. This review examines the meaning of 'connectedness' in long-term care. This paper critically examines the meaning of 'connectedness' in the context of its contribution to the quality of life of older people living in long-term care settings. Key databases (CINAHL, PsychInfo and Medline) were searched systematically. Fourteen papers and two book chapters met the inclusion criterion of papers exploring 'connectedness for older people in residential care'. The experience of connectedness for older people in long-term care settings is linked with quality of life and successful ageing. Fundamental prerequisites of connectedness for older people are: self-awareness, meaningful relationships with family and friends, involvement in meaningful activities and connections with wider society. However, barriers to these prerequisites are evident for many residents in long-term care settings. Register and Herman (Advances in Nursing Science, 33, 2010, 53) identify six connections that combine to generate connectedness for older people. These connections are representative of the factors associated with increased quality of life for residents living in long-term care settings. The six connections are helpful in identifying areas to focus on when planning person-centred care. ","404":"Self-transcendence is considered a developmental process of personal maturity and a vital resource of well-being in later adulthood. Measurement of the associations between self-transcendence and spiritual well-being in cognitively intact nursing home patients has not been previously published. The aim of this study was to identify the relationships between self-transcendence and spiritual well-being in cognitively intact nursing home patients. A cross-sectional design using the self-transcendence scale and the FACIT-Sp spiritual well-being questionnaire was adopted. A sample of 202 cognitively intact nursing home patients in mid-Norway was selected to respond to the questionnaires in 2008 and 2009. Statistical analyses were conducted using lisrel 8.8 (Scientific Software International, Chicago, IL, USA) and structural equation modelling. A hypothesised structural equation model comprising a two-factor construct of self-transcendence and a three-factor construct of spiritual well-being demonstrated significant direct relationships between self-transcendence and spiritual well-being and total effects of self-transcendence on spiritual well-being. Facilitating patients' self-transcendence, both interpersonally and intrapersonally, might increase spiritual well-being among cognitively intact nursing home patients, which is seen to be of great importance to nursing home patients' overall satisfaction and satisfaction with staff. The two-factor construct of self-transcendence and the three-factor construct of FACIT-Sp allow a more complex examination of the associations between the constructs and prove more specific guidelines for nursing interventions promoting well-being in nursing home patients. ","405":"Undernutrition, weight loss and dehydration are major clinical issues for people with dementia in residential care, with excessive weight loss contributing to increased risk of frailty, immobility, illness and premature morbidity. This paper discusses a nutritional knowledge and attitudes survey conducted as part of a larger project focused on improving nutritional intake of people with dementia within a residential care facility in Brisbane, Australia. The specific aims of the survey were to identify (i) knowledge of the nutritional needs of aged care facility residents; (ii) mealtime practices; and (iii) attitudes towards mealtime practices and organisation. A survey based on those used in other healthcare settings was completed by 76 staff members. The survey included questions about nutritional knowledge, opinions of the food service, frequency of feeding assistance provided and feeding assessment practices. Nutritional knowledge scores ranged from 1 to 9 of a possible 10, with a mean score of 4.67. While 76% of respondents correctly identified risk factors associated with malnutrition in nursing home residents, only 38% of participants correctly identified the need for increased protein and energy in residents with pressure ulcers, and just 15% exhibited correct knowledge of fluid requirements. Further, while nutritional assessment was considered an important part of practice by 83% of respondents, just 53% indicated that they actually carried out such assessments. Identified barriers to promoting optimal nutrition included insufficient time to observe residents (56%); being unaware of residents' feeding issues (46%); poor knowledge of nutritional assessments (44%); and unappetising appearance of food served (57%). An important step towards improving health and quality of life for residents of aged care facilities would be to enhance staff nutritional awareness and assessment skills. This should be carried out through increased attention to both preservice curricula and on-the-job training. The residential facility staff surveyed demonstrated low levels of nutrition knowledge, which reflects findings from the international literature. This has implications for the provision of responsive care to residents of these facilities and should be explored further. ","406":"In previous literature, it has been recognised that the extent to which different healthcare professionals collaborate may affect both the quality and safety of care, and patient outcomes. Collaboration appears to be an essential part of professional practice, yet there is a lack of knowledge and understanding of collaboration in the context of short-term care units. Therefore, this study was undertaken to better understand how professionals in this context view collaboration. To describe collaboration in rehabilitation from the perspective of healthcare professionals. Qualitative interviews were conducted with ten healthcare professionals, including: occupational therapists, physiotherapists and nurses, who worked in three different short-term care settings. The interviews were transcribed, and qualitative content analysis was used. Four categories, all of which included both positive and negative descriptions of collaboration, were identified: (i) Crossing professional and organisational boundaries (ii) Awareness of own professional identity (iii) Information and knowledge transfer and (iv) Balancing between patient, system and process. The findings indicate the importance of leadership and organisational structures for stimulating communication, and promoting collaboration between team members. In addition, working as a professional in short-term care requires individual skills in collaboration efforts, including awareness of one's own professional identity. Opportunities for supervision could be one way to increase individuals' awareness of their own role in the team. ","407":"Delirium is common in older patients. Little is known of support needs of families of older hospital patients with delirium. To inform nursing practice, we sought to describe families' experiences, understanding of delirium and delirium care, and support needs. Descriptive mixed methods. Review of questionnaire items used with families of people with terminal delirium informed development of a new questionnaire to evaluate the support needs in our study population. In a tertiary hospital delirium unit, we recruited 17 family carers of older patients with (non-terminal) delirium to respond to this questionnaire. Twelve participants (11 female) also took part in interviews addressing the study's aims. Descriptive statistics were calculated and thematic analysis was undertaken. From the survey, key family issues included distress about the patient's condition, worries about future care, and a need for more information about how the patient might feel and how families could support the patient. Themes from interviews included The admission experience, Worries and concerns, Feeling supported, and The discharge experience. Limited understanding of delirium underpinned all themes. Families experienced shock and sadness at the change in the patient; they were reassured by the specialist care but needed more information about delirium, its effects and outcomes, and how they could help with care. Meeting long-term postdischarge needs was a key concern. In this study, families with a hospitalised older relative who had delirium described a distressing experience and needs for informational support. Further research is needed outside of delirium-specific units and in samples including a greater proportion of male relatives. Nurses should work within the interdisciplinary team to ensure a planned, sensitive and timely approach to informing the patient's family about delirium and its implications for their relative, recognising the family carer's role and likely distress. ","408":"A metropolitan geriatric evaluation and management (GEM) facility in Australia was undergoing expansion, and consideration for the needs of individuals with dementia and their family carers was identified as important in planning the new facility. Existing literature revealed that people in hospital value privacy, minimal noise, family amenities and homeliness, but these findings did not consider the perspectives of the person with dementia specifically. The aim was to elicit the perspectives of current inpatients with dementia, and their family carers, about the environment\/design features that they believe are necessary for people with dementia, and their family carers. This qualitative study utilised in-depth semi-structured interviews to obtain information from current inpatients with dementia and their family carers. Participants described how the care received was more important than the physical environment; however, participants also valued homeliness, privacy for the patient and for conversations, a shared space without a television and a connection to the outside. Participants described how accommodating carers, providing quiet spaces and appropriate amenities were also important. While participants valued care over the physical surroundings, they also offered valuable information about their experience in the ward environment. Despite cognitive difficulties, people with dementia were able to provide useful information about the environment within which they were being cared. Consumer opinions about hospital design\/environment should be considered as an important source of data. Privacy and personal space for people with dementia and their family carers, a connection with the outside environment , and the needs of carers and visitors are all important considerations when designing healthcare environments. ","409":"Functional decline is a common complication in hospitalised older adults, associated with low mobility and physical activity. Fear of falling may contribute to limited mobility and physical activity, and loss of physical function. An understanding of this relationship, as well as contributing factors, may inform the development of safe, function-promoting interventions. To describe fear of falling in hospitalised older adults and its relationship with patient characteristics and physical function and explore patient views of associated factors. combined quantitative and qualitative approach using chart extraction, observation and interviews of older adults. (i) correlations and analysis of variance methods; (ii) content and thematic analysis; and (iii) evaluation of convergence, complementarity and dissonance of quantitative and qualitative data. Depressed older persons were more likely to describe fear of falling (r = 0.47, P = 0.002). Fear of falling was associated with the loss of physical function from admission to discharge (F = 7.6, P = 0.009). The participant response to fear of falling was activity restriction vs. self-direction. Participants described the following factors, organised by social-ecological framework, to be considered when developing alternatives to activity restriction: intrapersonal, interpersonal, environmental and policy. Fear of falling plays a significant role in restricting physical activity and function. A multifactorial approach may provide a viable alternative to activity restriction, by facilitating self-direction and functional recovery. Interventions to prevent falls and activities to promote functional mobility are ideally developed in tandem, with attention paid to the physical and social environment. Preventing hospital-acquired disability may require a shift in organisational values around safety, from a soley protective approach to one that reflects an enabling philosophy emphasising independence and self-direction. Such a paradigm shift would demonstrate a valuing not only of the absence of falls but also the preservation and restoration of function. ","410":"There is a move towards the provision of rehabilitation for older people in their homes. It is essential to ensure that rehabilitation services promote independence of older people. The aim of the study was to explore multidisciplinary teams' experiences of home rehabilitation for older people. Five focus groups were conducted with multidisciplinary teams based in a municipality in Sweden, covering seven different professions. In total, 28 participants volunteered to participate in these interviews. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed according to content analysis. Two main categories, as well as four subcategories, emerged. The first main category, having a rehabilitative approach in everyday life, consisted of the subcategories: 'giving 'hands-off' support' and 'being in a home environment'. The second main category, working across professional boundaries, consisted of the subcategories: 'coordinating resources' and 'learning from each other'. Common goals, communication skills and role understanding contributed to facilitating the teams' performances of rehabilitation. A potential benefit of home rehabilitation, because the older person is in a familiar environment, is to work a rehabilitative approach into each individual's activity in their everyday life in order to meet their specific needs. At an organisational level, there is a need for developing services to further support older people's psychosocial needs during rehabilitation. Team performance towards an individual's rehabilitation should come from an emerged whole and not only from the performance of a specific professional approach depending on the traditional role of each profession. A rehabilitative approach is based on 'hands-off' support in order to incorporate an individual's everyday activities as a part of their rehabilitation. ","411":"To explore nursing documentation in long-term care, to determine whether it reflected a person-centred approach to care and to describe aspects of PCC as they appeared in nursing records. Documentation is an essential part of nursing. It provides evidence that care has been carried out and contains important information to enhance the quality and continuity of care. Person-centred care (PCC) is an approach to care that is underpinned by mutual respect and the development of a therapeutic relationship between the patient and nurse. It is a core principle in standards for residential care settings for older people and is beneficial for both patients and staff (International Practice Development in Nursing and Healthcare, Chichester, Blackwell, 2008 and The Implementation of a Model of Person-Centred Practice in Older Person Settings, Dublin, Health Service Executive, 2010a). However, the literature suggests a lack of person-centredness within nursing documentation (International Journal of Older People Nursing 2, 2007, 263 and The Implementation of a Model of Person-Centred Practice in Older Person Settings, Dublin, Health Service Executive, 2010a). A qualitative descriptive study using the PCN framework (Person-centred Nursing; Theory and Practice, Oxford, Wiley-Blackwell, 2010) as the context through which nursing assessments and care plans were explored. Findings indicated that many nursing records were incomplete, and information regarding psychosocial aspects of care was infrequent. There was evidence that nurses engaged with residents and worked with their beliefs and values. However, nursing documentation was not completed in consultation with the patient, and there was little to suggest that patients were involved in decisions relating to their care. The structure of nursing documentation can be a major obstacle to the recording of PCC and appropriate care planning. Documentation that is focused on the 'person' will contribute to a more meaningful relationship between nurses and residents. ","412":"Internationally, the role of the registered nurse (RN) in long-term care (LTC) settings has evolved in response to the demands of governmental and organisational priorities. In stark contrast to the regulatory mandates, a person-centred care approach in LTC settings would require different outcomes, processes and competencies of the RN. This article explores the implications of defining the RN's role in delivering person-centred care in LTC homes. Based on a review of the literature, we present a framework that can be used to gather evidence on the outcomes, processes of care and competencies required of RNs to lead their teams to person-centred LTC homes. The development of the framework highlighted several issues: (i) current measures of quality in LTC settings focus on health outcomes and avoiding adverse events rather than on resident quality of life and well-being, which influences the RN's practice; (ii) person-centred care has emerged as a focus of care, yet measures currently developed are limited, and thus, new outcomes are proposed; (iii) to practice in a person-centred way, RNs must work through others on their team to ensure that staff truly relate to their residents, tailor approaches based on the remaining abilities of the residents and manipulate environments to match the competence of the individual, while focusing on residents' personhood and (iv) competencies of RNs to deliver person-centred care include leadership, facilitation, clinical excellence and critical thinking skills. RNs need to be supported, allowed and encouraged in redesigning their role, to work to their full capacity if they are truly to support person-centred care in LTC settings. ","413":"The need for personhood-focused long-term care (LTC) is well-documented. A myriad of sociocultural, political, nursing\/professional and organisational contexts facilitate or hinder registered nurses (RNs)' capacity to ensure personhood-focused LTC. Complexities derive from the countless interrelated aspects of these contexts, blurring clear distinctions of causality, responsibility and accountability. Context-related complexities were highlighted at a recent international conference attended by invited experts in LTC leadership from six countries (Canada, USA, England, Northern Ireland, New Zealand and Sweden). The group was convened to explore the value and contributions of RNs in LTC (McGilton, , International Journal of Older People Nursing 7, 282). The purpose of this paper is to expand the discussion of personhood-focused care beyond RNs, to contexts that influence the RN's capacity to ensure personhood-focused practices are embedded in LTC settings. Consistent with key topics covered at the international conference, we selected four major contexts for discussion in this paper: (i) sociocultural, (ii) public policy\/financing\/regulation, (iii) nursing\/professional and (iv) organisational. For each context, we provide a brief description, literature and examples from a few countries attending the conference, potential impact on personhood-focused practices and RN strategies to facilitate personhood-focused care. The knowledge gained from attending to the influence of contextual factors on the RN's role in facilitating personhood-focused practices provides critical insights and directions for interventions aimed to maximise RN role effectiveness in LTC. In practice, understanding linkages between the various contexts offers indispensable insight for LTC nurse leaders charged with managing day-to-day operations and leading quality improvement initiatives that promote personhood-focused practices.","414":"Internationally, approaches to the long-term care of older people are changing. New models are being developed that aim to de-institutionalise care settings, maximise opportunities for older people to participate in decision-making and move from a predominant medical model of care to one that is community orientated. The aim of this study is to highlight similarities and differences between the different models that exist and explore the implications of these for the role of the registered nurse in long-term care. We chose three models for review as these represent a range of views of person centredness, each having distinct roots and focus. The models chosen were as follows: (i) culture change, (ii) person-centred practice and (iii) relationship-centred care. The review highlights two key issues - (i) the distinctiveness of different models and frameworks and (ii) different interpretations of 'person'. Firstly, we identify a disconnection between espoused differences between models and frameworks and the reality of these differences. The evidence also identifies how some models and frameworks adopt a more inclusive conceptualisation of person and personhood and do not define personhood in relation to role (resident, nurse and family member). There is merit in the development of models and frameworks that try to make explicit the different dimensions of person centredness in long-term care. However, the focus on the development of these, without sufficient attention being paid to evidence of best practices grounded in the concept of personhood, person-centred care is in danger of losing its original humanistic emphasis. Further, models and frameworks need to take account of the personhood of all persons. Registered nurses need to have an understanding of the concept of personhood to make sense of the various person-centred practice frameworks that exist. Without this understanding, there is a danger that the essence of personhood may be lost in the zeal to implement particular models and frameworks. ","415":"","416":"","417":"Traditional ways of viewing hospitalisation do not always recognise how elements within the hospital environment contribute to disability. Four theoretical dimensions of older adult-hospital environment fit have been proposed in previous research on elder-friendly hospitals: social climate, physical design, care systems and processes, policies and procedures; however, modifiable factors for each dimension are not yet identified. Exploratory iterative design guided by Arksey and O'Malley (2005, International Journal of Social Research Methodology 8, 19) scoping review methodology. We undertook a scoping review of primary research related to hospitalised community-dwelling older adults. Keys search terms and criteria were used to identify relevant articles with modifiable factors extracted from articles meeting study criteria. A total of 66 studies were included and evaluated for modifiable factor mapping. We were able to map all 66 studies to the four dimensions. The majority of included studies described care systems and processes, with little relating to social climate, physical design and policies and procedures. Thirty-nine potentially modifiable factors were identified and mapped to the theoretical dimensions according to four overarching themes: models of care; assessment of potential geriatric issues; targeting care to a specific clinical issue and supporting transitions home themes. The dimensions of older adult-hospital fit help us to organise key features of an elder-friendly hospital and identify potentially modifiable factors. Although it makes intuitive sense to cluster and organise according to the dimensions to help with understanding, this tells us little about the synergy of interactions and hierarchical relationships. Our results highlight the importance of competent gerontological nursing in care for hospitalised older adults and the need for further understanding of the older adult and family as a unit of care. Registered nurses have a leadership role to ensure safe quality care for older people in hospital. This leadership role can be framed in interventions that focus on fixing the fit between what older people need and what the hospital environment provides. Modifiable factors for improvement are within the scope and competency of the registered nurse. ","418":"Providing palliative care in long-term care (LTC) homes is an area of growing importance. As a result, attention is being given to exploring effective palliative care learning strategies for personal support workers (PSWs) who provide the most hands-on care to LTC residents. The purpose of this intervention was to explore hospice visits as an experiential learning strategy to increase the capacity of PSWs in palliative care, specifically related to their new learning, and how they anticipated this experience changed their practices in LTC. This study utilised a qualitative descriptive design. Eleven PSWs from four Ontario LTC homes were sent to their local hospice to shadow staff for one to two days. After the visit, PSWs completed a questionnaire with open-ended questions based on critical reflection. Data were analysed using thematic content analysis. PSWs commented on the extent of resident-focused care at the hospice and how palliative care interventions were tailored to meet the needs of residents. PSWs were surprised with the lack of routine at the hospice but felt that hospice staff prioritised their time effectively in order to meet family and client care needs. Some PSWs were pleased to see how well integrated the PSW role is on the community hospice team without any hierarchical relationships. Finally, PSWs felt that other LTC staff would benefit from palliative care education and becoming more comfortable with talking about death and dying with other staff, residents and family members. This study highlighted the benefits of PSWs attending a hospice as an experiential learning strategy. Future work is needed to evaluate this strategy using more rigorous designs as a way to build capacity within PSWs to provide optimal palliative care for LTC residents and their family members. PSWs need to be recognised as important members within the interdisciplinary team. PSWs who shadow staff at hospices view this experience as a positive strategy to meet their learning needs related to palliative care. ","419":"This qualitative, descriptive study aimed to illuminate professional caregivers' reflections on managing residents' violent behaviour in nursing homes. Violence towards caregivers in the care of older people is a challenge attracting increasing attention in nursing research. However, studies that focus on the approaches caregivers in nursing homes resort to and how they manage everyday care situations involving threats and violent situations are relatively few. The study was based on 41 interviews in which the caregivers reflected on their own courses of action in violent situations. The interviews were subjected to qualitative content analysis. This study showed that caregivers were flexible and in tune with the resident by averting and defusing threatening and violent situations. The caregivers tried to give care in line with the residents' condition, control their own spontaneous reactions and interpret the residents' reactions as communicative signs indicating how they should interact with the resident in the situation. As a last resort, when previous approaches had been unsuccessful, the caregivers took a firm stand, confronted the resident and the violent behaviour more directly, but with respect and with the residents' best interests in mind. These findings illuminate how caregivers successfully can manage threatening and violent behavior in nursing homes by being flexible and tuning in with the resident but also by taking a firm stand with the residents' best interests in mind. To be flexible and in tune with residents, it is important to know the residents' personal histories. This may mean involving stakeholders, such as family members and friends, in the care of residents with violent behaviour. We believe that it is important to involve stakeholders in the care of threatening and violent residents in nursing homes as it is important to get information on the residents' personal history. However, there are risks when interpreting residents' behaviour in light of their personal histories as relatives experiences may be subjective and the information may give the caregivers preconceived ideas about the resident. ","420":null,"421":"This study aims to explore the factors associated with depression among older persons in Macau, in relation to family and social aspects. Depression among community-dwelling older persons in Macau has been shown to be present at high rates. In Chinese culture, depression leads to social stigmatisation, suggesting a need to better understand depression as a sociocultural phenomenon. A mixed methods study was undertaken to identify the key influences on depression among Chinese older persons in Macau. Quantitative (standardised tests) and qualitative (collection of narratives) data were collected from 31 purposively selected participants, all community-dwelling older persons with depression. Depression was common among the participants. The paper reports on the family and social aspects, one of the findings of the study. Informants readily described their thoughts and judgements of themselves in graphic language. As they explored their life stories, family and social aspects emerged as significant influences that associated with depression. In a society and culture that relies on and values filial support, experiences of being widowed, having poor family support and weak social networks appeared to compound and exacerbate depression. These findings highlight that filial support, valued in Chinese culture, is seriously strained by the realities of contemporary society. Yet current government policies rely on and confirm the role of family support. Findings from this study suggest a need for such policies to be reviewed to address the realities of family and social support. The findings have several implications for clinical practice. Firstly, the cultural context of Chinese older persons should be considered and emphasised in nursing practice. Secondly, the root of depression among Chinese older persons is seen to lie in their social, family, cultural and day-to-day living issues. ","422":"Nurse assistants working in residential care facilities need support to ensure that they provide high-quality care for the residents and support for relatives, from admission to bereavement. The aim was to describe the nurse assistants' experience of how an intervention with a palliative care approach, had influenced them in their work in residential care for older people. Fourteen nurse assistants working in three different municipal residential care facilities. Data were collected by means of semi-structured individual interviews following an intervention consisting of study circles combined with workshops. The data were analysed using content analysis. The nurse assistants felt that, through the intervention, they had gained insight into their understanding of the importance of quality of care. This included an increased awareness of, and respect for, residents' and relatives' needs, and an increased understanding of the importance of the outcome of encounters with residents and their relatives. After the intervention, they also felt there was increased openness and understanding between colleagues. However, the nurse assistants also expressed frustration over obstacles to implementing a palliative care approach, such as lack of resources and supportive leadership. The nurse assistants felt that the intervention was positive and encouraged them to provide more person-centred care within the framework of a palliative care approach. Although the intervention was intended to involve and support the management, it was not sufficient. Nurse assistants described lack of resources and supportive leadership. There is, therefore, a need to place greater emphasis on leadership and their support of nurse assistants so that they can provide high-quality care. To support nurse assistants in the provision of care, clear leadership and opportunities to discuss and reflect on issues associated with care, including systematic improvement work in practice, appear to be essential to ensure high-quality care. ","423":"The aim of this study was to test reliability and validity of the Lorensen's Self-Care Capability Scale (LSCS). The assessment of self-care capability among older people living at home is essential for maintaining independence for as long as possible. The study sample consisted of 242 home nursing patients who were 75 + years old and living at home. The responsible home nurses documented their answers. In addition to the LSCS, help dependency, subjective health and demographic characteristics were recorded. Various statistical analyses were used to assess reliability and validity of the LSCS. Reliability of the LSCS was supported by a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.97. Regarding validity, six factors extracted in the factor analysis explained 69.8% of the variance in the group. The extracted factors supported the underlying theoretical assumptions of the instrument. Construct validity was supported by significant differences between groups with expected low and expected high LSCS scores, respectively. Concurrent validity was established by a significant correlation between LSCS and Barthel's ADL Index. This study has shown that LSCS is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing self-care capability in older people living at home. ","424":"This paper presents four phenomenological accounts of pain which describe: the pain at the time of the experience; the meaning the pain had at the time of the experience (reflection in); and the meaning of the experience looking back on it (reflection upon). Specifically, the accounts describe pain that is emotional, cognitive and physical (acute and chronic). By exploring the essence of pain using very personal accounts, we encourage nurses to reflect on how their own understanding of pain and individual responses to pain can impact on how they in turn recognise, assess and manage pain in older people and especially those living with dementia. Paper 1 highlights the under-assessment of pain in older people with dementia. By confronting readers with this paper's phenomenological approach, it is hoped that they will be challenged to address this situation.","425":"There are fundamental clinical implications around assessment and evaluation of pain as well as management strategies for pain that have the potential of impacting and improving client outcomes. It is these principles that have been used to develop a training module on pain and dementia with widespread application to a range of settings. This study serves to provide an overview of this process as it translates evidence of pain in people living with dementia to practice for clinicians working in the field.","426":"This paper discusses how pain and its undertreatment impacts upon older people with dementia. It outlines how the contributing factors to the underassessment of pain are numerous and includes dementia-related factors (such as loss of communication ability) and health professional-related factors (such as inappropriate or non-application of a pain-assessment tool and deficit knowledge regarding pain mechanisms and\/or dementia). Pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment options for pain are noted as important but are not the focus of this paper.","427":"","428":null,"429":"The aim of this study was to illuminate the meaning of older people's dependence on caregivers' help, and of their opportunity to make independent decisions. Throughout the world, the older population is growing, and in Sweden, the system of care for older people is currently undergoing change. Older people in the need of care are expected to live at home for as long as possible. A qualitative and life world approach was used. Audio-taped interviews were conducted with twelve older persons living at home, dependent on daily municipal home help service. A phenomenological hermeneutic method was utilised to disclose the meanings of lived experiences. The findings revealed three themes: being facilitated to make one's own decisions, being hindered from making one's own decisions, struggling for vs. resigning oneself to losing the opportunity to make one's own decisions. The comprehensive understanding revealed that as older people become more dependent on caregivers' help, their opportunity to self-determine is challenged and this is stressful for them. The older persons assess their opportunity to self-determine differently, depending on who they are as a person. The caregivers need an awareness of this, and further research is needed to gain knowledge and understanding of how caregivers can improve the way they support and enhance older people's opportunity to decide for themselves. The findings revealed older persons need to exercise more self-determination and caregivers' need for knowledge to enable this. Further, it indicates a move towards a person-centred approach to focus on persons as individuals and see them as interdependent. The findings contribute to improvements in similar contexts worldwide. ","430":"To explore the caregiving process of family units caring for a frail older family member at home. Previous research on family caregiving has demonstrated the interdependence between individual members' health and family status and suggested the importance of support provided to the family as a unit. However, little research that could be used as the basis for nursing interventions has focused on the caregiving process of the family unit caring for a frail older family member in the community. The grounded theory approach was applied in this study. Eighteen families were recruited using the method of theoretical sampling. Data were collected through face-to-face semi-structured interviews. Constant comparative analysis proceeded with data collection. Two core categories were identified: 'degree of routinisation of daily life' and 'degree of minimisation of competing needs within the family'. The caregiving process was classified according to the core categories into the following four phases: confusion, fluctuating disharmony, stable disharmony and stable harmony. The conditions for the routinisation and the competing needs and coping strategies of the family were also clarified. To lead a stable family life, families caring for a frail older member try to control the competing needs among members and routinise by adopting various strategies. Nurses should support or enhance such family action and interactions. The degrees of daily life routinisation and of minimising competing needs within a family can be used to assess families caring for a frail older member. Nurses can determine the current state of the caregiving family from these two aspects and support family strategies that build daily routines and regulate their competing needs. ","431":"In this article, we explore the gender aspects of long-term caregiving from the perspective of women providing home care for a spouse suffering from dementia. One of the most common circumstances in which a woman gradually steps into a long-term caregiver role at home involves caring for a spouse suffering from dementia. Little attention has been paid to examining the experiences and motivations of such caregivers from a feminist perspective. Twelve women, all of whom were informal caregivers to a partner suffering from dementia, were interviewed on the following themes: the home, their partner's disease, everyday life, their relationship and autonomy. The results of these interviews were analysed in relation to gender identity and social power structures using a feminist perspective. The findings of this study show that the informants frequently reflected on their caregiving activities in terms of both general and heteronormative expectations. The results suggest that the process of heteropolarisation in these cases can be an understood as a consequence of both the spouse's illness and the resulting caring duties. Also, the results suggest that the act of caring leads to introspections concerning perceived 'shortcomings' as a caregiver. Finally, the results indicate that it is important to recognise when the need for support in day-to-day caring is downplayed. Women view their caregiving role and responsibilities as paramount; their other duties, including caring for themselves, are deemed less important. We stress that the intense commitment and responsibilities that women experience in their day-to-day caring must be acknowledged and that it is important for healthcare professionals to find mechanisms for providing choices for female caregivers without neglecting their moral concerns. Female carers face difficulties in always living up to gendered standards and this need to be considered when evaluating policies and practices for family carers. ","432":"Home healthcare nurses in their roles as caregivers, educators and administrators of medications are particularly well positioned to act on a preventive way to be alert of adverse drug reactions. However, knowledge about medication and a professional attitude is required. To describe medication-related knowledge and perspectives of Dutch home healthcare nurses regarding frequent used medication by older people. A cross-sectional study was conducted among home healthcare nurses (n=146) in the Netherlands based on the ten most frequently used drugs by older people. The mean score for total medication knowledge was 76.2% of the maximum score. Most home healthcare nurses (80.3%) felt responsible for improving older patients' medication use. Three-quarters of the home healthcare nurses agreed with the statement: \"By taking appropriate action at the right time, I am able to prevent a medication-related hospital admission\". Although most home healthcare nurses felt responsible for their older patients' proper medication use and agreed with the statement that they played a role in preventing older patients' medication-related hospital admissions, their knowledge regarding medications could be improved. Home healthcare nurses should profit as a professional from gaining more knowledge of medication frequently used by older people. ","433":"Maximising the client's power resources facilitates their ability to cope with chronic illness. Nurses must be well informed about power resources and feelings of empowerment among older people. This article reports on a study exploring power resources in daily life from the perspective of older people in Iran. A qualitative content analysis study was conducted. The participants were selected from older community dwellers in Iran using in-depth, semi-structured interviews to understand their experiences with power resources. Power in older people in Iran is represented by four dimensions: spiritual, intellectual, social and physical. Each power dimension can be divided into intrinsic and extrinsic modes. By maximising older people's power in intellectual, social and especially in spiritual resources, the effect of the loss of physical power, with its deteriorative or depressogenic effect on older people's sense of power and well-being can be compensated for. It is recommended that nurses should plan their interventions to enhance older people's power, especially their spiritual power. Different models of empowering older people should be explored in Iranian nursing care delivery. ","434":"In order to maintain one's state of health whilst growing older, the ability to walk is essential. The aim of this study was to illuminate the meanings of the lived experience of living in an ageing body and using a walker in daily life. Narrative interviews were performed with seven older persons aged 79-95 years. The transcribed text was analysed using a phenomenological hermeneutic method. The key finding of the study was that the lived experience of living in an ageing body and using a walker in daily life was interpreted as 'walking on the edge' based on the themes 'Being vulnerable and dependent' and 'Being confident and independent'. The results highlight the importance of reflecting on this phenomenon as a health care professional while meeting the care needs of older persons who use walkers. Nurses need to consider the walker as a personal and valued possession of the individual and handle the walker in agreement with the older person, placing the walker close at hand with the brakes locked to give secure support. ","435":"One key aspect of person-centredness is striving to understand both the patients' experiences and behaviours from their perspective. These aspects are precisely those that staff in dementia care highlight as causing them most difficulty because the people in their care have major problems expressing themselves. There is thus a need to develop a method to help the staff to achieve interpretation through reflection. The aim of this study was to explore the use of drama as a tool to support reflection among staff working in the residential care of people with dementia. A qualitative evaluation of a programme consisting of three drama sessions with staff working in residential care (n = 10 nurse assistants). Data comprised observations and tape recordings of the sessions, the researchers' reflections after each session and a focus-group interview with the participants. The texts were analysed using qualitative content analysis. The analysis showed that: (i) the exercises stimulate reflection about daily caring practice; (ii) the participants must receive extensive information about the purpose of the sessions; (iii) the research team must secure the defined frames and conditions and have practical knowledge about caring for people with dementia and (iv) the management needs to be stable, committed and supportive. Drama seems to be a valid tool to aid reflection, but several adjustments are needed concerning both the content of the sessions and the methodology. When designing a larger intervention study, it would be preferable to the sessions to be combined with staff support to effect changes in care provision resulting from their increased awareness of the residents' situation and experience. Our results showed that drama can be a means to enhance reflection among staff in residential care for people with dementia. Further research is however needed concerning the effects for the staff's situation and nursing care quality. ","436":"Leisure activities contribute to well-being and health in old age. Community nurses should consequently promote such activities among older persons. To do so they need an understanding of older persons' interest in leisure activities. Social contacts, volunteering and pursuit of hobbies and interests constitute the main aspects of leisure. This study aimed to determine the attitudes of older Germans to these aspects to identify user types of leisure time facilities. A qualitative study was conducted within a community-based project in an industrial town in West Germany. Data were collected with semi-structured guideline interviews and evaluated with qualitative content analysis according to Mayring. With regard to social contacts attitudes ranged from limited need for contacts to being a reliable member in an older persons' club. Social engagement is only found among the latter. Pursuit of hobbies and interest ranged from being a minimal user of leisure time facilities to refined expectations. Inflexible group structures may prevent potential users from participation despite having a programme in accordance with target group needs. Attitudes to leisure activities can be described as a combination of two dimensions: the degree of social involvement and the desired refinement of hobbies and interest. Community nurses who organise social afternoons need to assess these attitudes and should steer social dynamics of in a way that facilitates access for newcomers. ","437":"Few empirical studies have directly examined the relationship between staff experiences of providing healthcare and patient experience. Present concerns over the care of older people in UK acute hospitals - and the reported attitudes of staff in such settings - highlight an important area of study. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES. To examine the links between staff experience of work and patient experience of care in a 'Medicine for Older People' (MfOP) service in England. A mixed methods case study undertaken over 8 months incorporating a 149-item staff survey (66\/192 - 34% response rate), a 48-item patient survey (26\/111 - 23%), 18 staff interviews, 18 patient and carer interviews and 41 hours of non-participant observation. Variation in patient experience is significantly influenced by staff work experiences. A high-demand\/low-control work environment, poor staffing, ward leadership and co-worker relationships can each add to the inherent difficulties staff face when caring for acutely ill older people. Staff seek to alleviate the impact of such difficulties by finding personal satisfaction from caring for 'the poppets'; those patients they enjoy caring for and for whom they feel able to 'make a difference'. Other patients - noting dehumanising aspects of their care - felt like 'parcels'. Patients are aware of being seen by staff as 'difficult' or 'demanding' and seek to manage their relationships with nursing staff accordingly. The work experiences of staff in a MfOP service impacted directly on patient care experience. Poor ward and patient care climates often lead staff to seek job satisfaction through caring for 'poppets', leaving less favoured - and often more complex patients - to receive less personalised care. Implications for practice. Investment in staff well-being and ward climate is essential for the consistent delivery of high-quality care for older people in acute settings. ","438":"","439":"Delirium frequently occurs in hospitalised older adults leading to poor outcomes and frequent adverse events. Proper recognition and management of delirium by acute care nurses can minimise the effects of negative sequelae associated with delirium. This pilot study used focus group methodology to: (i) describe acute care nurse's experience and knowledge regarding assessment and management of delirium in hospitalised older adults; (ii) illustrate potential facilitators and barriers to non-drug management of delirium; and (iii) to explicate the use of non-drug interventions by acute care nurses to manage delirium in hospitalised older adults. Qualitative, pilot study. A total of 16 nurse participants, working on medical, surgical and orthopaedic units from one acute care hospital participated in two focus groups. Main themes included the following: confusion is normal; our duty is to protect; and finding a balance. Nurses were able to identify non-pharmacological interventions for delirium and facilitators and barriers to using these in clinical practice. Findings from this pilot study illustrate the need for regular assessment of cognitive status in hospitalised older adults and nursing staff education regarding the use of non-pharmacological management of delirium. Based on their experience, nurses have a wealth of ideas for managing delirium. Areas for future research and policy are also highlighted. More research is needed on how to improve delirium management by acute care nurses to increase the efficacy and use of non-pharmacological interventions in the management of delirium in hospitalised older adults. To translate these findings into practice, nursing care needs to be guided by evidence-based guidelines to implement non-pharmacological strategies in the acute care setting. ","440":"To describe and test a model for structured nursing assessment and intervention to older people discharged from emergency department (ED). Older people recently discharged from hospital are at high risk of readmission. This risk may increase when they are discharged straight home from an ED as time pressure requires staff to focus on the presenting problem although many have complex, unresolved, care needs. A prospective descriptive pilot study was conducted. Older people aged 70 and over and at risk of adverse health and functional outcome were included. At discharge, and at 1 and 6 months follow-up, a brief standardised nursing assessment (ISAR 2) developed by McCusker et al. was carried out. The focus was on unresolved problems that required medical or nursing intervention, new or different home care services or comprehensive geriatric assessment. After assessment, the nurse made relevant referrals to the geriatric outpatient clinic, community health centre, general practitioner or made arrangements with next of kin. One hundred and fifty people participated, mean age was 81.7. At discharge, they had a mean of 1.9 unresolved problems, after 1 month 0.8, and after 6 months 0.4. Older people receiving home care services increased from 79% at discharge to 89% at 1 month and 90% at 6 months follow-up. ISAR 2 works well in a Danish ED setting and intercepts older peoples' problems. It seems that unresolved problems decrease when a nurse assesses and intervenes at discharge from ED, and at follow-up. However, a randomised controlled test should be carried out to confirm this. Nursing assessment and intervention should be implemented in the ED to reduce older peoples' unrevealed problems. ","441":null,"442":"This is the concluding paper of a three paper publications. Paper 1 focused on specifically understanding what autonomy for older people in residential care means. Paper 2 discussed the various factors that either facilitate or hinder residents autonomy and directed readers to reflect upon their practice. This final paper outlines the findings from the action research phase of a study aimed at enhancing resident autonomy. It describes just one way in which residential care units can work on enhancing residents autonomy and enables the reader to reflect upon nursing practices, which with the right approach can be resident-centred.","443":"As the population ages, the expectations of consumers rise and future care provision for older people will demand that autonomy is operationalised in residential care facilities. This paper looks at international publications related to identifying the factors which facilitate or hinder residents autonomy and directs the reader to reflect on their own custom and practice. There are many factors which both facilitate and hinder the level of autonomy which older people experience in residential care. This paper will discuss the three most pertinent factors that are discussed repeatedly in the literature, and they are as follows: the organisations approach to care, person-centred care and life planning.","444":"Autonomy is an important concept because it brings dignity to peoples' lives, regardless of physical circumstances. The United Nations (UN) Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing emphasises the need to include older adults in autonomous decision-making processes. However, many older people living in residential care find that their autonomy is curtailed. This is largely because autonomy for older people is poorly understood, and hence, nurses working with older people need to become clear about what autonomy is and how it can be facilitated. In this, the first of three papers, the literature is reviewed specifically to establish the meaning of autonomy for older people in residential care as opposed to autonomy in a wider context. This important distinction may help nurses working with older people to begin to facilitate autonomy more effectively.","445":"","446":"Human rights and citizenship are concepts widely used in health and social care literature. However, they are applied less frequently and less rigorously in dementia care. This paper briefly presents these concepts before exploring how they have been applied to dementia care policy and practice. We highlight areas of dementia care where human rights can be violated and citizenship can be denied. We suggest reasons why people with dementia can be denied their human and civil rights and discuss how such concepts provide a way to address cultural and practice change in dementia care. To demonstrate how these concepts can be used to challenge and improve dementia care nursing. This paper contributes to emerging discussion about dementia care nursing by challenging conventional ways of understanding dementia and the care practices that result. Taking a rights-based approach allows nurses to examine inequity in services and address poor practice. Looking at dementia through the lenses of citizenship and human rights provides a way to broaden the scope of contemporary dementia care nursing, to enable nurses to challenge inequity and to develop and improve the direct nursing care offered to people with dementia. ","447":"With ageing demographics, it is important that nurse education curriculum can prepare students to work with older people. To explore students' perceptions of working with older people and the extent to which their preregistration curriculum is preparing them for this role. A qualitative research design, incorporating focus groups in data collection. Four focus groups were held in January 2011, involving a total of 32 students undertaking a preregistration BSc (Hons) nursing degree course. An overt focus in the preregistration curriculum on acute and critical care and perceived deficits in care of older people content left some students feeling underprepared to work with older people and to challenge ritualistic practice. Clinical placement experience and mentor support appeared to be influencing students' decisions about whether they would consider working with older people in the future. Education providers should ensure that students are adequately prepared to work with older people and that students are supported when they observe poor practice. A finding that observation of ritualistic practice could prompt some students to consider working with older people, warrants further research. Implications for practice. Nurse educators should evaluate the content and delivery of their preregistration courses to ensure that the prerequisite knowledge, skills and attitudes required to work with older people are accorded appropriate value and attention. ","448":null,"449":"The growing aging population, with its associated complex needs and illnesses, will in the future become an even more important challenge for the Nordic countries. The aim of the study was to describe and explore the perceptions and views of top-level managers and politicians in regard to an optimal future care for older people during the next decade. The study has a qualitative, descriptive design. Top-level managers (n = 11) and politicians (n = 8) were interviewed in Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway in 2009. The data material was analysed through manifest and latent content analyses. Future care should substantially focus on the individual needs and dignity of older people. The respondents also recommended a preventive perspective on future care. They anticipate that older people's needs will be complex, requiring nursing competence on an advanced level within home care and nursing homes, and point to the importance of leadership abilities and workplace image. Limited resources and the use of health technology will be dominant issues, entailing the need for open-mindedness to reorganise future care. The latent theme expressed was 'A creative willingness to act - but with an underlying worry about the future'. The findings reveal a multifaceted scenario of optimal future care; older people will have significant, acute and complex needs but resources will be limited. In the near future, medical treatment and nursing care for older people at advanced and specialised levels within primary health care will be needed. To meet demands, a clear need exists for the advanced clinical competence of nurses. There is also a clear need to reorganise health care services for older people, develop the leadership abilities of nurse managers and make workplaces more attractive. ","450":"Residential care in nursing homes continues to be necessary for those individuals who are no longer able to live at home. Uncovering what nursing home residents' view as quality of care in nursing homes will help further understanding of how best to provide high quality, person-centred care. To describe residents' experiences of living in a nursing home related to quality of care. The study utilises a descriptive exploratory design. In-depth interviews were undertaken with 15 residents who were not cognitively impaired, aged 65 and over and living in one of four nursing homes. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed by categorising of meaning. Residents perceived the nursing home as their home, but at the same time not 'a home'. This essential ambiguity created the tension from which the categories of perceptions of quality emerged. Four main categories of quality of care experience were identified: 'Being at home in a nursing home', 'Paying the price for 24-hour care', 'Personal habits and institutional routines', and 'Meaningful activities for a meaningful day'. Ambiguities concerning the nursing home as a home and place to live, a social environment in which the residents experience most of their social life and the institution where professional health service is provided were uncovered. High-quality care was when ambiguities were managed well and a home could be created within the institution. Implication for practice. Achieving quality care in nursing homes requires reconciling the ambiguities of the nursing home as a home. This implies helping residents to create a private home distinct from the professional home, allowing residents' personal habits to guide institutional routines and supporting meaningful activities. Using these resident developed quality indicators is an important step in improving nursing home services. ","451":"This study aimed to explore the experiences of healthcare staff of caring for bereaved older people, and older people's experiences of bereavement care. Loss through death of close family members, partners and friends inhibits the physical, emotional and social well being of older people. The rising population of older people and pressure on healthcare services to reduce costs indicate the necessity of developing strategies that enable coping and independence. A qualitative design drawing on phenomenological methodology was used to understand interactions between healthcare staff and bereaved older people. The study was set in hospital wards, general practice and community nursing teams, and care homes. Healthcare staff and a sample of recently bereaved older people participated. Purposive sampling took place to recruit staff with a range of roles, and older people who were 65 years of age or more, and bereaved of a family member or friend for between 6 months and 5 years. Participants took part in in-depth interviews, and data were analysed systematically. Thirty-nine participants were recruited, and three key themes arose from the data: (i) Bereavement care depends on an established relationship between healthcare staff and the patient's relatives; (ii) Preparation for the relative's death may not equate to being prepared for bereavement; (iii) The 'Open Door' to bereavement care is only slightly ajar. The study identified the interactions of healthcare staff with bereaved older people in terms of the bereavement journey. Staff demonstrated awareness of difficulties the bereaved person may encounter and showed commitment to providing support. However, lack of flexibility in services restricts meaningful interactions. (i) Healthcare staff may identify gaps in services in terms of preparing relatives and follow-up post-bereavement; (ii) Therapeutic relationships between staff and relatives enable ongoing support; (iii) Development of practice guidelines is a key consideration. ","452":"This study aims to explore, and develop a greater understanding of the experience of living with age-related hearing impairment from the perspectives of older people themselves to highlight possible recommendations for the improvement of hearing aid (HA) services and rehabilitation. Hearing impairment (HI) is one of the most common chronic conditions affecting older people. HI can have a huge impact on a wide variety of life factors including physical, mental and social health and can lead to a reduction in quality of life. With the current ageing population, the numbers living with hearing impairment in old age is likely to increase. Currently, the diagnosis of hearing impairment in older people can be slow with individuals living with hearing impairment for around 10 years before being diagnosed. The research utilises a descriptive qualitative method in the form of descriptive thematic analysis. Findings are reported from semi-structured interviews with nine participants with self-reported HI, aged 61-93. Themes include; the loss itself, communication, using HAs, isolation, and coping strategies. The results highlight the need for early diagnosis of HI and the development of nurse-led rehabilitation strategies and support services that address the felt stigma and potentially isolating experiences of older people with HI. ","453":"To examine older patients perception of their readiness for discharge from hospital to home and use of community supports postdischarge, including readmission. Early discharge leaves little time for older people, families and professionals to prepare. The perspectives of patients are essential to therapeutic caring; however, few studies have examined patient's perception of their readiness for discharge. A quantitative, descriptive and correlational design was used. Data were collected from older patients (n = 335) at discharge and postdischarge using the Readiness for Discharge Scale (Weiss &amp; Piacentine; Journal of Nursing Measurement, 14, 2006, 163) and a Demographic and Community Resource Questionnaire. At 6 weeks postdischarge, almost one-quarter had been readmitted. Family support had increased, yet a minimal increase in formal services was found. At discharge, differences in readiness existed between the younger and older old. Significant relationships existed between lower perception of readiness at discharge and increased use of informal and formal support post-discharge. Lower perception of readiness had a significant relationship with readmission in the older old. Perceptions of readiness reflect the patient's reality and may be significant to discharge preparation and arrangements for support. Older patients' perspectives should be included in discharge decisions and in individualised approaches by nurses to discharge preparation. ","454":"To synthesise research-reporting literature about multi-professional communication between health and social care professionals within transitional care for older people, with particular attention on outcomes, enabling contextual factors and constraints. Older adults experience high rates of morbidity and health care usage, and frequently transit between health services, and community and social care providers. These transition episodes place elders at increased risk of adverse incidents due to poor communication of information. Integrated multi-professional models of care built on enhanced communication have been widely promoted as a strategy to improve transitional care for older people. However, a range of findings exist in the literature to guide service providers and researchers. Comprehensive literature search and review strategies were employed to identify, describe and synthesise relevant studies. Ten databases were searched in addition to Google Scholar. Specified discharge worker roles, multi-professional care coordination teams, and information technology systems promote better service satisfaction and subjective quality of life for older people when compared with standard hospital discharge. Improved multi-professional communication reduces rates of re-admission and length of stay indicating greater cost effectiveness and efficiency for the health and social care systems. Systems of care emphasizing information exchange, education and negotiation between stakeholders facilitate communication in transitional care contexts for older adults. Conversely, lack of dialogue and lack of understanding of others' roles are barriers to communication in transitional care. Enhanced multi-professional communication, transitional pathways, and role clarity are required to improve the quality, sustainability and responsiveness of aged care into the future. Recommendations for further research include: (i) Investigation of pathways promoting person-centred care planning including the older person, their family and relevant practitioners; (ii) Development of interventions aimed at improving multi-professional communication and transitional aged care with marginalised and socially disadvantaged elders on indicators of equity and access; (iii) Investigation of changing roles for practitioners in multi-professional teams with a focus on community-based teams including nurses specialising in aged care and general practice.

It is thus critical to ensure that services promote healthy ageing and participation.The aim of the study was to explore service providers' perception and understanding of the conditions for participation among older adults who receive home-based care. The study design was a grounded theory, with six focus groups representing different parts of home-based care in two different municipalities. The data were analysed by a constant comparative method following the guidelines from grounded theory. The findings showed how four different conditions influenced the opportunity for participation or could give a push towards passivity. Firstly, the timing of applications for services. Secondly, the older adults and their family's expectations about participation. Thirdly, external factors such as adequate housing and assistive devices. Finally, the service delivery per se could constitute a barrier for participation, because the services often focused on passive help and 'standard packages'. The findings show how factors at the system level, the execution of services and characteristics among older adults and their family may contribute to the individual service recipient being on the verge of being passive. ","458":"In gerontological practice, special observation is a known nursing activity across different settings. The group that possibly are most effected by this intervention are older persons with dementia and\/or delirium. The research literature about special observations in the mental health field is small, more disappointingly there appears to be little published literature about special observations in regard to older persons with dementia and\/or delirium. The aims of this study are to (i) establish the state of current published research on special observations in regard to older persons with dementia and\/or delirium and (ii) make recommendations for research and practice. A literature review. Most literature pertains to adult mental health practice and services. Themes were generated and discussed in relation to gerontological practice. This review has established there is variance in the usage of the terms 'special observation' and 'constant observation'. It concludes that there is no published research on special or constant observations in relation to older people with dementia\/delirium or the purpose of this activity. There is therefore a clear need to establish a research base in the topic. Given the limited evidence, practitioners and managers need to be cautious when writing and implementing policies about special observation. However, until gerontological research is improved, research from mental health nursing will need to be drawn on with caution and the purpose of special observation determined locally. To be of therapeutic value and to be cost effective, special observation should be seen as a skilled nursing intervention and not a passive 'watching' or 'sitter' activity. ","459":"Incontinence is prevalent among older populations and residents in care homes. This paper is a review of descriptive studies that investigated associated factors related to managing urinary incontinence in older people in care homes. A systematic literature review was undertaken. MEDLINE and CINHAL were searched from 1996-2010 using the Cochrane Incontinence Review Group search strings for urinary and faecal incontinence including all research designs. Sixteen studies were identified that reported on associated factors related to comorbidities, management preferences, policies, staff views and knowledge or methodological studies. Non-invasive methods involving toileting and use of pads were common management approaches. No studies aimed at maintaining continence were identified. Factors associated with incontinence need to also be considered when planning and managing care for individuals, and developing and designing systems of care within care homes. Further study in care home populations to change or inform practice and provide effective care is warranted. Preventive studies that maintain continence are required. Older people and their families should be involved with decisions regarding their preferred care, goals, management and outcomes for managing incontinence, promoting or maintaining continence. ","460":"Future patients with chronic diseases will probably remain longer in their homes. To enable family caregivers to meet these challenges, public services and informal support are essential. This study compared social support between home-dwelling caregivers of partners with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or dementia. A cross-sectional study of 206 caregivers. Professional aid was quantified by the services utilised. Informal support from family and friends was rated by the number of helping persons and the degree of social withdrawal. The Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey Form captured perceived social support. For both diseases, increased severity correlated with more utilisation of professional aid. The chronic obstructive pulmonary disease group perceived more social support, reported less social withdrawal and higher numbers of helping persons. Ill partners' aggressive behaviour reduced perceived support. The use of professional aid was negatively associated with the ill partner's level of self-care, and positively correlated with social withdrawal. Professional aid was more utilised by the dementia group and by men. Differences in caregivers' needs for social support were related to their partner's disease. Counteracting social withdrawal, considering type of illness and gender differences may increase the quality of informal care. ","461":"The aim of this study was to describe assessments of older people about patient-centeredness in the long-term care of Estonian hospitals, and to determine correlations between patients' assessments and their socio-demographic characters. Patient-centeredness increases patients' satisfaction and enhances their recovery. Still, patients' opinions are not always taken into account. A cross-sectional study included 111 older people in long-term care of 14 Estonian hospitals. Data were collected in 2008 by means of structured interviews. What patients agreed most was that they were given enough opportunity to carry out activities they were capable of performing themselves. Two thirds of participants had not been sufficiently consulted on who would be providing their care. Half of the participants were not given sufficient opportunity to decide what kind of care was needed and how they would receive it. The more assistance patients needed in daily living activities, the less they considered the care as patient-centred. From the perspective of older people, the patient-centeredness in Estonian long-term care is above average. Providing patient-centred long-term care in Estonian hospitals deserves more attention. Older people should be more involved in decision-making, especially those who need more assistance in daily living activities. ","462":"","463":"Falls are a significant threat to the safety, health and independence of older citizens. Despite the substantial evidence that is available around effective falls prevention programmes and interventions, their translation into falls reduction programmes and policies has yet to be fully realised. While hip fracture rates are decreasing, the number and incidence of fall-related hospital admissions among older people continue to rise. Given the demographic trends that highlight increasing numbers of older people in the UK, which is broadly reflected internationally, there is a financial and social imperative to minimise the rate of falls and associated injuries. Falling is closely aligned to growing older (Slips, Trips and Falls Update: From Acute and Community Hospitals and Mental Health Units in England and Wales, Department of Health, HMSO, London, 2010). According to the World Health Organization, around 30% of older people aged over 65 and 50% of those over 80 will fall each year (Falls Fact Sheet Number 344, WHO, Geneva, 2010). Falls happen as a result of many reasons and can have harmful consequences, including loss of mobility and independence, confidence and in many cases even death (Cochrane Database Syst Rev 15, 2009, 146; Slips, Trips and Falls Update: From Acute and Community Hospitals and Mental Health Units in England and Wales, Department of Health, HMSO, London, 2010; Falling Standards, Broken Promises: Report of the National Audit of Falls and Bone Health in Older People 2010, Health Care Quality Improvement Partnership, London, 2011). What is neither fair nor correct is the common belief by old and young alike that falls are just another inconvenience to put up with. The available evidence justifiably supports the view that well-organised services, based upon national standards and expert guidance, can prevent future falls among older people and reduce death and disability from fractures. This paper will draw from the UK, as an exemplar for policy and practice, to discuss the strategic direction of falls prevention programmes for older people and the partnerships that need to exist between researchers, service providers and users of services to translate evidence to the clinical setting. Second, it will propose some mechanisms for disseminating evidence to healthcare professionals and other stakeholders, to improve the quality and capacity of the clinical workforce.","464":"Falls are an important public health problem for older adults, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality, as well as healthcare costs. Evidence supports the assessment of older adults' fall risks and implementation of interventions to reduce these risks. Older adults are the key stakeholder in preventing falls, but need the support of their informal caregivers, healthcare providers, and community groups. This article addresses the roles of these additional stakeholders in providing and supporting best practices in fall prevention. Together these stakeholders can assist older adults in self-management of fall prevention, based on the preferences of the individual, local resources, and available programmes and healthcare services.","465":"Despite evidence supporting fall prevention methods, fall-related injury and death rates continue to rise. Understanding older people's views on fall risk and prevention will help nurses and other health professionals in the design of fall prevention strategies that will broaden their scope, reach and adoption. This literature review synthesised 19 qualitative and quantitative studies examining older people's perspectives about fall risk and prevention using a social-ecological framework. Three themes emerged about fall risk; fearing vulnerability, maintaining autonomy and independence and interpreting risk. Four themes emerged about fall prevention programs: influence of participant and program characteristics, need for personal relevance and preference, maintaining autonomy and independence and increased support for and access to programs. Implications for practice include individual, interpersonal, organizational and community level considerations for improving fall prevention efforts.","466":"","467":"","468":"The aim of this study is to report the findings of a case study that explored the phenomenon of advance care planning and advanced care directives in residential care settings in Australia. In particular, this study focuses on the experiences of residents' and family members'. Understanding the phenomenon of advance care planning and advanced care directives is vital to end of life decision making. There are few studies that report the experiences of older people and family members in relation to advance care planning and advanced care directives. A case-study research was conducted and data was collected over 7 months involving participant observation, field notes, semi-structured interviews and document analysis. The participants' early experiences with advance care planning were expressed in unpleasant, hostile and negative ways. However, those emotions and concerns were transformed to more stable, amenable and positive attitudes and feelings as issues were resolved. The factors that enhanced or inhibited the transition were described. Older people and families view the end of life with broader psychosocial and spiritual meanings shaped by a lifetime of experiences. Advance care planning led to a different level of appreciation of personal entity and transcendence. However, advance care planning demands concerted action and support by everyone involved.

Information is a vehicle through which people can be enabled or disabled, so it is essential that we ensure that information is available in a way that is accessible and relevant for people with dementia and that it enables personal aspiration and collective identity to be advanced in a way that is to the benefit of those living with dementia. People with dementia need information to support autonomy in making decisions and in acting on those decisions. Information must be provided in a way that is appropriate to the individual and to achieve that requires knowledge of the needs of that individual. However, maintaining autonomy includes, but involves much more than, the provision of information - others need to listen and hear their views and be prepared to act on them. As professionals, we must be aware that the (dementia) information we provide may disrupt the biographical narrative that people with dementia value. Thus, a person-centred approach encourages the sharing of knowledge and information. The (mis)use of information also impacts on the way that society disables, discriminates and applies barriers against people with disability.","472":null,"473":"There are currently 25 million people with dementia worldwide, and this number is rising. Dementia has been highlighted as a major priority for health care and research because of the enormous economical and health burden associated with it. Consultations with people with dementia and carers have highlighted that timely well-targeted information services are a key priority for enabling them to 'live well with dementia'. Despite this, the evidence base for the optimal design and delivery of an information provision service is limited. Findings from randomised controlled trials and other studies have indicated that information provision does confer some benefit in carer outcomes and in the symptoms and well-being of people with dementia. However, there is limited understanding of the optimal design of such a service because of the variety of approaches that have been evaluated, the wide range of settings and locations and the lack of a clear conceptual framework. The existing evidence base supports the importance of an optimised information provision service and strongly indicates the need for a large-scale RCT to identify the most effective and cost-effective design for people with dementia and their carers.","474":"","475":"","476":"The knowledge over time of the health status and changes in care needs of newly admitted nursing home residents is limited. To investigate trends in residents' health status and functional profile at admission to nursing homes and compare rural and capital areas in Iceland over an 11-year period. Retrospective analysis of nursing home data over 11 years (1996-2006). Residents, who had been assessed with the Minimum Data Set assessment within 90 days from admittance (n = 2206). Non-parametric tests for descriptive statistics and linear regressions were used to analyse time trends. The mean age ranged from 80.1 to 82.8, and women accounted for 52.7% to 67.1%. The level of independency indicated intact cognitive performance in 28.6-61.4% and in 42.5-68% in activities of daily living performance. A weak, but significant, linear trend was seen in residents' health becoming less stable, their cognitive performance improving, more pain being reported and greater participation in social activities over the 11 years. Some residents might have stayed at home longer had they been given appropriate home care and the opportunity of rehabilitation. Pain management and social activities are areas where more staff knowledge seems to be needed. Resources to enable old people to remain at home need to be explored before their entry into nursing homes. Whereas providing services at the appropriate level is important for society as well as older people.

Residents with dementia in LTC often display responsive\/protective behaviours during bathing. Consequently, bathing is a source of stress for PSWs who provide most of the personal care for LTC residents in Ontario, Canada. A qualitative descriptive study employing the critical incident technique (CIT) was used. Eight PSWs were interviewed and 24 incidents were collected and analyzed using thematic content analysis. Findings revealed that PSWs experience the following during bathing: managing responsive\/protective behaviours, working with limited resources, and dealing with communication difficulties. Participants used various strategies to respond to these challenges; however, they reported limited strategies to manage the most challenging behaviours. Many of the bathing strategies described by the PSWs in this study are found in the literature about best bathing practices in dementia care. However, it is evident that further work is needed to support PSWs to manage the most difficult physical responsive\/protective behaviours that occur during bathing. This study has clear implications for knowledge translation. ","479":"Little is known of the experience of loss among nurses working with older persons in long-stay settings. The aim of this study was to explore and describe the experience of loss among nurses working in a long-term residential care setting. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) was the method adopted. Data was collected by semi-structured interviews undertaken with seven nurses. The findings revealed three main themes: 'life's final journey', 'family' and 'professional carer'. The experience of loss on the death of an older person is described by nurses in the context of the care they give at end of life, and the relationships nurses developed with the older person's family. Where the older person has no contact with family, nurses become the 'family' and this contributed to the feeling of loss experienced. Finally, the loss experienced by nurses when an older person dies suddenly can often be emotive. Supporting nurses in their provision of end-of-life care to older persons is essential. Nurses' attempts to keep memories of deceased residents alive by remembrance, helps place loss in the context of acknowledgment of the person's life. ","480":"Age-related weakness, or sarcopenia, has been related to functional disability, falls, frailty and mortality. Although it is one of the most common symptoms older adults link to their functional abilities, to date, no studies have explored older adults' perceptions of weakness and its association with ageing. To understand the meaning of weakness for older adults' and their perceptions of its association with ageing. A qualitative descriptive design involved in-depth interviews with 13 community-dwelling older adults. Weakness was described primarily in two ways: (i) inability and (ii) inward turning. The extreme of weakness, as giving up and giving in, which older adults applied to others, not themselves, prompted them to engage in several efforts at staying strong. These included motivating self-talk, achieving balance, keeping busy and active, and self-validating as a strong person. Older adults' perceptions of the association between weakness and ageing were variable and characterized by considerable ambiguity. Nurses must be alert to both the visible and subtler dimensions of weakness. It is important to engage older adults in active strategies that enhance muscle strength while capitalizing on their self-motivating and validating efforts at staying strong.

To describe for later evaluation how older persons with dementia experience dance performances in a nursing home. Four dance performances, based on the recollections the older persons had of different seasons, were arranged in one nursing home. Qualitative descriptive study, with 13 older persons with dementia, four family members, seven nurses and three practical nurse students. Data were collected and analysed using methodological triangulation. Older persons identified dance performance activity as a process. They had a positive attitude towards the dance performance and performers, and they had experiences of different elements of the dance performance. The older persons forgot their ailments during the performances, and the performances evoked various emotions and awoke memories. Some of them had negative experiences of dancing and dance performances. The older persons experienced a common bond with other spectators. Watching a dance performance is an active process for older persons with dementia. Reminiscence about the dance performance gives the older person an opportunity to deal with the experiences evoked by the performance.

To understand how older patients with mild to moderate dementia experienced the transfer from acute to subacute care and settling-in period. A descriptive design was used. Eight patients with mild to moderate dementia were recruited, one to 5 days after transfer. A qualitative method using in-depth interviews was used. The data were analysed using content analysis. Four main themes were identified: 'Settling into a new environment', 'staff attitudes to people with dementia', 'loss of control' and 'family support'. Person-centred care that comes from the perspective of respect for the individual transcends all these issues. People with dementia require more support to settle after transfer. Family involvement can assist in facilitating a smooth transition. Nurses who understand the specific needs of patients with dementia can develop ways of working with patients to ensure person-centred care. More conversations with people with dementia are needed to investigate how this can be achieved. Orientation procedures should ensure that support for people with dementia is optimized during the settling-in phase.

The identification and handling of older victims depended on individual nurses and the involvement of the participants and are based on clinical experience and less on knowledge through professional training and education. The participants emphasised the need for an individualised approach to older victims suspected of abuse. The important role of the nurse managers in the handling of abuse is discussed as well as the need for support of the nurse managers and the staff in community care by increased interdisciplinary collaboration to handle complex cases. The identification and handling of abused older clients are a challenging issue for community care, and more knowledge and support are needed.

Few studies, however, have focused on what helps residents to find a home in long-term care settings. This study aimed to fill this gap. This study aimed to understand older peoples' perceptions of 'being at home' in long-term care settings and the factors that influence these perceptions. Grounded theory guided the study design. Residents (n = 61) living in public or private long-term care settings were interviewed using unstructured interviews. Four categories were identified as critical to finding a home in long-term care settings: 'continuity', 'preserving personal identity', 'belonging' and 'being active and working'. 'Finding Home' was conceptualised as the core category. The potential to 'find home' was influenced by mediating and facilitating\/constraining factors. The Theory of Finding Home was generated from the data. This theory describes the factors critical to 'finding home' in long-term care settings.

The position of Older People's Champion was established in England to help implement the National Service Framework for Older People at local level. This paper reports on the findings of a national survey of older people's Champions. It sets this in the context of developments around health polices for older people. Forty-three of the 209 Champions who participated in this study were nurses. Nurses were the most commonly appointed clinical Champions in National Health Service Trusts responding to the survey; they used this position to promote changes within their organisation and locality. While focusing on the implementation of National Service Framework for Older People targets and requirements, some used their position to work with organisations of local older people and advocated for older patients' interests. Nurses conceived their position as clinical Champions broadly and reported that they used this role to promote service improvements for older people. Those who established networks with other Champions and older people's groups found this useful. Their role as Champions appeared to encourage a proactive and outward-looking perspective and provides evidence of the workings of one model of Championship. Embedding championing roles within organisations may be one way of bringing about change in the way that services to older people are developed.

However, little is known of the effectives of pressure ulcer prevention educational leaflets for older adults. A quasi-experimental uncontrolled pre-test, post-test study of participants' knowledge of pressure ulcer and preventative strategies was conducted. Community dwelling older adults (n = 75) were recruited to this study. Older adult's knowledge was measured pre- and postdistribution of an education intervention. A risk assessment scale was recorded to identify whether this cohort of older adults were actually at risk of developing pressure ulcers. The results indicate that an education leaflet enhanced patients' knowledge relating to pressure ulceration. Printed education materials increase knowledge and understanding which may lend to older adults adopting healthy behaviours. An education leaflet can help older adults and their carers to be more empowered as active participants in reducing the incidence of pressure ulceration.

The extent to which these resident outcomes can be replicated when the abilities-focused approach is implemented by nursing staff under the conditions of day-to-day practice was investigated in this study. The aim was to examine changes in resident outcomes before and after nursing staff' implementation of the abilities-focused approach and the contribution of this approach to resident outcomes. A one-group pretest-post-test design was used. Observational data were obtained from 65 residents with dementia. The data pertained to the implementation of abilities-focused strategies during episodes of morning care and residents' level of agitation, participation in morning care and physical and psychosocial functioning. The number of abilities-focused strategies used during morning care increased at post-test. No clinically important changes in resident outcomes were observed over time. However, the implementation of some strategies was associated with residents' participation in care and functioning at post-test. The results provided preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of the abilities-focused approach in maintaining functioning in people with dementia. Additional research is needed to understand the mechanism underlying the effects of this person-centred approach to care on resident outcomes. Implementation of the abilities-focused approach assists people with dementia to participate in morning care.

Critical appraisal of the literature by using a qualitative interpretation of a translational approach. The literature was thematically mapped according to the criteria of credibility, transferability, plausibility and applicability. No clinical practice guideline was found that directly related to both assessment and management of pain using an algorithm in acute care for older people. Five studies were found to have relevance and were critically evaluated. A critique of the literature shows that an algorithmic approach is feasible for translation into a clinical practice guideline for assessment and management of pain in older people within the acute care setting.

Older adults comprise a vulnerable population for social isolation and its associated health risks. Literature review. Canada's Population Health Promotion Model was chosen as a comprehensive tool to understand and prevent social isolation. Research studies were sought to identify key health determinants and evidence-based options for preventing social isolation. Around 1 out of 6 older persons are socially isolated and three health determinants are of prime importance: (i) income and social status; (ii) personal health practices and coping skills and (iii) social support networks. Evidence-based interventions targeted to these health determinants are suggested. Nurses are a key group to advocate for actions needed to prevent social isolation. Nurses can play a vital role in minimising social isolation through a variety of educational, prevention and political lobbying activities.

Ethical values and morals are important aspects that influence the quality of care. Empirical observational study including follow-up interviews. Twenty-two older patients participated voluntarily in this study. Constant comparative analysis, the core foundation of grounded theory was used. Five categories: being addressed, receiving respect, desiring to participate, increasing self-determination and gaining self-confidence formed the bases for the core category. APPROACHING: Approaching concerns how people become closer to each other in a physical space. It also includes how people become closer to each other in a dialogue, involving verbal or bodily communication. Approaching indicates the ethical values that guide nurses in their caring encounters with older patients. These values are noted by the patient and have an individual value as well as leading to improved quality of their care. The older patient will be confident and satisfied with the caring encounter if the desired components in the nurse's approaching are exhibited.

DESIGN, SAMPLE AND MEASUREMENTS: A cross-sectional survey was adopted. Two hundred and forty-two people aged 75 years and above receiving home nursing care participated in the study. Binary logistic regression model was used to test the effects of the independent variables on home nursing care. Poor capacity to perform activities of daily living and high level of education were directly associated with a high frequency of home nursing care. Lack of perceived social support affected the amount of home nursing care allocated only when feelings of loneliness were connected with poor activities of daily living functioning. Interaction effects revealed that perceived social support influenced the amount of home nursing care in persons with higher education, in persons with low education, no such association were found. No associations were found between coping resources and home nursing care. Impaired capacity to perform activities of daily living was the main reason for care allocation. Education was associated with more formal care. Patients with low perceived social support combined with a low education level was a particularly vulnerable group.

The participants were divided into two groups: those 65 and over (n = 149) and those under 65 and working (n = 271). Data analysis used descriptive and inferential statistics. Patients expressed a desire for individualised care, and gave relatively good evaluations about the perceived support for their individuality and the realisation of individualised care. Differences in the perceptions of individualised care were found between, but not within, the two groups. The older patients were more positive in their evaluations. There is a need for programmes of individualised care that are age-adjusted. As the older population rises worldwide individualised care becomes more important in the care of older people. These findings provide baseline data for the development of individualised nursing care from the patients' perspective.

Palliative care stakeholders recently included more groups in their definition of palliative care; older people constitute one such group. Consequently, palliative care systems, which will serve a large, aging cohort, will require new skills. The first stage in skills acquisition is to gather current views on dying and death. Qualitative descriptive study that uses focus group discussions for data collection; 20 employees in 4 Swedish nursing homes participated. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. The following categories were conceptualised: alleviating suffering and pain; finding meaning in everyday life; revealing thoughts and attitudes about death; taking care of the dead person's body; and coping with the gap between personal ideals and reality. A deeper understanding of the palliative care philosophy is needed to further develop and tailor care for the dying persons in nursing homes. To get public support for palliative care, the silence surrounding dying and death must be broken. Employees must receive education to prepare for all aspects of their work, and management must account for employees' situation when planning the care.

The study aims to explore nurse-older person encounters and relationships within the context of person-centredness. This study involved secondary analysis of interview data originally collected from a commissioned study investigating whole-systems approaches in services for older people. The process of analysis used the Authentic Consciousness Framework. Nurses are often invisible to the patient, unless they are providing care to address a physical need. A sense of rolelessness pervaded the data, when patients were deprived from actively participating in important decisions about their future care. Patients would like nurses to work with them in more transparent ways. Patients are very conscious that nurses are busy and attempt to share the coping with the busy workload by limiting their expectations of the nurse. Person-centred strategies must enhance the capacity of not only older patients and their ability to assert self, but also the capacity of their nurses. Nurses must work to actively recruit the patient in all decision making. ","501":null,"502":"Disease is influenced by the nutritional status of the individual. We have assessed the relationship between nutritional status and food intake among recently hospitalised older people. A cross-sectional study was undertaken with 240 older people in a hospital that provides care for the public and private healthcare systems. Nutritional status was classified by the MNA (Mini Nutritional Assessment) into: malnourished, risk of malnutrition and without malnutrition. Food intake was estimated by the reported food intake during a typical day. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the medians and the correlation coefficient of Spearman to verify the relationship between the consumption of energy, protein and vitamin C and MNA scores. 33.8% were classified as adequate regarding nutritional status; 37.1% were classified as being at risk of malnutrition and 29.1% were classified as malnourished. The malnourished individuals reported significantly less energy and nutrient intake than those at risk of malnutrition or those without malnutrition (P = 0.001). Not all nutrient intake, just some (iron, cholesterol and fibre), were lower in malnourished people. Deterioration of the nutritional status of older people is accompanied by a reduction in energy and some nutrient intake. The investigation of food intake in older people could provide important information about nutritional risk.

With a growing number of older people in Africa, studies on the individual experiences may help to develop care which is more sensitively based on the needs for older people in a changing Southern Africa context. Data were collected through group and individual in-depth interviews and participant observations which involved 16 individuals, aged 52-76. Data were analysed using a qualitative content analysis. The study showed two interrelated themes reflections on life and ubuntu - an orientation towards others. Findings were discussed from the viewpoint of the theory of gerotranscendence, showing similarities as well as differences, possibly due to societal and cultural differences. Shortage of formal care for older people living in poor conditions in Southern Africa, gave rise to the discussion for the need of a contextualized development of gerontological care. To enhance knowledge on the theory of gerotranscendence and develop guidelines for nursing in home-based care\/community-based care in a South African context may be a first step to support older people in their process towards gerotranscendence.","504":"Studies indicate that physical and pharmacological restraints are still often in the frontline of aggression management in a large number of nursing homes. In the present literature review the aim was to describe, from a nursing perspective, aggressive and violent behaviour in people with dementia living in nursing home units and to find alternative approaches to the management of dementia related aggression as a substitute to physical and chemical restraints. A systematic literature review in three phases, including a content analysis of 21 articles published between 1999 and August 2009 has been conducted. The results could be summarised in two themes: 'origins that may trigger violence' and 'activities that decrease the amount of violent behaviour'. Together, the themes showed that violence was a phenomenon that could be described as being connected to a premorbid personality and often related to the residents' personal care. It was found that if the origin of violent actions was the residents' pain, it was possible to minimise it through nursing activities. This review also indicated that an organisation in special care units for residents who exhibit aggressive and violent behaviour led to the lesser use of mechanical restraints, but also an increased use of non-mechanical techniques. The optimal management of aggressive and violent actions from residents with dementia living in nursing homes was a person-centred approach to the resident. Qualitative studies focusing on violence were sparsely found, and this underlines the importance of further research in this area to elucidate how violence and aggressiveness is experienced and understood by both staff and patients. To communicate with people with dementia provides a challenge for nurses and other health caregivers. To satisfy the needs of good nursing care, an important aspect is therefore to get knowledge and understanding about aggressive and violent behaviour and its management.

In Korea, older people receive health care services in acute care settings because long-term care settings are not the norm. Culturally, it is considered shameful to place parents or relatives in a long-term care facility. A descriptive survey design. Attitudes towards older people with dementia were measured in Korean registered nurses (n = 100) working in acute care settings of two hospitals in southern Korea in 2009. The Attitudes toward the Elderly with Dementia (AED) and the Approaches to Dementia Questionnaire (ADQ) were administered to participants. Moderately positive attitudes towards older people with dementia in the acute care setting were found. Two-thirds of the nurse participants (n = 65, 65.7%) working in medical wards demonstrated significantly more positive attitudes than those working in surgical wards (n = 34, 34.3%). Demographics including years of experience in the current unit and in the service, and nurses' position did not correlate significantly with their attitudes. The environment, work routine and technology may influence the likelihood of negative attitude towards people with dementia. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE. There may be conflict between nurses' cultural values and care practices in acute care settings. Therefore, there is a need for ongoing education of nurses in dementia care that may reduce the potential of such conflicts. ","506":null,"507":"This study sought to uncover what nurses perceived to have learned, during their participation in video supported counselling, based on Marte Meo principles, in four dementia specific care units. This was a descriptive qualitative study. Data were collected through 12 individual and four focus group interviews. In addition, supplementary data from two video recordings and one written log were included. Findings emerged through content analysis and re-examination of the text based on the initial analysis. The nurses experienced that they acquired new knowledge about the residents through Marte Meo Counselling (MMC), resulting in improved capability to interpret the residents` expressions, and increased awareness of the residents' competence. New knowledge about themselves as nurses also emerged; they recognised how their actions entailed consequences for the interaction, in turn making them conscious of the usefulness of taking time, pacing their interactions, maintaining eye contact and describing the situation in words when the interaction took place. This appeared to increase the resident's perception of being able to cope. This study indicates that MMC helped the nurses to gain knowledge about how to improve interactions with residents suffering from dementia. Further research is warranted into the effectiveness of MMC. ","508":"This paper presents a critical review of the literature related to the violence staff in care homes experience from people with dementia. It attempts to identify the psychological consequences abuse has on care workers and the implications this has for practice. Abuse in the form of violence or aggression against healthcare professionals is not new. However, when this is from residents with dementia in care homes it is considered to be part of the job. Consequently it is largely underreported and ignored which masks its true extent. The magnitude of violence in care homes crosses cultural boundaries. Fear of being blamed, job insecurity and resignation that abuse should be accepted as part of the job is unique to this care setting. The cumulative effect of psychological abuse leads to emotional exhaustion and depersonalisation which results in care workers emotionally and physically withdrawing from residents. Being subjected to abuse, feeling undervalued, unsupported and lacking essential skills may compromise a workforces' ability to provide person-centred care. A rising ageing population and prevalence of dementia will place demands on commissioners and providers to deliver high quality care. Consistent recording and reporting procedures, dementia specific training and infrastructures to support staff is therefore crucial. ","509":null,"510":"Relocation of persons with dementia might be considered when quality of care cannot be sustained due to increasing needs. Relocation has been studied from the aspects of mortality and morbidity. AIM. To explore the thoughts and experiences of care workers when relocating a person with dementia within municipal sheltered housing. This qualitative study was conducted in Sweden and based on interviews with six care workers involved in the relocation of two persons with dementia. Latent content analysis was applied. The findings of one narrative are summarised in the theme 'Walking the tightrope: trying to balance conflicting needs'. In the other narrative the theme 'Balancing closeness and distance' emerged. Eight sub-themes were identified illustrating the relocation time-line. Relocation from the care workers' perspective is a complex process with conflicting values and practical issues that hinder the provision of good care and security. Supporting next of kin in the relocation decision-making process presupposes time for reflection in dialogue with staff. The risk of moral distress should be observed and support for care workers could be provided in the form of supervision, ethical consultations and local guidelines. ","511":"BACKGROUND; Delirium is a critical, costly, frequently reversible problem in older adults. Findings of previous studies indicate that delirium occurs in up to 65% of hospitalised older adults and up to 80% of terminally ill patients. Few studies address the frequency of delirium in community dwelling older adults and the extent to which delirium symptoms create distress for their family caregivers. To determine the frequency of delirium in older people attending two adult day centers (ADC) in the United States and identify the extent to which delirium symptoms were associated with family caregivers' mental health symptoms, and ways of coping with the older adults' care. A descriptive, cross-sectional design was used. Thirty older adults and their family caregivers were randomly selected from the rosters of the ADC. Only 6.7% of the older adults had a positive screen for delirium. The majority of family caregivers (96.6%) stated that they had no knowledge of delirium prior to participating in this study. Both older adults and their family caregivers need education about delirium symptoms and risks.

We anticipate that nursing homes will continue to be part of the overall long-term care delivery model, but will face a number of challenges if they are to be considered as much sought-after places. This paper highlights three issues in relation to prescribing that have been largely ignored to date, but which need to be considered by practitioners, policy makers and researchers alike: culture; resident-centred decision-making and care at the end of life. There has been growing interest in culture within organisations and how this may influence behaviour and performance. In this paper, we will consider how culture may influence prescribing. Culture is important in how it contributes to resident-centred care and this leads to a consideration on how residents may be involved in decision-making, specifically in the area of medicines. Finally, care at the end of life in nursing homes, particularly in those with dementia, has been shown to be poor in quality, and this also encompasses the medicines that are prescribed. Palliative services need to be developed to meet the requirements of some of the most vulnerable residents in this care setting.","517":"Interventions to improve prescribing in the nursing home environment are many and varied. The critical literature review presented in Paper 1 (Parsons et al., 2011, International Journal of Older People Nursing 6, 45-54) in this series discussed the main issues repeatedly identified as problematic, and this paper summarises the main approaches which have been used to attempt to improve prescribing. These include national legislation which demands documented justification for the prescribing of medicines, medication review, approaches to reducing medication errors, improving communication across care boundaries and assessment teams and alternative service models. It is difficult to make global recommendations as some of these approaches are country specific or have been delivered in different ways, involving different professionals. However, a series of prompt questions have been provided which may assist nursing home staff in deciding whether prescribing is optimal in a resident or if an intervention is required which may lead to an overall improvement in outcomes.","518":"Prescribing of medication is one of the most common interventions that residents in nursing homes will experience. There is little doubt that medication has greatly contributed to improvements in symptom control, long-term management of medical conditions and greater longevity. However, the quality of prescribing has also been criticised and this paper outlines the issues that have proved to be most problematic and have been repeatedly highlighted in the literature. There have been numerous reports of over-use of inappropriate medicines for which there is no clinical indication or for which there is little evidence of effectiveness, and under-use of medicines that would be indicated for residents with certain medical conditions. Residents may also suffer from adverse drug events and enforced or erratic compliance. Some of these problems may arise because of the difficulties encountered by staff or a breakdown in communication when residents move from one setting to another (e.g. hospital to nursing home or vice versa).","519":"","520":"","521":"To describe what characterizes preventive home visits with collaborative relationships among non-disabled home-dwelling older people in Japan. Preventive home visits have the potential to result in improved health outcomes among older people. Collaboration, mutual understanding and trust between visitor and the visited person seem to work as a vehicle, but little is known about which part of the encounters contributes to a collaborative relationship. We performed a retrospective qualitative analysis of visiting records written by preventive home visitors immediately after the visits were made. A collaborative relationship was predefined as a favourable change in behaviour seen in the visited person during the study period. Visitor characteristics were analysed from 248 records where 37 cases of collaborative relationships were documented. The three most important elements associated with a collaborative relationship were (i) visitor communication skills i.e. mastering 'enhancing motivation' and 'having patience and coping with frustrations' in difficult and problematic situations, (ii) professionalism, which includes 'professional instruction and guidance' based on documented knowledge in health and social domains combined with an overall 'caring approach' and (iii) practical actions which imply an 'immediate concrete response to identified needs or problems' and 'individually tailored advice' to suit the older person's daily life. Preventive home visitor communication skills and professionalism, and practical actions after the visits characterized cases, where favourable changes in behaviour were obtained in non-disabled home-dwelling older people in Japan. Education should be emphasized, because preventive home visitor competence may be the most important element of proactive assessment schemes to obtain beneficial outcomes. ","522":"The aim of this study was to make sense of the Swedish concept 'trygghet' by using stories from daily life in a Participatory Action Research project. In Sweden, attempts to implement core values to ensure high quality health and social care for older people are given high priority and concepts such as security and dignity are often used. As concepts are abstract they are difficult to transform into practical work. One group of six assistant nurses and one group of five Registered Nurses working in a municipality participated in Story Dialogue Method and four older women were interviewed. 'Trygghet' was found to be an internal sense - an intrinsic state based on faith and trust in oneself and others called Sense of security. External factors that strengthened Sense of security were to be part of a community, to recognize and be familiar with things and situations and to use various kinds of aids. A prerequisite for the professionals being able to support the care receivers adequately is that they have a sense of security themselves, and that they are allowed to operate in a system that facilitates for the care receivers to maintain trustworthy and reliable relations over time. ","523":null,"524":"To identify and define the concept of home and its meaning in the lives of three older women. For many older adults home is the centre of daily life and increasingly important as a place where health care is delivered. Yet, as a concept, home remains theoretically and empirically underdeveloped. The Hybrid Model of Concept Development was used to interface theoretical analysis and empirical observation with a focus on definition. A comprehensive, interdisciplinary literature review, semi-structured interviews with three older women and case and cross-case analysis were completed. Interviewees spoke of childhood, community, residential, church and heavenly homes. Feelings of comfort and security were associated with residential homes, peace and quiet with church homes, safety and pleasure with heavenly homes. The experience of home as being taken for granted, unselfconscious and unrecognized, became obvious when one woman tried to consciously establish a sense of being at home in her new residence. No single comprehensive and measurable definition was found. However, three major components were identified (place, relationship and experience) and used to define home as a place to which one is attached, feels comfortable and secure and has the experience of dwelling. Every day assumptions about the meaning of home and home as just another place where health care is provided are called into question. Increased awareness and dialogue is needed among health-care providers working with older adults in their homes. Future research needs to explore the impact of home care on the older adult's meaning of home and its potential impact on recovery. ","525":"","526":"","527":"We have been invited to imagine a future where the care for older people goes beyond the current paradigm. This article challenges the fundamental assumptions that underlie current care practices and, instead, promotes systems and processes that elevate nourishing and stimulating relationships with basic dignity, as well as personal agency, in the later days of life. Healthcare professionals still base current care systems on a medical model that emphasises the diagnosis, treatment and cure of disease (Kane RL &amp; West JC, 2005It Shouldn't Be This Way: The Failure of Long-Term Care, Vanderbilt University Press, Nashville, Tennessee). In contrast, we highlight principles of relating that support care to older people during the final stages of life, and promote systems, processes, and design elements that constitute compassionate care. To do so, it is necessary to move from a model that responds to the dominant regulatory environment to a model that is designed in the ongoing processes of human relationships. Specifically, we are including all dimensions of relating including relations among the residents and between and among residents' families, and all levels and functions of caretakers and the community.","528":"There is increasing emphasis in policy, research and practice on the importance of caring in health care. Indeed there is much debate about how to enhance the caring cultures within which health care is provided. This paper argues that a proper systematic analysis of caring practice that works well in care environments may help us to move towards a realistic model for the future which supports staff, patients and families to give and receive compassionate care. The aim of the project was to explore, develop and articulate strategies that enhanced compassionate relationship centred care in an acute hospital setting, caring for older people. Appreciative action research informed the development and evaluation of the project. A range of data generation activities were used to examine what worked well. Following detailed analysis key processes emerged as being central to delivery of compassionate care. Specific action projects were implemented and evaluated to enhance these processes necessary for compassionate caring. Data from the project helped to articulate the special and often hidden acts that make up compassionate care. In relation to the process of 'knowing who I am and what matters to me' data provided evidence of the value of this process and the potential impact to care. In addition data about the process of doing appreciative action research helped to realise its application and relevance in the health care setting. Findings from this work suggest that there are a number of significant processes that help people to deliver compassionate care. These need to be articulated, shared more widely across practice, policy and education so that we can build on this excellent practice. Appreciative action research adopted in this project is an important methodology to supporting practitioners to identify what it is they do well and develop practice to try to make the best caring practice happen most of the time. Academics, policy makers and practitioners should consider the approach of appreciative action research as key to supporting developments in care. ","529":"This paper describes the results of a literature search which sought papers specifically on appreciative inquiry (AI) and older people. The results of this search suggested that there were not many papers which met these criteria, and those that did were more often discussion papers rather than research papers. This lack of publication belies the observation that research with older people could benefit from the positive approach entailed in an AI approach. The reasons for this are discussed in the paper, but the possibility is explored that some authors may be using AI, but not classifying their studies as this. The studies that do explicitly use AI have reported that participants became productively engaged in the process, but there is little evidence that this promising start has been followed up.","530":"","531":"The aim of this study is to investigate student nurses' perception, knowledge and awareness of elder abuse. It is evidential that elder abuse tends to be unrecognized and is often hidden from public awareness. Nurses who work with older people are expected to be knowledgeable of the causes and detection of elder abuse. A quantitative approach using a questionnaire was used to collect data from 245 student nurses from year 1 and 3 of a 4-year bachelor's degree programme. Convenience sampling was used to recruit participants from the two cohorts of the nursing programme. A 25-item questionnaire was used to investigate participants' perception and awareness of elder abuse. Some 47.8% (n=86) year 1 students and 76.9% (n=50) year 3 students perceived that they were not well trained in identifying or handling elder abuse. Year 1 and 3 students ranked the top three most common abuses differently. In addition, 38% of year 3 students thought that it was largely the responsibility of social workers rather than nurses, to deal with cases of elder abuse. The study reveals that nurses-to-be, who are generally expected to be part of the joint force to protect older people against abuse, did not find themselves adequately prepared to fulfil this responsibility. The findings provide useful information from which more comprehensive content about elder abuse can be developed in the gerontological nursing curriculum, to better prepare future nurses by increasing their basic understanding of elder abuse. ","532":"Over the past 10 years, there has been an increase in the literature promoting patient involvement in health care at all levels of the decision-making process. To review the literature on factors influencing patient participation in care with a particular focus on the perspective of older people. Various search engines were used to conduct the review and articles were identified through the following databases; CINAHL, CSA ILLUMINA, Science Direct, Blackwell Synergy, the Cochrane Library, OVID, SAGE, AHMED, BNI and MEDLINE. Research studies ranging from 2000-2007 were selected for inclusion on the basis that they investigated patient participation and\/or older peoples' involvement in health care. Seven key themes emerged from the literature: the concept of participation, the need for older people to be involved, autonomy and empowerment, patients' expectations, benefits of participation, factors influencing participation and precursors to participation. Although patient participation has received considerable attention in the literature, this review highlights the dearth of research from the perspective of older people. There is a general consensus that preference for participation should be assessed and not assumed, and the review offers a sobering reminder that participation should not be achieved at the expense of patient autonomy and choice. Quality care and the most productive use of resources are dependent on the public's engagement with health service providers. However, despite being central to contemporary nursing practice, this review suggests that the reality is not matched by the rhetoric. Future initiatives should focus on supporting nurses and other healthcare professionals to develop the competencies required to facilitate greater participation by older people who wish to become more involved in their care. ","533":"To explore the nature of relationships between nurses and older people within the home and to illuminate the nature and quality of caring boundaries within this setting. Older people are increasingly receiving nursing care in the home. There has been little exploration of the nature of the nurse-older patient relationship within this setting. An ethnographic approach using semi-structured interviews with 16 community nurses and 13 older patients (aged 65 years and over), were undertaken to explore the nature of care relationships within the home setting. The study has highlighted the centrality of the location of care and the concept of 'the home' in terms of geographical and metaphorical meanings. Moreover, the study has clearly illuminated the complex nature of relationships and boundary construction from a number of perspectives. As the location of care for older people continues to move closer to home it is crucial that the implicit qualities that are valued within nurse-patient relationships within this context of care, and which contribute to the quality of care, are recognized and made more explicit at the organizational and policy level. For nurses working within the home there is a clear impetus to clearly define and articulate the full breadth of their role, the nature of relationships and issues surrounding professional boundary construction within this environment. There is also a need for the core qualities that underpin the receipt of care within the home and the facets of the nurse-patient relationship valued by older people to be fully recognized and accounted for. ","534":"To examine how older persons in need of home-nursing care and their relatives experience the discharge process and develop a model that explains the experience. The discharge process has well-known deficiencies and is therefore a challenging issue requiring improvement in many countries. Research focusing on patient-centred factors has attracted very little critical attention. Grounded theory was used to analyze semi-structured interviews with 26 older persons and their relatives. The analysis resulted in a theoretical model that depicts factors determining whether the older persons and their relatives feel prepared or unprepared for life at home at the time of discharge. The older persons and\/or their relatives felt prepared at the time of discharge if their needs were satisfied in the three significant areas of preparation. Not only were the professionals' skills of the utmost importance in preparing the older persons\/relatives, but also the latter's own approach if the professionals were unskilled. A knowledge of the preparation areas and skills can be of use for improving the quality of the discharge process from the older persons' and their relatives' perspective, i.e. through policies, checklists and teaching programmes.

This paper explores the development of a successful and exciting community of research and practice involving a university and an aged care organization in Australia. The community of research and practice is premised on dynamic, contextual and active interaction between research and practice; where the categories of research and practice are not mutually exclusive or static; and where community is more than just a structure to facilitate collaborative research projects. It is proposed that the idea of a community of research and practice is a useful one in terms of seeking to better understand and provide strategies for knowledge translation between researchers and practitioners and those who are both.","547":"In this paper we focus at the level of individual project to explore aspects of the nexus between research and practice. Using a research project that sought to explore and understand care transitions for older people as the vehicle for our discussion, we examine how the process by which a research project itself is thought about, conceptualized, developed and conducted influences knowledge translation and ways to get research into practice, and conversely practice into research. Processes and strategies we engaged in throughout this research project to promote the transfer of knowledge both among and between researchers, practitioners and the wider practice community are highlighted.","548":"Much has been written about the link between practice and research in the nursing and health literature. The literature from fields of practice relating to care of the older person is no exception. Enhancing best practice to effectively meet the needs and desires of older people, and provide an optimal working environment for those providing that care, requires sustainable synergies between research and practice. However, the perception of a gap(s) between 'what we know' and 'what we do' persists in the writing in relation to the care of older people, as it does in healthcare more broadly. Rather than attempting to provide an exhaustive descriptive review of the literature, this paper reports on, and provides an analysis of, two broad thematic areas that are reflected in much of the writing about research and practice relevant to the care of older people. The first thematic area relates to literature that presupposes a linear\/passive view of research uptake. The second thematic area includes literature that conceptualizes research uptake as dynamic\/active. The discussion focuses on what these thematic areas can tell us about enhancing and optimizing synergies and connections between research and practice relating to care of the older person.","549":"","550":null,"551":null,"552":null,"553":null,"554":null,"555":null,"556":"In spite of a considerable body of research in the past decades on what does or does not constitute good care for older people, there are still few studies addressing this question in which older people narrate their experiences of being dependent on community care. This study was therefore carried out aiming to explore older people's lived experiences of what good and bad care meant to them, when it was offered by community care services. Nineteen older persons in three Swedish communities participated in the study, which used a phenomenological-hermeneutic approach. Data were collected through unstructured interviews and Colaizzi's framework was utilized in the analysis of the data. The key theme arising from the analysis was that of being encountered as a human being by caregivers who, through the provision of safe and secure care, provide opportunities for living life as usual. When any of these circumstances are lacking, bad care will be the consequence. As the general intention in society is to ensure good quality of care to older people as well as others, the findings in our study should have important implications for providers of community care for older people.","557":"","558":"This paper explores the role of the nurse in empowering older people at all stages in the disaster cycle.

The group from Sri Lanka (n=9) who had direct experience of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami were asked how they perceived international aid relief and a group of white Caucasians from East Coast USA (n=8) were asked about disaster preparedness. Findings indicate that both groups had similar issues albeit that they were looking at different phases of the disaster cycle and from different cultural perspectives. Both groups identified issues related to, protecting the rights of the older person and preventing loss of independence in responding and preparing for a disaster, mistrust of government and access to resources and all expressed strong feelings of self-responsibility.","560":"Older people sit at the centre of a unique constellation of factors that combine to increase their vulnerability to the negative effects of catastrophic events. The aim of this paper is to explore some of the factors that underlie this vulnerability. Attention will be directed at three broad factors that will be discussed in some depth, namely poverty, long standing health conditions and psychological trauma. The aim is not, however, to provide a comprehensive systematic review of existing research evidence regarding the older person and disasters. This is due in part to the paucity of studies that take as their primary focus the older population and disasters. Whilst poverty, chronic illness and psychological issues are discussed in this paper as separate issues, they are interconnected. A map of the synergies between factors is presented that places the older person at the centre of a network of vulnerabilities. Recommendations for strategic planning and clinical practice are made that address this complex problem.

To explore the influence of gaming workshops on undergraduate nursing students' learning about nursing older people. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used. A survey questionnaire was distributed pre- and postgaming workshops to a cohort of second year nursing students (n=100, 86% response rate). Students (n=9) were invited to participate in a semi-structured interview on completion of their placement. Responses were significantly more positive for the questionnaire postworkshop when compared with the responses of preworkshop. Five themes were identified from the interviews, they included teacher interaction; level of student engagement with the topic; the effect of the teaching method; influence of the workshops on practice; working with older people. Nursing students preferred this novel teaching method to lectures.

This study used an exploratory qualitative design involving personal interviews with geriatric nurse aides. Interviewers carried out 90-minute interviews with 16 nurse aides who worked at an assisted living facility or a nursing home. Of interest was the extent to which established systems for coding interactions could be used to code nurse aide\/resident interactions, or whether new categories would emerge.

The three modes are no visual input (mode 1), vague (mode 2), and clear visual input (mode 3). Standing sequences A and B are defined as supine-to-standing and supine-to-sitting-to-standing, respectively. For a given visual mode, maximal moved distance was significantly greater for older patients than for younger adults with both standing patterns (P&lt;0.0001). Both standing pattern B and clear visual input decreased maximal moved distance in younger adults and older patients. A greater maximal moved distance score indicated a greater fall risk. It is important for nurses to train older patients to turn on the light and perform standing pattern B, when going to the bathroom at night. In addition, it is advisable to confirm the placement of distinct visual markers on the way to the bathroom.

The aim of this study was to gain an understanding of how nursing home residents experienced pain and how it influenced their lives and daily living. The present study applied a descriptive design. Fifteen residents from nursing homes were recruited among the participants in a larger quantitative study who reported having pain. A qualitative method using in-depth interviews was used. The data were analysed applying Kvale's method of interpretive analysis. Two dimensions of pain were identified: physical pain and pain as suffering. These are described in relation to factors that influence the intensity and the consequences of pain experiences. Physical pain may be relieved by various means of pain management. The residents experienced pain as suffering because pain management was not timely, inappropriate, or insufficient and also because of the nature of their social situation in nursing homes.

Data collection was carried out by means of open observations and additional conversations with residents and personnel. Simultaneously, data analysis was performed with open, axial and selective coding. The findings showed that 'patient participation' concerned 'A matter of presence' as the core category. The other categories described as 'presence of personnel' and 'presence of residents', were strongly connected to the core category as well as to each other. Presence of personnel comprised three levels; being there in body, which required physical presence; being there in mind, which required presence with all senses based on knowledge and competence; and being there in morality which was understood as being fully present, as it was based on humanistic values and included the two other levels. Presence of residents comprised 'ability and wish' and 'adaptation'. The presence of the personnel had a huge impact on the ability and will to participate of the residents. Organizational conditions concerning leadership, amount of personnel and routines as well as housing conditions concerning architecture and shared accommodation, could stimulate or hinder 'patient participation'. The study highlighted the great impact of the personnel's presence in body, mind and morality on the participation capacity of the residents.

Person-centred dementia care guidelines emphasize the assessment of individual needs, and where appropriate, the use of non-pharmacological interventions before resorting to pharmacological management. However, dementia care is not consistent with these guidelines suggesting conceptual limitations and reliance on passive knowledge translation strategies. Focus groups and semi-structured interviews with practitioners (n = 24) in two nursing homes in central Canada were undertaken to assess the effectiveness of the drama-based components of the intervention. Our findings suggest that drama was effective as an educational modality, and helped implement the person-centred approach into practice. Significant practice outcomes included: new awareness that residents' body movements and dispositions can convey meaning; seeking biographical information from families; increased time efficiency; and supporting residents' independence. Our findings make an important contribution to person-centred dementia care by broadening the notion of personhood, and by facilitating implementation using drama. As an enhancement of person-centred care, the support of embodied selfhood may significantly improve residents' quality of life, quality of care, and practitioners' care-giving experience.

This study explores the use of life story work to enhance person-centred care with people with dementia. The study investigates how life story work is: understood and developed in practice; experienced by all participants and affects the delivery and outcomes of care. The experience of older people with dementia, family carers and care staff in using life story work was explored within an NHS Health and Social Care Trust. A multiple case study design was adopted within a constructivist approach. Semi-structured interviews, observation, conversations were employed. Life story work has the potential to: enable care staff to see the person behind the patient; allow family carers to uphold their relatives' personhood; enable the voice of the person with dementia to be heard, verbally and non-verbally; be enjoyable for all concerned and enable the person with dementia to feel proud about themselves and their lives. Life story work has the potential to enhance person-centred care for older people with dementia and their families. Taking a practice development approach ensures that life story work can be implemented sensitively and is sustained in practice. ","574":"To explore the relationship between nurses' understanding of dignity and how it is enhanced and developed in their practice environment. Dignity is a ubiquitous concept in an era of healthcare reform yet is referred to almost exclusively in terms of the quality of care delivered to support the experience of the patient rather than the caregivers engaged in the relationships of care. This article focuses on dignity in the professional life of nurses in aged care. This is part of a doctoral study of the implementation of a palliative approach in residential aged care using emancipatory practice development methodology. Constructions of dignity were co-created with participants through creative reflective activities and subsequently analysed using reflexive methods and data from other sources within the study. Constructions of dignity and subsequent actions taken by nurses on their own behalf to articulate their experiences of transforming practice are interconnected with dignity enhancing relationships and emancipatory ways of working in practice development. Dignity enhancing ways of working in an active learning group and workplace have been interlinked with actions that promote person-centredness in developing a palliative approach to care. ","575":"This paper describes outcomes from research titled Leadership in Compassionate Care. The research adopts a participatory action research approach, utilizing appreciative inquiry and relationship centred care. Outcomes of the research are based upon relationships between patients, families and staff. This paper focuses on in-patient care for older people. A range of data generation activities were undertaken including: observation, interviews using emotional touch points and reflective accounts. To highlight outcomes in compassionate care, this paper uses case studies from two participating services. Principles of compassionate care were derived from understanding experiences of patients, relatives and staff and initiating responsive action projects. The aim was to enhance the experience of relationship centred, compassionate care. The process of emotional touch points enabled a richer understanding of experience. In terms of outcomes for patients this involved, enhanced quality of time spent with family and opening up conversations between families and staff. Outcomes for families involved enhanced access to relevant information and the opportunity to make sense of their situation. Staff outcomes were gaining experience in working alongside family to co-create the service, enhanced understanding of the experiences of patients and relatives led to direct changes in individual and team practices.","576":"This research sought to illuminate the distinct contributions made by Registered Nurses (RNs) and Care Assistants (CAs) to outcomes for older people in UK (nursing) care homes and to identify the outcomes of their work. This paper reports on aspects relevant to RNs. Older people living in long-term residential care settings around the world are among the most vulnerable individuals within their communities and those with the most complex needs. Nursing has historically been fundamental in the delivery of these services but, in some countries, the role of Registered Nurses in residential care is coming under increasing scrutiny, particularly in the context of escalating costs and funding restrictions, a questioning of the need for a 24-hour 'health' professional presence in a 'social care' service and a lack of evidence on the distinct contribution that RNs make to outcomes in these settings. A multi-method qualitative interpretive approach, adopting a structure-process-outcome framework and grounded in the philosophical hermeneutics of Hans-Georg Gadamer (2003). For Phase 1 of the study, RNs and CAs from care homes around the UK contributed examples of their work, which they identified as having made a 'significant' difference to older individuals. Phase 2 comprised researcher fieldwork (observations, interviews and documentary analysis) in three care homes around UK. Research participants included RNs, CAs, older residents, relatives, home managers and professionals working in the homes. RN roles in care homes are broad and multifaceted. Distinct outcomes of RN work are consequent to their caring and their knowledge and skills developed through broad experience in a range of healthcare settings. Outcomes for residents from RN work include enhanced personhood and wellbeing, improved health and function, the prevention of problems\/adverse outcomes and enhanced quality of life. RN outcomes have positive impact on relatives, staff and the homes in general. There is potential to reconsider the broad, 'anything and everything' nature of the RN role in care homes identified in the research. However, given the complex healthcare needs of the current resident population, the 24-hour RN presence is deemed essential. ","577":"The aim of the present study was to investigate how residents were affected when an intervention based on the theory of gerotranscendence and guidelines derived from the theory was introduced in a nursing home. The notion that communication is essential in staff-resident interaction is widely accepted both in theory and practise, as is the notion that communicative behaviour influences patient outcomes. No studies as yet have focused on whether residents are influenced by staff use of guidelines derived from the theory of gerotranscendence. The study was explorative in nature and used a qualitative approach. Data were collected through interviews with residents and participant observations; qualitative content analysis was performed. six residents. The study shows that many residents reviewed and thought about their lives, and that this aspect changed during the study period. Some residents' descriptions of their situation revealed that certain changes in social life on the ward had occurred. These changes could be an effect of the intervention. For nurses working in gerontological care, it is a challenge to get to know and provide the best nursing care and individual treatment for each resident; this involves a holistic view helping residents in their ageing process. The use of guidelines derived from the theory of gerotranscendence could help nurses promote positive ageing and constitute one way of treating residents in a more individualized manner. ","578":"To present the nursing outcomes from the evaluation of developments in the care environment in residential settings for older people. The evaluation data reported here is derived from a larger national programme of work that focused on the development of person-centred practice in residential services for older people using an emancipatory practice development framework. A multi-method evaluation framework was utilised. Outcome data were collected at three time points between December 2007 and September 2009. The data reported here were collected using an instrument called the 'Person-Centred Nursing Index'. Heavy workload was the main cause of stress among nurses. Personal and professional satisfaction with the job was scored highest by the total sample of nurses. Nineteen factors were examined using the Person-Centred Nursing Index. Statistically significant changes were observed in 12 of these. In addition, there were statistically significant changes in nurses' perceptions of caring, indicating a shift from a dominant focus on 'technical' aspects of care, to one where 'intimate' aspects of care were more highly valued. The findings highlight the importance of the development of effective teamwork, workload management, time management and staff relationships in order to create a culture where there is a more democratic and inclusive approach to practice and space for the formation of person-centred relationships. ","579":"To explore the experiences of patients and nursing staff of the care received by older people with dementia in acute hospitals. The prevalence of dementia is steadily increasing as is the number of people with the condition requiring acute hospital care. Significant concerns about the quality of this care have been raised. There is a paucity of knowledge about the views of such care from the perspectives of people with dementia and nurses. An ethnographic approach was used and data were collected thorough observation and interviews in one acute hospital in the United Kingdom. Findings suggest that care for older people with dementia in acute hospitals is not always optimum although there are clear exceptions. Generally, people with dementia found the delivery of care and the experience of being in hospital distressing as they did not know what was happening and they were often ignored. Nurses strive to give good care but do not always achieve this. Bourdieu's Model of Practice assists in explaining why care is as it is. There is a clear need to improve current practice. It is imperative that innovative methods of developing practice are implemented and evaluated. Education alone will not lead to sustained changes in practice. Further research into this subject needs to be undertaken. ","580":"","581":"To outline the importance of understanding quality of life (QOL) in people with dementia living in long-term care. To consider several key research questions and some of the challenges and impact of neglecting knowledge transfer. There is a gap between the knowledge in the broad dementia research literature and transfer of knowledge into practice. Quality of life research and transfer of research into practice is one means by which health professionals can inform health and social care policy and improve care practice. There are a number of unanswered research questions in relation to QOL in people with dementia living in long term care. A selection of questions discussed in this paper relate to the impact of staff knowledge of mental health assessment and the importance of therapeutic communication, cognitive training programs and social biography, individual needs, weight and behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), resident choice and the impact of the environment on QOL. Research methods used to assess QOL must not be too restrictive and mixed methods and data from multiple perspectives should be encouraged so that an extensive understanding is uncovered. Potential strategies to assist knowledge transfer in long-term care settings are needed. ","582":"The need for healthcare practitioners to respect the dignity of older people is widely recognised in England, where it has been given attention by politicians, professionals and health service regulators. This article aims to provide examples of how such ambitions may be used in practice development. This article reports the use of five vignettes discussed by dementia care practitioners that explored the areas of dementia diagnosis, lying, incontinence, behavioural and psychological distress, and end of life care. Each vignette promoted discussion of differences of perspectives about the ways to enhance the dignity of people with dementia in hospital, care home and community settings. The discussion confirmed that while dignity may be one quality indicator of good care potentially enhancing quality of life, it is not always straightforward. It may be more easily conceptualised when talking of physical care and treatment than other areas. The opportunity to debate the subject and to discuss practice examples revealed differences of opinion and moral perspectives between practitioners about the use and relevance of the term dignity. These need to be acknowledged in any debates about objective and subjective definitions of quality of life. ","583":"To review contemporary literature on quality of life for people with dementia. One of the consequences of population ageing is the predicted increase in the incidence of dementia. While we can as yet do little to affect the course of the disease, health care professionals are well-placed to intervene to affect quality of life and quality of care for people with dementia. Research into quality of life for people with dementia has grown markedly over the last decade, in line with evolving conceptual and theoretical understandings of this complex concept. While much of the literature continues to focus on assessment and measurement of quality of life, emerging areas of interest are noted, including dialogue associated with personhood; dignity; and dining and mealtime experiences. Literature on quality of life for people with dementia is as diverse as the concept itself. Established and emerging areas of research suggest that this diversity will continue into the future as we strive to better understand quality of life for people with dementia in all its complexity.

The changing context and literature has called for a culture change within emergency department care to integrate principles of older people care into care delivery. There is a paucity of reports describing how geriatric emergency care models bring about a broader change in culture within the entire emergency department. The Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-term Care in Canada established a programme to place geriatric emergency management nurses into emergency departments with the goal to improve delivery of care through development of unique, site-appropriate solutions. Geriatric emergency management nurses incorporate capacity building into their role to develop and strengthen the skills, instincts, abilities, process and resources of the emergency department. Care processes focus on areas of staffing, mobilization, comfort, medication, hygiene, nutrition\/hydration, cognition, environment, equipment and stimulation. Multi-modal educational strategies and advocacy promote appropriate person-centred care. Improved communication among care providers at key patient transition points remains a priority system-level improvement. Geriatric emergency management nurses work collaboratively with the emergency department team to facilitate change in the way that emergency department care is provided to the older person experiencing health emergencies. Known strategies that have been effective in improving outcomes for older people within the hospital and residential care setting can be generalized into emergency department care. Further research into the effectiveness of these strategies in this environment is recommended.

Qualitative data collected from 24 participants in three focus groups who had previously taken part in a diabetes self-management education programme in a community setting were analyzed using an interpretive method. The barriers to adherence to self-management included ageing-related physical and psychological changes, restrictions related to specific cultural factors, lack of self-discipline and poor understanding of self-management. Facilitators of self-management were knowing the benefits of and having a system to reinforce self-management, being the master of oneself by reshaping historical life habits and family support. The perceived barriers and facilitators differed with gender as a result of the characteristics of Korean culture. This study identified the major barriers to and facilitators of self-management adherence specific to Korean older adults with diabetes, which can be used to develop better diabetes self-management education programmes for this population. Korean nurses working with Korean older adults with diabetes can utilize the findings of this study to structure better tailored and culturally appropriate self-management programmes specific to older adults.

The ageing of the population is poised to emerge as a preeminent worldwide phenomenon. It is assumed that even though older adults experience many decades of autonomy and independence, the potential for illness or bodily decline will induce a serious reduction in the level of perceived control in older adult populations. This is a descriptive correlational study using a secondary data base, Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study. Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study is a nationally representative study of health outcomes in the Taiwanese population. Both perceived levels of social control and personal control had a statistically significant relationship with functional health status. Functional health status was significantly higher for urban older adults than their rural counterparts. Personal control and social control were both found to be predictors of functional health status. Major findings are supported by previous studies. Nurses should create programs and plan activities to assist older adults to enhance their perceptions of social control or personal control in order to improve the health status of older adults and minimize associated health care costs.

To examine personal and social correlates to health services utilization among Mexican older persons. This was a cross-sectional study conducted between 2004 and 2006 with 2030 Mexican adults 60 years and older and based on a health services utilization framework. A two-stage cluster sampling with probability proportionate to size was used. Participants were randomly selected and recruited in four metropolitan areas in Northeastern Mexico. Chi-square and Pearson's chi-squared tests and logistic regression were used for data analyses. Significantly more women than men had lost a spouse and were illiterate. Also, females reported significantly poorer health, higher nutritional risk and lower ability to perform activities of daily and instrumental living than males. Predictors of healthcare utilization were: Having a caregiver during an illness; perceiving to have a health problem; being able to afford food, and having children. Predisposing, enabling and need factors are strong predictors of health services utilization among Mexican older persons. In addition, gender differences exist among this population in relation to health status, but not to health services demands.

The emphasis on service users is gradually increasing and, along with this, the focus within health and social care policy, service provision and professional practice is shifting. In UK health and social care policy the emphasis on service structure and provision is being replaced by a focus on outcomes for service users, including outcomes which patients themselves evaluate. The focus of UK Adult Protection services is also shifting from intervention to prevention through developing greater understanding of the factors which contribute to abuse, changing attitudes towards entrenched poor care, identifying preventative services and safeguarding vulnerable adults. Nursing literature is also beginning to acknowledge the evolution of an outcomes focus. This paper discusses the shifting emphasis in UK health and social care in the safeguarding of vulnerable people and in nursing practice. It offers an overview of literature on outcomes. The paper then describes a research study which sought to identify outcomes of care for older people living in UK care homes. The outcomes framework developed through the research is offered, along with a discussion of the advantages of an outcome-focused approach to care and some of the remaining challenges. A case example is offered to illustrate an outcomes-focused approach. Finally, the paper draws conclusions on how shifting the focus of care delivery from traditional problem-orientated approaches and ritualized practice towards the outcomes of care that individual older people choose and evaluate for themselves offers potential towards eradicating abuse and neglect in formal care settings.","592":"The protection of vulnerable people is becoming more understood internationally, and in the UK standards of care for frail older people is now receiving appropriate attention (CSCI 2009, The state of social care in England 2007-2008. Commission for Social Care Inspection, London). Although many people continue to live in their own homes, even when they are very frail, many receive long term care in institutional settings, and are dependent on the standards, practices, belief systems and culture of the staff who care for them. As society becomes more intolerant of sub standard services, more adult protection investigations are being carried out to establish whether frail people are being neglected. Within West Sussex England, the multi agency safeguarding team addressed the dilemma of how to assess the risk to other residents in a formal care setting, when concerns had been raised about a small number of people who are resident in that place. The Consultant Nurse, used intuitive and craft knowledge, including examination of clinical evidence as audit data, collected as part of her practice, to examine how to assess the risk to others in formal care settings where care had been identified as neglectful for some of the residents. This paper uses the reflective framework of Mezirow transformative learning theory (http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Transformative_learning) to examine the development of a neglect risk assessment tool and highlight the issues identified by a consultant nurse in examining concerns about poor care and neglect in formal care settings.

The key barriers to providing optimal continence care for older people points to a need to address change not only from an individual practitioner perspective but also at the levels of the multidisciplinary team and organization. Examples of some emerging implementation frameworks that incorporate the broader context in which change occurs in 'real world' practice are introduced which may serve as useful guides. It is argued that if national and international standards of good practice for continence care are to be achieved, implementation methods have to take account of the complex interplay of patient, practitioner, social and organizational factors that mediate change.","601":"Urinary incontinence is one of the most common and distressing of the conditions experienced by older people. It is not just associated with physical and cognitive frailty but also features significantly in the fit community living population. Urinary incontinence is known to be hidden and under-reported. Yet the needs of older people across the globe in relation to urinary incontinence will increase with the changing demography. Palliative strategies to contain urinary incontinence predominate in practice, although the reasons for this are not fully understood. Conservative approaches including lifestyle adjustments and behavioural therapies form the mainstay of active continence promotion but their routine use by nurses working with older people seems to be minimal. Promoting continence with older people is an area of practice long overdue for significant and sustainable practice development.","602":"As the population of older people increases so does the prevalence of urinary incontinence experienced. Despite its complex aetiology most of the contributing factors are reversible, when accurate assessment leads to the development of a person-centred continence care plan. This selective literature review highlights that a change in perspective among older people and healthcare professionals will enable a focus on bladder rehabilitation and proactive approaches to managing urinary incontinence, even in the very frail population.

While there is consensus in the literature that such relationships are central to caring processes, there is a dearth of studies that have explained how different factors contribute to the formation of relationships. The research reported here aims to describe the nature of relationships and develop an interpretive framework to understand how relationships influence the experience of residents, families and staff in care homes. This paper is based on the findings from a constructivist inquiry. Data were collected in three care homes using participant observation, interviews and focus groups with older people, families and staff. Constructivist methodology seeks to share multiple perceptions between participants with the aim of creating a joint construction. This process, known as the hermeneutic dialectic supported the development of shared meanings as views and ideas were shared between participants. The findings suggested that three types of relationships are developed within care homes: pragmatic; personal and responsive and reciprocal. These relationships are influenced by a range of factors that include leadership, team working and the contributions made by residents, families and staff.","616":"The research reported here aimed to present the stories of care home residents through an interpretative study that was informed by a biographical approach and narrative method. Eight older people who lived in four different care homes in England participated in a sequence of up to eight narrative interviews over a six month period.

They were able to do this to a greater or lesser extent through the implementation of a range of resident-led strategies. The understanding of care home life that was developed through this study offers an alternative biography for living in care homes that is not only possible but achievable. This is a biography of frail older people who are active in reconstructing their life following the move to a care home, and living lives that are meaningful, purposeful and enjoyable. This sits in contrast to the standard biography that dominates current understanding of care home life that of older people merely 'existing' for the most part of their days.

If the domains identified are useful for identifying negative attitudes towards older people, then strategies can be implemented to try and reduce negative attitudes in clinical practice.","692":"","693":"Ageism and sexism have been remarkably successful in portraying sexuality as the preserve of young people and stereotyping older people as asexual. Older people have colluded in the stereotype by passing as asexual and generally keeping secret their ongoing interest in, or expression of, sexuality. The labelling as 'deviant' and associated stigma experienced by people who dare to breach societal stereotypes are recognized as tools used by powerful vested interests to maintain and manage the norms and values of society. Despite the sanctions, people do find ways of resisting, and over time norms and values change. This paper notes the centrality of sexuality to identity and argues that nursing is pivotally placed to recognize and value the older person's sexuality and support older people to 'come out' and re-claim the sexuality of their choice. It provides a provocative vision of how care and attitudes might look in 2025.","694":"Sexuality is an important contributing factor to quality of life and sense of well-being. All adults have the right to express their sexuality, regardless of their age. Research indicates, however, that older people frequently experience barriers to the expression of their sexuality. Many of these barriers are influenced by the health professionals and services that care for them. This paper will outline these barriers and identify strategies that the healthcare professional can implement to help improve practice in this area.","695":null,"696":"","697":null,"698":"Old people of non-western minority backgrounds are an invisible group in Norway in several ways: in the national debate about the ageing population, in geriatric health care services, and in the general picture of ethnic minorities. There is a lack of knowledge about health and care amongst old migrants. This study aimed at exploring nurse managers' perceptions of the content of community health nursing care of older people from non-western countries of origin, and the challenges associated with caring for this group of patients. The study took place in a medium-sized Norwegian community, a mostly urban area with surrounding rural areas. The community health nursing system was organized in six districts with nurses in management positions, covering nursing homes, special housing and home-based care. Data were collected by a questionnaire with structured and open-ended questions answered by 18 nurse managers. The data provided scarce information, but indicated a lack of systematic cultural care assessments. Community health nursing of old non-western migrant patients was described as deficient and a demanding burden. The challenges were captured in four themes: language barriers, family involvement in care, deficiencies in cultural competency and the need for development. Increased competency, action and local responsibility were identified as propositions to manage the challenges. The lack of awareness and knowledge concerning cultural issues found in this study highlights the need for further development and research on this topic.","699":null,"700":null,"701":"This research in nursing management of urinary tract infections in nursing home residents experiencing impaired cognition was informed through qualitative naturalistic enquiry.

Wandering is one of the most burdensome of all the behavioural symptoms and is increasing as the prevalence rates of dementia rise with the aging of the population. Wandering describes a diverse pattern of behaviour from aimless walking and pacing through to elopement. Until recently, the empirical evidence in relation to wandering and its implications for caring for older people has seriously lagged behind other research. However, several studies have led to important advances in the management of wandering and despite there being in some instances methodological deficiencies and modest efficacy, nurses, carers and older people who wander will benefit from the findings.","707":null,"708":"","709":null,"710":null,"711":null,"712":null,"713":"","714":null,"715":null,"716":null,"717":null,"718":"","719":"Tornstam's theory of gerotranscendence provides the theoretical underpinning for two small reminiscence groups that met for eight weekly sessions in a Swedish daycentre. Tornstams's theoretical perspective provides a developmental model for understanding positive progressive changes in values, attitudes and behaviour in the second half of life. Practical guidelines derived from this theory informed the group-work approach used. Participants' opinions about their reminiscence experience were analysed to determine the relevance of gerotranscendental theory as a basis for understanding older people's use of reminiscence in the ageing process. The study aimed at investigating older peoples' experiences of participating in a reminiscence group with a gerotranscendental perspective. The study used a qualitative approach. Older people were invited to participate in reminiscence group sessions arranged at a daycentre. When the sessions were finished, participants were interviewed about their experience of the reminiscence group. Data were analysed and categorized by using qualitative methods. The participants were satisfied with the arrangement of the group sessions. All participants believed they had reminisced and thought much more about their childhood and also recalled other memories from their lives during the period. Three quite different views emerged of the recall experience and effects of participating in the reminiscence group: 'An activity like any other; an activity that led to thoughts about memories from life or an activity that influenced my thoughts about life.' Findings suggest that it is possible to arrange reminiscence groups from a gerotranscendental perspective that serve as an intervention in gerontological nursing. This paper provides some guidance concerning how this type of group may be arranged and the various categories of participant response that may be expected.","720":null,"721":null,"722":null,"723":"","724":"The preceding papers have outlined the issues of under-recognition of delirium, aspects of assessment to improve this situation and presented an alternative discursive construction of delirious patients. With respect to the understandings from the first two papers, the authors intend to suggest a direction for future practice and research in the area of delirium. The discussion will start with an overview of current international practice. Approaches focussing on the specific care of team members or on multidisciplinary care have been reported as well as approaches that focus on a clinical expert such as a nurse specialist or those that focus care of patients with delirium in a specific identified clinical setting. The literature represents variable evidence of the success, or otherwise, of different initiatives. The authors intend to provoke debate on the care of delirious patients and indicate the priorities for the future management of delirium.","725":null,"726":"Delirium is a prevalent condition associated with high morbidity and mortality. Studies investigating delirium date back centuries but the subject has received increased attention in the last two decades. This recent attention focuses on, risk factors, early recognition, consequences and management of delirium. The aim of this paper was to provide an updated review of issues concerning the assessment and identification of delirium. Assessment is central to the effective management but delirium continues to be under-recognized by the healthcare team. This review sets the scene for the following papers on practice and the future direction for the management of delirium.","727":"","728":null,"729":"The aim of this literature review was to investigate studies that actively engage older people with dementia in research 'with' rather than 'on' them. The focus of the paper is the methods that researchers have used to ensure that studies are ethical, meaningful and preserve the personhood of individuals. The intention is to present a selection of papers rather than undertake an exhaustive review. It is well recognized that the prevalence of dementia in older adults is increasing, this increase is reflected by a huge rise in the amount of research into this area. The biomedical model continues to dominate dementia research however there is a small, but growing, body of research that actively seeks to engage people with dementia. This increase in research that actively engages people with dementia has developed in parallel with the 'new culture' of dementia care in which Kitwood (Dementia Reconsidered: The Person Comes First. Open University Press, Buckingham, 1997) exhorts us to respect the personhood of people with dementia. This review identifies 22 studies that sought the views and experiences of older people with dementia. There is evidence in each paper that the researchers had given thought to ensuring that their work was ethical, meaningful and preserved the personhood of individuals. The skill with which this aim was achieved varied considerably from formulaic approaches to those that clearly demonstrate that the researchers have a mindset that is grounded in a powerful belief in, and application of, the concepts of genuine respect for older people with dementia. The examples of good practice that have been drawn from these papers have direct application to both future research and to the provision of clinical care.","730":null,"731":null,"732":"","733":"The provision of palliative care for older people within the next decade will need to be substantially different to that provided today. In long-term care settings the achievement of quality palliative care will require attention to all levels of the health and social care system, in both its formal and informal manifestations. We suggest that long-term care facilities will become the hospices of the future, caring for older people with chronic conditions with a long trajectory to death, the most common being dementia. We see this progression as inevitable and appropriate if the right support is provided. We discuss the impact that transferability and sustainability has had on the present provision of palliative care for older people and how that may affect the future. Four forces which are important factors in public policy; leadership, a culture that supports learning throughout the care process, an emphasis on effective team development and the use of information technologies for quality activities are used as a framework for our vision of social planning. We then go on to discuss the impact of costs, workforce, service planning and public awareness as vital areas where progress needs to be carefully tackled. We suggest some likely poor outcomes if this planning does not occur, but indicate that if planning and implementation is effective then services can provide the kind of care the baby boomer generation seeks.","734":null,"735":"Most if not all of end-of-life care for people living in long-term care facilities is provided within the facility. This type of care is likely to increase with population ageing. This paper presents a literature review of the published literature on end-of-life care in long-term care facilities such as nursing homes, aged care facilities, residential care homes and continuing care settings, published between 2000 and 2004. A subset of literature that focuses on the development of practice and the identification of interventions to promote the provision of end-of-life care in care homes is examined in detail. Twenty-five papers are identified and these address modes of service delivery, the introduction of 'interventions' that facilitate care for individuals, and the development of tools. This work remains largely descriptive. Small-scale work dominates, reflecting the initial stages of knowledge development in this area of work. Suggestions for ways to expand the scope of the end-of-life care development work in long-term care settings are presented, as it is time to expand the horizons of these initiatives to become more rigorous and responsive to the needs of older people and their families in this care setting.","736":"","737":null,"738":"Older peoples' health varies considerably and the number of older people who need hospital care will increase in the future. Traditionally, the focus of nursing care in hospitals is oriented towards diagnosis and treatment of disease, although health and health promotion are inherent in theories and definitions of nursing. This is an important issue in health politics, in new laws and regulations in Norway. However, it was difficult to find research-based knowledge about how nurses work with health promotion and health related to older hospitalized patients. This study aimed at describing older hospitalized patients' experiences of health and health promotion. The study used a descriptive and explorative qualitative design, with an interpretative-phenomenological approach. Ten older hospitalized patients, recruited through purposeful sampling, were interviewed during their hospital stay. The informants described health as Being able to be the person I am, to do what I want to do, and feel well and have strength. Health promotion was described as Being enabled through being the person I am, through information and knowledge and through hope and motivation. The findings may be applied to nursing practice in order to focus on promotion of health as an individual process built upon the unique person's life and situation, supported by nursing care and medical treatment.","739":null,"740":null,"741":null,"742":"","743":""},"articletitle":{"0":null,"1":"Nurses and the decade of healthy ageing: An unprecedented opportunity.","2":"Factors that influence the emotional impact of memory problems in older adults: A qualitative descriptive study.","3":"Informal caregiving from the perspectives of older people living alone in India.","4":"Moving our care home: A qualitative study of the views and experiences of residents, relatives and staff.","5":"Relationship between hospitalised older people's fear of falling and adaptation to old age, quality of life, anxiety and depression.","6":"Formulation-led care in care homes: Staff perspectives on this psychological approach to managing behaviour in dementia care.","7":"The development of the MENTOR_D nursing intervention: Supporting family involvement in delirium management.","8":"Perceptions and experiences of functional mobility for community-dwelling older people: A focused ethnography.","9":"Exploring documentation in Person-centred care: A content analysis of care plans.","10":"Evaluating the use of participatory action research to implement evidence-based guidance on dementia palliative care in long-term care settings: A creative hermeneutic analysis.","11":"Development of a multi-component intervention to promote sleep in older persons with dementia transitioning from hospital to home.","12":"Which objective itch-assessment tools are applicable to patients with advanced cognitive impairments?
