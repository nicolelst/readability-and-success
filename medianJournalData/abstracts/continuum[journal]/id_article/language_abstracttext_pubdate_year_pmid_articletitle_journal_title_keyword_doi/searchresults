Hereditary myelopathic syndromes can be recognized as four clinical paradigms: (1) spinocerebellar ataxia, (2) motor neuron disorder, (3) leukodystrophy, and (4) distal motor-sensory axonopathy. This review illustrates these hereditary myelopathy paradigms with clinical examples with an emphasis on clinical recognition and differential diagnosis.","1":"","2":"","3":"","4":"","5":"","6":"","7":"","8":"","9":"","10":"","11":"","12":"","13":"","14":"","15":"","16":"","17":"","18":"","19":"","20":"","21":"","22":"","23":"","24":"","25":"","26":"","27":"","28":"","29":"","30":"","31":"","32":"","33":"","34":"","35":"","36":"","37":"","38":"","39":"","40":"","41":"","42":"","43":"","44":"","45":"","46":"","47":"","48":"","49":"","50":"","51":"","52":"","53":"","54":"","55":"","56":"","57":"","58":"","59":"","60":"","61":"","62":"","63":"","64":"","65":"","66":"","67":"","68":"An aging population, financial and technical changes, and consumer preference will drive the increase in the types and volume of service clients receive at home. Financial and technical changes will influence the structure of home care services, but home health agencies will continue to partner with primary, acute, and long-term institutional care to provide a continuum of services. However, the health care system will need to allocate sufficient resources to home health if it is to serve an increasing number of more frail and unstable clients. Lacking such resources, home care may not able to contribute appropriately to the continuum of care, and the effectiveness of the overall health care system may be compromised. Challenges to home health agencies' successful operations include decreased resources, changing payment methods, staff shortages, and structural changes in health care systems that fragment care of decrease attention to home health. Home health care's traditional goals of serving clients and caregivers directly and educating them toward health and independence can continue if these problems are resolved.","69":"","70":"","71":"","72":"","73":"","74":"","75":"","76":"","77":"","78":"","79":"","80":"","81":"","82":"","83":"","84":"","85":"","86":"","87":"","88":"","89":"","90":"","91":"","92":"","93":"","94":"","95":"","96":"","97":"","98":"","99":"","100":"","101":"","102":"","103":"","104":"","105":"","106":"","107":"","108":"","109":"","110":"","111":"","112":""},"articletitle":{"0":"HEREDITARY MYELOPATHIES.","1":"Options in caregiver program design: examples from the United Hospital Fund family caregiving grant initiative.","2":"Ongoing needs assessment strengthens family caregiver programs.","3":"Supporting caregivers by teleconference.","4":"Win\/win partnership serves dementia population.","5":"Peninsula Hospital Center: stretching support over the continuum.","6":"Y2K: identifying potential sources of legal liability and litigation.","7":"HCFA implements new patient protection standards.","8":"Long-term care planning: getting residents, families, and staff on the same page.","9":"Managed care: evolution or revolution?","10":"Social work and Y2K--preparing for the millennium.","11":"The Honolulu VA Hoptel: an option for the mentally ill homeless veteran.","12":"Interfaith House: breaking the cycle of homelessness.","13":"Prospective payment in long-term care--a new challenge in assessment and care planning.","14":"Dartmouth Atlas examines lack of prevention in US health care.","15":"Housing for infectious TB patients who are homeless: an alternative housing program.","16":"Improving patient satisfaction through unit-based team case management.","17":"A continuum of HIV services: focusing on the children.","18":"Psychosocial functions and training needs of social workers in nursing homes: a survey.","19":"The role of the social worker in interdisciplinary geriatric teams.
