Patients with skin diseases are often considerably stigmatized and report a limited quality of life and participation. The somatic and psychosocial development of the children is also often severely affected by severe forms of the diseases. The concept of inpatient rehabilitation is, on the one hand, the development of an individually adapted topical therapy plan, which often follows a step concept and is adapted to the severity of the skin symptoms. On the other hand, the disease management of children and affected families is promoted. Specific skills such as dealing with itching, learning of cream and dressing techniques, as well as the targeted application of medical baths with suitable additives are taught and practiced. In addition, the motivation for an adapted dealing with the disease and specific resources is promoted in order to comply better with the considerable psychosocial burdens.The results after the rehabilitation show, depending on the basic disease, not only an improved skin condition but also an improved quality of life and participation.","237":"Aim In Germany all childhood cancer patients and their families are offered the opportunity to participate in a four-week, family-oriented, inpatient rehabilitation program in order to facilitate (re-)integration into everyday life. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of this rehabilitation program on motor performance, quality of life (QoL) and fatigue. Methods Motor performance, QoL and fatigue were assessed in 22 childhood cancer patients and 20 healthy siblings at the beginning (t1) and the end (t2) of the four-week rehabilitation program, as well as 6 months later (t3). Results At t1 significant differences between groups were found in motor performance and physical well-being. Improvements in motor performance, QoL and fatigue were found in both groups. Conclusion Different preconditions must be considered.

Although the number of children and adolescents with chronic conditions is growing, applications for rehabilitation have declined substantially since 2008. The aim of the study is to identify barriers that prevent families from claiming benefits for rehabilitation services and to give recommendations for actions. Methods In this explorative study, guided qualitative interviews with families with children and adolescents eligible for benefits were conducted. The analysis of the transcribed interviews followed the iterative process of content analysis (deductive and inductive development of main and sub-categories). Results 14 families (with 16 index-children) participated in the study. The results showed high levels of psychosocial burden of families and yet barriers to access services on a structural, disease-specific, and individual level. We identified three main topics in which families recommended modifications: (a) information policy, (b) family centeredness perspectives and flexibility, and (c) cross-sectoral collaboration\/health care management. Conclusions Results indicate that families perceive the current pediatric rehabilitation services to lack fitting and flexibility. In general, a new approach of information and counselling, a more family centered perspective and integration of rehabilitation services in a comprehensive and coordinated health care structure are needed.","239":"Comprehensive evidence has been provided for the significant increase in most chronic physical illnesses among children and adolescents. Therefore, early diagnosis and multimodal intervention in childhood and adolescence is required to prevent a chronic course of disease. Thus, patient education is essential for the medical child and adolescent rehabilitation.

Representatives of all degree courses of human medicine in German Universities (n=41) received a pseudonymised standardised questionnaire in summer 2015. The response rate was 76% (n=31). Half of the faculties (48%) stated that they had a teaching and research unit for at least 1 of the 3 subjects of the interdisciplinary Q12. The Q12-teaching of faculties including these units partially differed from the other faculties. Model medical education programmes provide on average 2 semesters more for Q12-teaching in comparison to the traditional programmes. More than 3 quarters of the traditional programmes and all other courses include other medical professionals besides physicians as lecturers. Multiple choice questions still constitute the most common examination type (94%). Nearly all Medical Faculties evaluate the rehabilitation-related teaching but only half of all them have implemented a financial gratification based on the evaluation results. Even 10 years after the implementation of Q12, major variations were demonstrated regarding the execution, content and methods of medical education in rehabilitation. In the future the influence of the National Competence Based Catalogues of Learning Objectives for Undergraduate Medical Education on the Q12-development and the Q12-teaching in medical university education in Germany with foreign qualification will be of particular interest.","253":null,"254":null,"255":"Work-anxieties are often going along with workplace problems and long-term sick leave.

In particular, for rehabilitation facilities, these recommendations stipulated a medical risk analysis to establish necessary hygiene measures, and provide specific recommendations. Based on a large investigation carried out in 21 rehabilitation facilities covering different medical specialties, medical risk analyses according to KRINKO were performed, and the findings evaluated separately for orthopedic, cardiologic, oncologic, neurologic, or geriatric facilities, as well as for all institutions taken together. The overall colonization pressure, i. e. the point prevalence of MRSA and extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative pathogens (ESBL) among hospitalized rehabilitation patients was found to be 0.7% and 7.7%, respectively. Impairment of the intact skin (an established risk factor for persisting MRSA colonization and MRSA infection) was found in 7% of the patients, impaired mobility requiring enhanced level of care in 4.1%, and mental confusion and\/or incontinence (potentially impairing the application of hygiene measures) in 11% of patients. Compared to the total study population, there was an increase in all risk factors in geriatric and neurologic rehabilitation patients: skin barrier breaches (in neurologic and in geriatric patients: 18.3 and 19.2%, respectively), impaired mobility (32.7 and 37.0%, respectively), and mental confusion\/incontinence (24.5 and 28.0%, respectively). In addition, geriatric patients demonstrated an increased overall prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms (MRSA: 9.4%; ESBL: 22.7%). Risk analysis according to KRINKO showed that in rehabilitation facilities with internal medicine or orthopedics specialties, there was a comparably lower risk for transmission, colonization, and\/or infection with multidrug-resistant pathogens, as against institutions with neurologic or geriatric specialty. It appears that in the first type of rehabilitation facilities, consistently carried out basic hygiene measures are sufficient while in neurologic or geriatric rehabilitation hospitals, these measures should be supplemented with additional hygiene measures based on medical risk analysis. Furthermore, for infection control purposes in rehabilitation facilities, patient isolation will be rarely necessary or appropriate.

Most of them related to chapters E (\"occupational therapy, work therapy, other functional therapy\") and C (\"information, motivation, training\"). The change from German diplomas to the international Bachelor's and Master's degrees, and the inclusion of diagnostic and work-related procedures were the main focus of the user feedback. For the revision of the KTL, the user survey provided valuable information. Only by the inclusion of practitioners can the KTL meet the requirements of realistic and comprehensive acquisition of data on therapeutic procedures also in future. ","328":"While a limited number of studies have investigated the prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in medical rehabilitation institutions, almost no data on the colonization of rehabilitation patients with multiresistant gram-negative rods is available. Here we report on a large multicenter study on the prevalence of MRSA and multiresistant pathogens in rehabilitation institutions in the Rhine-Main area in 2014. Altogether, 21 rehabilitation hospitals participated. For all patients, age, gender, previous history of hospitalizations, surgery, previous colonization with multidrug-resistant organisms, use of a medical device, current antimicrobial therapy, and the current infection status were ascertained. On voluntary basis, nare and throat swabs were taken for analysis of MRSA and rectal swabs were tested for extended spectrum betalactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria (ESBL). 50% of 2 440 patients had a history of hospitalization within the previous 6 months while 39% had undergone surgery during the past 30 days. Approximately a quarter of the patients had been transferred to a rehabilitation hospital directly from an acute care hospital, had been under antimicrobial therapy with the past three months, or had travelled to a foreign country within the previous year. Risk factors such as lesions of the intact skin or presence of medical devices were rarely reported (&lt; 5%) within the exception of patients undergoing geriatric or neurologic acute care rehabilitation. 0.7% (15\/2155) of the patients were colonized with MRSA, while 7.7% (110\/1434) showed a positive result for ESBL. The highest prevalence rates for multiresistant organisms were encountered among patients with neurologic rehabilitation (MRSA, 1.3%, and ESBL, 10.2%) or with geriatric rehabilitation (MRSA, 9.4%, and ESBL, 22.7%). In the rehabilitation patient population, the prevalence rates of MRSA and ESBL were found to be in the range of rates encountered in the general population (reported rates for MRSA, 0.5%, and ESBL, 6.3%). The known risk factors for MRSA such as skin lesions, medical devices and previous history for MRSA were also confirmed among this patient population. Direct transfer from an acute care hospital, antimicrobial treatment during the past 3 months, and wounds proved significant risk factors for ESBL colonization. Patients of neurologic rehabilitation and geriatric patients showed the highest rates of risk factors and the highest prevalence rates of multidrug-resistant organisms. It appears to be of importance for rehabilitation hospitals to be geared to the needs of patients with multidrug-resistant organisms, and prevent the transmission of these pathogens by appropriate hygiene measures. ","329":"Structures and practice of psychological units in neurological rehabilitation centres treating post-stroke patients are described. A nationwide survey of psychological services in neurological rehabilitation centres was conducted. Psychologist-patient ratios differed greatly among rehabilitation centres. Post-stroke patients showed a variety of complex problems. Psychological interventions mainly comprised diagnostic evaluation as well as individual interventions and cognitive training. The complex and manifold problems of patients in neurological rehabilitation require a comprehensive knowledge of (neuro)psychological functioning. In order to support appropriate and individual treatment decisions, practice guidelines for psychological interventions in the rehabilitation of post-stroke patients are necessary. The present survey constitutes the basis for developing such practice guidelines. ","330":"Evaluation of the effectiveness of 2 implementation interventions - train-the-trainer workshops (TTT) and written implementation guideline (GL) - in terms of implementation fidelity of a back-training school within inpatient orthopedic rehabilitation. An implementation trial was conducted using a mixed-methods approach for outcome evaluation in 10 rehabilitation clinics randomly assigned to the interventions. Data were assessed by questionnaires and observation forms. Trainers in the TTT condition, as compared to trainers in the GL condition, rated both their patient-oriented back school practice (d=1.37) and achievement of manual-based educational goals (W=0.18) significantly higher. Patients in the TTT condition showed significantly higher treatment satisfaction compared to patients in the GL condition (d=0.44). There were no significant group effects regarding the observed fidelity. An interactive TTT showed several benefits with regard to subjective outcomes compared to a written guideline. ","331":"The \"ParZivar II\" project had 2 aims: optimization of the \"ParZivar I\" intervention by individual coaching of physicians, and evaluation of the optimized intervention. The intervention was evaluated in a sequential control group design in 4 rehabilitation facilities with 3 measurement points. A total of n=279 patients with chronic low back pain participated in the study. The optimized intervention shows the potential to statistically significantly improve proximal outcomes (e. g. goal-centric processes or patient-physician interaction). Regarding distal outcomes, no statistically significant differences were found. The \"ParZivar\" intervention is a suitable approach to increase participative goal setting. Due to the complexity of the intervention, problems of dissemination and the potential for improvement in study design, there is a need for further research.

In the summer of 2013, rehabilitation clinics in Germany were surveyed online on their ICF utilization. The questionnaire covered scope and purpose of ICF use, application of ICF core sets and assessments as well as barriers to the use of ICF. Of 359 clinics invited, 104 (30%) participated in the survey. Of those surveyed, 60 (61.9%) claimed to have taken measures to implement the ICF in their clinic; only 37 (38.5%), however, reported using the ICF in their daily work. The main barriers identified were complexity of the ICF, time management issues and training deficits. Approaches to ICF use are not uniform. There is a need for training programs, and guidance from health care insurance providers could help towards uniform implementation of the ICF. ","335":"The effectiveness of 2 aftercare treatments was examined with regard to patients' implementation of health-enhancing recommendations and changes in psychological distress, as well as mental and physical health. Psychosomatic patients were randomly assigned to an intervention group (aftercare over the telephone or face-to-face) or to a control group without aftercare (n=62) at the end of their treatment. Patients in the intervention group (n=139) were offered up to 4 aftercare conversations during the 3 months after their rehabilitation. Data were collected at admission (t1), at discharge (t2) as well as 3 (t3) and 9 (t4) months after discharge. Patients were asked whether they implemented health-enhancing recommendations, recorded in the discharge report, at t3 and t4. Psychological distress (SCL-90-R) was measured at t1, t2, t3 and t4, mental and physical health (SF-12) at t2, t3 and t4. In the intervention group, more participants implemented the recommendations made at discharge such as sports and exercises or outpatient psychotherapy as compared to the control group. Likewise, participants of the intervention group maintained better their physical health. Aftercare over the telephone and face-to-face did not differ in their effectiveness; however, less time was required for aftercare conversations over the telephone. Aftercare over the telephone seems to be an economical approach to support patients in implementing healthcare recommendations made at discharge after inpatient rehabilitation.

This question is gaining relevance in the context of the billing of services in the DRG system (DRG=Diagnosis-Related Groups), because in paragraph 8-552 of the operations and procedures coding system (OPS), it is explicitly stated that therapeutic care must be carried out by specially trained personnel. To date, empirical results on therapeutic nursing in neurological early rehabilitation are sparse. The objective of the study is to develop a theory of therapeutic care in neurological early rehabilitation. The study is based on the method of grounded theory. Open participatory observations (n=92) and episodic interviews (n=10) with nursing professionals and nursing auxiliaries were conducted in 5 inpatient rehabilitation clinics. The theory of therapeutic nursing includes 6 categories: (1) nursing care, (2) observation\/perception, (3) communication, (4) autonomy and individual needs of patients and their relatives, (5) multi-professional team and (6) prerequisites. The results indicate which aspects are included in therapeutic nursing and the necessary prerequisites for delivering therapeutic nursing. Against this background, continuing education programs reveal conspicuous gaps in the area of knowledge transfer and application in practice. The results of the study should be taken into consideration and integrated in nursing education, both at the basic level and in continuing education. ","339":"To determine if there is a difference between successful and less successful rehabilitation facilities concerning their extent and quality of interdisciplinary cooperation? This analysis is part of the project MeeR, that aims to identify characteristics of rehabilitation facilities related to successful rehabilitation. 6 facilities were recruited based on a quantitative analysis; 3 facilities that ranked as above average and 3 as below average in terms of their success in rehabilitating patients. Comprehensive qualitative data were collected on these 6 facilities. In above average rehabilitation facilities, the extent of interdisciplinary cooperation was higher than in below average facilities; the position of the medical profession was less dominant and there was a wider access to team meetings. Promotion of interdisciplinary cooperation is an important component for the improvement of the success of rehabilitation facilities. ","340":"The paper examines whether patients with neurological diseases and a poor return to work (RTW) prognosis gain more from work-related medical rehabilitation (WMR). Re-analysis of matched samples of 2 randomised controlled trials (N=442; questionnaire at admission of rehabilitation and 15-month follow-up). Linear regression models were used calculating the effect of the WMR dependent on the RTW prognosis. Primary outcome was time of sick leave in the follow-up and physical and mental health measured by the SF-36. As secondary outcomes, strategies of coping skills and work-related attitudes were defined. Only for patients with a high non-RTW risk could positive effects of WMR be demonstrated on mental health, coping skills and the scale \"work as a resource\". In the 15-month follow-up, there were no differences in effects on duration of sick leave and physical health. The results based on this analysis indicate that patients with neurological diseases derive benefit from WMR only if their empirical RTW prognosis is poor. However, this only applies for the mental health in the medium term. Our study confirms the previous findings that suggest different effectiveness of the WMR for patients with different RTW risk. ","341":"The aim of multidisciplinary rehabilitation after total knee replacement (TKA) is to reduce postoperative complications and costs and enable faster convalescence. The goals of fast-track rehabilitation, as a multidisciplinary concept, are to reduce the length of hospital stay and achieve early functional improvements by optimizing the perioperative setting. A literature review was carried out for the years 1960-2013. The search terms were: \"rehabilitation\", \"training\", \"physiotherapy\", \"physical therapy\", \"recovery\", \"exercise program\", \"knee surgery\", \"TKA\", \"total knee replacement\", \"arthroplasty\", \"intensive\", \"multidisciplinary\", \"accelerated\", \"rapid\" or \"fast track\". Only randomized controlled trials and metaanalyses were included. A survey was also performed to assess care as actually offered in orthopaedic rehabilitation clinics in North Rhine-Westphalia. A total of 729 articles were identified of which 11 studies were included. Fast-track rehabilitation can significantly reduce both the duration of hospital stay and costs after TKA. Current studies showed that a better short-\/middle-term clinical outcome might be achieved with multidisciplinary rehabilitation. However, a difference in the long-term outcome could not be observed. Our survey shows that most patients are admitted to a rehabilitation clinic in a state of poor general condition as well as decreased mobility and knee range of motion. Fast-track rehabilitation facilitates a shortened hospital stay as well as cost saving. It probably can be used to optimize the condition of the patient before admission to a rehabilitation facility.

Moreover, additional costs for health care will occur as well. This paper examines the incentives of German rehabilitation centers to implement prevention measures in order to avert MRSA transmissions and infections. Relying on a decision tree analysis, the expected healthcare cost per capita is calculated for the 3 strategies general screening, risk-based screening, both upon admission, and no screening at all. The values of the relevant parameters are identified by a review of the published literature. From the perspective of a rehabilitation center, undertaking no screening at all minimizes the expected cost of treatment while the first strategy causes the highest cost. This ordering is robust with respect to multivariate sensitivity analyses. In Germany, rehabilitation centers currently are not reimbursed for the implementation of additional prevention measures against MRSA. Hence, as our analysis demonstrates, the financial incentive to implement MRSA screening turns out to be rather weak. This could well be inefficient for society because a substantial part of the benefit arising on other agents is not taken into account. Our results can be used to indicate changes in the remuneration system that would provide rehabilitation centers with an appropriate incentive for MRSA prevention. Moreover, hygiene regulations enacted recently such as the change in the Infection Prevention Act or the Medical Hygiene regulations emphasize the significance of an appropriate hygiene regimen, thus fostering MRSA prevention. ","346":"To explore problem patterns of patients with musculoskeletal disorders assigned to and treated with a conventional (CR), behavioural-medical (BMR) or work-related (WR) rehabilitation concept. We conducted interviews with 8 patients per concept, focus groups with 2 rehabilitation teams and 1 focus group with socio-medical assessors. For the interviews patients with chronic back pain were included, receiving inpatient rehabilitation. Data was examined by qualitative content analysis. We identified 7 problem patterns (one typical for patients in CR, 3 typical for specified subgroups in BMR resp. WR), differing in psychological co-morbidity, limitations of work-related activities and participation, psychosocial stress and pain. On the basis of detailed characterizations of these patterns, we developed recommendations for access and treatment management. The study specifies and demarcates different problem patterns in orthopedic rehabilitation and, therefore helps to further improve access management and treatment adequacy. Future studies should verify the generated findings on representative samples. ","347":"To check the intelligibility of informational texts written for rehabilitation patients. Most investigated texts came from rehabilitation providers, patient organizations and health portals (8 texts), and from 50 rehabilitation facilities for musculoskeletal conditions (145 texts). We added a self-written booklet in plain language. All texts dealt with the goals and substance of rehabilitation. Readability formulas were computed for each text, and the Hamburg approach to intelligibility was applied. Only highly educated people will find the documents easily to understand, except for our self-written booklet, which is also comprehensible to lower secondary school leavers. The informational texts are of little help for people who are undecided whether or not to participate in rehabilitative measures and for rehab patients in preparatory stages. Issuing organizations are overburdened with the task of wording in a comprehensible manner, and should consider seeking assistance by professional writers or providing training for their staff.

We conducted a systematic literature search in the scientific databases (EMBASE, Medline, PsycInfo, PSYNDEX) and screened relevant conference proceedings since 2001. From abstracts fitting our inclusion criteria we reviewed full texts. Identified assessments were compared regarding their operationalization of the ICF. Out of 440 identified abstracts we selected 8 assessment instruments for interviewer-, proxy- or self-assessment. Two were generic and six disease-specific scales.

Thus possibilities were created to facilitate care for people requiring nursing within the rehabilitation hospital while the informal caregiver is treated. On behalf of the German Ministry of Health the BQS Institute of Quality and Patient Safety analysed what specific offers for this target group are available in the rehabilitation setting and to what extent the requirements of the new law are already implemented. To identify those specific offers for informal caregivers, a nationwide e-mail survey was conducted in 1,167 rehabilitation hospitals in Germany which was complemented with an internet research. Additionally semi-standardised interviews with 28 experts in different specialty fields as well as a literature research were conducted. 31 rehabilitation hospitals were identified, which provide specific measures for informal caregivers and 53 hospitals which provide care for the dependent person, too (overlaps are possible). By providing those offers, the providers are in unchartered waters in regard to concepts. Usually providers are relating to already existing measures in their indication areas and extend those through specific measures.

The gross sample was restricted to persons, who received sick leave benefits in the previous year while not claiming or utilizing any rehabilitation services for the previous 4 years. 1,261 men and 1,495 women were included in the analyses. The odds of an intended disability pension claim were 4.8-times higher in men and 3.4-times higher in women if RI-DP scores were high. Furthermore, high RI-DP scores were also associated with frequent disability days, poor self-rated work ability and frequent visits to physicians.

Due to this fact, it was chosen for translation and subsequent validation. In this multi-centered study, 93 first-time stroke patients were contacted during their inpatient rehabilitation (rehabilitation phases C and D). Postal surveys were then conducted twice 4-6 months after the initial stroke.

Furthermore, experts, dropouts and participants were interviewed and group discussions with experts and participants were conducted. Drop-out is not a definite term. Instead, it consists of different dimensions. 3 personal factors for predicting a drop-out could be identified: suffering from depression, negative health assessment and lack of social support. Generally speaking, drop-out of vocational retraining is a complex and mainly situational process which can hardly be predicted by personal factors, job-biographies or foregoing unemployment. ","362":"The aftercare-program new credo was developed interdisciplinary and with practical orientation for rehabilitation patients with chronic back pain. The concept focuses on rehabilitation aftercare from the beginning of rehabilitation treatment and includes a long-term support of rehabilitation patients after inpatient rehabilitation. A multi-center, controlled longitudinal study demonstrated that participants in the intervention group (IG) implemented significantly better rehabilitation contents and objectives in everyday life and had significant better long-term effects. Anyway, there are participants who don't benefit from the new credo as they begin rehabilitation treatment with low impairments. Assuming that rehabilitation patients with lower impairments need a less comprehensive rehabilitation aftercare compared to those with higher impairments, a follow-up study including a flexible aftercare strategy was conducted. Thereby it is investigated whether the IG achieves more sustainable effects despite of less aftercare compared to the control group (CG) without the aftercare program. A prospective controlled longitudinal study in 2 rehabilitation clinics with 3 points of measurement was conducted. The flexibilization of the aftercare program was based on the level of impairment in the main outcome variable functional limitation in activities of daily living (FFbH-R) and restriction in participation (IMET) at the beginning of rehabilitation. Both questionnaires have been used in numerous studies successfully. Rehabilitation patients with low impairments received only the elements of the new credo during inpatient rehabilitation, rehabilitation patients with relevant impairments received the entire new credo over a period of 12 month after inpatient rehabilitation. The effects were evaluated with data from the CG of the primary study [Deck et al., 2012]. This sample was also divided according to their impairments. Rehabilitation patients with no relevant impairments were included in the analysis (IG N=81, KG N=157). Regarding the long-term effects for the primary outcome variable FFbH-R a significant positive intragroup-effect was detected for the IG, the CG reached the initial value 12 month after inpatient rehabilitation. For the IMET a significant intragroup-effect is also visible in the IG, the CG does not change over the period of time. For both primary outcomes, there are no significant interaction effects to be observed. With respect to the secondary outcomes, in the IG significant small to moderate intragroup-effects were determined in all outcomes, the CG achieved for half of those outcomes significant small intragroup-effects. Rehabilitation patients, who begin rehabilitation with rather low impairments perpetuate their rehabilitation effects with an even reduced aftercare. Aftercare-programs should therefore be adapted to the individual needs. Rehabilitation patient, who start the rehabilitation with relative good health, seem not to have an added value from an intensive aftercare-program. ","363":"Parkinson syndromes (PS) represent frequent neurodegenerative disorders. The demographic change suggests an increasing prevalence of PS in the near future. Treatment expenses, early retirement and need of long-term care result in rising public health care expenditures. Standardised concepts of care do not only improve the quality of patient-centered care, but also help to minimize its consequential costs. Their implementation requires profound knowledge of therapeutic strategies and sociomedical regulations. Medical treatment and sociomedical care have to be regularly reevaluated and adapted to the patient's needs and disease severity. An optimal therapy concept guarantees the patient's long term social integration and improves the compliance.

Our findings document severe preoperative handicaps and identified a variety of sports activities which were practiced before treatment. The most emphasized motive was the social function of sports. The main barriers were the self-definition as a sick and elderly person and insecurity and concerns over the course of illness and healing. Very constraining advises on sports activities without consideration of the individual experience in sports were not perceived as helpful. Counselling on sports activities following joint replacement needs to consider individual motives, barriers and previous sports experience in order to be perceived as supportive.

ANOVAs (analysis of variance) showed that warned claimants had significantly higher scores in total assets in symptom scales of the HEALTH-49 as well as the SIMS compared to the unwarned claimants. Warned persons showed higher odds for an invalid value in the SIMS.

Rehabilitation patients from the intervention group reported significantly better implementation of rehabilitation contents and objectives in everyday life during 12 months after their rehabilitation stay. Better long-term effects were also detectable. Anyway, not all rehabilitation patients seemed to benefit from the intervention. The present analysis focuses on this subgroup: How do rehabilitation patients that do not benefit from the \"new credo\" differ from rehabilitation patients that draw advantage from it? Data from a controlled study were used for secondary analysis. 3 clinics implemented the \"new credo\". Primary outcomes were: participation constraints (IMET) and functional disabilities in everyday life (FFbH-R). The intervention clinics recruited a total of 166 rehabilitation patients. Data from 163 cases could be analyzed using quantitative methods. In addition, interview data from 7 unsuccessful rehabilitation patients was analyzed qualitatively. 102 (63%) rehabilitation patients improved their values in FFbH-R or IMET by at least 0.3 effect sizes (successful group). Among the 61 unsuccessful rehabilitation patients, 17 (10%) started rehabilitation with initial values that high that they could not reach the fixed minimal improvement criteria (\"low burdened\" group). They were excluded from further analysis. The remain-ing 44 (27%) rehabilitation patients constitute the \"unsuccessful\" group.Both groups have comparable levels of impairment concerning somatic and psychosocial parameters.At the end of the rehabilitation stay the \"unsuccessful\" group reached improvements of moderate to large effect sizes concerning the recorded health parameters. One year after rehabilitation \"unsuccessful\" rehabilitation patients fall back to their baseline levels of impairment, while the successful maintain their achieved effects after rehabilita-tion. The 2 groups rated several aspects of the intervention differently and the \"unsuccessful\" group rated the preparation for the time after the rehabilitation worse.The number of perceived aftercare elements proves to be the strongest predictor of failure in multivariate evaluation; \"clinic facilities\" is the only other independent predictor.During the interviews, \"unsuccessful\" patients reported different individual barriers for implementation of physical activity in daily life. Rehabilitation patients, who did not benefit from the new rehabilitation and aftercare concept, did neither differ in sociodemographic nor in disease-specific characteristics from the successful rehabilitation patients. However, differences in the implementation of the new rehabilitation philosophy and its individual components in the rehabilitation clinics are significantly associated with the occurrence of success or failure.

The \"Score of Independence for Neurologic and Geriatric Rehabilitation (SINGER)\" was developed to compensate the weaknesses of the established instruments and to facilitate a direct connection to the ICF. The results of the original validation study of the SINGER in an inpatient setting recommended a test of the SINGER also in an outpatient setting. The SINGER has been applied in a multicentric validation study. Patients of 17 outpatient rehabilitation centres were included consecutively. In this study patients with stroke or TBI were asked to fill in a questionnaire at 4 points of measurement. Additionally, medical staff were asked to rate the patients' status at admission and discharge. SINGER-data could be collected of 429 patients. In sum, results recommend to use the SINGER in outpatient neurorehabilitation, though with some restrictions. In comparison to BI and FIM, the SINGER results show in any case considerably less ceiling effects. The further exclusive use of FIM and, above all, BI cannot be recommended.

This criterion is based on 3 different items: patients with at least 12 weeks sickness absence, (a) a SIBAR score&gt;7 and\/or (b) a perceived need of SOR.The main aspect of our analyses was to describe the association between the SOR need-criterion and the participation in SOR measures as well as between the predictors of SOR participation when fulfilling the SOR need-criterion.

The formal prerequisites for SOR were given for 33% of the sample, out of which 32% received a SOR after rehabilitation and 43% fulfilled the SOR needs criterion. A negative relationship between these 2 categories was observed (phi=-0.08, p&lt;0.01). For patients that fulfilled the need-criterion the probability for participating in SOR decreased by 22% (RR=0.78). The probability of SOR participation increased with a decreasing SIBAR score (OR=0.56) and in patients who showed more confidence in being able be return to work. Participation in SOR measures cannot be predicted by the empirically defined SOR need-criterion: the probability even decreased when fulfilling the criterion. Furthermore, the results of a multivariate analysis show a positive selection of the patients who participate in SOR measures. Our results point strongly to the need of an indication guideline for physicians in rehabilitation centres. Further research addressing the success of SOR measures have to show whether the information used in this case can serve as a base for such a guideline.

In a prospective, controlled and randomized longitudinal study data about the state of health and job status were assessed at 4 measured time points. As an indicator of the sociomedical development the current employment status was used. Aftercare treatment (n=139) included 2-4 interview contacts (via telephone or face-to-face) within the first 3 months after discharge from inpatient psychosomatic rehabilitation.

Some of the interventions that investigated different methods of standing- and gait training showed positive eff ects in walking capacity, gait speed, dynamic standing balance, stance symmetry, balance self-efficacy and gait in dependence. Circuit class therapy and overground physical therapy gait training showed the best eff ects of the investigated interventions.

The newly developed smoking cessation programme (intervention group, IG) is compared against the treatment-as-usual (control group, CG) of participating rehabilitation centres. Data from 850 smokers in 19 in-patient rehabilitation centres are analysed. The process evaluation of the non-sequential programme shows good acceptance among trainers and patients and easy implementation in the rehabilitation setting. Abstinence rates at the end of treatment are comparable for the IG (19.1%) and the CG (17.9%). The amount of cigarettes smoked among remaining smokers also reduced to a comparable degree in both groups. Patients in the IG showed significant improvement with regard to stages of change and self-efficacy. The non-sequential smoking cessation programme is accepted and can be implemented in an in-patient rehabilitation setting. With regard to major outcome criteria, the programme is comparable to treatment-as-usual. Secondary outcome criteria and satisfaction ratings favour the new programme.

A representative sample of working age persons insured in the German Federal Pension Insurance stratified by main diagnosis groups fulfilled a postal questionnaire before admission to their rehabilitation centre. Work-related interventions were measured by the Classification of Therapeutic Services (KTL), a German classification of treatments during medical rehabilitation. The sample consisted of 2232 persons with full data. Persons with SRWA received work-related interventions by an average of 6.1 h. The standardized mean differences for the treatment dose of persons with and without SRWA were between 0.12 and 0.34 for different work-related modules. In none of the modules the required minimum level was met. There were no considerable differences in persons with and without SRWA receiving the required minimum level. The analysis clearly stated the insufficient frequency and intensity of work-related treatments in medical rehabilitation.

By means of structural equation modeling high convergent and divergent validity of the RehaCAT dimensions could be proven in a sample of N=184 rehabilitation patients (71,2% inpatient and 28,8% outpatient). In the resulting model between 41% (functionality upper extremities) and 76% (activities in daily living) of the RehaCAT dimensions could be explained mainly by the theoretical assumed predictor constructs.

Regarding the same disease there can be very different states of functional health. Within the interdisciplinary rehabilitation field the ICF is supposed to be an appropriate format to function as a common assessment tool. A rehabilitation center had gathered data (n=77) with an ICF core set for psychiatric rehabilitation that was analyzed with quantitative methods (secondary data analysis). The logic of data evaluation was as follows: are there autonomous types (factor analysis) of impairment concerning the ICF concepts and is there a systematically intervention allocation according to these types (comparison of means)? For this purpose the quantita-tive assessed ICF item selection was compared to the ICD-10 diagnosis schizophrenia, affective disorder or personality disorder as well as with the quantified interventions as listed from the annuity insurance. The core set shows discriminant construct validity concerning ICD-10 diagnoses. Factor analysis identified 3 types of impairment of functional health independent of ICD-10 diseases: cognitive, psychomotoric and emotional type. The allocation of therapeutic interventions happens not yet systematically according to the impairment type. An autonomous rehabilitation assessment beyond the ICD-10 diagnosis is scientifically verified.

The results demonstrate that preventive programs, which are conducted in addition to the normal working hours on the job, can be implemented successfully in rehabilitation units. The participation in the multimodal prevention program goes along with a stable reduction of risky health behavior: increased physical activity, stress coping, dietary change und weight reduction.

","420":"For some years therapeutic service catalogues have been established in medical rehabilitation which have broadened our previous understanding of nursing actions. Currently, therapeutic nursing plays a prominent role in neurological early rehabilitation because the operations and procedures coding system (OPS) 8-552 within the DRG-System (Diagnosis Related Groups) states that therapeutic nursing must be carried out by specially trained nursing personnel. This requirement leads to inconsistencies in nursing practice and the medical service of the health insurance (MDK) since a definition of therapeutic nursing is lacking. A previous review of therapeutic nursing in 2003 focused primarily on the development of the therapeutic nursing role, but not on therapeutic nursing itself. The following article contains the first systematic review of the current state of research regarding a definition of therapeutic nursing. For this purpose, a systematic study was conducted to examine if there are, nationally or internationally, any definitions of therapeutic nursing and to identify what the therapeutic aspects of nursing are. The research included following database; Medline, Cinahl and Embase. Additionally, a research by hand of several German journals as well as textbooks and specialized literature was carried out. 5 studies were selected which define the term \"therapeutic nursing\". Among these are one review, one primary study, one theoretical discussion and one dissertation. Further twenty four studies were identified which do not define the term, but are closely related to the subject, and use or characterize the term in various contexts. The publications examined provided indications of duties, interventions and roles nurses should perform, but not how to carry these out, nor what is therapeutic about the nursing. At the same time, the low number of studies reveals that therapeutic nursing has barely been examined and demonstrates the lack of theoretically grounding through nursing science.

Data of 160 patients, age 47.4 (SD 10.8), 51% female, approximately 51% with previous arthroscopy, were analysed. The response rate 6 months after therapy approximately amounted to 50%. Main therapy approaches were strengthening, stretching and manual therapy, combined with home exercises. Impairment in daily life as well as pain improved substantially during therapy (SES range 0.6-1.75). The conducted study brought up insights for physiotherapy health service for pa-tients with cartilage or meniscal problems, based on a sample size not accessible for Germany before.

Rehabilitation aims to improve self-management abilities and the course of the disease. A structured heart failure education program was established to create knowledge about the disease and to implement a disease friendly behavior. The effectiveness was tested in a randomized controlled design. Patients were cluster randomized -assigned to an intervention group or a control group at the beginning of a rehabilitation. Both received a rehabilitation specifically geared to heart-failure-patients. The intervention group received additionally the education program, the control group a single lecture on the disease. At the end of rehabilitation and 6 months later the knowledge and integrity of the recommended self-tests have been checked. In addition the disease severity and pharmacotherapy were determined. Both groups showed improvements in disease status. Participants of the education program had a sustained higher knowledge, were better adjusted to medication after 6 months and documented their self-tests more frequently. Regardless to the education intervention an improvement of the disease status occurs during cardiac rehabilitation. The effective single components are still unclear. The evaluated education program leads specifically to an improved disease-related knowledge and improved self-management skills. Due to these results it seems useful to include cardiac rehabilitation in heart failure disease-management programs - a specific heart failure education program should be integrated.

Data of 85 clients with 2 measurements (T1=4 weeks after admission, T2=dis-charge) were available. The following variables were analyzed: seizure frequency, carer-ratings on epilepsy, on daily-life independence and on occupational and psychological status of their clients, assistance needs following the program (residential care vs. supported housing), and client-ratings on satisfaction with the program. Seizure frequency was significantly (p&lt;0.05) reduced, more than half of the clients were assigned for supported housing. Proportions of clients with improvements according to carer-ratings varied between 44.7% with regard to epilepsy and 67.1% with regard to occupational status. Approximately 66% of the clients were satisfied with the program. T1-data only scarcely influenced later assistance needs. Outcome measures correlated moderately with each other. Depending on the outcome measure, at best two thirds of the clients are rehabilitation responders.

These range from improvement in the major clinical symptoms of shortness of breath and diminished vitality, the reduction of the psychosocial consequences of the disease in terms of secondary anxiety and depression, the reduction of sick days and hospital stays to reduced patient mortality rates after hospitalization for COPD. Considering the enormous medical as well as socio-economic relevance of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the convincing body of evidence and the high levels of recommendation in evidence-based guidelines, there is a striking disparity with regard to those rehabilitation measures actually carried out, which, according to German national statutory pension insurance, account for less than 3% of all completed medical rehabilitation measures.

The sample comprises 249 rehabilitation patients with musculoskeletal diseases. The correlations of the SE-FFB with the criteria of convergent and discriminate validity are in accordance with the expectations.

For the intervention group, the questionnaire included, in addition to general information about rehabilitation goals, free text fields for the formulation of own goals. Patients were asked to bring the completed questionnaire to the admission interview. At the end of rehabilitation, satisfaction with participation in the goal-setting process and perceived usefulness of information on rehabilitation goals were captured. The doctors\/psychologists responded to standardized items regarding various aspects of utility and practicability of the questionnaire. 34% of the targeted rehabilitation patients brought the completed questionnaire to the admission interview. For most of the rehabilitation patients goal setting is important; 31.4% reported the information obtained to rehabilitation goals to be very, and 62.9% particularly helpful. For practitioners, the questionnaire is likely to orient rehabilitation patients to rehabilitation goals: they reported that 56.6% of the patients reflected about their goals and that 50% were more familiar with the subject. Physicians rated the handling and integration of the questionnaire into the interview, its format and layout as well as its benefits more positively than the surveyed psychologists. These were more optimistic about the ability of rehabilitation patients to answer the questionnaire (62.5%, physicians 47.2%) and define own goals (77.8%, physicians 41.7%). The applied questionnaire has been well accepted by the majority of rehabilitation patients and practitioners as well as was judged to be practical and useful in important aspects. A comprehensive implementation of the questionnaire proves to be promising, particularly in the context of oncological and orthopedic rehabilitation.

Concerning structure-related quality, the project included a) designing and evaluating a questionnaire, b) the definition of assessment criteria for subsequent comparative data analyses, and c) the description and documentation of the current state in the field of rehabilitation and prevention for mothers, fathers and children. To document structural quality comprehensively, a modular questionnaire was developed and tested in a survey of 115 inpatient prevention and rehabilitation institutions for mothers, fathers and children. Involving an expert panel, preliminary basic and selection criteria were defined in order to assure a conducive assessment with regard to structural attributes. The majority of institutions had provider agreements for both prevention and rehabilitation. Measures for mothers\/fathers with children were predominant; only 7 institutions exclusively treated mothers and fathers. Institution sizes varied strongly. Major indications included psychosomatics, dermatology, and pneumology. Overall, structural conditions of the institutions showed a high standard.

Rehabilitation in Germany on principle requires that insurees file an application. Proactive screening for rehabilitation need has only been explored in pilot projects so far. It seems a promising attempt to assess rehab need by questionnaire especially in patients with type 2 diabetes. We do not know though how patients who have been screened positive for rehab need differ from other patients with type 2 diabetes as to their health and risk profiles. This could provide an indication of the validity of the proactive approach. Members of an Allgemeine Ortskrankenkasse (AOK) Disease Management Program (DMP) for type 2 diabetes were screened for rehab need by questionnaire. 13 diabetes-specific problem areas were assessed. Problems were assigned to 10 specific treatments (problem-treatment-pairs). Rehab need was presumed if patients needed 3 or more treatments. Patients were then compared to regular rehab patients as well as patients with type 2 diabetes from primary care medical offices. From 5500 DMP-patients 829 returned the questionnaire (return rate: 15.5%). From these 94% met the criteria for rehab need; of these 55% needed 6 or more treatments (complex problems). Patients who screened positive for rehab suffered from more health problems and had worse risk profiles as compared to patients from medical offices, and disease burden was comparable or worse as compared to regular rehab patients. This indicates that proactive screening for rehab need in patients with type 2 diabetes leads to reasonable (valid) results. The very low return rate suggests that the sample may be considerably biased, though. Possibly, mainly patients with greater impairment to health responded to the screening.

Differences in work ability of WMR and MR patients confirmed need-related access. However, these differences were exclusively explained by screening-based access decisions. If access was not supported by a screening, WMR and MR patients did not differ. Decisions by rehabilitation centres compared with decisions by insurance agencies resulted in similar differences between WMR and MR patients. Screening-based decisions about access enable a more need-related access to WMR.

During the course of the therapeutic interventions, the patient showed more and more signs of vegetative, emotional and motor reactions. The latter were increasingly target-bound and at last allowed a simple type of non-verbal communication. The present case indicates that animal-assisted therapy can be a reasonable option to treat patients with most severe cerebral lesions.

Reliable evidence exists to confirm that therapy should start as early as possible, because it is less effective during later phases of the disease when concomitant cardiovascular illnesses may occur. In most cases, medical rehabilitation of diabetic patients is based on other diagnoses. There is a considerable need for rehabilitation among diabetics who are in ambulant care but do not intend to file a request for rehabilitative measures.

Overall, 4,825 handicapped individuals with hearing impairments - including n=166 students - took part in the survey. The results of the evaluation of the group of hearing-impaired students indicate that many of them are not informed about laws important to them. It was also found that the knowledge of a law cannot be equated with its implementation. This survey also resulted in a resolve for the future, to demand information about legal options be reinforced, and to adjust this information to fit the needs of specific target groups, e.g. this information could be disseminated through sign language films.

Findings regarding effectiveness and moderators of treatment outcome that were already reported elsewhere are briefly summarized.In a preliminary study we first assessed whether rehab patients have the technical requirements and abilities to successfully participate in Internet-based treatments. Patients expressing interest for participation in W-RENA (N=400) were compared with non-participants (N=1789) with regard to sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. In a 2-arm randomized controlled trial (N=400) we subsequently compared participants of W-RENA with participants of a treatment as usual group (TAU). Self-report measures were assessed at the beginning of inpatient treatment (t1), at discharge from inpatient treatment\/start of W-RENA (t2), and at 3- (t3) and 12-months follow-ups (t4). The majority of assessed rehab-patients had the technical prerequisites (78.79%) and necessary skills (79.9%) to successfully participate in an Internet-based intervention. A third of the patients (32%) which were invited to take part in the intervention (and the study) expressed interest to participate. Study participants and non-participants differed only slightly. Most participants (80.6%) reported to have gained benefit from participating. Treatment achievements as well as quality of therapist alliance were rated high from both patients and therapists.

The PARZIVAR intervention was evaluated in a sequential control group design with 3 measurement points (before the start of rehabilitation, at the end of rehabilitation, and at 6-month follow-up). The proximal endpoints were defined as patient perception of participative goal setting, subjective awareness of goals, and satisfaction with goal setting. The distal endpoints were intensity of pain and generic and illness-specific functioning. Overall, the degree of achieving aspects of participative goal setting was higher in the intervention group. There were no differences regarding satisfaction with goal setting, however, and distal outcomes also remained unchanged after the intervention was implemented. Participation in the PARZIVAR intervention was partially reflected in the perception of the rehabilitation patients, but the effects regarding distal outcomes in the intervention group did not exceed those of usual care.

Our cohort consists of 197 FMS patients from 3 psychosomatic (M=49.9 years) and 223 FMS patients (M=50.2 years) from 3 somatic rehabilitation centers. At the beginning of rehabilitation, patients filled out a questionnaire packet to identify their access routes to the rehabilitation centers and to record patients' disease-related, psychosocial and socio-demographic characteristics. To analyze the results we used descriptive calculations, calculated bivariate correlations, and conducted binary logistic regression analysis for the prediction of group membership. The access routes of FMS patients to a somatic or a psychosomatic rehabilitation center were often similar. Some items revealed significant group differences, i. e., a higher primary -rejection rate, longer waiting period between application for rehabilitation and its approval, and between the application itself and initiation of psychosomatic rehabilitation in comparison to somatic FMS patients. Prior experience of out-patient psychotherapy, and expectations (\"psychological support\") for the rehabilitation were predictive patient characteristics for the assignment into a psychosomatic rehabilitation center. Marriage, motivation, and expectations (\"physical improvement\" and \"interaction with other patients\") for the rehabilitation were predictive patient characteristics for the assignment in a somatic rehabilitation center.

Data from clinics caring for patients with somatic disorders could be compared to the 2005 survey. Data from clinics for both psychosomatic and substance abuse disorders was collected for the first time in 2010. Overall, psychologists and physicians were reported to be the most frequent conductors of educative programmes. In somatic clinics, psychologists, dieticians and occupational therapists or physiotherapists were the most common conductors. Two-thirds of the institutions reported no training prerequisites for staff members to perform patient education. 80% of the education programmes were categorized post hoc into 3 classes: \"generic health education\", \"disorder-specific patient education\", and \"psychoeducational group programmes\". Almost two-thirds of all programmes were carried out with 8-15 participants, and many used several interactive didactic methods. Programmes conducted in small groups (&lt;8 participants) used significantly more interactive methods than those conducted in larger groups did (&gt;15 participants). Only half of the programmes were manualized. Significantly more interactive methods were used in completely manualized programmes. Only about half of the programmes were evaluated, and only very few evaluation studies were published.

We defined performance-related outcomes (e. g. return to work, self-assessed working capacity), asked patients if they needed further vocational advice and how helpful they estimated the rehabilitation treatment. 1 year after the end of rehabilitation 309 employed patients had completed the study (65%). We addressed our research questions using non-parametric tests, t-tests, analyses of variance and logistic regressions. Of the 309 patients 58% started rehabilitation not later than 14 days after the end of acute treatment while the other 42% had finished their treatments at least some weeks or even months ago. Patients of the IG evaluated the work-related rehabilitation offers significantly better and needed less additional vocational advice after the end of rehabilitation (n. s.). Regarding the patients, who started rehabilitation not later than 14 days after the end of acute treatment (beginning of rehabilitation n=269, 12 months after rehabilitation n=174), the IG achieved a slightly higher return-to-work-rate 12 months after the end of rehabilitation (81% IG, 76% CG, n. s.).

It is not the aim of this paper to identify solutions to those problems, but rather to facilitate their discussion by enhancing the awareness of the complexity of implementing high-quality participation research.1. It is important that studies on participation research specify which aspects of the concept \"participation\" are being addressed, in other words, how the term is being interpreted. This would improve interdisciplinary communication beyond one's immediate research field while increasing cumulative knowledge.2. Fully-developed participation research is generally only conceivable when carried out in an interdisciplinary manner. Its current status can be considered a transition between pre-interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary efforts requiring further development. The key factor to the success of any interdisciplinary activity is each researcher's attitude, that is, interdisciplinary projects must be \"carried\" by the readiness of the entire team to share as well as question their individual knowledge and expertise and to show a willingness to learn from others. The research's prevailing conditions can make this easier when the functioning, communicative relationships among participation researchers are set up to construct and incorporate an acknowledged repertoire of methodology and knowledge and when participation researchers design specific promotion and career structures.3. Another main element of such shared knowledge would be methods and theories addressing the integrated consideration of personal and environmental characteristics. Social-ecological models, especially those used in the preventive sciences and public health field, would provide a good basis for integrating theories. These models aim to define personal factors in conjunction with aspects of the social and attitudinal environment of an individual to gain deeper understanding of his or her life's reality. The development of these approaches and their implementation in participation research is a key future goal, as these models represent the theoretical basis of interdisciplinary cooperation among those disciplines active in participation research, making them essential to its long-term success.","493":"This contribution introduces the \"Diskussionspapier Teilhabeforschung\" (discussion paper participation research) of the German Association for Rehabilitation (DVfR) and German Society for Rehabilitation Science (DGRW).

In this context, vocational retraining is of special importance. However, the success of vocational retraining, represented by subsequent returning to work (RTW), is only to a limited extent attributable to intervention quality. Apart from methodical influences participant-related as well as context-related attributes are discussed as influencing factors. To know these RTW predictors is a necessary condition for a valid comparative evaluation of intervention quality. A structured literature search was conducted. All studies meeting the following criteria were included: publication between 2006 and 2011; context: German rehabilitation system and vocational retraining; multivariate analysis of RTW predictors. The evidence for or against the influence of a predictor was rated as strong if more than 75% of the models, and moderate if more than 50% of the models reported or excluded a significant relationship between predictor and RTW. All predictors included in more than 2 studies were considered in this review. 15 publications from 6 studies were included in the analysis. Due to differentiation of the models between different types of retraining the evidence was based on 9 prediction models. Strong evidence of an effect on RTW can be assumed for income before admission, subjective health rating and regular completion of retraining. There is moderate evidence for an effect of age and target job. Strong evidence against an effect on RTW is found for employment and occupational status before admission. There is moderate evidence against an RTW effect of sex, education and locus of control. Ambiguous evidence is obtained for the local job market, the type of retraining, social support and mobility. For the first time the review provides findings on the relevant influence factors of RTW following vocational retraining. These findings on the one hand could lead to an advance of intervention quality due to consideration of special personal and\/or environmental factors. On the other hand there still remains an undeniable lack of information in this field. There is a special need for studies capable of confirming previous findings or of clarifying known uncertainties in the available evidence.

Therefore, instruments and methods of external quality assurance were developed and evaluated on behalf of the federal-level health insurance institutions. On the level of structure quality, a modular questionnaire for assessing structural features of rehabilitation\/prevention centers, basic and allocation criteria as well as a checklist for visitations were developed. Structural data were collected in a nationwide survey of parent-child prevention and rehabilitation centers. Process and outcome quality data were collected in n=38 centers. Process quality was assessed using multiple methods (process-related structural features, case-related routine documentation, and incident-related patient questionnaires). Outcome quality was measured via patient questionnaires (n=1 799 patients). We used a multi-level modelling approach by adjusting relevant confounders on institutional and patient levels. The methods, instruments and analyzing procedures developed for measuring quality on the level of structure, processes and outcomes were adjusted in cooperation with all relevant stakeholders. Results are exemplarily presented for all quality assurance tools. For most of the risk-adjusted outcome parameters, we found no significant differences between institutions. For the first time, a comprehensive, standardized and generally applicable set of methods and instruments for routine use in comparative quality measurement of inpatient parent-child prevention and rehabilitation is available. However, it should be considered that the very heterogeneous field of family-oriented measures can not be covered entirely by an external quality assurance program.

The general practitioners estimated that on average 41,9% (SD=18,2; Range 15-90%) were suffering from chronic mental disorders. 46,5% of the patients said that they suffered from mental problems, 38,3% had mental problems longer than 6 months, i. e., chronic, and in 26,9% even persistent. 29,7% of the patients suffered from chronic mental problems with relevant participation disorders. Patients with chronic mental disorders and participation problems are frequent in general practice.

To describe the coded indications used by physicians to justify a physiotherapy prescription for patients with back pain, in order to verify its plausibility. Furthermore, we aimed to describe the manner in which patient subgroups differ regarding factors given in the CPT to allocate patients to various domains of indication. A descriptive-exploratory secondary analysis of data from a prospective multicentre (84 private physiotherapy practices) observational trial was conducted. The Bother index of the Musculoskeletal Function Assessment Questionnaire (German, 16-Item version), the Work Ability Index and an 11-step box scale on pain intensity were measured as outcome. Coded indications related to dysfunction\/pain due to joint-blockages dominated clearly (WS1a 30%, WS2a 35.3%). Patients who were allocated to the domains of indication WS1 and WS2 did not differ regarding botherment in daily life at the beginning of therapy (SES=0.05). It is hardly possible to identify clear prescription patterns. Results did not show any clear differences regarding major criteria for efficient prescription in line with the CPT.

For each of the 3 indications, a separate questionnaire was applied to assess modification suggestions regarding KTL therapy elements, the minimum percentage of patients to be treated accordingly, and the minimum duration of therapeutic procedures for each evidence-based treatment module. Responses from 14 rehab centres (return rate 54%) were obtained and analyzed.According to the majority of the responding rehabilitation centres, the therapy standards for child and adolescent rehabilitation fulfilled the quality features of topicality, multidisciplinarity, and relevance for routine rehabilitative practice. The degree of empirical grounding was evaluated more inconsistently. Difficulties with coding of KTL therapy elements were cited as the primary reasons for failing to comply with requirements in 2008.Exemplarily, the results of the user survey regarding the rehabilitative treatment of children and adolescents with obesity (age group: 8 years and older) are presented in detail.Concluding, the modifications to the therapy standards in child and adolescent rehabilitation introduced on the basis of the user survey are set out.","509":"Being confronted with missing data, the most important step is the knowledge of the underlying mechanism.

Highest predictive power relative to symptom over-reporting was achieved by Health-49-score followed by social class and sex. Percentage of symptom over-reporting is higher in insurants with migration background than in German insurants, but taking into account more factors, differences in German and Non-German insurants can be largely explained by differences in social class and gender distribution.

Additionally, data from the discharge letter were considered. 24.6% of 329 patients showed conspicuous response behavior. Patients with conspicuous complaint representation were more likely to have an immigration background, rather belonged to the socio-economic underclass and more frequently showed a vulnerable gainful employment. There was no correlation between SIMS and the rehabilitation outcome. Patients with conspicuous response behavior and with high depression scores benefited significantly less from the inpatient treatment. Differences in the ability to work assessment were not found.

Many rehabilitation clinics believe they should isolate these patients and therefore deny rehabilitation of this patient group arguing that rehabilitation and isolation are incompatible. In order to improve the rehabilitation of MDRO-patients the MDRO network Rhein-Main has developed a recommendation for rehabilitation clinics.Based on literature data on the prevalence of MRSA\/MDRO in rehabilitation clinics, the data on transmission of MDRO in such clinics and on existing recommendations, a new recommendation was established by experts in hygiene and by management of rehabilitation clinics in the region.Current studies in Germany as well as in France exhibit the same prevalence of MDRO patients in rehabilitation units as well as in acute care clinics. Transmission occurs mainly via hand contact during patient care or medical therapy in critically ill patients with high maintenance. However, the risk of transmissions in patients with great mobility is not increased. Hence, good standard hygiene, especially good hand hygiene both in staff and patients, is the key method to prevent transmission. Isolation or other restriction of mobility does not seem necessary. These data formed the basis of the newly established recommendation, which sets out in a clearly laid-out and tabular manner the standard hygiene procedures necessary for safe rehabilitation of all patients and the additional measures necessary for rehabilitation of MDRO-patients.

It is the objective of this explorative study to examine how patients and providers evaluate the comprehensibility and patients' comprehension of patient education under routine conditions during orthopaedic rehabilitation. Furthermore, we aim to explore the influencing factors that patients and providers describe as conducive and counterproductive to the comprehensibility of patient education, and the ideas or desires they have as to how patient education can be made more comprehensible. We conducted guided focus groups with 50 patients with chronic back pain or osteoarthritis aged between 22 and 71 years (M=50.4, SD=9.4) and 35 patient education providers aged between 26 and 61 years (M=44.9, SD=9.8) in a total of 9 orthopaedic rehabilitation centres. Qualitative analyses of the interview transcripts were conducted according to Mayring's content analytic approach using Atlas.ti software. Patients and providers evaluate patient education as generally comprehensible. The involvement of patients in patient education is reported by both patients and providers as the main conducive factor. Patients describe poor (e. g. superficial or contradictory) information as counterproductive regarding comprehensibility, while providers tend to mention patients' lack of motivation and of taking personal responsibility as hindering patients' comprehension. Patients' and providers' proposals and ideas can be organized in the topics patient education (e. g. stronger reference to patients' everyday life), providers (e. g. improving providers' tutoring skills), information (e. g. more information), patient involvement (e. g. stronger consideration of patients' interests), organization (e. g. smaller groups), and goal clarification (e. g. consideration of patients' expectations). Our results reveal that good comprehensibility can be achieved in patient education during routine orthopaedic rehabilitation. They also show the factors that account for good comprehensibility. The counterproductive factors described by patients and providers provide evidence of the factors that may hold potential for improving patient education with regard to comprehensibility.

Aims of our study were: (1) to picture trajectories of change in a simple and descriptive way, (2) to compare the resulting solutions, (3) to highlight relations with direct measurement of change and\/or global estimation of effects, (4) to compare the predictive value of different measurements of change. We used available data from rehabilitation research which covered direct and indirect measurement of change as well as global measurement of effects and which therefore enabled us to compare different methods of outcome measurements. The well documented record includes data from n=466 patients with chronic back pain. Different trajectories (3 and 5 groups) were defined using their pre\/post data. Depending on limits chosen for positive or negative courses and chosen outcome 20% to almost 40% of the patients showed improvements over the follow-up period. About the same percentages changed for the worse. However, two-thirds of the patients improved at least in one outcome. Compared with those, who did not experience improvements in any outcome, this group indicated better global rehabilitation effects. The different types of trajectories (3 and 5 groups) substantially contribute to the explained variance of catamnestic status at 12 months beyond other predictors as well as beyond initial status. The same applies to the prediction of disability days. The description of trajectories of change yields useful results. In contrast to complex statistical methods we were able to identify groups of patients that can easily be described.

This study was aimed at examining the current status and medium-term changes of mothers' health and psychosocial situation, comparing mothers with or without approval and participation in an inpatient mother-child rehabilitation measure. The sample consisted of 477 women. The first survey (T1) took place at the time of application; the postal follow-up survey (T2) was carried out 6 months later. At this point 353 mothers had completed their measure (IG=intervention group); 75 women had not yet started (WG=waiting group), and 49 applications had finally been rejected (AG=rejected group). This study examines how far the 3 groups differ with respect to their health parameters at the time of application as well as 6 months later. The outcome variables, containing health complaints, somatic and mental illnesses, psychosocial factors (e. g., single parenthood), or restrictions of daily activities and the range of participation in family and job affairs, were selected following the assessment guidelines of the Medical Review Board of the Statutory Health Insurance Funds (MDS). Duration and severity of symptoms were measured with Likert scales (indirect measurement of change), the mental health status with SCL-K-9. At the time of application the 3 groups of mothers did not differ significantly with respect to their complaints and symptoms, but some minor tendencies became apparent. Mothers, who were admitted for the intervention (IG and WG) showed more complaints and symptoms than mothers, whose applications had been rejected (AG). 6 months later, highly significant changes and clinically important improvements were observed for IG mothers: large effects were achieved regarding the number of illnesses, health complaints, the degree of daily activities and participation as well as mental health of participants. Minor effects were obtained with respect to psychosocial strains. In contrast the number of illnesses and health complaints among mothers, who had not (yet) participated, increased within half a year. Similarly, psychological strains were greater than before: in the waiting group they had risen significantly, in the rejected group values resembled those of the intervention group before intervention. Inpatient measures do not only cause short-term improvements of mothers' health status, they also lead to clinically relevant reductions of health impairments and complaints in the medium term. In contrast, the health status of mothers, who miss the intervention, deteriorates. This also applies to mothers, who were rejected. Therefore, it is highly recommended to take the self-reporting forms into account when identifying mothers for the intervention, and also to start the intervention early after the approval.

Background is a project for the development of evidence-based practice guidelines for psychological interventions in the rehabilitation of patients with coronary heart disease.

A handsearch was conducted in addition to the electronic search. Eligible publications were selected, and evidence for psychological interventions was extracted as well as recommendations relative to psychological diagnostics or interventions. 5 systematic reviews and 34 guidelines were included. Recommendations and (partially restricted) evidence from systematic reviews was found for the following psychological interventions: patient counselling and health education; screening and treatment of comorbid psychological disorders; occupational counselling; stress management; relaxation training; interventions for smoking cessation; interventions promoting appropriate nutrition and weight management; interventions enhancing sufficient, regular physical activity; interventions enhancing social support; specific interventions for women; involvement of family members or partners; discussion of sexual activity. For several psychological interventions in the treatment of patients with coronary heart disease we found empirical evidence from systematic reviews. For other psychological interventions, no empirical evidence from systematic reviews was found. The summary of guidelines shows that both in Germany and abroad, a number of psychologically grounded interventions are an inherent part of cardiac rehabilitation. However, many recommendations which refer to psychological diagnostics and interventions are not precise enough to guide psychological care of individual patients. In particular, there are no statements in many guidelines on which (psychological) treatments should be considered for which problems. Moreover, hardly any evidence or recommendations were found for specific interventions referring to special groups of patients (e.g., women, patients with low socio-economic status or migration background).

The activities are heterogeneous; of particular importance in the rehabilitation process is vocational retraining. These interventions are cost-intensive, take very long and have a decisive impact on the main goal, the return to work (RTW). However, vocational retraining is conducted under different settings: The question is to what extent this leads to specific methodical implications of RTW measurement that have an impact on the level of RTW. The analysis was concentrated on the main outcome RTW after vocational retraining. A structured review was conducted of all German-language publications from 2005 to 2010 which report an RTW quota after vocational retraining. The main methodical conditions were: kind of RTW measurement (point in time rate vs. cumulative course rate), time of follow-up in years, and sample definition (all participants vs. participants with regular completion of retraining, RC). The impact of these conditions on the level of RTW was predicted by using a meta-regression model. The time of follow-up was standardized on the mean (1 year). 20 publications from 10 studies were included in the analysis. In all, 23 RTW quota were observed, from which 22 were included in the regression model. A positive impact on the level of RTW was identified for reduction of the sample to participants with RC (b=10.04; p=0.001), the time of follow-up (b=5.47; p=0.052) and, by trend, the interaction of the kind of RTW measurement and time of follow-up (b=6.32; p=0.090). There was no significance given for the main effect of kind of RTW measurement (p=0.787). The model fit was calculated with an adjusted R2=75.17%. The level of RTW given in the publications is very heterogeneous, but a major part of the variance was explained by the 3 methodical conditions we examined. Based on this, a classification system for RTW measurement after VR is presented, which could be a model for designing future studies as well as inter-actor communication of success after VR. ","534":"Interventions in medical rehabilitation are often evaluated using a single-group pre-post study design with health-related quality of life (hrqol) as an outcome variable. Through comparison of mean values in hrqol subscales treatment effects are calculated. In many cases conclusions about changes in hrqol are made depending on the sizes of effects. The precondition for doing this, however, is that the answers to the items in questionnaires were given within the same frames of internal standards, values and conceptualizations at the different time points. Changes in these frames can be found, however, and are discussed under the term response shift, which can happen when adjusting to chronic and progressive diseases. Existence of response shift can be proven with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) by measuring hrqol at different time points. This approach can be assigned to the broader issue of measurement of invariance in longitudinal studies and is described in a sample of 279 patients with diabetes mellitus. Different response shift processes were detectable. If response shift takes place but is not taken into account inferences from changes in scale scores to changes in hrqol are invalid. This means that the calculation of effect size is also influenced by response shift. By the use of CFA conventionally calculated effect size can be differentiated into either effects due to response shift or 'true change' of hrqol. Measurements of invariance within one group at 2 time points can be differentiated from multiple group analysis at one time point. Investigations of measurement of invariance in longitudinal studies allow for conclusions regarding sensitivity to change of instruments examining hrqol changes. This is important for clinicians who make decisions about which scales are appropriate to detect hrqol changes. For scientific research it is relevant for further analysis of sensitivity to change of hrqol instruments.","535":"","536":"","537":"","538":"","539":"It is being discussed how prioritization affects access to rehabilitation and rehabilitation practice.

On the other hand, a vivid controversy is taking place in particular as to how prioritization can be formalized in order to allocate resources in the German (statutory) health care system in the best possible manner. Some believe prioritization to be just a preliminary stage for rationing resources. Others point out that if human dignity, medical needs, and solidarity within society are taken into account properly, prioritization can contribute to an improvement of distributive justice and quality control in the health care system. With respect to the rehabilitation system this has already been discussed in the late 1990s, when the main rehabilitation carrier--the German statutory pension insurance scheme--had been forced by legislation to implement major cutbacks in rehabilitation spending. In this article, the authors analyze whether the German social code book IX (SGB IX), in force since 2001, has added new aspects to this debate, and consider the question of whether prioritization can be a useful approach in the rehabilitation system.","542":"The paper discusses the question whether it could be ethically appropriate to \"resolve\" the problem of scarce resources in health care via priority lists. It is argued that such a schematical priority list could only be undisputed in ethical respects if it represented a broad consensus on the question what a good life would be. Priority lists are always implicit decisions about specific concepts of the good life. Using a priority list only in consideration of a mere cost-benefit ratio means to accept a mere utilitarian way of defining good life. Such a definition goes with neglect of the interests of people with chronic diseases, of patients with incurable diseases, of patients with a limited life expectancy. To neglect the interests of these patients means to abandon the core of medical identity, because medicine has the mission to help those above all who are most in need and those who cannot help themselves. And so we have to realize that for medicine there are some values which are more important than economic considerations. The physician is a person who gives a promise, the promise to be there for the patient. If the physician now is becoming a businessman, this promise is no longer valid. The businessman doesn't give any other promise than not to act against the contract. But the main need of the patient, his longing for a human person whom he can trust, cannot become part of a contract. Especially in our time medicine has to fight for the core of its identity.","543":"Participation benefits (rehabilitation) in Germany are granted on the basis of public social security law. Allocation and prioritization, hence, are to be seen in a legal context. As far as they belong to subsistence level requirements, participation benefits have to be granted unconditionally in case persons are needy. As all kinds of participation benefits also are part of social assistance law it can be assumed that they are part of subsistence. In light of individual basic freedoms, members of an obligatory system of social security have to be granted essential benefits in case of major contingencies. Basic equality rights demand objective reasons for making distinctions. Discrimination on the basis especially of religion, race, gender and disability is forbidden. This has to be taken into account also in prioritization by benefit usefulness. Substantial criteria for prioritization have to be stipulated by law. The divided system of rehabilitation in Germany impedes a systematic prioritization because benefits continue to be granted according to different criteria. The social code book 9--SGB IX--demands common guidelines for the rehabilitation administration bodies, but these guidelines are not concrete enough so far. It remains to be seen whether prioritization criteria can be extracted from the various benefit prerequisites. Prioritization is subject to narrow limits as far as persons are basically entitled to a benefit. This holds true also in case of rehab budgets such as those in statutory pension insurance. Anyhow, research needs to be done on whether these lead to prioritization in practice and which criteria would be relevant. A highly prioritizing impact is exercised by decisions about the available infrastructure of rehabilitation services and facilities, but there is neither a clear legal basis nor research on this subject. Finally, not only prioritization within rehabilitation has to be discussed but also prioritization between rehabilitation and acute medicine.","544":"The German Pension Insurance's spending for rehabilitative benefits is capped by a statutorily determined rehab budget, which is adjusted only in keeping with the development of gross income. Due to demographics and other factors rehabilitation need is increasing and it is getting more and more difficult to provide the necessary participation benefits. This can have an impact on the quality and effectiveness of rehabilitation and gives rise to the question whether prioritisation or even rationing of rehabilitation benefits will be necessary. Accordingly, a modified mechanism for adjustment of the rehab budget is discussed, which takes into account at least the main influences on rehabilitation need.","545":"This paper introduces the concept of priority setting in health care. Priority setting is understood as a notional approach to find out what to regard as more important or less important in health care. It primarily means to bring aspects into a ranking order. Priority setting is first and foremost theoretical work aimed at preparing decisions. It does not replace these decisions. Priority setting is not restricted to circumstances of scarce resources. It can be used, for example, for working more efficiently, for quality assurance, and also for rationing. Values or value decisions form the basis of priority setting. There should be a societal consensus regarding these values and the way priority setting is conducted. Priority settings can be done to very different objects, including objects from a macro-level, e. g. general goals of health care, from a meso-level, e. g. condition-treatment pairs, as well as from a micro-level, e. g. waiting lists. Swedish national prioritization guidelines serve as an example of how priority setting can be conducted. Here, condition-treatment pairs are developed on the basis of present health care occurrences. Then, priorities from 1 (highest priority) to 10 (lowest priority) are assigned on the basis of a priority setting model. The process includes all relevant stakeholders. Priorities are set on the basis of the severity of the problem, knowledge of the effect of an intervention and its cost-effectiveness, as well as the level of evidence of the knowledge contributing to the decision. In rehabilitation, priority setting is still an unfamiliar topic which only few scientific papers have taken up to date. Different aspects of priority setting that may be deemed important for rehabilitation are introduced.","546":"","547":"Treating diabetes mellitus type 2 (DMT2) essentially involves long-term changes of health behaviour, especially diet and physical activity habits. Medical rehabilitation tries to support these changes by patient education and practical instructions. While short-term successes are frequently obtained, the main challenge lies in maintaining these results in the longer run. This study examines whether a fractionated inpatient rehabilitation programme of 3 weeks duration in combination with an additional week of inpatient rehabilitation after 6 months and a subsequent aftercare telephone service facilitates positive long-term effects for patients with DMT2. A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted with 411 patients with DMT2 in order to compare the fractionated inpatient rehabilitation programme with aftercare to a 3-weeks standard rehabilitation programme without aftercare. The analysis included physiological (cardiovascular risk, HbA1c, BMI) and psychosocial (diabetes-specific coping, quality of life) parameters at baseline (beginning of the programme) and 1 year later. After 12 months, no significant differences between the groups were found in the physiological parameters. At the same time, however, the aftercare group showed larger benefits in almost every psychosocial dimension (coping, quality of life, subjective health). Coping and quality of life had even improved when compared to baseline. In contrast, these parameters had decreased further in the standard-care control group when compared to baseline. The intensive aftercare was successful in the long-term improvement of the patients' psychological well-being. Also, the high rate of participation in fractionated inpatient rehabilitation suggests both the acceptance of and the need for aftercare. However, positive long-term changes of physiological parameters probably will require more specific interventions or individual case management. The effectiveness of fractionated inpatient rehabilitation may be limited by the adverse social, psychological and financial situation of the patients. ","548":"In the context of developing and testing a procedure for \"Outcome-oriented payment for rehabilitation after stroke\", we found that the instruments commonly used to measure the outcomes  of rehabilitation after stroke (e. g., Barthel-Index or FIM) were not meeting the special requirements  of the new payment system. Therefore the \"Scores of Independence for Neurologic and Geriatric Rehabilitation\" (SINGER) was developed as a new assessment instrument. This instrument is based on the ICF and measures 20 aspects of \"independence in activities of daily living\". The characteristic feature of the SINGER is, above all, the way all items are graded in 6 steps: the gradation does not refer to the degree of disability but to the kind and amount of help required for the respective activity, i. e.: 0 = totally dependent on professional help; 1 = professional contact help needed; 2 = contact help by (instructed) lay persons sufficient; 3 = preparation or supervision by lay persons still needed; 4 = independent with assistive device or still slow; 5 = independent without assistive device. For experienced personnel in neurologic rehabilitation, these gradations are \"intuitively plausible\". A manual moreover describes each grade in detail for each item so that the instrument can be used in rehabilitation facilities without extensive training. The SINGER has been tested and validated in a pilot study (n = 100) and in 2 subsequent studies with large case numbers in neurologic rehabilitation (n = 1058 and n = 700 patients after stroke in all categories of severity). Factor analyses showed that the instrument contains 2 dimensions which can be interpreted as \"physical activities\" and \"activities of communication and cognition\". Each of these 2 dimensions can be split into 2 sub-dimensions that can be assigned to the tasks of therapeutical professions in care\/Occupational Therapy, physiotherapy, logopedics, and neuro- psychology. The test criteria of reliability, sensitivity, convergent validity, floor and ceiling effects as well as sensitivity to change show good to very good results. Particular emphasis can be given to the high degree of interrater reliability and the wide range of possible applications in clinical practice as well as in research. A limitation of the instrument to be taken into account is the fact that the SINGER has not yet been tested and validated in geriatric rehabilitation facilities.","549":"Subjective constructs like health-related quality of life are often investigated in scientific surveys in rehabilitation science, usually assuming that such constructs would be equally defined between different groups in case of cross-sectional control group designs or across time in longitudinal study designs with or without control-groups. Differences between measurements of these constructs were expected to occur only regarding quantity but not regarding quality. However, this assumption cannot be expected to apply in every case and it is discussed from a theoretical angle under the terms of invariance or equivalence of measurements. Confirmatory factor analysis-based approaches are suitable to investigate measurement invariance empirically and will be described in this article. These statistical methods are applicable to test whether qualitative differences in constructs exist between several groups or time points (response shift) and what these differences mean. If measurement invariance cannot be held, comparisons of sum scores, which are often used in rehabilitation science, have to be considered to be questionable. On the basis of a measurement model specific parameters (regression weights, intercepts, measurement errors) can be analyzed both between comparison groups and over time. Different kinds of measurement invariance exist, depending on the statistical definition of parameters which are proven to be equal, and the extent of differences between models. The application of confirmatory factor analysis to test measurement invariance in a cross-sectional design will be described in this article on the example of quality of life data from inpatient rehabilitation. Methodological and substantive aspects which arise if measurement invariance is disproved will be discussed. In a companion article (Jelitte &amp; Schuler, in press) the method will be described for a longitudinal study design and results will be discussed in the context of response shift research.","550":"The findings of empirical educational research and the theoretical and experiential knowledge of general didactics and specific didactics of relevant subjects are not adequately considered in the conception and implementation of patient education. The aim of this work is to screen the results of existing research about the quality of instruction, to deduce quality criteria for patient education and to discuss their benefits for the existing practice. The research on the quality of instruction was systematically investigated for this purpose. Subsequently, the 3 empirically validated quality features: \"clear structure\", \"participant-oriented social climate\" and \"cognitive activation with particular attention to domain-specific components of teaching\" we identified were transferred to patient education and concretized by including the theoretical and experiential knowledge of didactics. In the process several domains (conception of manuals, train-the-trainer seminars) were identified in which the quality characteristics can be tied in. The findings of empirical educational research are able to complement the existing measures for quality assurance in the area of patient education. For this purpose the identification and specification together with the possible integration of the 3 quality criteria in the area of patient education are a first step.","551":"Patients with chronic somatic -diseases often suffer from psychological distress and mental disorders, which remain unrecognized in somatic rehabilitation. The present -study aimed to investigate whether the implementation of a stepwise psychodiagnostic procedure improves the documentation of psychological distress and mental disorders as well as of the -related inpatient treatments and aftercare recommendations. Implementation of a stepwise psychodiagnostic procedure in 5 orthopaedic, cardiologic and oncologic inpatient rehabilitation clinics. The 4 steps comprised (1) screening, (2) in-depth psychodiagnostic assessment, (3) diagnosis and treatment, (4) documentation. Implementation efficacy in terms of a better documentation was evaluated by comparing the discharge reports of every fifth screening-positive and screening-negative patient (n=146) with historical discharge reports of the last 3 months preceding baseline assessment (n=161). Mental disorders (26,0% vs. 21,7%), general psychological treatment (75,3% vs. 66,5%), specific psychological treatment (32,9% vs. 31,7%), as well as psychologically relevant aftercare recommendations (41,1% vs. 34,8%) were more frequently documented in the current post-implementation discharge reports compared to the historical discharge reports. A significant difference was found only for the documentation of general psychological treatment. The results suggest that the implementation of a stepwise psychodiagnostic procedure improves the documentation of psychological distress and mental disorders as well as related inpatient treatments and aftercare recommendations. Continuous staff training and quality assurance relative to the discharge reports may contribute to further enhancing the documentation of psychological distress and mental disorders. ","552":"In recent years, rehabilitation aftercare has become an important topic in rehabilitation research and practice. This development was initiated by the lack of long-term effects after rehabilitation treatment and by the deficits identified in several reviews of aftercare recommendations and of actual practice of aftercare. Against this background, a new aftercare strategy was developed, the \"New Credo\", which focused aftercare from the beginning of rehabilitation treatment. A substantial element of the concept is the resumption and maintenance of physical activity in everyday life of the rehabilitation patient. The goal of the present study was the evaluation of this concept in a sample of patients with chronic back pain. The \"New Credo\" was evaluated in a multi-centre, prospective controlled longitudinal study with 3 points of measurement (before and after rehab as well as after 12 months). 6 rehabilitation clinics in Schleswig-Holstein were included in the intervention arm (IG, 3 clinics) and in the control arm (CG, 3 clinics), participants were rehabilitants with chronic back pain. The clinics in the intervention arm implemented \"the New Credo\" in accordance with their local conditions. During the study period they were provided with a person who was responsible for managing aftercare activities for patients. Participants in the CG received standard rehabilitation treatment according to general guidelines. Restriction of social participation, disability days and restriction in functional capacity in everyday life were defined as primary outcomes. Complete data were available for 166 rehabilitants in the IG and 368 in the CG. At the end of rehabilitation rehabilitants in the IG reported significantly higher use of treatment offerings and more intensive preparation for the time after rehabilitation treatment than rehabilitants in the CG. Rehabilitants in the IG found recommendations for the time after treatment significantly better than those in the CG. As expected, both rehabilitants in the IG and in the CG showed similar outcomes directly after inpatient treatment. With respect to long-term effects 12 months later, significant differences with moderate effect sizes were observed in 2 of the 3 primary outcomes (function capacity and social participation) in favour of the IG. With respect to secondary outcomes, rehabilitants in the IG showed significantly better long-term results than those in the CG. Our results show that the \"New Credo\" can successfully be implemented into rehabilitation practice. The \"New Credo\" was positively rated by clinicians and rehabilitants. Rehabilitants in the IG found offerings of supported aftercare very helpful. The intensity of actual use of aftercare by rehabilitants as well as the emphasis laid on aftercare by clinicians indicate that treatment was focused on aftercare over the whole time of rehabilitation and that the rehabilitants transferred these aspects into everyday life. For the rehabilitants in the IG higher long-term effects could be observed compared to those in the CG. This suggests an improved sustainability of rehabilitation effects and a successful transfer of acquired knowledge and self-efficacy in everyday life.

The implementation of services for companies including support of company return to work management and prevention services for employees with specific health-related burdens offer the chance to identify an endangerment of earning capacity at an early stage. Workplace-orientated medical rehabilitation increases the focus on the job and the workplace in rehabilitation under the pension insurance scheme, both in selecting the right service for a client as well as in the service itself. Employers, employees and pension insurance together benefit from close cooperation.","559":"Company doctors can assume an important moderator function in company health management because they know both the individual employee with his or her abilities and functional disorders as well as the individual workplace and its organizational framework conditions. Moreover, they have access to population groups who would not as a rule make use of health care services. In the framework of industrial medicine preventive examinations, consultations and workplace inspections, they can identify a need for rehabilitation at an early stage, can support applications for services and return to work, and thus contribute to greater sustainability.","560":null,"561":"In Section 20a of Book 5 of the German Social Code (SGB V), the legislator obliged the health insurance funds to carry out company health promotion in cooperation with the accident insurance agency in charge. He thus created a foundation for more health and secure earnings or employment potential in the companies. At the same time company health promotion permits detecting threats to this potential. That helps to identify a possible need for rehabilitation at an earlier stage and to take appropriate action.To verify whether and how this instrument of preventive health policy is being used, an empirical study explored the actual application of that legal provision in small and medium-sized enterprises in particular. The law, administrative measures and company everyday evidence were set against each other under legal and de facto aspects, which showed obvious deficits in applying the law. Proposals for better company health promotion are derived from these findings. In the first place, actors in administration and self-management of the statutory health and accident insurance schemes are addressed to this end, in anticipation of enhanced implementation. A premature reduction of earning capacity could thus be counteracted. Pension insurants could retain gainful employment for a longer time, companies would have a more reliable employee basis. Social insurance carriers, notably the health and pension insurance schemes, would have to spend less in the end. A development like that would be a benefit for all--including the state.","562":"","563":"This paper is aimed at identifying labour market factors impacting vocational retraining centre participants' return to work on Employment Agencies level and at comparing results to unemployed people's return to work (Social Code Book III).

The n = 75 Employment Agency districts where 74.5 % of the participants followed-up lived were analyzed using analyses of variance and multiple loglinear regression. Compared to the unemployment context (Social Code Book III), the impact of the labour market is much lower and less complex. In the multiple model, the regional unemployment rate and the regional tertiarization rate (size of the service sector) are found to be significant and superior to the IAB-classification. Hence, participants' return to work is less dependent on labour market conditions than unemployed people's return to work (Social Code Book III).","564":null,"565":"","566":null,"567":"Stroke, Multiple Sclerosis (MS), traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and neuropathies are the most important diseases in neurological rehabilitation financed by the German Pension Insurance. The primary goal is vocational (re)integration. Driven by multiple findings of neuroscience research the traditional holistic approach with mainly empirically derived strategies was developed further and improved by new evidence-based interventions. This process had been, and continues to be, necessary to meet the health-economic pressures for ever shorter and more efficient rehab measures. Evidence-based interventions refer to symptom-oriented measures, to team-management concepts, as well as to education and psychosocial interventions. Drug therapy and\/or neurophysiological measures can be added to increase neuroregeneration and neuroplasticity. Evidence-based aftercare concepts support sustainability and steadiness of rehab results.Mirror therapy, robot-assisted training, mental training, task-specific training, and above all constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) can restore motor arm and hand functions. Treadmill training and robot-assisted training improve stance and gait. Botulinum toxine injections in combination with physical and redressing methods are superior in managing spasticity. Guideline-oriented management of associated pain syndromes (myofascial, neuropathic, complex-regional=dystrophic) improve primary outcome and quality of life. Drug therapy with so-called co-analgetics and physical therapy play an important role in pain management. Swallowing disorders lead to higher mortality and morbidity in the acute phase; stepwise diagnostics (screening, endoscopy, radiology) and specific swallowing therapy can reduce these risks and frequently can restore normal eating und drinking.In our modern industrial societies communicative and cognitive disturbances are more impairing than the above mentioned disorders. Speech and language therapy (SLT) is dominant in communicative disorders; the therapists use communicative and\/or linguistics-oriented strategies. SLT must begin early after disease onset and with high frequency to elicit good results. PC-assisted (self-)training, possibly telemedically applied, can increase training frequency and time and, hence, improve outcome in aphasia. High-frequency and task-specific training, often PC-assisted, were found to be relevant for improving cognitive functions in all dimensions. Several strategies seem to be efficient in neglect. Visual field deficits can be treated restitutively and compensatingly by PC-assisted training. Attention, memory and executive dysfunctions each require multimodal specific treatment strategies, performed in single and group therapy and in PC-assisted training. Also, education of patients to cope with their impairments and disabilities is another important part. Combined medically and vocationally oriented rehabilitation settings are necessary for raising the rate of return-to-work, especially in patients with motor hand impairments or cognitive disorders. Education of patients and relatives to cope with the chronic neurological diseases and disablements highly improve the sustainability of rehab results and can, in the long run, also reduce mortality and admission to nursing homes. Appropriate physical activity and sports are relevant in the phase of aftercare, by stabilizing both motor coordination and cognitive factors; in MS patients fatigue can be diminished effectively.The main mental comorbidities are anxiety and depression. Pharmacological and psychological treatments have been found to be equally important in this context. Frequently, these mental disorders appear in the phase of aftercare and long-term course only, then worsening outcome sustainability. Efficient concepts to deal with this aspect are still missing. The ambulatory health care system can not cope with it until now.The multitude of evidence-based interventions have over the last 20 years after the Rehab Commission of the Federation of the German Pension Insurance Institutes contributed decisively to even improving primary outcomes and quality of life of neurological patients in spite of shortened length of stay and other restrictions. Neurorehabilitative research, especially the clinically oriented part, had a major influence on the process of professionalization of all members in the neurorehabilitative team. This fact enables new and more efficient organizational structures and working processes within the team; the discussion on this topic has however only just started.","568":"","569":"Implementation of the pilot version of the rehab therapy standards for rehabilitation following total hip or knee replacement was accompanied by a user survey. This survey allowed rehab centres to comment on the standards and suggest changes.Early 2010 a total of 160 rehab centres that had treated at least 50 German Pension Fund insurees following total hip or knee replacement in 2008 received a written survey together with an overview of performance data according to KTL (Classification of Therapeutic Procedures), data that reflect the degree to which the centres had complied with the requirements of the therapy standards.69% of the centres returned the questionnaire. The centres included predominantly agreed that the rehab standards fulfil the quality attributes \"scientific foundation (evidence)\", \"relevance for day-to-day work\", \"up-to-dateness\", and \"inter- and multidisciplinary development\". There were no statistically significant differences between centres with previously high or low compliance with the requirements of the standards relative to the ratings given for these global quality criteria. Almost all responders considered comprehensiveness and structure of the standards adequate. Between 55 and 94% found that therapeutic procedures were sufficiently represented by the treatment modules. Minimum percentages of patients requiring the respective treatment were considered adequate for 8 out of 13 modules. Responders suggested restricting continuous passive motion to knee replacement. Psychological interventions were considered less important. Among the main reasons for non-adherence to therapy standards in 2008 were: coding problems, too high demands, contraindications, and shortage of staff. Implementation of the standards was associated with both positive and negative expectations on the part of the rehab centres; an issue raised in addition was the effort involved in internal restructuring.The results of the user survey show that the concept of the rehab standards and its implementation basically are accepted. Criticism had mainly concerned continuous passive motion and the need for psychological interventions. Coding problems should not be overrated since the underlying performance data referred to a period of time before the standards were implemented. General appraisal of the rehab standards was independent of previous performance. This emphasizes the weight of user feedback. The rehab standards already have been revised in light of the results of the user survey.","570":"Increasing stress-associated health problems in Germany often are attributed to problems on the job, in particular to rising work demands.

Overall stress and job stress were measured with different instruments.The sample showed above-average overall stress scores along with below-average job stress scores. The multivariate predictive model for explaining the heightened stress shows pathogenetic and salutogenetic main effects for organizational variables such as \"gratification crisis\" and personal variables such as \"occupational self-efficacy expectations\" as well as an interaction of both types of variables. There are relevant gender-specific results concerning empathy and differences between professions concerning the extent of occupational self-efficacy.The results are a matter of particular interest for the practice of workplace health promotion as well as for social work schools, the main group in our sample being social workers.","571":"Because of the diversity of institutions funding rehabilitative measures and the lack of a shared data base, little is known so far about how many people in all and what kind of people make use of medical rehabilitation. Starting out from this dilemma, the rehabilitant population of 2004 was described in greater detail with the help of the population-representative and not institution-oriented German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) and by means of health variables (subjective health, severe disability, periods of disability, health care utilisation) as well as of socio-demographic characteristics (sex, age, social status, region). In addition, the influence of these variables on the chances of taking part in rehabilitation was evaluated. In 2004, 4% of the respondents took part in rehabilitative measures, with women having a lower chance of participating as men have. A bivariate distinct age gradient leveled under multifactorial analysis. The strongest predictors, in contrast, were found to be subjective health, amount of visits to doctors' offices as well as hospitalizations. Contrary to our expectations, an influence of the social stratum could not be found. The analysis in addition shows a higher utilization of rehabilitative procedures in eastern Germany.","572":"The promotion of a physically active lifestyle has become an important issue in exercise therapy. Exercise-only interventions are frequently used for the rehabilitation of individuals with chronic diseases. These do indeed improve functional and physical performance, but they are not alone sufficient to initiate long lasting changes in physical-activity behaviour. Behaviour-related aspects are rarely integrated into exercise-therapy interventions. Based on theories of health behaviour change, effective techniques for changing physical-activity behaviour in the context of exercise therapy will be identified. The starting point is a theory-driven definition of individual behavioural determinants of physical activity and the identification of techniques for influencing the determinants. Subsequently, the potential of the techniques for enhancing physical activity is evaluated. The available evidence was reviewed on the basis of international reviews and control-group studies from the German rehabilitation setting. Finally, recommendations are offered for designing exercise-based interventions to promote participation in and adherence to physical activity. A total of 28 techniques for the promotion of physical activity behaviour were identified. An approach that proved particularly effective was self-monitoring of physical activity behaviour in a variety of combinations with other techniques, such as contracting, feedback, rewards, generating one's own varied exercise experience, action planning and barrier management. The integration of behaviour-related techniques in the context of exercise therapy interventions shows great promise as a means of initiating and promoting a physically active lifestyle. ","573":"To examine the impact of the subjective health impairment due to pain, intention and planning on long-term physical activity. A longitudinal questionnaire study with rehabilitation patients was performed over a time-span of more than 3 years. Data analyses were performed with binary logistic regressions. After controlling for social-cognitive variables subjective health impairment due to pain at the beginning of rehabilitation was a significant positive predictor of increased physical activity after rehabilitation. However, subjective health impairment due to pain 6 months after discharge was significantly negatively correlated with physical activity 3 years after rehabilitation. These findings suggest that subjective impairment due to pain should be considered when motivating people, e. g. by anticipating pain and possibilities for its improvement, respectively, or by coping planning on how to be physically active even in the face of pain. Especially during the time after rehabilitation patients may benefit from more help to manage pain. ","574":"Visitation procedures are an established method of external quality assurance. They have been conducted for many years in the German statutory pension insurance's medical rehabilitation centres and have continuously been refined and standardized. The overall goal of the visitation procedure implemented by the German statutory pension fund is to ensure compliance with defined quality standards as well as information exchange and counselling of rehabilitation centres. In the context of advancing the visitation procedure in the German statutory pension funds' medical rehabilitation centres, the \"Visit II\" Project was initiated to evaluate the perspectives and expectations of the various professional groups involved in the visitations and to modify the materials used during visitations (documentation form and manual). Evaluation data from the rehabilitation centres visited in 2008 were gathered using both written surveys (utilization analysis) and telephone-based interviews with administration managers and chief physicians. The utilization analysis procedure was evaluated with regard to its methodological quality. In addition, the pension insurance physicians in charge of patient allocation during socio-medical assessment were surveyed with regard to potential needs for revision of the visitation procedure. Data collection was complemented by expert panels with auditors. Interviews with users as part of the formative evaluation of the visitation procedure showed positive results regarding acceptance and applicability of the visitations as well as of the utilization analysis procedures. Various suggestions were made with regard to modification and revision of the visitation materials, that could be implemented in many cases. Documentation forms were supplemented by current scientifically-based topics in rehabilitation (e. g., vocationally oriented measures), whereas items with minor relevance were skipped. The manual (for somatic indications) was thoroughly revised. The transparent presentation of visitation processes and visitation criteria has proven to be a useful basis for strengthening the cooperation between the statutory pension insurance funds and the rehabilitation centres. Moreover, it is a helpful tool for the systematic and continuous advancement of this complex method by including all parties involved.","575":"The highly specialized occupation of professional dancers is a combination of sport and artistic expression. The exertion is only possible with a fully operative body. Although professional dancers may be compared with elite athletes and acute injuries frequently happen, dancers do not seem to be granted an appropriate therapy after accidents as compared with athletes. Although even minor injuries may potentially endanger the career of a professional dancer, physiotherapeutic or physical treatment methods are applied in every tenth case only. Alternative and holistic concepts such as Pilates or dance-specific re-integration that proved successful in professional dancers, are used in even fewer instances. The aim of this study is to develop a rehabilitation concept for professional dancers focusing on dance-medicine aspects. It has been taken into account that the best physical outcomes are reflected in an optimized, holistic, dance-specific therapy and rehabilitation. Intensifying and exploiting dance-specific methods of treatment can not only reduce costs in the end but can even contribute to reducing the duration of rehabilitation after injuries of dancers. Preconditions for realization of the rehabilitative model are a high qualification of all persons working in the rehabilitative field as well as a marked willingness to cooperate in the various dance fields. Both gender-specific and dance-style particularities are to be taken into account to ensure a successful rehabilitation.","576":"Returning to work after cancer frequently plays an important role for patients of working age. Accordingly, occupation and return to work are key issues for these patients during rehabilitation. So far there is only little empirical evidence from Germany concerning the expectations cancer patients in inpatient rehabilitation hold in relation to their return to work. Negative expectations may hamper returning to work. The context of rehabilitation offers the opportunity to work on potential problems to prepare a successful re-entry into employment. The aim of this study is to analyze the expectations of patients towards getting back to work and how helpful in this respect they estimate the work-related therapies provided during rehabilitation. Furthermore we asked whether professional support should be offered already before getting into inpatient rehabilitation and to what extent they have experienced that kind of help. We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with 32 cancer patients who participated in inpatient cancer rehabilitation. All patients had been recruited within the same clinic. Interviews were analyzed based on Mayring's \"Qualitative Content Analysis\". The majority of the patients experienced positive reactions from their occupational environment after learning about the diagnosis. Most of them are optimistic to get help from colleagues and supervisors when returning to work. Prior to their rehabilitation stay 47% had received counseling on cancer and return to work from general practitioners or oncologists. Regarding the occupation-related offers during rehabilitation, the results suggest that women and men have different needs. Women consider them to be more helpful than men. The results indicate that after having received their diagnosis most cancer patients do not experience negative reactions from their work environment and consequently report few worries with regard to returning to work. The different views on work-related offers during rehabilitation indicate that the concepts of occupation-related therapies within cancer rehabilitation might be optimized by taking the different needs of male and female patients into account.

In both indication areas an average of one psychologist is in charge of 100 patients. In the treatment of patients with chronic back pain and coronary heart disease, several methods of psychological assessment and a wide range of psychological interventions are being applied. On the whole, there are notable parallels between the psychological interventions provided to patients with chronic back pain and coronary heart disease. At the same time, however, there is considerable heterogeneity among rehabilitation facilities as to the psychological interventions carried out. The heterogeneity found reveals the low degree of standardization of psychological practice in medical rehabilitation of patients with chronic back pain or coronary heart disease.

How-ever, interprofessional treatment, such as in medical rehabilitation, is very important in the treatment of chronic diseases. This requires an extended understanding of shared decision-making. Therefore the aim of the study is to develop an interprofessional training (IPT) for implementation of shared decision-making (SDM) in rehabilitation clinics. The needs and preferences of the persons undergoing rehabilitation were collected in 4 focus groups, with frequency of answers analyzed by means of inductive category formation. The providers' preferences and requirements concerning a training programme on shared decision-making were assessed through an expert survey and underwent a mainly descriptive-explorative evaluation as well as a partial content analysis. 36 patients took part in the focus groups. Besides the wish for more participation in treatment decisions, they expressed further needs, such as more time and respect. The -experts of the 4 clinics (n=34, rate of response: 71%) also assessed these aspects of the patient-provider interaction as relevant. However, they saw the highest training need in the area of interdisciplinary team interactions. The interprofessional training programme \"Fit for SDM\" was developed on the basis of these results, and consists of 2 modules for the implementation of shared decision-making in medical rehabilitation. Module 1 focuses on external participation (provider-patient interaction), Module 2 on internal participation (team interaction). Module 2 was additionally used for preparing executives in their role as multipliers in the team. The training is currently being evaluated in a cluster-randomized multicentre study.

The central research issue had been the question how far client-centred OT treatment enables improvement in the occupational performance of mentally ill persons. In order to answer the research question raised 150 persons in various vocational rehabilitation institutions were interviewed. The clients' recent performance and their satisfaction with their abilities were assessed in a pre-post design using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) and the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS). The focus of the Occupational Therapy interventions carried out had been on client orientation, on training of social competence and on activities of daily living. The intervention group's COPM scores, their COPM-satisfaction scores, as well as their SOFAS ratings of difference were significantly higher than those found for the control group. It could be shown that applying client-centred Occupational Therapy methods in vocational reintegration work can contribute considerably to improving the performance, satisfaction, quality of life, and social skills of persons with mental illness.

Experiences from other countries revealed that introduction of DRG does not only have a significant impact on hospitals but also on rehabilitation facilities. The study approach ensures a comprehensive analysis as it considers major clinical, therapeutic, psychological and economic aspects. The REDIA study is the only nationwide empirical study that includes all stages of the implementation process: before DRG implementation, during the convergence phase and following implementation. An indication-specific comparison of the phases showed significantly shorter stays in the acute sector as well as shorter transition times between the sectors, resulting in admission of patients into rehabilitative care at an earlier stage of their recovery process. Significant diversions of treatment efforts from the acute sector to the rehabilitative sector have been proven in terms of increased nursing efforts and potential changes in the therapeutic and medical treatments to be provided.","589":"","590":null,"591":"The composition of participants and the success of rehabilitation of an ambulant vocational rehabilitation programme for persons with mental illness was examined (Integration Seminar; 1994-2009; n=703). The programme applies an individualized concept of rehabilitation. The findings show that average age and share of participants with psychotic illness had increased over the years. The share of long-term unemployed persons in all was very high and had increased strongly in the 2002-2005 period. Depending on the year of programme completion, the share of successful participants ranged between 50% and 60% a year. The success of rehabilitation turned out relatively stable over all measurement times (r (s)=0.52-0.83) and correlates with resilience, age and duration of unemployment. This implies the necessity of an early beginning of vocational rehabilitation, as the probability of success decreases with increasing duration of prior unemployment. Overall, the concept of individualized ambulant vocational rehabilitation turns out very successful.","592":"As the common sense self-regulation model (CSM) was further developed in the late 1990s, its focus was, along with subjective illness perceptions, the treatment representations of patients, in particular medication-related perceptions. However until now, only few studies have dealt with subjective concepts regarding non-medication treatment. The objective of this study was to explore the core content areas of the treatment concept of rehabilitation patients as a basis for developing a questionnaire to survey rehabilitation-related treatment beliefs. In 5 inpatient rehabilitation centres for psychosomatic and musculoskeletal diseases, guided focus groups were conducted with a total of n=25 rehabilitation patients. Some 56% of the participants were female; the average age was 52.8 years (SD=10.8). The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using the computer programme Atlas.ti based on the method recommended by Mayring in a multi-stage qualitative content analysis procedure. In the analysis of the discussion transcriptions, a total of 579 patient statements were categorized with 49 codes that were assigned to the areas (1) expectations and beliefs with respect to the rehabilitation process, (2) expectations of results, and (3) fears associated with rehabilitation. The process expectations were the most frequently discussed topic, constituting 58.2% of all patient statements. It was found that the patients associate not only numerous individual treatments with rehabilitation but also have concrete perceptions about the specific form rehabilitation should have, their own role in the rehabilitation process, and features of the overall rehabilitation concept. The outcome expectations are related to the areas activities of daily life and job, psyche, soma, and effectiveness of rehabilitation. Fears with respect to rehabilitation generally played only a subordinate role for those surveyed. The indication-specific analyses showed that the perceptions regarding the realization and form of rehabilitation differed among the various diagnosis groups, but the patients named similar categories for expectations of results and fears, with only some variation in importance. The focus groups allowed good insights into the patient perspectives of rehabilitation. Simultaneously, a good basis was created for generating contents of items for a questionnaire on the rehabilitative treatment concept, so that along with literature analyses, the qualitative method proved to be a suitable approach and good source for developing a questionnaire. ","593":"The aim of the study was to examine the direct and the indirect change measurement; previous studies comparing the 2 methods demonstrated that they agree only to a limited extent. Analyses of the factorial structure have shown that indicators of direct change measurement were assigned regardless of the content of a dimension common to them. This paper examined whether previous results obtained on scale level were also valid on item level. Empirical data were obtained from 3 rehabilitation patient samples (n=466, n=194, n=610). The factorial structures of the direct and indirect measurements of change were assessed and compared using principal components analysis with oblique rotation. Additionally, analyses were performed stratified across clinical indications and only for items of the direct change measurement. The factorial structure of 3 data sets showed that the previously published scale-level results were also valid on item level. Analyses demonstrated only low to medium agreement between the 2 methods of change measurement. The indicators of direct change measurement loaded regardless of their content on one or a few common dimensions, which did not agree with those of the indirect change measurement. In considering the 2 methods of measuring change, it is apparent that the standard method of change measurement (indirect change measurement) is suitable to reflect a comprehensive and multi-dimensional representation of changes within the field of medical rehabilitation evaluation.

Despite essential improvements in intensive medical care from the accident scene to clinic life, comprehensive rehabilitation, and implementation of a lifelong aftercare system, the life expectancy of SCI patients is still reduced. Especially patients with high tetraplegia die significantly earlier from pulmonary complications. The longer the onset of SCI is survived, the more patients die from age-related diseases. In old paraplegic patients, pressure sores are the only major SCI-related complication.

In addition, it presents a modification of this instrument, called lower-saxony ERBI (lsERBI). In order to validate the lsERBI, it has been used in 273 neurological rehabilitants. Findings suggest that the lsERBI has a higher specificity but lower sensitivity than the conventional ERBI. Inter-rater-reliability was high (r=0.84). Further studies are welcome to validate the lsERBI.","598":"An extended version of the Barthel index, the so-called \"Early Rehabilitation Barthel Index\", or ERBI, is widely used in German early neurological rehabilitation centres and even was used in defining early rehabilitation procedures in the German DRG system. It contains highly relevant items like mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, or dysphagia. This study presents an English version of the ERBI and examines its validity and reliability. Two samples of early neurological rehabilitation patients have been analyzed. In one sample (n=1,669), measures of morbidity and length of stay (LOS) have been compared between certain ERBI categories. In a second sample (n=273), inter-rater reliability (nurses vs. physicians) has been examined. Patients with low ERBI had a significantly longer LOS than those with high ERBI values (p&lt;0.001). Further, parameters of morbidity (patient clinical complexity level, number of co-diagnoses) were significantly higher in a low ERBI subgroup. Inter-rater reliability was r=0.849 (p&lt;0.001). The findings suggest that the ERBI is a reliable and valid scale to assess early neurological rehabilitation patients.","599":"The study deals with the question of how patients with chronic ischemic heart disease assess different health situations that can be achieved by rehabilitation. Furthermore it examines which factors influence these health valuations and whether the predictors vary depending on the level of education. The health valuations of n = 331 patients with chronic ischemic heart disease are compiled using visual analogue scales (VAS). In addition to sociodemographic questions, generic and illness-specific scales (SF-12, MacNew) for the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) are used as potential predictors of the health valuations. Additional basic medical data were provided by the physician. Hierarchical regression analyses are conducted; the sociodemographic, medical and HRQOL variables are included stepwise. Since many variables are observed for the regression models, an imputation of missing values is made. The health dimensions \"Self-care and domestic life\" and \"Mobility\" are assigned the highest values on the VAS. The lowest preference is assigned to the dimensions \"Reduction of symptoms\" and \"Information about the disease\". The differences between the health dimensions are statistically significant. Sociodemographic variables explain up to 3.6% of the variance of health valuations, with level of education and living with a partner being the most important predictors. The medical variables included in the second step explain between 2.1 and 6.8% incremental variance; the most important predictor is the operation performed prior to rehabilitation (bypass, heart valve). The HRQOL variables in the third block provide 7.1-24.9% incremental explanation of variance, by far the highest percentage. This is mainly achieved using the 3 MacNew scales (emotional, social and physical functioning). The overall explanation of variance for the health valuations is 17.1-28.8%. For patients with a higher level of education, the total explanation of variance is about 9.2% higher on average than for the total sample and lies between 21.2 and 44.1%. The health dimensions examined are assessed quite differently by the patients. The most significant factor of influence is the HRQOL. In the subgroup of patients with a higher level of education, the predictive strength of the variables examined is considerably higher in comparison with the total sample. Since the health valuations can be predicted to a limited extent only using other data arising during routine care, it is necessary to implement special methods for compiling health valuations.

In 2008, the effectiveness of SOR regarding return to work was affirmed for the first time in a comprehensive study. However, in view of the growing amount of SOR, the question of differential effects of SOR in special subgroups is raised. This paper presents a re-analysis of data collected in the 2008 study. A total of 696 patients after medical rehabilitation were included in the analyses, 348 with SOR provided by the DRV, and a control group of 348 patients without SOR matched on a multitude of different variables using the Propensity Scores. Successful outcome was measured using a combined criterion \"Return to work in good health\", that is, patients returning to gainful activity and with sick leave of under 6 weeks and no intention to retire within a one-year follow-period after medical rehabilitation. Differentiating criteria are age gender, rehab indication, periods of sick leave in the year before medical rehabilitation, kind of and access to medical rehabilitation. The data indicate especially good results of SOR for patients with mental disorders (OR=2.49), patients who were requested to participate in medical rehabilitation by a health insurance fund because of long-term sick leave (OR=2.71), and patients with longer periods of sick leave before medical rehabilitation (3 to &lt;6 months: OR=2.41, 6 months and more: OR=2.23). In contrast, there are only minimal effects (statistically not significant) of SOR in patients with medical rehabilitation directly after a hospital stay (\"Anschlussheilbehandlung\"), patients with cardiac or oncological diseases, and in younger (age 19-34) and older patients (age 55-60). In-depth analyses show that SOR success is more marked in patients with poorer return to work prospects. The findings indicate differential effects of SOR after medical rehabilitation for subgroups, effects associated in particular with return to work problems, kind of disease, and age. There is evidence for greater benefits of SOR in groups of patients with a high risk of non-successful reintegration. Hence, SOR opens up new options after medical rehabilitation in patients with especially severe impairments.

In almost all indications there is evidence of benefit of Work MR in patients with distinctive work-related problems due to chronic disease or disability. Nevertheless, there is a lack of implementation in clinical practice. This is due to a variety of reasons, mainly a missing definition of the appropriate Work MR interventions. The development of a Profile of Requirements (PoR) for defining contents and patterns of Work MR on behalf of the Statutory Pension Insurance (SPI) therefore is a fundamental step towards evidence-based, needs-focused rehabilitation management. The article introduces such a PoR - for the present focused on somatic indications. The PoR was developed by an SPI expert group and revised in an extensive discourse within the SPI. A strategy involved in this context was the dissemination of work-related therapeutical concepts in medical rehabilitation. In the PoR, Work MR is defined as a concrete work-related designing of therapeutical interventions as well as an integrated \"philosophy\" in thinking and practicing of the actors involved. Work MR is differentiated in 3 intervention levels: While work-related basic interventions (Level A) are provided in all facilities for all patients, core interventions (Level B) as well as specific interventions (Level C) are explicitly concentrated on patient subgroups with distinct work-related problems. In the PoR the relevant diagnostic and therapeutic work-related interventions are attributed to the different intervention levels and described concerning the concrete arrangement. The 3 central core interventions \"Work-related psychological group interventions\", \"Work-related internal load test\" and \"Work conditioning\" are presented. The decisive benefit of the PoR is to substantiate the requirements of Work MR on behalf of the SPI often worded in a rather unspecific manner in the past. In the current pilot study called \"Work MR Management\" the feasibility of Work MR in clinical practice based on the PoR is tested. The resultant recommendations will provide the basis for disseminating Work MR throughout Germany independent of setting and indication.

Implementation of the programme generated several problems and obstacles that are not, or not to this extent, present in the inpatient setting of a rehabilitation clinic. The patient education programme was developed in line with an existing inpatient programme, taking into account the criteria for evaluating such training programmes. Several adjustments to process, structure and content level had to be made to achieve the conditions of the outpatient setting. Since May 2008, 17 training courses took place in various outpatient and acute inpatient settings, and a total of 156 women with diagnosed endometriosis participated. The problems and obstacles that emerged affected similarly the process, structure and content of the training programme. On the structural level, especially problems with availability of rooms, technical equipment and trainers occurred, leading to significant time pressures. The main problem on the procedural level was the recruitment of participants, since--in contrast to the inpatient setting and to disease management programmes--no assignment by physicians or insurers takes place. Furthermore, gainful activity of the participants and the resulting shift of the training beyond the usual working and opening hours are important barriers for implementation. The unavailability of trainers in these settings requires creative solutions. Regarding the contents of the training it has to be taken into consideration that--unlike the inpatient setting--no aftercare intervention and no individual psychological consultation are possible. The training programme has to be designed in such a way that all problems that have occurred could be dealt with appropriately. In summary, the permanent implementation of an outpatient training programme is possible but is more time-consuming than inpatient trainings due to unfavourable conditions concerning recruitment, organization and procedure. It seems that \"soft\" factors such as motivation, integration into the clinic concept, well-defined acceptance of responsibility and experience in dealing with the disease and with patient groups are the critical success factors.

The present study dealt with patients' acceptance of this programme, changes in disease-related knowledge, perceived health- and illness-related quality of life, and mental symptoms over the treatment course. During inpatient cardiac rehabilitation, 64 patients (79.7% male) participated in this competence-focused programme for patients with chronic heart failure. Before, directly after and 6 months after participation in the programme, they filled in self-rating questionnaires on their mental wellbeing (HADS anxiety and depression), quality of life (SF-36, KCCQ), and a test of their knowledge on heart-related disease behavior. Additionally they were given an evaluation-questionnaire of the programme. Evaluation of the programme given by the patients was very good. Knowledge and perceived quality of life had increased significantly at the end and 6 months after rehabilitation. Mental symptoms of anxiety and depressivity were reduced directly and also 6 months after rehabilitation. Over the course of a multidimensional cardiac rehabilitation programme focusing on training of disease-directed competences, patients felt better and were better informed.

Against the background of this amendment of the law, the present study was commissioned by Deutsche Rentenversicherung Bund to get information relative to indication, introduction, implementation and results of the new SOR procedure. Analysis of routine data from the German pension insurance scheme pertaining to more than 140 000 insured persons treated in more than 1 083 medical rehabilitation centres, as well as of more than 6 500 participant surveys, resulted in a so far unique database for investigating SOR. This database offers a comprehensive collection of data and experiences relative to the amount of SOR prescribed and realized, to participants, procedure and results of SOR under the pension insurance scheme. This amount of data has never before been available when SOR was provided by the health insurance funds. The data collected suggest pinpoint indication of SOR, a positive rating of participants and an effective contribution to reintegration into working life and prevention of premature retirement.

Before and after the intervention the participants were questioned using semi-structured interviews. Beside the qualitative analysis of the interviews the process of the course and the making of the book were demonstrated using the example of a breast cancer patient. The participants reported various effects of the intervention. In all, 17 of 23 participants have created her own book. More than 75 % of the books created pick out their own cancer disease as a central theme. The participants deal with the subject in different ways.

It intends the patient-oriented imparting of information referring to social system, legal rights, earning capacity and occupational reintegration as well as an early feedback of the sociomedical assessment by the physicians. Participants during in-patient rehabilitation are supported to deal with their occupational situation; motivation to stay employed is strengthened. The group programme contains five psychoeducative modules and an additional sociomedical \"ward round\". The aim of the study was to examine the acceptance of the newly developed sociomedical vocational therapy module. A total of 179 patients participated in 21 \"vocational perspective\" seminars within the scope of a controlled quasi-experimental trial. In the experimental group the data on acceptance of the treatment was assessed by questionnaire at the end of the intervention. Experiences with implementation of the programme are described in order to complete the patient-related perspective. The identification of a demand for work-related interventions in medical rehabilitation seemed successful: Sociodemographic and socioeconomical parameters of the sample proved high risk in view of the social-medical perspective (poor education, high unemployment rates and long-term sick leave). Self-estimations revealed high suffering of the participants, e. g. due to the occupational situation, anxiety and depression, and confirmed high interest in work-related issues. The patients showed quite high acceptance of the programme (regarding importance of seminar, comprehensibility, usefulness of information, atmosphere of the group, mode and extent of the programme). 82.7% of the participants would recommend the programme to other people with work-related problems. Altogether, the experiences during the implementation of the programme can be described as positive. Nevertheless, organizing took much effort and the treatment was very demanding for the therapists. Finally, it is also necessary that the physicians agree to realize high transparency in the process of sociomedical assessment. The sociomedical programme \"Vocational Perspective\" helps patients to deal with relevant information referring to social system and occupational reintegration. Problematical sociomedical issues can be handled in a therapeutic way during rehabilitation process. Therefore, the programme can be used as meaningful supplement in regular medical rehabilitation.

About 60% of patients returned to work (35% worked, 9.3% were seeking a job, 13.5% underwent training). Positive predictors for return to work were lower age and high educational level.

Work-related factors could modify the risk of disability in a sustainable manner, and assessment of these factors might contribute to better risk prediction. Using the example of psychosocial work factors, empirical studies examining the question whether those exposures predict forthcoming events of disability retirement were to be identified. The review was expected to help quantify disability risks related to specific psychosocial factors at work. A systematic review was conducted. 20 studies were found which studied associations between disability retirement and different aspects of the psychosocial work environment in a longitudinal design. Most studies found elevated disability risks in persons exposed to psychosocial factors at work. Important single factors were low control, monotonous work, work stress (job strain, effort-reward imbalance), a lack of social support, problems related to the organization of work and to leadership behaviours. There is evidence that psychosocial work factors influence the short- and long-term risk of disability pensioning.

The overall approval rate was 70%, with a range between 60 and 86% in regional pension insurances.

Physicians frequently argued that ambulatory psychotherapy was unavailable due to long waiting lists or lack of psychotherapists. The problem whether shortcomings in ambulatory care can constitute sufficient reason to affirm a need for inpatient rehabilitation is discussed. It is necessary to improve the basis for needs assessment by the medical services (e. g. personal assessment, contacting family doctors). A survey of the further development (e. g. course of disease, disability days, and early retirement) of insurees whose applications for rehabilitation were rejected is recommended.","623":"Disability assessment is a complex and multifaceted process of exploration and evaluation, which in terms of legal evidence can be of far-reaching consequence for the claimant, the statutory pension insurance and finally for society as well.

The article outlines the legal background and practical framework conditions for the present assessment duty and refers to examples of existing methods for needs assessment, which in general are still too much aligned to specific benefits. In light of these circumstances, a need for action exists in order to implement legal demands relative to needs assessments across social insurance agencies and to advance approaches already in place.","625":"Needs Assessment for participation benefits (rehabilitation) in Germany is part of the administrative proceedings.

Following the principle of cooperation the need has to be assessed for all administrative bodies possibly involved as responsible for a participation benefit to be provided. In practice, however, needs assessment is still focussed on issues within the specific domain of the various administrative bodies. There is hardly any research on the implementation of needs assessment under a legal point of view.

A molecular-genetic investigation showed a duplication in the CYP2D6 gene. This genetic situation caused a quick metabolizing-status for substances dependent on CYP2D6 like Tramadol, which is a prodrug. The quick metabolizing-status resulted in an increased rate of active Tramadol-metabolites which caused the chronic dizziness. Under morphine sulphate which is metabolized independently of CYP2D6, a sufficient analgetic outcome could be achieved.

Existing data demonstrate that patients report detailed ideas about indicators and preconditions of good quality of rehabilitative care. Patients' quality concepts differ in some aspect from the quality definitions of health care professionals. There is some evidence that patients' views on quality are a necessary extension and completion of programme evaluation and of quality management. They influence usage and selection of rehabilitation facilities and programme elements and probably patient satisfaction and long-term outcomes as well. Patients' ideas could contribute to gaining a deeper understanding of patients' needs. Here, patients are experts to define challenges for long-term improvements in health and health-related behavior with regard to everyday life and related resources and barriers.

Therefore, exemplary studies concerning interface analyses leading to solutions and networking activities are discussed in this article. Different problems and fields of action regarding access to rehabilitation are presented: the role of physicians in practice concerning the patients' applications for rehabilitation, post-acute rehabilitation since introduction of the Diagnosis Related Groups in the acute hospital setting, and the involvement of companies and different funding agencies. With regard to networking in rehabilitation, issues dealt with are work-related interventions as well as challenges for the rehabilitation team concerning joint presentation of concepts in the face of an increasing differentiation of competences and a new distribution of roles and tasks. In this context, quality management within the rehabilitation facilities as well as internal and external patient-orientation including shared decision-making are highly significant during the rehabilitation process. The planning of activities to be realized after discharge from the rehabilitation facility is dealt with in greater detail in view of recommendations for and implementation of physical activities and stepwise return-to-work measures. Rehabilitation has an important course-setting function by supporting rehabilitants on their way toward self-management. Networking within, including and by means of rehabilitation requires considerable effort, which needs to be followed along by research and quality assurance.

On the whole, positive results predominate. Big differences in quality however have been found between the rehabilitation centres. The data collections and data evaluations carried out make a continuous process of quality assurance reporting possible for use by rehabilitation centres and pension insurance agencies.

After giving a general definition of quality, this article deals more closely with 3 aspects of quality: quality development, quality assurance, and data on quality. Quality development in rehabilitation centres demands an atmosphere that supports change, encourages creativity, courage, transparency and involvement, and reduces fear. The creation of such an atmosphere is, in particular, the responsibility of a centre's management. Routine interviews regarding patient as well as employee satisfaction, and the use of strategic planning and management systems have proven successful instruments in the practice of quality development. Compared with other sectors of the health system, quality assurance in rehabilitation is marked by its comprehensive approach, intense patient orientation, scientific underpinning, and nationwide implementation. Regarding the benefits of these programmes for the health system at large, however, no clear scientific proof is available yet. Data gained from quality assurance programmes on the whole show a high amount of patient satisfaction, good quality of structures and processes as well as an improvement of the patients' health status. Between centres, however, there are marked differences of quality in a number of cases, and long-term effectiveness could be improved in some indications. Finally, suggestions are offered concerning further development of quality in rehabilitation as well as of the quality assurance programmes.","637":"","638":"An association of professions, administrations and facilities as well as expert and self-help associations involved in rehabilitation, the German Association for Rehabilitation, DVfR has for several years been dealing intensively with the issue of technical aids provision in Germany. For many people with health problems, technical aids and assistive devices are an indispensable prerequisite for their equal participation in society. In light of the issue's considerable relevance for people with disabilities, the German Association had already in 2006 presented an expert opinion on the current status of technical aids provision, pointing out a number of quality problems in various fields. In the paper now presented, options are set out for overcoming these problems. Initially, fundamentals of technical aids provision are pointed out; apart from an overview of technical aids, this comprises conceptual and legal aspects of provision and, above all, issues involved in assessment of need and in quality including economical aspects. In the main section, suggestions are set out for optimizing the provision of technical aids, first in relation to the basic information processes of provision, followed by suggestions for improvements in the fields of professional education as well as further and continued education, including improvements in research. Another important section refers to suggestions for optimizing assessment of need, indication and prescription. Subsequently, the decision-making processes of the financially responsible agencies are dealt with as well as the process of clarifying which agency is in charge. The following sections deal with production and adaptation processes, outcome quality, as well as further development of the framework conditions at hand. Concluding annexes refer to legal issues in respect of the participation focus of technical aids provision and to considerations to be heeded in elaborating a provision concept.","639":"","640":"The supply with rehabilitative technical aids in Germany is regulated in a complex way. Technical aids can be granted by different social security agencies for purposes of medical treatment, for long term care, for compensation of disabilities in the context of medical rehabilitation, for workplace participation and for participation in society. At present, the most relevant carriers of technical aids for compensation of disabilities are the statutory health insurance funds. In practice and jurisprudence there are several problems. A distinction is made between direct and indirect compensation of disability, and the obligation to provide cover is restricted to the compensation of basic needs. Both are questionable in the light of the German disability law and the ICF. The needs assessment cannot be carried out by physicians alone but has to be multifactorial. Fixed prices for technical aids are not always sufficient. In that case they are unlawful according to the latest jurisprudence of the Federal Social Court. The technical aids register of the statutory health insurance funds cannot restrict the rights of the insured. Further problems of legislation and practice are the responsibility for the supply with technical aids in homes for elderly or disabled persons and the tendering procedures of the statutory health insurance funds. A new codification is needed to simplify and clarify the law.","641":"","642":"","643":"The aim of this study was to investigate the relevance and the barriers of physician empathy in medical rehabilitation by conducting a narrative literature review and a qualitative survey in physicians. First, we described the current state of research of physician empathy in medical rehabilitation based on a narrative (non-systematic) review of the literature. Additionally, the questions of relevance and barriers of physician empathy were examined in a qualitative short survey with physicians from Rehabilitation Medicine, Internal Medicine, Pediatric and Family Medicine. The qualitative data were analyzed according to the summarizing content analysis of Mayring. Only n=13 studies of physician empathy were conducted in Rehabilitation Medicine; of those, just a few were from Germany and a small number investigated the influence of empathy on patient health outcomes. The qualitative survey's results regarding the definition, patient outcomes and barriers of physician empathy are similar to other theoretical and empirical studies on those issues. Moreover, they show many new, practical aspects, particularly in the field of barriers of physician empathy. Although physician empathy has been shown to be an outcome-relevant factor in acute health care, less attention has been paid to it in Rehabilitation research. Physicians from Rehabilitation Medicine, Internal Medicine, Pediatric and Family Medicine perceive empathic behavior also as an outcome-relevant ability, which is particularly hindered by time pressure and stress but also by personal and patient-specific factors. ","644":"A body of evidence suggests that good interaction is crucial for high-quality medical practice and that it has a considerable impact on treatment outcomes. Less is known about the role and significance of doctor-patient interaction in rehabilitation. The study's aim was to capture perceived quality of doctor-patient interaction in rehabilitation by a rating instrument (P.A.INT-Questionnaire) and to examine the relationship between perceived quality of interaction and long-term treatment outcomes. Referring to the approach of Bensing (1990) and Rogers (1972) we defined \"quality of interaction\" in terms of 3 dimensions: (1) affective behaviour, i. e., empathy, positive regard and coherence; (2) instrumental behaviour: providing and collecting information, structuring and reinforcement; (3) participation and involvement of patients. 2 parallel versions of the Questionnaire were developed for patients and physicians. 7 rehabilitation clinics in north-western Germany participated in the multi-centre study. 61 doctors and their 470 patients evaluated both their shared dialogues upon admission, discharge and at least one ward round. Furthermore, patients rated their health status on admission (t0), discharge (t1) and 6 months after discharge (t2) using the IRES-3 (Indicators of Rehabilitation Status Questionnaire Version 3). (1) Comparisons of patient and physician evaluations on admission revealed the following: Affective quality of contact (empathy and coherence) was rated positively and without discrepancies by both patients and physicians. On the other hand, instrumental behaviour (information and structuring) was rated less positively by patients than by physicians. (2) Patients who rated the dialogue on admission more positively showed stronger treatment effects with respect to pain, to anxiety and depression 6 months after discharge. Also disability days decreased about 40% stronger in the group of positive raters. (3) Patient ratings of quality of interaction showed low but significant correlations with patient-related aspects like coping with disease, health-related knowledge and former positive experiences with physicians. A stepwise regression analysis revealed that interaction quality seems to contribute to enhanced treatment results independently of patients' competences. Our results suggest a positive relationship between perceived interaction quality as defined by the P.A.INT-Questionnaire and treatment effects 6 months after discharge. Comparisons of patient and physician evaluations showed that physicians seem to be successful in building relationships on the affective level but less successful on the instrumental level (i. e., information, structuring and reinforcement). Our data underline the importance of interaction quality for the success of rehabilitation and thus the importance of specific skills such as providing and collecting information, recognizing patients' concerns and goals as well as reinforcement of health-related action. This is especially important when knowledge of disease and coping with disease on patients' side is poor. Interaction quality seems to contribute to better treatment results independently of patients' competences. ","645":"This article aims at shedding light on the role of physician and patient gender in the medical consultation. Because of the scarce amount of studies concentrating on gender aspects of the physician-patient interaction in rehabilitation or chronic disease, mostly results from general medicine are reported. Female physicians have a more emotional and less dominant communication style. Female patients bring up more psychosocial topics and disclose more information about themselves in general. Both female and male physicians give more information and apply a more partnership-oriented communication style when seeing a female patient. Female and male patients communicate more partnership-oriented with female physicians and share more psychosocial and medical information with them. Same-gender dyads seem beneficial most of the time for physician-patient communication. Mixed-gender dyads are more difficult, especially when a younger female physician sees a male patient. There is no single good communication style recommendable for all physicians. Rather, the research results presented should be applied to communication trainings for physicians. This could provide physicians with a flexible choice of communication styles to apply according to different situations.","646":"E-Health applications open new avenues for seamless care of patients with a chronic disease. This study examines the demand and the usage pattern of an Internet-assisted aftercare group-treatment following inpatient treatment. The analysis uses data from telephone interviews which were conducted 12 months after discharge. 168 study participants of the prospective controlled effectiveness study (73.7%) participated. The frequency and the time of beginning an outpatient psychotherapy are compared between controls and chat participants. Computerized text-analyses of the chat-scripts are used to examine the usage pattern of the chat-aftercare. Statements of the patients with chronic symptoms at the beginning and at the end of their chat participation are quoted for illustration of the contents of the group therapy sessions. Patients with chronic course of illness utilize the online-based aftercare more frequently and more actively than patients with short durations of illness. Words indicating cognitive processes are used more frequently by chat participant with chronic illness. Chat participants with chronic course of illness who are receiving no additional outpatient psychotherapy, relapse considerably less frequently than controls without any psychotherapeutic support. Patients with chronic course of illness use online aftercare treatment to sustainably improve their health status. ","647":"Patients have a great need for information that is often not satisfied by providing \"standard\" information. In order to reach the patients better, it is increasingly necessary to tailor patient information to the individual needs of patients and make stronger use of patients' \"common sense\" models. This article reports on the development and implementation of an intervention procedure for providing needs-based patient information as well as on initial results of its use. Both the intervention concept and the operationalization of its contents are based on the common sense self-regulation model (CSM). The intervention aims to link the information given to patients to the existing illness beliefs and treatment beliefs of the rehabilitation patients. To do this, the illness and treatment representations held by the patients before rehabilitation are assessed, automatically analyzed using a computer programme, and aggregated in a \"response questionnaire\". This feedback is then passed on to the information-providing therapists well in advance of admission of the rehab patients. The contents and key organizational data of the intervention procedure were discussed with the treatment providers in a feasibility analysis before implementation. In addition, intervention training was also conducted before the start of the intervention. Since August 2009 the procedure has been implemented and evaluated in 9 cooperating rehab centres. Process documentation provides criteria relative to the feasibility of the intervention. The results on implementation of the intervention as well as on its feasibility have thus far been relatively encouraging. The treatment providers ascribe high relevance to the contents of the intervention and assess the major components to be generally feasible. From the treatment provider viewpoint, the rehabilitation patients benefit from the intervention, and it is also considered to be helpful for planning further treatment. The intervention procedure for needs-based patient information presents an option for making information available to patients as needed. It is based on theory and accepted by treatment providers. The strengths and weaknesses of the intervention are discussed. ","648":"Communication between patient and providers is extremely important, especially for the treatment of chronically ill patients, characterized by a biopsychosocial disease model. This article presents an overview of the current status of research on patient-provider communication in 3 selected areas: the communication preferences of chronically ill persons, the correlation between communication and relevant endpoints, and interventions to improve patient-provider communication. One major result of the research is that patients display a rather high degree of inter- and intra-individual variability with respect to the preference of certain communication styles (e.g. patient participation); there are differences among them, and they develop varying preferences in the course of their illness. However, communicative behavior of the provider that is generally perceived by many patients to be positive can also be identified: affective behavior (for example, asking the patient about his\/her feelings, being sensitive to these feelings and responding to them), providing information in an understandable, proactive manner, and attempting to understand the patient's perceptions, expectations, and cognitive concepts. Successful communication requires a certain congruence between the patient's communication preferences and the provider's behavior. It has been sufficiently documented in literature that successful communication leads to greater adherence. The correlation to patient satisfaction is not documented quite as clearly but has often been shown. The findings vary with respect to the improvement in the patient's health status. The effectiveness of communication training for providers has been documented quite well regarding the immediate endpoints in patient-provider interaction (e.g., patient-oriented behavior); the evidence with respect to medium-term endpoints such as patient satisfaction varies, also due to the number of possible operationalizations of the endpoints. Supplementing provider training with communication-related training for patients appears to be an important and useful method as many studies have shown that the behavior of providers can be influenced using relatively simple measures that start with the patient. There is a need for further development of research on patient-provider communication, in particular with respect to a more solid theoretical basis, integration of methods including qualitative and quantitative methods, self-evaluations, and interaction analyses, and also concerning conducting more longitudinal studies.","649":"","650":"","651":"","652":"In this article the development of self-esteem and self-efficacy in adolescents with chronic physical illness with and without psychological symptoms is measured over one year, following a medical inpatient rehabilitation treatment of four to six weeks. Gender- and diagnosis-related differences are analyzed. 243 chronically ill adolescents were interviewed at the beginning of their rehabilitation treatment. After one year data of 99 chronically ill adolescents are available (age: M=14.6; SD=1.70), 50 boys. Self-esteem was measured using the revised Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. The revised Allgemeine Selbstwirksamkeitsskala was chosen for assessing self-efficacy at school and other social contexts. At the beginning of rehabilitation, psychological symptoms were identified using the German version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Therapy of chronically ill adolescents in medical rehabilitation affects their self-esteem positively, with differences in self-esteem found between adolescents who show clinically relevant psychological symptoms and those who do not. Only minor changes are however noticed in ratings of self-efficacy at school and other social contexts. Gender- and diagnosis-related differences have not been found.

Taking the theoretical model of rehabilitation and the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) into account, we propose a heuristic model of aims and effects of exercise therapy and define a system of methodological target setting. This system offers a background for an expanded scientific discussion about biopsychosocial determinants and effects of exercise therapy as well as quality development and the evaluation of exercise treatment concepts within and across indications in the context of multimodal medical rehabilitation.","655":"Medical rehabilitation of chronically ill children and adolescents is characterised by interdisciplinary methods including parents' participation. Research in this field leads to specific evaluation approaches and corresponding measurement procedures.

Because of the stark increase of research findings in the field of rehabilitation, it becomes difficult for the responsible rehabilitation providers to keep up to date on new findings and to realize the transfer of knowledge. Hence, the aim was to establish a literature research which surveys current national and international results in cardiac rehabilitation. The literature search was undertaken using the electronic databases OVID and includes publications from 2009 and the first 2 months of 2010. The selection of studies was performed in a team of experts based on the criteria of relevance, usefulness and methodological quality of research for rehabilitation. 26 primary sources were selected, mainly focusing the fields \"Cardiac rehabilitation: indications\", \"Risk factors and prevention\", \"Job-related reintegration\", \"Rehabilitation of specific medical disease patterns\" and \"New rehabilitation models\". The studies examined show very clearly that cardiac patients can benefit from participation in cardiac rehabilitation treatment and that prevention represents a central task of medical care in the long-term treatment of coronary diseases. There is a need for further research, especially concerning the topics \"New rehabilitation models\" and \"Job-related reintegration\". The DGRW Update intends to depict current developments and to promote evidence-based medicine in rehabilitation.

We conducted a controlled trial with two intervention groups. Both groups received an interdisciplinary training programme, with the first group (n=87) receiving the standard version, and the second group (n=72) receiving an additional tool 'BBS-trainer' to improve the perception of the pelvic floor muscles. Primary outcomes were quality of life (EORTC questionnaires) and impact of incontinence (modified questionnaire) evaluated up to six months after the treatment. The relationship between certain parameters such as incontinence was investigated. Mean age was 64 years; most of the participants were married and pensioned. Both groups improved significantly and to a relevant extent in most of the quality of life and incontinence variables during the three weeks of treatment, after six months they further improved significantly. Quality of life improved first, continence and impact on daily life followed. Some differences found between both groups refer to the time course. There is strong interaction between quality of life, incontinence and impact of incontinence. The interdisciplinary training programme shows quickly strong effects on quality of life and impact factors. It therefore is advisable that men with incontinence symptoms after prostatectomy should be offered such a treatment in a specialized rehabilitation clinic.

A total of 78 inpatients after TKA was randomized into the active versus the sham treatment samples; all patients received ten applications of their respective therapy assignment. The primary clinical endpoint of the investigation was defined as the three-months intraindividual change (%) in a patient's OSWESTRY total function score after start of treatment. Secondary endpoints were the WOMAC osteoarthritis index as well as a patient's pain profile as assessed by a visual analogue scale before start of treatment, after five and ten therapeutic applications, and three months after discharge from hospital. The M sample showed a median increase of 31% (22-38%) in the OSWESTRY total score from 53% before start of treatment to 91% three months afterwards; the control sample showed an increase of 18% (3-31%) in median from 56 % to 78%; the samples differed significantly in this three-months increase (p&lt;0,001) but not in the baseline OSWESTRY score before start of treatment (p=0,841). This randomized trial could demonstrate statistically significant superiority of microcurrent therapy embedded in conventional postoperative rehabilitation treatment after TKA versus the combination with a sham treatment. The results indicate an early introduction of microcurrent therapy concepts into postoperative treatment. ","663":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the one-day epilepsy training course IBF (Information, Counselling, Teaching) for staff members who support people with disabilities. IBF is designed to teach basic knowledge in epilepsy and thereby to promote appropriate support for people with epilepsy and additional disabilities. IBF trainers are recruited from the Bethel Institute in Germany with its special focus on epilepsy. They realize IBF courses on requests of other German facilities for people with disabilities and use teaching material on CD-Rom developed by a working group of the Bethel Institute. Data of 241 IBF participants and data of 197 staff members who took other courses than IBF could be compared twice. Two self-constructed questionnaires on (a) epilepsy knowledge and (b) epilepsy related concerns about caring had to be answered. Trainers administered the instruments at the beginning of the IBF courses (T1). Three months later (T2), the questionnaires were sent again to the IBF participants. The procedure for staff members of the control group was similar. Analyses of variance with repeated measurements showed that the IBF group - in contrast to the control group - improved significantly with respect to epilepsy knowledge and with respect to concerns about caring. The effect sizes of the IBF group changes on epilepsy knowledge had to be regarded as high, and improvements could be seen on most items of the scale. Effect sizes of the IBF group changes on concerns about caring had to be regarded as low, and improvements could only be seen on a few items of the scale. The essential finding of this study is that IBF proved to be efficient and that its most important goals are reached. Although a low responsiveness of the scale on epilepsy related concerns about caring cannot be excluded, it seems reasonable to discuss whether subjects that go beyond enhancing epilepsy knowledge should not be focussed even more in future IBF courses.

Treatment approaches whose effectiveness with regard to bronchial asthma was empirically verified (i. e., evidence-based) were identified (medical and diagnostic procedures as well as drug trials were excluded from the analysis). 152 methodically sound studies referring to asthma treatment of children and adolescents were selected. Strong evidence was found for patient education, parent education, exercise therapy, inhalation, and tobacco withdrawal. Nutritional counseling and avoidance of allergens showed limited evidence. Psychotherapy, relaxation techniques, breathing exercises, climate therapy, clinical social work (social and legal counseling services, vocational reintegration counseling, aftercare) and integration counseling showed inconsistent evidence. No evidence was found for alternative medicine. Challenges regarding the development of treatment standards for children and adolescent rehabilitation are highlighted; these refer to limitations in report quality in some of the studies, the validity of treatments for comorbid conditions, a lack of differentiation for different age groups, and transferability of outpatient or international study results to inpatient rehabilitation.","665":"In Germany, introduction of the law on Integrated Health Care (IC) (section sign 140a-d SGB V) opened up the possibility of cross-sectoral health care settings and new forms of remuneration, and improved the conditions for a closer cooperation between health care providers. However, cross-institutional and interdisciplinary work contexts demand new organizational structures in order to assure the coordination of different competences, resources and interests. This study aims at identifying factors of successful integrated care settings for total hip and knee arthroplasty. Using the example of an integrated care setting between an orthopaedic hospital and a rehabilitation clinic it will be examined which factors lead to successful implementation of the services and measures designed. A qualitative research design was developed comprising different methods of data assessment (participant observation, guided expert interviews, document analyses) enabling a comprehensive exploration. Overall, data were derived from six consultations with patients, two integrated care information sessions and various documents (17 patient files, information material, patient lists, etc.). First of all, the different phases of development and implementation of integrated care settings were described. In this context, clearly defined aims, structures and appropriate measures seem to be crucial for an ideal long-term cooperation. Furthermore, the staff perspective on the effects of the IC programme on their daily routines proved an essential basis for process reconstruction. The staff members pointed out four main aspects regarding IC settings, i. e., improved image, increased knowledge, intensity of relationship, and less and more work effort. Against this background, factors of successful IC settings could be generated such as the need for central coordination, a regular staff information systems as well as accompanying process monitoring. Several key factors of successful integrated care settings in arthroplasty could be generated which provide important clues for shaping future interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral cooperation settings in health care services in general.

The present paper describes the concept of the Research Network and the work contents addressed over the last three years. The advantages and disadvantages of this association and the changes initiated in practice were evaluated from the point of view of 19 quality managers of the participating clinics. The data were collected by means of semi-structured interviews, and a qualitative content analysis was performed in order to quantify the responses. The concept of the Research Network has proven successful. In the view of the quality managers of the clinics, implementation of DIN EN ISO 9001 has lead to structuring of the processes, improved internal communication, and increased motivation in the team. The major obstacles were the lack of time and human resources. In all clinics, the participation in practice-related research projects und scientifically monitored concept development has contributed to optimizing everyday practice. The exchange between the quality managers in external quality circle meetings was of central importance. The conjunction of internal quality management, practice-related research and concept development in a network can be recommended also for other associations of clinics, health centres or medical practices.","672":"The present study investigated whether women and men differ with regard to non-religious and religious coping with cancer, here: colon cancer--a question on which only little research has been done so far. 341 patients filled in a questionnaire during inpatient oncological rehabilitation. Statistical analyses showed that women reported higher mental strain than men. They used more bagatellization and wishful thinking, more depressive and less active problem-oriented coping strategies. A higher use of religious coping among women was to a high degree associated with their generally stronger religiosity. Correlations between coping strategies and measures of mental health indicated commonalities and differences. In particular, a positive correlation between active problem-oriented coping and mental health was found for men but not for women. In accordance with women's higher religiosity, the data indicate a stronger correlation between religious coping and adaptation among women than among men. The results suggest that gender differences and religiosity can be relevant in the context of treatment but that their significance must not be overinterpreted. In terms of patient orientation they speak for the necessity to individually assess the need for support, also with regard to the consideration of religiosity in the treatment process.","673":"This article presents a literature review on post-rehabilitation care focussing on preventive and health promotion aspects set out on the example of coronary heart disease. Selected studies and programmes for intensified aftercare are analyzed as to whether and to what extent preventive and health promotion aspects are integrated in post-rehabilitation care. The analysis includes a stock-taking of practice concepts and evaluation studies on aftercare programmes in cardiac rehabilitation in Germany. Presented is an overview of the aftercare programmes in place based on a comprehensive, systematic literature search. The review shows a great diversity of aftercare programmes available in cardiac rehabilitation. The findings support the assumption that aftercare offers a range of promising approaches for implementing preventive and health promotion activities due to its aim of achieving sustained rehabilitation success. So far, implementation of those activities has been insufficient. Cardiovascular risk factors such as lifestyle and psychosocial status are being considered to different degrees in those programmes in terms of intensity and frequency. Along with programmes showing a large proportion of preventive measures, only limited preventive structures are found for a majority of the aftercare concepts analyzed. Health promotion strategies are also identified in only few aftercare programmes. Effectiveness studies support good results for intensified aftercare, but they often refer to only part of the relevant cardiovascular risk factors and to only medium-term observation, while long-term proof of effectiveness is scarce. A small number of programmes with positive outcomes relative to the risk profile suggest that integration of preventive and health promotion activities can contribute strongly to improving and stabilizing the effects achieved in rehabilitation. The present analysis indicates further need for research in order to verify the effects of existing post-rehabilitation programmes concerning cardiovascular risk factors and determination of the relevant target groups.

Medical and vocational rehabilitation under the German statutory pension insurance scheme are among these strategies. For a long time already, preventive concepts have been taken into account in rehabilitation so that the pension insurance's prevention approach is mainly based on the experience gained with preventive-modules in rehabilitation and follow-up care. Having so far only been able to offer in-patient prevention benefits, the statutory pension insurance scheme now can offer out-patient prevention measures, given the amendment it initiated to change Section 31 (1) no. 2 of Book 6 of the German Social Code which came into effect on January 1, 2009. The common guidelines of the statutory pension insurance institutions directed at ensuring continued working capacity were revised relative to the preventive benefits contained and were supplemented by recommendations for their use. The changing occupational demands in modern service society have thus been taken into account, and prevention benefits can be implemented in a more flexible manner following successful trials. The concept of out-patient prevention measures following along at the workplace and during leisure time is intended to enhance sustainability of acquired health-promoting behaviours in every day (working) life. At present this new concept is being tried out in various circumscribed pilot projects by several pension insurance institutions, partly in combination with in-patient components.

Aims of the study were implementation and efficacy evaluation of an intensified multimodal work-related programme following a cognitive behavioural approach. Participants were patients with substantial work-related problems. Included patients were randomized in groups either to the work-related programme or to the common orthopaedic rehabilitation (cluster randomization). Primary outcome was return to work.

Questionnaires at post-treatment were completed by 155 (65.7%) persons and after six months by 169 (71.6%) persons. The medical performance evaluation given in the discharge letters documented a better performance of the intervention group (positive capacity: p=0.037; negative capacity: p=0.016). This evaluation was also reflected by the patients' evaluation at post-treatment. Participants of the intervention group reported higher work-related self-efficacy (p&lt;0.001) and felt that they are better prepared for the time after their rehabilitation (p=0.006).

How can disabled persons' right to occupational participation by way of vocational rehabilitation, a right stipulated both under the German constitution and in German law, be realized as needed also in the future? Various fields of action have been derived on the basis, for one, of an investigation of the factors, social law, social and education policy as well as European, influencing vocational rehabilitation and, for the other, of an evaluation of current labour market and demographic developments. Dealt with in the fields of action outlined are the aspects: equitable opportunities of access, developmental and needs orientation, closeness to the real occupational and working world, as well as the role of self-determination and self-responsibility. The fields of action are to be understood as framework concept for shaping a cross-actor innovation process. Sustainable vocational rehabilitation is characterized in particular by the fact that it is specifically targeted at promoting disabled persons' self-determination and self-responsibility actively using these in the process and that it strengthens an independent lifestyle, ensures social participation by inclusive structures; also, it facilitates continued participation in working life by ongoing education involving holistic development of professional and personal competencies oriented towards the individual's resources and potentials, safeguarding it by systematic networking with companies. The concept presented for vocational rehabilitation of adults with disabilities encompasses a change of paradigms which service carriers and providers will have to face jointly and including the service users, the rehabilitants.","687":"The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities should be regarded as a challenge to German education policy to finally establish a more comprehensive school system in Germany. There is no doubt that students with handicaps will find their place only in schools that respect and hold in high esteem every student, not only those with handicaps. The time of the traditional, highly separated special school system in Germany is over. Nevertheless we assume that we do need a variety of different forms of support in order to realize the right of every child to be educated. The building up of a school for all depends at least on the resources, mainly the human ones.","688":"A pilot study was conducted to implement and evaluate a routine gradual psycho-diagnostic programme to improve diagnostics and treatment of mental disorders in somatic rehabilitation centres. First of all, implementation strategies were acquired in trainings together with psychologists and physicians. The psycho-diagnostic programme consists of a screening instrument (PHQ-9) designed to permit time-effective detection of comorbid mental disorders. Besides evaluation of the training, the aim of the study was to analyze the extent to which it is possible to implement the routine gradual psycho-diagnostic programme in practice. Additionally, it was intended to identify beneficial and obstructive conditions for implementation. The pilot study was conducted in two orthopaedic and one cardiological rehabilitation centre. The training was evaluated directly after its completion using a questionnaire. Three months after its implementation, the introduction of the psycho-diagnostic programme was evaluated using interviews with n=11 physicians and psychologists. The training was rated positively by the participants . Implementation of the entire gradual psycho-diagnostic programme was possible in one centre and to some degree in the other two. Beneficial for implementation were a frank organisational climate, sufficient time resources, and physicians' biopsychosocial understanding of disease. A dismissive attitude towards psycho-diagnostics, little communication between staff members, little perceived advantage for one's own work and fear to stigmatise patients by psychiatric diagnoses were obstructive. Essential for a successful implementation are sufficient time and personal resources, a motivation for change in staff and centre management, and a positive attitude regarding psycho-diagnostics in clinic staff. Furthermore, flexibility in implementation strategies and the opportunity to participate in the implementation process are important. ","689":"The pivotal role of optimizing pharmacotherapy is generally accepted in somatic rehabilitation of various specialities like cardiopulmonary rehabilitation. No data exist as to whether significant modifications of pharmacotherapy occur during gastroenterological rehabilitation of Crohn's Disease (CD) patients. A single centre chart review was performed including patients with International Classification of Disease Codes for CD (ICD K50). The Harvey-Bradshaw activity index (HBI) and CD medications were protocolled at the beginning and end of in-patient rehabilitation. 337 of 355 patients with ICD K50 fulfilled the predefined diagnostic criteria of mild to moderate CD (250 female, 87 male, average age of 40 (95% confidenceinterval, 29-51)). Disease activity decreased from 4.9 to 3.7 by 1.2 (0.75-1.37) Units during 23 (20-35) days. On admission, 120 (36%) patients received one and 158 (47%) received two to five CD drugs. CD drug prescriptions changed in 162 (48%) patients. Overall, 116 (34%) patients received systemic steroids which were stopped in 14 patients (p&lt;0.05). In the remaining 102 patients the cortisol equivalence doses decreased from 77 to 56 mg by 21 (14-28) mg. The number of patients on azathioprine (AZT) increased from 98 to 108 (p&lt;0.05). The average AZT dose increased from 1.81 to 1.99 mg\/kg in 97 rehabilitants continuously treated. Our results describe an association between rehabilitation and significant changes of CD-specific pharmacotherapy in line with current treatment guidelines. This supports the concept that future studies on effects of gastroenterological rehabilitation should control for changes in pharmacotherapy. ","690":"The purpose of the study was to develop a generic questionnaire for assessing the patients' rehabilitation treatment representations on the theoretical basis of the Common Sense Model of self-regulation and analogous with established assessment instruments for illness representations and medication-related treatment representations. Using theory-based and empirical patient and provider input, a pool of 115 items on the patients' rehabilitation treatment representations was generated. The items were first pre-tested on n=182 rehabilitation patients in nine rehabilitation centres for the indications musculoskeletal diseases and psychosomatic illnesses. The next step was the factor analytical reduction of the item pool. The resulting factors were analyzed for unidimensionality, and the remaining items were analyzed for distribution of values. Internal consistency and the \"known groups validity\" were used to determine reliability and validity, respectively. Finally, patient acceptance of the questionnaire was assessed. The item pool was considerably reduced by factor analysis and the remaining items were grouped under four factors. After eliminating other single items on the basis of modification indices and indicator reliability, the unidimensionality of these factors was assessed as good. The majority of the remaining 23 items showed an asymmetrical distribution, which was also reflected by low item difficulty. The contents of the scales can be interpreted as \"somatic outcome expectation\", \"psychological outcome expectation\", \"process expectations\", and \"concerns\". The internal consistency of the scales (Cronbach's alpha) lies between 0.80 and 0.84 for the entire sample. The treatment representations for psychosomatic patients differ in the anticipated direction from those of orthopaedic rehabilitation patients. Patient acceptance of the questionnaire was very positive. The questionnaire developed allows aspects of the patients' rehabilitation treatment representations to be measured, the features of which are highly relevant for providers as a basis for providing individualized patient information. However, the results of the pretest have to be tested confirmatory and also indicate that there is still potential for improving the instrument and making it more precise. ","691":"Medical rehabilitation in Germany is still lacking in patient education programmes that meet certain quality requirements such as the use of manuals, patient-oriented didactics, and evaluations of effectiveness. For patients with chronic low back pain, no standardized and evaluated back school programme has so far been available for routine use. In this paper, we demonstrate the development of a quality-assured back school based on a health-education programme of the German statutory pension insurance scheme. Both topics and didactics incorporate treatment evidence, practice guidelines, quality criteria for patient education and theories of health and illness behaviour. First, formative evaluation was conducted to assess patient acceptance and practicability of the manual. Second, effects of the back school programme were assessed on a short-term (at the end of rehabilitation), medium-term (6-month follow-up) and long-term (12-month follow-up) basis in a randomized controlled study of patients with low back pain (n=360). Results show a significant medium treatment effect in patients' knowledge about chronic back pain and its treatment at the end of rehabilitation (p&lt;0.001; eta (2)=0.080). Furthermore, small to medium effects were also observed among some secondary outcomes, such as motivation to physical activity, pain beliefs and pain intensity. After the programme's medium- and long-term effects have been demonstrated, it will be recommended for implementation in medical rehabilitation. The manual meets the requirements that allow for a successful transfer into clinical practice.","692":"The German population faces an increasing proportion of the elderly. These changes are also reflected in the age composition seen in clinics for medical inpatient rehabilitation. The disease-related discomforts of elderly rehabilitants differ from the troubles faced by younger age-groups. Age-specific rehabilitation programmes and therapies play a key role in enabling long-term participation in occupational and societal life. This article explores age-specific expectations and aims towards medical rehabilitation among members of statutory pension funds aged 55 and above, their health-related problems and the status-quo of rehabilitative programmes. Using the data of 1 008 patients of orthopaedic medical inpatient rehabilitation, we assessed age-specific differences in the utilisation, provision and success of rehabilitation programmes, and in the satisfaction with rehabilitative measures. The data indicate distinctive health-related problems and higher strains among elderly rehabilitants. However, they enter the rehabilitation process with less and rather impeding expectations, their rehabilitation aims primarily focussing on their dominant health problems. Current medical inpatient rehabilitation programmes and treatments seem to lack patient-orientation, obviously they do not address the specific needs of the elderly. Instead of serving individual needs, the rehabilitative treatments seem to be administered evenly across all patients. Compared to younger age-groups, older patients benefit less from rehabilitation programmes. Their expectations concentrate very much on retirement, thus increasing their risk to retire from work. A patient-centred rehabilitation programme should at an early stage take on the specific strains and expectations of elderly rehabilitants and develop manageable solutions. The process could be supported by stronger involvement of and cooperation with the patient's general practitioner. Further suggestions are being developed by an ongoing research project.","693":"","694":"","695":"Between 50 and 90% of patients in psychosomatic rehabilitation are affected by occupational problems and misdirected stress. The patients often find themselves in a vicious circle in which occupational problems lead to the development of mental illnesses before a background of lacking compensation possibilities and positive resources. Besides, mobbing can be understood as a special form of occupational stress, whereas in former studies, no differences in the magnitude of mental strain were discovered in comparison with rehabilitants who were in a psychosomatic remedial treatment. Patients who are in psychosomatic remedial treatment and are norm-aberrantly limited in their occupational efficiency and patients who are affected by mobbing in the job show a higher psychosocial strain than other patients in treatment whose occupational efficiency is not limited. Do mobbing victims more frequently receive a recommendation that measures to strengthen their working life participation be considered? A total of 189 patients were handed out a questionnaire at the beginning of their remedial treatment comprised of questions regarding their mobbing experiences, the IRES-3, the SCL-27, the Fatigue-Scale, the Incongruity questionnaire and the VDS-scale. The sample was split up into a group whose occupational efficiency was limited, a group affected by mobbing, and a group who had no efficiency limitations. 72.6% were clearly limited in their occupational efficiency. 27.4% felt neither affected in their occupational efficiency nor due to mobbing. 21% of the sample as a whole were affected by mobbing. Patients limited in their occupational efficiency differed neither from patients whose efficiency was unlimited, nor from those who were affected by mobbing. On the other hand, mobbing victims differed in all symptom scales evaluated from patients who had no occupational efficiency limitations. Also the scales on personality styles were substantially increased compared to this group. With mobbing victims it was recommended more often that the possibilities for working life participation measures should be checked. Patients in psychosomatic rehabilitation are strongly affected by occupational limitations and have a huge need for counselling and support. Therapy concepts should pick up the occupational problems at hand in a differentiated manner, with job-oriented linked-up rehabilitation being recommended. The increased mental strain of mobbing victims must always be borne in mind. ","696":"The aim of this study was to investigate how depressiveness affects coping of patients with fibromyalgia. It was assumed that depressiveness has an influence on coping, self-efficacy und motivation for therapy. A total of 251 patients with fibromyalgia. The investigation started at the outset of their stay in the clinic, and both patients with and without depressiveness (HADS-D cut-off &gt;or=11) were examined. To investigate the differences, multivariate variance models were used for cognitive and behavioural coping, self-efficacy and motivation for therapy. Data were collected using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-D), German pain questionnaire (DSF), Questionnaire for assessment of level of coping with pain (FESV) and the German version of the Pain stages of change questionnaires (FF-STABS). Comparison of the groups shows significantly lower means for the fibromyalgia patients with depressive symptoms concerning \"perceived self-competence\", \"cognitive restructuring\", and \"countertraded activity\". The same results can be observed for \"self-efficacy\". Analysis of the motivation for therapy in the \"carefreeness\" scale shows significantly higher means in the fibromyalgia patients with depressive symptoms. In the \"maintenance\" scale, however, lower means are observed in this patient group. As fibromyalgia patients with depressive symptoms show greater strain on account of their psychosomatic symptoms, depressive symptoms should be dealt with during treatment. ","697":"For the therapy of fibromyalgia a multimodal therapy with patient education is recommended. It integrates pain management and stress management as well as cognitive restructuring. It will be examined whether depressiveness has an influence on rehabilitation outcome immediately after inpatient rehabilitation. Various questionnaires, i. e. the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-D), German Pain Questionnaire (DSF), Cognitive, Behavioural Coping and Psychological Strains Through Chronic Pain questionnaire (FESV), German version of the Pain Anxiety Symptom Scale (PASS-D) and the Patient questionnaire IRES-24, were distributed to 102 fibromyalgia patients in the framework of a pre post design. The scores of patients with and without depressiveness (HADS-D cut-off &gt;or=11) were compared by analysis of variance at two treatment points. Immediately after therapy, a general improvement was found regarding depressiveness and pain (strong effect size) as well as regarding pain-related anxiety (medium effect sizes). Only \"countertraded activity\" of coping with pain did not show any improvement. The \"rehabilitation status\" improved significantly whereas, in contrast, the \"physical health\" aspect did not improve. A significant increase was found on the \"pain\" scale. Additionally, depressive symptoms had a strong impact on the aspects \"physical health\", \"subjective health\" and on \"rehabilitation status\". In particular, patients with fibromyalgia and depressiveness showed poorer outcomes regarding these aspects than patients with fibromyalgia without depressiveness. A multimodal therapy with patient education can have a positive impact on the outcome of rehabilitation. ","698":"Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is often associated with clinical and subclinical levels of psychological problems. A higher stage of chronicity is associated with an increase in co-existing psychological disorders. Previous programmes of inpatient orthopaedic rehabilitation reveal little evidence of sustained rehabilitation effects, a finding which may be attributable to the absence of specific psychological treatment during the programme. Does cognitive-behavioural depression management training in patients with CLBP and depressive symptoms improve the inpatient orthopaedic rehabilitation success depending on the stage of chronicity? Effects of the new programme on psychological well-being (ADS depressive symptoms, HADS anxiety, SCL somatization and mental health of the SF-12) were investigated in n=75 patients with first and second stage of chronicity immediately after, six months after and 24 months after rehabilitation and were compared to standard rehabilitation without management of depressive symptoms. All patients benefited from both treatments immediately after rehabilitation. However, six months after rehabilitation only patients of the intervention group showed significant beneficial effects with regard to depressive symptoms and mental health. The lowered depressive symptoms remained stable up to the 24-month follow-up assessment. Anxiety in the second stage of chronicity was reduced up to the 6-month follow-up and in the first stage up to the 24-month follow-up. The new programme with a cognitive-behavioural depression management training revealed beneficial effects on mental health in the mid-term and on depressive symptoms in the long-term. However, the effects need to be further improved by after-care programmes. ","699":"Currently, little is known about the influence of pre-treatment in rehabilitation outcomes of patients with psychosomatic symptoms. This study examines whether there are differences in therapy motivation and impairment between patients with and those without pre-treatment measures. Additionally, the outcome for patients with prior knowledge of psychosomatic rehabilitation is analyzed. As part of a randomized controlled pre-post design the Patients' questionnaire of therapy motivation (PAREMO) and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) were distributed to 166 patients in psychosomatic rehabilitation. The selection of patients with prior knowledge of psychosomatic rehabilitation was made according to the scale \"knowledge\" of the patients' questionnaire. Changes were tested by analysis of variance at two treatment points. Although there were positive effects of rehabilitation, no interaction was found between measurement points and groups. The analyses of patients without prior knowledge of psychosomatic rehabilitation showed different outcomes for males and females. Higher rehabilitation outcomes for females than for males were found on the BSI scales \"somatisation\", \"phobic anxiety\", and \"psychoticism\". The findings show that pre-treatment facilitates the patients' approach to psychosomatic rehabilitation. Apart from receiving information patients should be motivated more strongly and their confidence in psychosomatic rehabilitation strengthened. ","700":"Treatments of patients with chronic mental disorders are increasingly focusing on salutogenetic aims to support human health and well-being. Up to now, standardized instruments to evaluate these treatment goals are still missing. We present results of analyses of the psychometric properties of the Hamburg Self-Care Questionnaire (HamSCQ). Besides reliability we are focusing on different aspects of validity: factor structure, concurrent validity, and sensitivity to change. A total sample of 7 478 inpatients with mental disorders from four different psychotherapeutic clinics participated in the study. Patients completed self-rating questionnaires at admission and discharge: Besides the HamSCQ we used the Symptom Checklist SCL-14, the Short Form SF-8, the CES-D depression scale, the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems IIP-25 and the AVEM. The two-dimensional structure of the HamSCQ with the two subscales PACING and POSITIVE EXPERIENCE could be replicated by means of both principal component and confirmatory factor analysis. The two scales correlate with r=0.56. Both scales show a high internal consistency (alpha &gt;or=0.90), they correlate with the selected measures of concurrent validity (except the AVEM scales) with medium (Pacing) or high (Positive Experience) effect sizes, and their mean scores differ significantly from admission to discharge with large effect sizes. The HamSCQ proves to be a reliable questionnaire, which is also sensitive to change. The two-dimensional factor structure could be replicated, and some aspects of concurrent validity could be demonstrated, but concerning criterion validity further research is still necessary. Thus we recommend the use of the HamSCQ for inpatients with mental disorders treated in psychotherapeutic\/rehabilitative clinics. ","701":"Quality of life is a major criterion of the outcome of psychotherapeutic interventions. The concept of quality of life emphasizes patient self-ratings. However, they can be burdensome or inappropriate in some cases. Therefore we have compared self-ratings and clinician-ratings of quality of life. Self- and clinician-ratings of the SF-8 (1-week recall version) were measured from consecutive samples of 1 812 inpatients from eleven psychotherapeutic clinics at admission and at discharge six weeks later. A physical summary score (PSS) and a mental summary score (MSS) were calculated. Pearson product-moment correlations were used. Self- and clinician-ratings of the PSS correlate r=0.48 at admission and r=0.58 at discharge, of the MSS r=0.46 and r=0.51, respectively. Concerning single items we find the highest correlation for item 4 (bodily pain: r=0.53 and r=0.55), the lowest for item 6 (social functioning: r=0.26 and r=0.30). Change scores of the PSS correlate r=0.20, of the MSS r=0.32. Correlations differ between diagnostic groups: Correlations are low for patients with either schizophrenia (F2), depressive episode (F32) or personality disorder (F60-62), comparatively higher for patients with dysthymia. Comparing correlations across the 11 clinics reveals substantial differences, for the MSS ranging from r=0.38 to r=0.58 at admission and r=0.27 to r=0.68 at discharge. Patient self-ratings of quality of life as a psychotherapeutic outcome measure using the SF-8 Health Survey could not be substituted by clinician-ratings, they should be used as complements. ","702":"The transition from home to psychosomatic rehabilitation is problematic for many patients. They show little treatment motivation because of insufficient information and fear of stigmatization. Pre-treatment seeks to reduce these problems. The patient-questionnaire for stance toward psychosomatic rehabilitation was developed and tested for performance criteria. A German statutory pension insurance scheme sample of psychosomatic rehabilitation patients (n=317) were recruited for testing psychosometric attributes and were questioned before and after pre-treatment. To determine whether the questionnaire can show clinically relevant changes, 124 patients with pre-information were compared with 88 patients without intervention. Additionally, clinically relevant changes for patients without knowledge of psychosomatic rehabilitation (n=70) were analyzed. Factor analysis shows a three factor solution with ten items. The discriminatory power was good. High reliability was found for two factors and lower reliability for one factor. The patient-questionnaire for stance toward psychosomatic rehabilitation contains three scales: \"knowledge\", \"confidence\", and \"motivation\", and can be characterized as a reliable and economic instrument. After pre-treatment a general improvement was observed regarding patients' stance toward psychosomatic rehabilitation. The analyses result in significantly higher mean for patients with pre-treatment. Patients without previous information showed less \"confidence\" and \"motivation\". Pre-treatment can have a positive impact on the stance toward psychosomatic rehabilitation. ","703":"According to the latest research its effectiveness can be considered as proven. By now there are many evaluation studies that document the psychosomatic rehabilitation process itself as well as long-term results. In the wake of procedural optimization in medical rehabilitation, however, potential for further development has also been stated, in particular given an increasing number of psychosomatic patients and their heterogeneous disease patterns. Hence, an increasing number of studies has been carried out over the last ten years which had been aimed at achieving a match between patients' needs and rehabilitation offers (therapy, patient-education). This survey gives an overview of recent studies on the effectiveness of psychosomatic rehabilitation and discusses new concepts for further optimization.","704":"","705":"","706":"","707":"","708":"","709":"Behavioural interventions in chronically ill adolescents aim to improve disease-related self-management. The study presents a short questionnaire for examining the self-management strategies in paediatric patients with obesity, asthma, type I diabetes or atopic eczema. For each indication, six favourable disease management strategies were identified: adherence to the subjective body perception, avoidance of trigger factors, adequate control of one's own behaviour, appropriate emergency treatment, and regular prolonged treatment including, depending on the disease at hand, adherence to alimentation. For each indication a \"disease management\" scale with six items was constructed. Psychometric properties (item statistics, reliability) were examined among 416 adolescents. Participants were diagnosed at least with one chronic illness and took part in an inpatient rehabilitation programme in a German rehabilitation clinic. For the scale obesity (KM-KJ-Adi) (n=192) difficulty of the items was 0.30-0.43, discrimination was 0.32-0.57 and Cronbach's alpha was 0.72. For the scale asthma (KM KJ AB) (n=164) difficulty of the items was 0.43-0.65, discrimination was 0.29-0.52 and Cronbach's alpha was 0.70. For the scale diabetes (KM-KJ-DM1) (n=78) difficulty of the items was of 0.42-0.74, discrimination was of 0.25-0.87 and Cronbach's alpha was 0.68. For the scale atopic eczema (KM-KJ-AE) (n=125) difficulty of the items was 0.31-0.71, discrimination was of 0.24-0.51 and Cronbach's alpha was 0.64. Up to now, no economic, indication-specific and reliable questionnaire exists for assessing the competences of adolescents in their disease self-management. The presented questionnaire fills this gap, the indication-specific scales with only a few items show satisfactory psychometric results. This questionnaire can be used as an instrument for self-management strategies in chronically ill adolescents. The responsiveness (change score) and validity have to be further investigated. ","710":"Relationship quality in families with a schizophrenic adolescent is demonstrated by means of the concepts of ambivalence and Expressed Emotions. A concept for the work with families focusing on relationship quality as well as an empirical study analysing the correlation between symptom state and relationship quality are presented. A questionnaire to register the family atmosphere (FEF) and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) were administered to 43 schizophrenic patients. The sample replicated the parental relationship styles \"criticism\" and \"emotional over-involvement\". Both styles show different correlations with particular symptom areas: uncertainty in social relationships and somatic symptoms support the criticism relationship style and depression protects the adolescents from emotional over-involvement. The results are helpful with regard to parent counseling because they enable the parents to develop alternative relationship styles in time. ","711":"Due to specifications in Social Code Book IX and increasing ICF orientation, occupation-related treatment gains importance in medical rehabilitation. The quick and easy identification of patients in need of occupational rehabilitation requires adequate screening instruments. The present study was funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the German Pension Fund within a programme that focussed on \"Work-related orientation within medical rehabilitation and occupational rehabilitation\". The study aimed at the development and validation of a \"Screening instrument work and occupation (SIBAR)\". SIBAR considers three different problems by using three subscales: (1) social-medical\/risk of early retirement; (2) occupational stress; (3) subjective need for occupation-related treatment. SIBAR was tested with regard to reliability and validity in n=2,228 applicants for medical rehabilitation and n=1,292 rehabilitation patients. Additionally, data on application for retirement up to 18 months after rehabilitation was available. The need for occupation-related treatment was analysed for these different subsamples. The prediction of risk of early retirement was examined using the data collected after rehabilitation. The reliability of SIBAR was satisfying to good. Depending on the external criterion and subsample included the validity of SIBAR was good to very good respective. The agreement between subjective need for occupation-related treatment and the report by clinicians reaches 63%. Yet there is no generally accepted definition of need. For different indications, significant differences occur regarding a need for rehabilitation, which are hardly related to any personal characteristics. In comparison with other screening-instruments, SIBAR supplies a better prognostic estimation of early retirement. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH: The concept of SIBAR meets the methodical requirements for a screening instrument. SIBAR can serve as a generic instrument addressing various demands. It is reliable, valid, short, easy to comprehend, and capable of representing subsequent occupational reintegration and a need for occupation-related treatment. ","712":null,"713":"The project aimed at developing and testing a new payment system which provides financial incentives for rehabilitation centers to achieve the best outcomes possible for their patients but does not create additional costs for the insurance funds. The system is conceived as a \"quality competition\" organized by the centers among themselves with a scientific institute acting as a \"referee\". Centers with outcomes above average receive a bonus financed by a corresponding malus from the centers below average. In a stepwise process which started in 2001 and was continually accompanied by a scientific institute, we developed the methodological and organizational prerequisites for the new payment system and tested them in two multicentric studies with large case numbers (n=1,058 and n=700, respectively). As a first step, a new assessment instrument (SINGER) was developed and validated in order to measure the outcomes in a reliable, valid, and change-sensitive way. In the second phase, we developed a regression analytic model which predicted the central outcome variable with &gt;84% variance explained. With this model, the different case-mix in the participating centers can be controlled, so that comparisons of outcomes across centers can take place under fair conditions. In the recently completed third phase, we introduced an internet-based programme SINGER-online into which the centers can enter all relevant data. This programme ensures a high quality of all data and makes comparisons of outcomes across all centers possible at any chosen time. The programme contains a special module accessible to the medical services of the health insurance only, which allows sample checks of the data entered by the clinics and helps to ensure that all centers keep to the principles of a fair competition for better quality for their patients. After successful testing of these elements, a functioning model of pay-for-performance in rehabilitation after stroke is now available.","714":"","715":"","716":"","717":"","718":"Eight years after Book 9 of the German social code, SGB IX had entered into force, secondary analyses of published reports (for example those of the Federal Rehabilitation Council, BAR) about the existence and functioning of important institutional innovations such as the common service centres or new benefits such as the Personal Budget show many quantitative and qualitative deficiencies in its implementation. Deficits are mainly a lack of transparency, insufficient utilization of the innovative possibilities offered by the law and above all, poor cooperation among the various rehabilitation carriers involved. Among the deficits concerned are some which it has been impossible to eliminate for decades (since the so-called Rehabilitation harmonization law of 1974) by simple legal regulations or by appeals and voluntary self-commitments. To enable the innovative goals of the SGB IX to be reached, more intensive thought should again focus on the sense of having different rehabilitation carriers in place side by side. Irrespective of this issue, the legislator has to sanction obvious offences against the spirit of the SGB IX more strongly than so far.","719":"Patient education has become increasingly important in medical rehabilitation in recent years. While educational programmes are often conducted under ideal circumstances during the developmental process, basic conditions may be less favourable in routine application on a daily basis. Therefore, quality requirements of patient education are needed. We have previously defined quality requirements regarding the conception of educational programmes and now propose quality criteria concerning the execution of patient education, with particular attention to inpatient medical rehabilitation of adult patients. In this report, both the procedure and the results of the process of criteria development are described. We obtained patient education experts' opinions regarding both dimensions and criteria of educational quality using the Delphi technique, which included a consensus group discussion. Final agreement was reached for eleven dimensions assessed with 59 criteria, covering the following domains: basic conditions of patient education; necessary qualifications of instructors; integration of patient education into the rehabilitation process; and quality management. The quality criteria proposed aim to increase the awareness of quality requirements and to provide a tool for improving the quality of patient education in medical rehabilitation.","720":"In this article, an adjusted model of shared decision-making is presented for the sector of medical rehabilitation. This model of interaction describes shared decision-making as a process between physician and patient on the basis of shared information and with both parties equally and actively involved. The typical elements of this interaction model can be transferred to other professionals in the health care sector (i. e. therapists, nurses, social workers, etc.) as well as to the interaction between these different groups of health professionals working as a team. The idea of patient orientation is supplemented with the aspect of relations between the different groups of health professionals, hence establishing patient-oriented interaction inside the organization. In order to strengthen internal patient orientation through a process of shared decision-making between different health professionals (providers), a co-operative leadership style is required in the rehabilitation clinic. Creating the internal conditions for shared decision-making (internal patient orientation) is a prerequisite for considering needs and expectations of the patient within the treatment process (external patient orientation). Health professionals need to display the ability to create these internal conditions to allow for improvement of patient orientated treatment in terms of an integrated patient orientation. Training of the providers is a prerequisite for implementation of an integrated patient orientation in medical rehabilitation. Once a higher level of patient orientation is achieved, through participation in the provider-patient-relationship and communication between the providers within the team, an improved quality of decision-making, a higher level of patient and employee satisfaction and more positive treatment outcomes can be assumed.","721":"Since 1994 the German Pension Fund has developed a systematic and centralized quality control system. Central components are a structural analysis of hospitals and rehab centers, a peer review instrument based on the treatment protocols and reports, and an outcome questionaire based on a follow-up 6 months after discharge from hospital or the rehab center. In order to improve the well established peer review instrument a new protocol document named RehaProDok was established. Based on a preexisting electronic report system, the new document can be generated automatically. Without additional work for the hospital or center a short discharge report for physicians is produced with this instrument. The use of ICF is strengthened by standardized use of rehab goals and its systematic input into the final report, which in turn improves patient orientation. Other quality important features (e. g. Team approach, changes in therapy protocol due to progress within of the rehab process) may be examined directly and added in the future. All technical improvements can be easily adapted to other clinical information systems.","722":"Medical rehabilitation aims at improving disorders of functions, capacity and participation. The present study investigates the degree to which inpatient psychosomatic rehabilitation improves disorders of capacity. 213 inpatients (149 females, 64 males) from a psychosomatic rehabilitation unit were investigated at the beginning and end of a six-week treatment using the Mini-ICF-Rating for Psychological Disorders (Mini-ICF-APP), an observer-rating instrument for the assessment of disorders of capacity, especially in regard to social functioning. There were significant improvements in all dimensions of disorders of capacity. Patients who were discharged as able to work benefited most from the rehabilitation treatment, whereas patients who were on sick leave at discharge showed only moderate improvement. Those who were able to work at admission but discharged as sick leave had the highest values in disorders of capacity in both measurements. Patients suffering from complex mental illnesses did show only moderate improvement. The greatest changes were seen with respect to \"planning and structuring of tasks\", \"competency\" and \"non-work activities\" while assertiveness did show the smallest changes. The data show that psychosomatic inpatient rehabilitation produces positive effects on disorders of capacity. ","723":"Work-related interventions have become an integral part of medical rehabilitation programmes on behalf of the German Pension Fund. Studies showed concordantly that work-related medical rehabilitation measures should focus on patients with extensive work-related problems. Therefore the identification of such problems has to be an integral part of effective work-related interventions in medical rehabilitation. Adequate screening instruments do exist, but publications regarding their psychometric quality across indications are still missing. Based on the SIMBO-MSK, which is a screening instrument for identification of work-related medical rehabilitation needs in patients with musculoskeletal disorders (MSD), a generic screening instrument for chronic diseases, SIMBO-C, was developed and tested for reliability and validity. For testing psychometric attributes a German Pension Fund sample consisting of rehabilitation patients with MSD (MSD, n=182), psychosomatic disorders (PSY, n=173) and internal diseases (INN, n=71) were recruited. They filled-in a questionnaire at admission and at the three-months follow-up. The test-retest reliability was examined by means of Intra-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) und Percentage of Agreement (PA) in a subsample (n=91) of patients who had been assessed additionally two weeks before starting their rehabilitation programme. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to observe the relationship between SIMBO-C on the one hand and Physical and Emotional Role Function (MOS-36), health status (EQ5-D) and subjective prognosis of work ability (SPE) on the other hand. Predictive validity was tested in three data sources: information about work ability in the medical report upon discharge, self-report on work ability from the Work Ability Index (WAI) as well as socio-medical situation at follow-up. In this context multiple linear and logistic regression models adjusting for age, gender, form of rehabilitation, indication and work status at admission were used. SIMBO-C was composed of the weighted sum of seven single items (range: 0-100). Extensive work-related problems were presented at a cut-off of &gt; 30. Prevalence of extensive work-related problems was between 29% (MSK) and 43% (INN). With ICCs of 0.83 (PSY) up to 0.91 (INN) as well as PAs of 78% (INN) up to 90% (MSK), a high test-retest reliability across indications was found. Construct validity were moderate. Particularly, high effect sizes between patients with and without extensive work-related problems were found across indications. The prediction of future events was predominantly high. Statistically significant associations for self-reported work ability and cost-relevant events (claim for occupational rehabilitation, claim for early retirement, gradual reintegration, absence from work for more than six weeks at a stretch, unemployment after rehabilitation) could be accounted for, which partly demonstrated a \"dose-response relationship\". SIMBO-C can be characterised as a valid and reliable instrument for identification of patients with extensive work-related problems. This study in particular outlines the ability of the SIMBO-C to make predictions about problematic developments, which qualifies it as an instrument to be implemented at an early point of time in the rehabilitation process. ","724":"This study aims to depict the significance of individual goal-setting in present-state medical rehabilitation. Marked discrepancies between goals of rehabilitation patients and doctors have been reported. Also, results of quality assurance programmes point to problems in goal-setting in rehabilitation. As part of a mixed-methods study, open guided interviews were conducted in four rehabilitation clinics with forty patients in the final stage of their 3-week stay. Two of the clinics focussed on care of cardiac patients, two others on musculoskeletal patients. Clinics were selected because of above- or below-average ratings on patients' reports in rehabilitation quality assurance of the German Pension Fund on the \"rehab planning and rehab goals\" scale. Content-analysis of interviews was based on a thematic coding approach. In addition, staff was invited in every clinic to join a group discussion to give feedback on the results of patient interviews. All interviewees showed marked difficulties in talking about personal goals, goals of rehabilitation or even about their expectations, independent of being in a clinic rated above or below average. They enter the clinic partly without expectations or disclose global, unrealistic, or unspecific expectations. Specified goals were at best embryonic in individual patients. Expectations were primarily concerned with somatic or physical-functioning dimensions. Discussions with staff members disclosed absence of consistent views regarding goal-orientation in the respective clinics. Problems in goal-setting were both related to patients and to staff, their interaction as well as the general framework or the organisational processes within rehabilitation. The significance of individual goal-setting as the \"essence of rehabilitation\" is not reflected in present-state rehabilitation in Germany. Starting points for change are found on different levels: patients, staff, development of organisational mission statements within the clinics, but also in changing organisational processes that appear to be dominated by economic directives. ","725":"","726":"","727":"","728":"","729":"The Rubicon model of action phases can help clear a typical misunderstanding between patient and medical rehabilitation measures in the return-to-work process. This misunderstanding is named \"The Rubicon-Misunderstanding\". Patients remain on their side of the Rubicon with insufficient motivation and volition to cross over, while rehabilitation professionals assume a motivational and volitional state beyond the Rubicon. So sophisticated help is offered to enhance their reduced abilities and occupationally relevant capabilities. To help overcome this misunderstanding, a Rubicon model with status-adapted intervention planning is presented in the following: (a) on this side of the Rubicon, for those patients who are searching clarification and individual meaning in life, the model empowers motivation for new goal settings, (b) on the verge of the Rubicon, the indecisive patient, where therapeutic experiments allow practising the crossing over, and (c) beyond the Rubicon, the active patient, where the model empowers individual coping with problems in the working place and in life.","730":"In vocational retraining centres, a test battery including several performance tests is generally administered to assess the occupational aptitude of rehabilitants and to predict their success in occupational retraining. This paper presents the multiple regressions of a set of achievement scores on \"grades of retraining\" and \"grades of final examination\", respectively, concerning retraining to become an office management assistant. It was shown that only few variables are adequate to clarify a maximum of variance of the criterions. Four different regression models were identified; each of them could clarify about 25% of variance. Significant predictors were indicators for verbal skills and basic numeracy. In each model a measurement for nonverbal intelligence had to be taken into account as a suppressor variable. To put all in a nutshell, in order to predict the success of vocational retraining to become an office management assistant it is more important to focus on strengthening school knowledge than on general intelligence.","731":"The study was to examine how far treatment success in psychosomatic rehabilitation can be predicted from patients' characteristics. The aim of this study included the development of outcome criteria, the analysis of bivariate correlations, as well as development and examination of multivariate models. The motivation for dealing with job-related problems was evaluated separately. Data were available from admission, discharge and three-months follow-up. The data of 463 patients were included. Generated were success criteria concerning sociomedical development, health as well as the ability to work. All success criteria were dichotomized. In the criteria defined, successful outcomes were found in 40 to 60% of the patients. In the bivariate analyses, it was shown that many sick days before rehabilitation, applications for pension, severe disability, high impairment, and suggestion for rehabilitation by the insurance agency, have basically negative effects on success. Correlations with the variables concerning motivation for dealing with job-related problems were rather weak. In multivariate model development, models of different quality were found. For prediction of working ability at discharge, there was an explained variance of nearly 60%. In the other success criteria as well, explained variance amounted to over 20%. The models consist of different constellations of variables, the number of sick days before rehabilitation, variables of application for pension and severity of the impairment frequently included. In case of a current sick leave, rehabilitation should be started early, sociomedical problems have to be dealt with explicitly, and rehabilitation should be accompanied by preparatory and aftercare measures.","732":"The present study investigated impact factors on the length of stay in neurological rehabilitation. 161 patients were enrolled in a six months period. As a major result, admission Barthel Index correlated highly significantly with length of stay (correlation coefficient -0.34). Besides diagnosis and age, gender had a significant influence on the duration, too. While the Barthel did not differ significantly, women stayed 2.9 days longer than men. In summary, the admission Barthel Index predicts length of stay in neurological rehabilitation.","733":"Primary care physicians play a crucial role in the assessment of restrictions in of participation, i. e. especially sick leave. In this study we investigated to which degree patients in primary care suffer from disorders of participation and how this is related to problems at the workplace and sick leave. A total of 382 patients, aged 18-65, were investigated in primary care office practices. Self-reported disorders of participation were measured with the IMET, together with sociodemographic and work-related information. 27,4% of 299 patients who were at present working reported to have problems at the workplace. 19% were at present on sick leave. These patients did significantly more often report mobbing at the workplace. No differences were found with respect to quantitative or qualitative overtaxation or with respect to context variables. Restrictions in of participation were strongest related to the workplace but were also reported for the domain of family or social activities. Patients on sick leave also showed more impairment in these private areas than patients at work. The treating physicians saw psychosocial problems as a primary cause for disorders of participation at the workplace. Chronic illness does impair occupational as well as general social participation, and such patients are frequently seen in primary care. Physicians in primary health care therefore play an important role in the treatment of restrictions in of participation and especially in early intervention. ","734":"Medical rehabilitation is a basic component in the German health care system. However, several studies have shown only moderate effects by rehabilitation treatment. The effectiveness of medical rehabilitation depends on different factors, like rehabilitation need, access, preparation for rehabilitation treatment, therapy intensity and rehabilitation aftercare. During the past few years the lack of cooperation and communication between cost carriers and general practitioners has been emphasized. Since general practitioners play a central role in the patients' decision for rehabilitation treatment, the aim of the present study was to facilitate the identification of rehabilitation need by general practitioners. The project group integrated different professions. To facilitate assessment of rehabilitation need in patients attending a medical practice, two different approaches were applied: First, a self-administered patient questionnaire was developed, containing different subjective indicators of rehabilitation need (e. g., subjective health, problems in activities and participation as well as daily or occupational stress). Secondly, the project group worked out a short checklist for general practitioners, containing a number of criteria confirming patients' potential need for rehabilitation. Both instruments were tested in nine medical practices with 60 patients presumably in need for medical rehabilitation. The short checklist as well as the patient questionnaire proved to be practicable and economical. Nine of 40 general practitioners participated. Based on the checklist a need for rehabilitation was identified in 85% of their patients. In another 10% of the patients the result was questionable, and in three patients the finding was negative. In the self-assessment of the patients, 98% stated a subjective need of rehabilitation (global rating), only one patient indicated no rehabilitation need. The agreement between physician and patient assessments was only weak (kappa: 0.11, p=0.08). Defining deviation by one category as still indicative of agreement of the two ratings, an agreement of 78% is reached. Both instruments in principle proved to be useful in medical practice. They allow quick and easy assessment of a potential rehabilitation need in everyday practice. Despite these positive results and the supportive function of the checklist, the participation rate among general practitioners was unexpectedly low, possibly mainly due to the additional bureaucracy, a negative image of the rehabilitation system, and the concurrence with DMPs. Poor accessibility of general practitioners regarding questions of medical rehabilitation is well-known from numerous earlier research projects. Satisfying integration of physicians could not be reached, although the approach of needs assessment seems to be promising. Further research should focus on how the urgently required cooperation could be achieved. ","735":"Evidence-based medicine is a central issue in medical practice. This also applies to rehabilitation services. The German Statutory Pension Insurance meets this need in its guideline programme. Amongst others a guideline for rehabilitation following hip or knee arthroplasty is currently being developed. In this context a hierarchic, systematic literature analysis was conducted summarising the current state of evidence with reference to the effects and the treatment requirements (frequency and duration) of different rehabilitative therapies following total hip or knee replacement. In the first step, a search for evidence-based guidelines, systematic reviews and health technology assessments was conducted. Secondly, search strategies for primary literature in the following databases were designed: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsychINFO (01\/1997-09\/2007). Additionally, a handsearch of several German journals not listed in the databases was conducted. Randomized trials were preferred, however, non-randomized trials were included if the intervention and control groups were comparable with regard to the baseline parameters. Results can be classified into three categories: (1) therapies for which evidence for (positive) effects was found, (2) therapies for which evidence was found, however, their transferability onto rehabilitation in Germany should be discussed (e. g., studies on immediate post-surgery interventions), and (3) therapies for which no methodologically appropriate trials could be found. The literature reviewed does not allow for final conclusions as to frequency and duration of different therapeutic interventions within the rehabilitation time frame in Germany (usually the first three weeks post discharge from hospital). Overall, there is a need for further research.","736":"","737":"This descriptive clinical report presents therapeutic climbing as a supplementary method within movement therapy, which builds on an integrative clinical concept as part of psychosomatic rehabilitation. Areas of application of therapeutic climbing are outlined along with its varying goals and aims based on the emphasis on body and mind. These are combined with an explanation of psychosomatic movement therapy and its work at the level of experiencing. Information on clinical experience is supported by examples from patient observation. As the examples demonstrate, through therapeutic climbing in movement therapy the patients are brought into contact with their unconscious behaviour and relationship patterns and with the manner in which they deal with situations and people. In addition to the correlates of perception of emotion and body sensation, further topics and transfers come into the frame. Positive experiences are contrasted with automatic negative cognitive processes as the result of learning and socialisation. In this context it is important to emphasise the special therapeutic relationship formation during therapeutic climbing, which provides the patient with the chance of a positive relationship experience.","738":"Medical Rehabilitation in Germany needs change. Weaknesses of the present care system are pointed out, and the potential for change is explored. The latter implies a more active search for rehabilitation need and the implementation of problem-focussed, flexible programmes. Above all, better evidence for the effectiveness of the German rehabilitation system is crucial.","739":"The population grows older, patients suffer from chronic diseases more frequently, and working life will be longer. Against this background, medical rehabilitation becomes more important. However, various studies indicate that rehabilitation lacks in sustainability beyond positive short-term outcomes: After three to six months there are hardly any detectable effects. For some time now the answer to this lack of sustainability is seen in an increase of aftercare. But here too, the situation seems rather deficient as in-patient treatment that usually lasts for three weeks is still predominant in the minds of many rehab patients and physicians. In a multicentre research project a new strategy and organisation of aftercare was developed and tested by orthopaedic clinics and patients with chronic low back pain. The main emphasis was put on changes in physical activity and mobility. The central item was higher personal activity of rehab patients and an aftercare plan for doctors and therapists that can easily be realised. Therefore numerous means of implementation (checklists, information material, patient documentation) were developed. Six rehab clinics and 77 rehab patients tested the new credo. On the whole we received positive reactions from clinical staff and rehab patients. The mobility diary during rehabilitation was greatly accepted and accurately filled-in by patients. After rehabilitation two-thirds of them returned the mobility diary they had completed at home. In general it had also been filled-in reliably. Starting points for supports to be offered by clinics are readily identifiable. Results of the pilot study showed that the concept is practicable and promising. Yet, long-term follow-along of rehab patients can only be realised by supplementary personal contact. Should the now starting controlled longitudinal study reveal that the concept contributes to securing the longer-term rehab effects, the time and expense for appointing an aftercare contact would be more than justified. ","740":"The aim of this study was to verify the assumption that fractionated inpatient rehabilitation (three weeks and another week at a future date) is superior to a four-week inpatient treatment for patients with rheumatic diseases (spondyloarthropathies, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis). This expectation was based on the evidence of only short-term effects of inpatient rehab. Fractionation was intended to prolong and consolidate the effects achieved by the three-week inpatient treatment. Altogether, both groups showed significant positive effects for pain-intensity, activity and state of physical health over a period of more than one year, but there were no statistical effects between the groups. Advantages of fractionated inpatient rehabilitation could not be confirmed.","741":null,"742":"Domiciliary rehabilitation is an innovative form of outpatient medical rehabilitation. All components of service provision are delivered in the rehabilitant's home by a multidisciplinary team headed by a physician. The key context factors in the rehab process can be taken into account firsthand. The target group of domiciliary rehabilitation consists of multimorbid patients with severe functional limitations and complex assistance needs, whose rehabilitation options would be poor without this outreach service. Here, as suggested by the WHO concept of functional health, the interaction between health condition and environmental factors is kept in view much better than in other forms of rehabilitation. The positive effects and the efficiency of the rehabilitation measures provided can be assessed very well at a high descriptive level. This fact had been a precondition for legal establishment of domiciliary rehabilitation as a regular service. Domiciliary rehabilitation not only complies with key demands in the health and social policy fields, such as priority of outpatient over inpatient treatment or rehabilitation to precede and accompany long term care, it also constitutes an alternative concept challenging the traditional inpatient rehabilitation approach. The patient, hence, no longer is to fit into the institutional framework of outpatient or inpatient rehabilitation, but the team will fit into the specifics of the patient's unique social and material situation.","743":"Instead of non-cash benefits, disabled people are to receive personal payments to help them to better manage their own support. This \"tailor made support\" has become a legal basis for a claim in 2008. It is aimed to pave the way for a new design of assistance: more ambulant services and a stronger position for the recipient of support. Initial results within the scope of pilot projects, evaluations from various perspectives and the discernible effects of personal budgets are reported in national and international perspectives.","744":"","745":"","746":"","747":"Young handicapped citizens in the Netherlands have increasingly been receiving social benefits or special services during the last five years. Dutch governmental departments have therefore commissioned an applied social policy research. We analyzed six benefits (for example special education, psychological healthcare, and Wajong benefits for young disabled). The usage of all these provisions is increasing. In particular we focus on \"Wajong\" (a sort of pension for Dutch young disabled people) and its social consequences. The number of Wajong benefits is growing strongly. In 2006 every 22nd person aged 18 (4.5%) claimed and received this disability benefit. Also, the statistical trend is that people with a handicap are less often employed and are more often unemployed. So there is an ongoing political discussion about these provisions with special attention to Wajong.","748":null,"749":null,"750":"The present study investigates possible differences in quality of life impairment of patients with psoriasis vulgaris and psoriatic arthritis. One hundred and sixteen patients who were admitted for inpatient rehabilitation to the Fachklinik Bad Bentheim were asked to fill in a self-assessment questionnaire. This questionnaire comprised the SF-12, the German version of the Health Assessment Questionnaire, questions regarding the occupational and the social situation as well as additional questions for identification of specific disease-related burden. Altogether, both groups exhibited impairments of the quality of life. As was to be expected, the arthritis patients suffered from considerably more functional impairment than the patients who only had skin involvement. Interestingly, however, the psychic burden attributable to the disease is equal in patients with isolated skin involvement in comparison to patients with additional arthritis. Summarizing, a different proportion between the extent of psychic and physical impairment is found in the two groups, which might be due to a different pattern of coping with the disease. Taking this aspect into account is imperative when assessing the severity of the disease.","751":"The pilot phase of the rehabilitation guideline for patients with breast cancer of the German Pension Fund was accompanied by a user survey. This survey allowed oncological rehabilitation centres to comment on the guideline and to suggest changes. In the autumn of 2007 a total of 57 oncological rehabilitation centres treating a minimum of 50 patients with breast cancer (ICD-10: C50) annually were contacted with a written survey. The questionnaire was accompanied by an overview of performance data according to the KTL (Classification of Therapeutic Procedures) from 2006 allowing to determine the degree of adherence to the guideline's requirements. Between 75% and 95% of the respondents agree that the rehabilitation guideline for breast cancer fulfils the quality attributes \"scientific foundation (evidence)\", \"relevance for day-to-day work\", \"up-to-dateness\", and \"inter- and multidisciplinary development\". 65% consider the guideline's comprehensiveness as \"adequate\" and structure and clarity as \"rather to very structured\". The individual chapters and treatment modules are \"rather to very comprehensible\" for 68% to 100%. Further information is needed especially with regard to \"methodological overview\", \"information on the guideline's integration into the Pension Insurance's quality assurance programme\", \"scope\" and \"minimum percentage of patients requiring such treatment\". Between 70% and 85% consider the KTL codes suggested to sufficiently represent the therapeutic contents of the treatment modules. 20% to 68% agree with the guideline's requirements regarding the \"minimum percentage of patients requiring such treatment\". In 7 of a total of 15 treatment modules the requirements are considered \"adequate\". The main reasons for insufficient adherence to the guideline's requirements are coding problems, as well as a high treatment volume and shortage of staff. The implementation of the guideline for the rehabilitation of patients with breast cancer raises positive and negative expectations. The discussion centers around the normative standards regarding the minimum percentage of patients requiring such treatment that is considered too high in many modules. However, suggestions to alter the treatment requirements are at times quite heterogeneous. Coding problems should not be overrated as the performance data so far available date back to a period prior to introduction of the new KTL 2007. At the end of the pilot phase the guideline will be revised where necessary, taking the rehabilitation centres' feedback into account. The Pension Insurance considers the guideline for the rehabilitation of patients with breast cancer an important addition to the quality assurance programme. According to the survey's results the guideline is generally accepted and realisable. ","752":"The experiences of small and midsized enterprises (SME) with medical rehabilitation were investigated in the KoRB-Study (KoRB= KOoperation Rehabilitation und Betrieb) for the first time. Opportunities for a targeted cooperation between the statutory pension insurance and these enterprises were explored. Based on explorative interviews, Westphalian employers, members of the works council, occupational health practitioners and employees were interrogated about the image of and their appreciation of medical rehabilitation in the work setting. Experience with rehabilitation and the level of information on rehabilitation were recorded as well as the compatibility of rehabilitation with operative processes in the working site. In addition rehab hospitals were asked about their experience in cooperating with enterprises. 697 employers of small and midsized enterprises, 458 members of the works councils, 73 occupational health practitioners, 47 rehab hospitals and 3 509 employees, who are members of the German Pension Fund of Westphalia, took part in the survey. Especially employers perceived rehabilitation positively and reported good experiences. Among the employees, those who had taken part in rehabilitation showed the highest appreciation. Occupational health practitioners were more restrained in their appraisal. Some of them complained about a lack of sustainability. The different target groups of the survey felt differently well informed about rehabilitation - best ratings came from the occupational health practitioners, worst ratings from the employees. All groups would welcome more accessible information in case of need. Medical rehabilitation in its standard form of \"3 weeks full-time\" often causes severe logistic problems in SME (e. g., replacement of employee, loss of experience). However the financial burden is perceived as less problematic. Employers favour alternative rehab models, which allow part-time working. Many employees, who expressed a need for rehabilitation, refrained from applying for rehabilitation on account of worries about loosing their employment. Both rehab clinicians and occupational health practitioners argued in favour of improved communication and cooperation in order to adapt medical rehab to the specific requirements of the working place and to assure a smooth reintegration into work. ","753":"","754":"A significant body of research suggests that patient motivation is related to better rehabilitation outcome with regard to psychosocial and physical well-being. Thus, patient motivation gains increasing attention with regard to the course of treatment and individual treatment planning in the practice and research in medical rehabilitation. This study aims to validate the PAREMO-20, a measure of rehabilitation motivation in a sample of cancer patients with different tumour sites. 1193 cancer patients participated in a prospective study evaluating the medical and psychosocial effects of inpatient cancer rehabilitation. A set of various questionnaires was completed at the beginning and at the end of the rehabilitation measure as well as at one year follow-up (participation rate at follow-up: 78%). The PAREMO-20 was psychometrically examined on this sample. Validity was examined using a cancer-specific questionnaire for individual therapy goals, as well as the HADS-D and the SF-8. The original six factors were replicated. The factor solution emerging through PCA was tested with a confirmatory factor analysis. Maximum likelihood estimation of this model produced good fit statistics. Internal consistencies were high to satisfactory with Cronbach's Alpha=0.88 to Alpha=0.59. Psychological distress and physical impairments were positively associated with anxiety and depression, as well as with therapy goal dimensions. Moderate to high (negative) correlations were observed with health related quality of life, in particular with the mental-health dimension (r=-0.74, p=0.01). The PAREMO-20 is a reliable, valid and economic instrument, which can be recommended for use in clinical care. ","755":"Based on the biopsychosocial model, the present paper investigates the interactions between physical complaints and psychological parameters under the terms of a rehabilitation procedure. In 309 participants of orthopaedic rehabilitation, the course of physical complaints (GBB-24), emotional stress (HADS-D) and locus of control (KU-WS) were recorded using a pre-post design. Additionally, the impact of the factors gender, age and level of chronicity as well as the interactions between the variables were analysed. Compared to the general population, the rehabilitation participants had significantly higher levels of fatigue, limb pain and pressure caused by complaints as well as anxiety and depression. Definite changes under the terms of rehabilitation were found for all single parameters of physical complaints and emotional stress; however, the scales with initially significantly increased values did not reach the levels of the general population. The reduction of physical complaints was significantly correlated with the reduction of emotional stress. The relationship between physical complaints and locus of control was much lower. The present paper confirms the strong interaction between biological and psychological factors under the terms of a rehabilitation process. ","756":"Currently, little is known about the influence of depressive symptoms and gender-specific aspects in rehabilitation outcome of patients with chronic low back pain. Effects of gender and depressive symptoms on rehabilitation outcome were examined immediately after rehabilitation, as well as three and six months after rehabilitation in 116 patients with chronic low back pain (43 women, 73 men; M=48 yrs.; ICD-10 diagnoses: M45.4\/M45.5, M54.4\/M54.5). Immediately after rehabilitation, general improvements with medium effect sizes in all rehabilitation measures were found. In contrast, six months after rehabilitation, only pain-related measures showed moderate improvements. Additionally, the mid-term outcomes were influenced by gender and depressive symptoms; women showed more stable rehabilitation outcomes in pain intensity, in the impaired function related to family\/leisure, and the coping with pain strategies of \"perceived self-competence\" and \"relaxation\". In contrast, especially male patients with severe depressive symptoms revealed regressive rehabilitation outcomes, both in pain-related variables as well as marginally in the coping with pain strategy of \"cognitive restructuring\". In post-hoc analyses, in the mid-term, they even showed a deterioration of functional capacity and somatisation compared to prior to rehabilitation. Our results suggest that the outcome of orthopaedic rehabilitation may be persistently improved by implementing gender-specific treatments in general and elements of depression treatments for the patients with severe but sub-clinical depressive symptoms.","757":"In the context of medical rehabilitation quality assurance, the use of screening procedures aims at specifically screening for rehabilitative cases that might be affected by quality problems. These may then be subjected to more elaborate quality management procedures. In the study presented, a criteria-based screening checklist designed to tap potential quality problems among rehabilitative cases in the German statutory accident insurance medical rehabilitation system was evaluated regarding its validity and suitability for routine use. Checklists were filled out by accident insurance administrators in three regional insurance funds who were instructed to evaluate all current rehabilitation cases (n=189) with regard to potential quality problems. For validation of the instrument, case reviews by physicians familiar with medical and administrative features of the accident insurance rehabilitation system were used. About a fifth of all cases reviewed using the screening checklist (22%) were classified as potentially problematic in terms of quality. Absence of relevant documents, delays in document receipt, and complications during treatment were cited as the most frequent problems. Concordance between the screening checklist and physicians' ratings concerning the quality of rehabilitative cases was moderate. Sensitivity and specificity were insufficient when using physicians' ratings as a validation criterion (0.53 and 0.56, respectively). Accident insurance administrators rated the screening checklist as a useful and practical quality management instrument. Concerning its insufficient validity using physicians' ratings as a validation criterion, the suitability of the checklist as a screening instrument is questionable. The instrument's potential of introducing the accident insurance administrators' expertise and knowledge into medical rehabilitation quality management strategies is highlighted. Further research on methodological aspects of the instrument as well as its content features is warranted. Starting points for modifications are outlined.","758":"The SGB IX, book 9 of the German social code (Sozialgesetzbuch, SGB), which is the legal basis of rehabilitation in Germany, states \"participation and self-determined conduct of life\" as the ultimate ambition of rehabilitation. This concept of participation and disability is based on the WHO model expressed in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). In this model, participation after the onset of a health problem may not only be infringed by disturbances in body functions and structures and the resulting activity limitations but also by contextual factors such as environmental and personal factors. In an outpatient neurological rehabilitation centre we prospectively rated for 49 patients the influence of these contextual factors as well as of objectively assessed functional\/activity limitations on the overall disability. On average, functional\/activity limitations were rated as contributing 58.4% (SD=17.2%), personal factors 26.4% (SD=12.7%) and environmental factors 15.1% (SD=11.2%) to the overall disability. The functional\/activity limitations closely matched the expected limitations based on the underlying brain lesions. The degree of disability based on contextual factors was not related to activity limitations based on disturbances of body functions and structures. Also, demographic variables such as age, sex or chronicity were not significantly linked to contextual factors. Since contextual factors together contributed 41.6% (SD=17.2%) to the overall disability they have major relevance for the rehabilitation process, because they essentially decide on the extent to which abilities acquired by the rehabilitant during rehabilitation actually be transfered to his everyday life. Therefore, rehabilitation programmes need to include assessment and treatment of contextual factors. It hence is necessary to develop instruments to quantify contextual factors.","759":"","760":"","761":"","762":"","763":"In rehabilitation research regression models are often used in analysing the effects of several independent factors on important outcomes in rehabilitation. But the results of such models are rarely used in rehabilitation practice for diagnosis or prognosis of patient outcomes. The main reason for this is the fact that the applicability of such models for new patient data is often unknown. A good fit of the model with respect to the data used in modeling does not guarantee a well-fitting model in the future. Thus, it is necessary to examine the performance of the model for new patient data. This examination is called model validation. The main aspect in model validation is the investigation of the prediction error caused by a too optimistic estimation of the model parameters. This prediction error is due to the twofold use of the data set: for estimating the regression coefficients AND for examining the model fit. In this paper this error is discussed and the main methods for regression model validation are presented. Finally an example illustrates the effects of model validation for prognostic purposes in a logistic regression model estimating the risk of early retirement after in-patient rehabilitation.","764":null,"765":"The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) consists of more than 1 400 items. Due to its size and complexity, using the ICF is hardly feasible in practice. Moreover, the severity of problems is given only on a five-point scale (qualifiers), which seems too insensitive for measurement of changes. Thus, in cooperation with four rehabilitation hospitals, Jacobi, Urban &amp; Kaluscha have identified 148 relevant items for musculoskeletal diseases. For easier usage we assigned mnemonic three letter codes to these items, e. g. WAL for the item \"Walking\" (ICF d450). Then the physician assigns those few items which he and\/or the patient consider most important. The severity of the problem is judged on a scale from 0 (no restriction) to 100 (maximum restriction) for each item. By drawing a bar on the scale the physician gives an interval instead of just a single point (fuzzy judgement). The centre of the interval represents the severity of the problem and the width represents the uncertainty of judgement, e. g. when there is no gold standard for measurement or when the problem varies with time. As both the assignment of descriptors from an item pool and the fuzzy judgements are a new approach to medical documentation, we carried out this pilot study to examine acceptance and feasibility of the approach. In the pilot study, 264 in-patients in four rehabilitation clinics have been included. 138 (94%) of the 148 descriptors in the item pool have been used. Altogether there were 1,764 single judgements. On average six descriptors per patient have been assigned, giving an efficient and precise individual documentation. This is an advantage of the documentation principle called combination of terms compared to the principle of classification. In contrast to the ICF core sets patients may get individual sets of descriptors as appropriate. On discharge, the judgements were about 25 points better compared to admission. During treatment the fluctuations of disorders decreased and the certainty of the judgements increased, resulting in reduction of interval width of 2.8 points. The feedback of the rehabilitation clinics involved showed good acceptance and feasibility. Our data can easily be mapped into the ICF. In addition to ICF core sets, our approach could facilitate the use of the ICF in practical settings.","766":"An important rehabilitation aim following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is to modify cardiovascular risk factors positively. Among the most potent possibilities for improvement of these factors is a lifestyle change in terms of increasing sports exercise, changing diet patterns, stress reduction, etc. An indispensable condition for these changes is the motivation to implement the necessary changes. In our working group a patient education programme was developed aimed at enhancing the motivation for lifestyle change, which was already applied in a cardiac surgery hospital. In evaluating the programme, we could observe that various cognitive factors of motivation for lifestyle change had dropped in untreated patients and risen in patients participating in the programme. Based on these preliminary findings we examined the motivation for lifestyle change one year after CABG surgery. Each patient was evaluated for his\/her value in motivation for lifestyle change using a 30-item questionnaire which measures the six factors Vulnerability, Intention, Social Expectations, Outcome Expectation, Self-Efficacy Expectation, and Perceived Severity two days before CABG surgery as well as ten days and one year after CABG surgery. Between January and May 2002 patients in usual care were investigated as control group (n=70). From January to May 2003, n=70 patients had the opportunity to take part in a comprehensive patient education programme that was provided by a specifically trained psychologist. Data from 108 patients could be evaluated one year after CABG surgery (response rate=77.1%). The programme had comprised individualized units, as well as a group lecture. If partners were available they were included in the process. One year after CABG surgery no significant differences between the control group and the intervention group could be found. The positive effects of the patient education programme measured ten days after surgery were found to have vanished one year after the operation. A possible reason is the short duration of the programme. Long-term, structured aftercare programmes should help stabilize the positive effects obtained in the short term. ","767":"Patients with chronic pain disorder are generally thought to be difficult to treat in psychosomatic rehabilitation. On average, their disorders tend to take a more chronic course than those of other patients, and they develop a higher rate of additional socio-medical problems, all of which increase the probability of therapy failure. Most of the time, such failures are attributed solely to the desire for early retirement and disability pensions, that is, a characteristic of the patient. However, a lack of specific therapeutic offers for patients with predominant psycho-social problems has also to be considered. The project described was designed to evaluate a newly developed socio-medical therapy module. This module aimed at bringing more transparency to the process of assessing occupational capabilities and work performance, thus improving the patients' motivation to participate in the rehabilitation program as well as the overall therapy outcome. The project was implemented as a controlled, prospective evaluation study. A quasi-experimental 3-factorial design was employed, including two group factors (factor 1: socio-medical intervention [EG 1] vs. relaxation therapy module [EG 2]; factor 2: current application for premature pension vs. none; factor 3: repeated measurements [admission to inpatient therapy, discharge from the clinic, 6-months follow-up]). The treatment conditions for the experimental groups were realized according to an ABBA-scheme. Patients in both treatment conditions took part in pain disorder-specific coping groups and were also included in the regular inpatient treatment. At all three points of measurement, socio-demographic, socio-medical, symptomatic and motivational patient characteristics were obtained as dependent variables by use of well-established standardized patient surveys. In total, 206 patients suffering from a chronic pain disorder took part in the study (n [EG1]=100; n [EG2]=106). Both treatment groups were considered equal regarding relevant sample characteristics. The socio-medical intervention was equally well accepted by all patients. Patients of the first experimental group turned out to be better informed about socio-medical issues than members of the second experimental group. The rehabilitation treatment program as a whole was--independently of treatment group affiliation--highly effective. Despite contrary expectations, the socio-medical intervention did not have an additional (differential) therapeutic effect on the patients at all points of measurement, not even on those participants currently applying for retirement pensions. Also, there were no significant differences between the treatment groups regarding the days of sick leave within six months after discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. The original and possibly too ambitious goal of the project, namely to increase the rehabilitation success for patients with pain disorder and current pension applications by means of the therapeutic module labeled \"social medicine\", was not achieved. Nevertheless it is to be noted that this module was well received by the patients. Moreover, the authors consider it to be of high value in itself that this therapeutic module helps patients to become better informed. ","768":"Previous reviews concerning inpatient orthopaedic rehabilitation in Germany stated no convincing evidence of its effectiveness. However, work-related and behavioural-medicine concepts of rehabilitation have for several years been established in order to intensify and broaden conventional rehabilitation. But so far none of the previous studies had compared intensified and conventional rehabilitation within the framework of a systematic review of randomized controlled trials and used a meta-analytic approach. To assess the effectiveness of intensified inpatient orthopaedic rehabilitation on clinically relevant outcomes in patients with musculoskeletal disorders. We searched the following databases as of 26 November 2007: MEDLINE from 1966, EMBASE from 1989, PSYNDEX from 1977, PsycINFO from 1980. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that had studied adults with musculoskeletal disorders, who had participated in intensified inpatient orthopaedic rehabilitation in Germany. Outcome measures were self-rated state of health, pain intensity, functioning, and days of sick leave. Standardised mean difference and associated 95% confidence interval were calculated. Cochran's Q statistic was used to assess the heterogeneity of the results, and the I (2) statistic was used to determine any inconsistency between the studies. Five relevant trials were identified in 15 publications. Four of them were considered to be high-quality RCTs. The trials identified reported 18 randomized comparisons of intensified orthopaedic rehabilitation and conventional orthopaedic rehabilitation. There is strong evidence that intensified rehabilitation improves self-rated state of health when compared with conventional rehabilitation at mid-term and long-term follow-up. There is moderate evidence that intensified rehabilitation with a psychological group intervention reduces pain intensity when compared with conventional rehabilitation at long-term follow-up. There is no evidence of reduced days of sick leave and improved functioning. The relevant studies provide evidence that intensified rehabilitation improves self-rated state of health and reduces pain intensity in rehabilitants with musculoskeletal disorders.

In homes without predominant nursing care and without hospital-like medical care of the inhabitants, genotypically identical MRSA-strains are rarely found in room neighbours up to now. The recommendations on prevention and control of MRSA published by the Robert Koch-Institut (RKI) therefore are partially discrepant for these two fields. The setting in rehabilitation medical centres, from hygienic points of view, is in many respects similar to a medical practice or a home with predominantly independent inhabitants rather than to a hospital for patients with acute diseases. For an effective and humane stationary rehabilitation of patients with MRSA colonisation it would be desirable to define conditions under which the strict isolation-hygiene prescribed for acute hospitals could be deviated from, following e. g., the RKI recommendations for homes instead. With the input of a summary of the clinical relevance of MRSA and a comparison of both partly identical, partially however very different RKI-recommendations on prevention and control of MRSA the present article seeks to characterize the hygienic setting in (particularly oncological) stationary rehabilitation under the above aspects. A series of recommendations on MRSA hygiene in stationary rehabilitation follows, which depending on the risk profile involved is based partially on the RKI guidelines for hospitals, partially however, on the guidelines for homes. The recommendations have a preliminary character without claiming completeness or the rank of a guideline. They are intended to focus on a problem which arises more and more frequently also in rehabilitation centers. They can, in the individual case, provide a useful help for the practice in stationary rehabilitation particularly as there are no publications on the subject of MRSA hygiene so far which meet the circumstances in stationary rehabilitation in a different manner.","774":"Geriatrics is needed as an independent discipline to cope with the demographic challenges ahead in a medically qualified manner. Geriatrics is a \"supraspeciality\" and not a \"subspeciality\" of Internal Medicine, because geriatrics typically combines the different medical disciplines and does not play a role as an independent functional area. For general practitioners and medical specialists a geriatric qualification is required. The geriatric structures in place in the German federal states need to be adapted and advanced with a focus on ambulatory geriatric service provision. The current health care reform has resulted in a strengthening of rehabilitation in general and in particular of an ambulant\/mobile service approach. The resultant opportunities and risks are described. Internal and external quality assurance is indispensable for the advancement of structures including geriatrics and social medicine.","775":"Getting the diagnosis of \"paraplegia\" means an extremely deep cut into someone's life.

It is not about offering easy solutions but about helping people to find their own language to express their inner experience and hopefully in the end, to find their own way with the disability. There is hope that something new can arise from the fragments of one's former life.","776":"This article describes the method and result of an authorized German translation of the Motor Assessment Scale (MAS) - a measurement tool to scale motor function after stroke. The MAS is widely known in English speaking countries and is used as an outcome measure in clinical trials. It has been well researched regarding its psychometric characteristics. The translation is based on a methodical process according to the guidelines of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. A synopsis was produced from two German initial translations, and an English back translation was performed to check the correctness of the content. The publication of the German version of the MAS aims to improve the outcome measurement in the area of rehabilitation after brain lesion.","777":"Medical rehabilitation of patients with mental disorders is new in Austria. A catamnestic study was performed to evaluate the effects of an inpatient treatment programme. 355 patients were included in the study in 2003, 262 patients (73.8%) were evaluated after one year. The sample included patients with \"severe mental illness\" (about 25%) as well as patients with neurotic disorders. Patients' symptoms and quality of life had improved. The effect sizes admission-dismissal were between 0.17 and 0.62, the effect sizes after one year were between 0.10 and 0.25. Duration of sick leave was 20.5 weeks in the year before rehabilitation and 6.5 weeks in the year after rehabilitation. Duration of hospitalization was three weeks before versus 1.5 weeks after rehabilitation. Patients who had been employed at admission had a good chance to remain on the job (65.8%). Disease-related factors did not predict treatment outcome. A medical rehabilitation concept showed positive therapy outcomes for patients with severe mental illness as well as for patients with neurotic disorders. ","778":"The objective of this study is to investigate the influence of substance abuse and addiction as comorbid disorders on the treatment results of patients of a psychosomatic unit one year after their release. In a prospective, non-randomized field study patients were asked by mail one year after finishing their treatment as part of a quality management endeavour. After one year patients with comorbid substance addiction did not improve in psychological tests whereas those with comorbid substance abuse or without any of these comorbidities showed significant improvements. Due to reasons to be studied further comorbid substance addiction seems to influence treatment outcome at least in psychological tests. ","779":"Musculoskeletal disorders are the most common health problem in Germany and the most frequent cause for medical rehabilitation under the German statutory pension insurance scheme. There is evidence of a strong association between musculoskeletal disorders and work-related problems. Recent research has shown that work-related interventions are adequate and effective as a treatment for patients with strong work-related problems. This evaluation compares the \"work-related\" (German: MBO, medizinisch-beruflich orientiert) rehabilitation to the standard medical rehabilitation provided in a clinical setting. From the perspective of a regional German statutory pension insurance agency, DRV Westfalen, it measures the efficiency of both treatments in patients with a diagnosed MBO demand 18 months after completion of the treatment. The effect of both treatments on pension insurance revenues and costs up to 18 months after treatment was determined. Rehabilitation balance sheets of both treatments were compared in a cost-benefit analysis. From the difference obtained, conclusions could be drawn relative to the efficiency of the respective treatments. The descriptive analysis indicated additional receipts as a result of the MBO rehabilitation. Considering total costs, an effect amounting to 1 245 euro concerning the total revenue of DRV Westfalen is found if a patient had completed the MBO rehabilitation instead of the standard medical rehabilitation programme. Compared to standard medical rehabilitation, \"work-related\" rehabilitation hardly causes higher follow-up costs within 18 months, while generating higher receipts. Consequently, a more favourable monetary development is realized within the balance total in contrast to the standard medical rehabilitation. Limitations and consequences of these results are discussed in detail. ","780":"The present study aimed at investigating the need for professional assistance in carers of stroke patients who do not require a therapeutic group intervention; and furthermore, how this need for assistance is changing in the course of rehabilitation. Ten highly burdened spouses of stroke survivors were interviewed twice in the framework of a qualitative panel study. In-depth interviews concerning subjective burden and assistance requirements were carried out and analyzed using Grounded Theory coding procedures. The evaluation of the interview data showed that the relatives' needs for assistance change in the course of rehabilitation, and feature gender- and age-specific differences. Assistance needs persist in the medium and long term, with qualitative diversifications: During the in-patient rehabilitation period, carers request mainly illness-related information, whereas emotional assistance is rarely desired. This is different during the out-patient rehabilitation period: While the desire for further information decreases, the need for emotional assistance (e. g.disburdening counselling) increasingly comes to the fore. Women much more often desire professional assistance than men. When designing and offering professional assistance for caregivers of stroke patients, gender- and age-specific aspects should be taken into account, as well as the medium- and long-term changes in assistance need. ","781":"The literature predicts a considerable demand of support and aid for stroke patients and their caregivers. It is not known to what extent existing resources are used by these groups. The present study aimed at a survey of knowledge of and acquaintance with institutions and organizations offering support after stroke and actual use of these resources. Six and twelve months after stroke, 84 patients and their nearest others were questioned concerning their acquaintance with and use of professional and institutional resources for support and also with respect to social support and self-efficacy. Six and twelve months after stroke, actual use of the various resources for support varied between 0 and 13%. Only part of the patients (11-65%) and relatives (up to 78%) knew about the professional and institutional resource available. Information about resources for support after stroke is unsatisfactory and should be established at a point in the delivery of care chain where all those affected by stroke and their caregivers are accessed.

The right to individual wishes and choice of assessment, services and institutions and of the benefits has to be respected. Also the services and institutions have to respect self-determination and to enable to exercise it. On an institutional level the organisations of disabled people have to participate in designing the benefits, the planning of the infrastructure and the counselling of people with disabilities.

The purpose of the review is to clarify standards, services, goals and topics of rehabilitation as seen from a gender perspective. Women and men have different rehabilitation needs. This is caused by differences as to circumstances, coping, health behaviours, resources, goals and preferences. There are also gender specific barriers to physical exercises. Some results also suggest differences in rehabilitation outcomes for women and men. Various gender oriented rehabilitation programmes are outlined. The results of the review are discussed, and deficits as to gender research in rehabilitation are pointed out.","790":"The article centres around the concept and meaning of narratives in medicine. It provides an overview over illness narratives and their relation to concepts and goals of narrative medicine. Narrative medicine is defined as a patient-centred form of medical practice. Epistemological, structural and functional properties of narratives and the role of narrative in doctor-patient-interaction are described. Interdisciplinary research on illness narratives, narratives in medical ethics, narrative forms of therapy and a database of patients' experiences on the web are introduced.","791":"Enhanced patient participation in health care is demanded due to better knowledge of patients about diseases and their treatment, due to more treatment strategies in the course of scientific progress, due to ethical and legal considerations, and due to study results. With shared decision-making (SDM) a method was defined for the medical interview to involve patients in treatment decisions. Process steps for orientation are available for the procedure of the medical encounter. Transfer of shared decision-making into health care can be realized through three strategies, i. e., by physician training to enhance physicians' competencies in medical encounter, by decision aids for better information and preparation for decision making, and by patient education. For examination and fostering of SDM in German health care the German Ministry of Health initiated a research consortium in the years 2001 to 2007 called \"Patient as a partner in medical decision making\". In an additional research consortium of the German Ministry of Education and Research, the German Pension Insurance scheme as well as the associations of statutory and private health insurance, various projects for health services research on the subject of \"Chronic Diseases and Patient Orientation\" will be funded starting in 2008. This initiative with a focus on rehabilitation will foster studies about need-specific patient information, training programmes for chronically ill patients, and about the organisation of a more participative structure of health care delivery.","792":"Patient education is a central component of patient-oriented medical rehabilitation. The aim of patient education is to provide patients with the fundamentals of acting as competent partners in the rehabilitation process. Thus, the goals of educational group programmes are compliance, self-management, and empowerment, which are aspired by means of providing information, training skills, and modifying attitudes. According to expert opinions, such programmes should comply with certain minimum criteria regarding aims, methods, and frameworks, which can then be complemented by additional quality criteria. Furthermore, educational programmes should meet all the substantial requirements and standards of the respective medical area and exhibit proven effectiveness. A nationwide survey of rehabilitation institutions has shown that the implementation of patient education does not meet the quality requirements in all cases, particularly regarding patient-oriented didactics, standardisation, manual-use and evaluation. An additional quality feature is marked by the skills and qualifications of the educators. Instructors should be competent in leading and moderating groups and using various methods and media in order to fulfill the standards of modern educational concepts. As ample evidence has shown, patient participation and improved self-efficacy are indispensable when trying to promote healthy lifestyles in patients. Additional opportunities for enhancing patient orientation and optimizing patient education are provided by measures of behavioural planning and after-care as attempts to convey the behavioural changes in the patients' everyday lives.","793":"Measuring the results of rehabilitation interventions presents a number of issues regarding content and method, two of which have been selected for discussion in view of the findings of current research--the significance of patient orientation and the relation to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, ICF. Compilation of patients' treatment goals, expectations and preferences, patient participation in the development of assessment instruments, compilation of patients' evaluations of treatment results and consideration of the subjectivity of the physician as well as interaction between patient and physician were discussed with respect to involving patients in measuring results. The ICF is a terminology system presenting a uniform international classification for describing health conditions that could assume the function of a common language for the members of various occupations involved in medical rehabilitation. Orienting the measurement of results to the ICF is an obvious next step. This can promote patient orientation, as the categories used by the ICF--in particular for the domains of activities and participation--are formulated in terms relevant to daily routine and are thus pertinent to the patients' lifestyle. The consequences resulting from this overview concern future research needs on the one hand, and on the other hand tips for carrying out a patient-oriented, ICF-based measurement of results. The need for research becomes especially clear regarding the measurement of results based on patient preferences, the determination of the participation relevance perceived by the patient as a criterion for \"patient significance\" (analogous to \"clinical significance\"), the integration and weighting of patient and physician assessments of success, the consideration of physicians' subjective concepts and patients' communication preferences, and the design of new, ICF-oriented assessment instruments.","794":"","795":"Regression analysis is a frequently used tool to examine associations between a dependent (outcome) variable and one or more independent variables. The resulting model enables prediction of an unobserved outcome based on the observed independent variables. In rehabilitation research the dependent variable is quite often dichotomous, i. e. having just two parameter values (e. g. capable of work: yes\/no). For such an outcome variable, the logistic regression model can be applied, having specific advantages in interpreting the model parameters with respect to risk factor analysis. In this paper the basics of the logistic regression model, interpretation of the model parameters and special aspects of modelling are presented. Subsequently the logistic regression model is applied to an example dataset for estimating the risk of early retirement after inpatient rehabilitation.","796":"Since April 1, 2007 medical rehabilitation is a standard insurance benefit of the statutory health insurance scheme (covered by the SGB V, book 5 of the German social code), with the right of the beneficiary to comply especially with the intentions, the principles and the preconditions of the benefits as stipulated in the SGB IX (book 9 of the German social code covering rehabilitation and participation of persons with disabilities). In claiming benefits the applicable rules primarily are those of the SGB IX, as long as the SGB V does not contain different rules. In light of the demands of the SGB IX, the prevailing case law of the Federal Social Court concerning technical aids and assistive devices cannot persist any longer. The so-called \"basic-compensation\" is contradictory to the specifications of the SGB IX. Medical rehabilitation does not only consist of complex benefits, but every single benefit pursuant to section sign 26 Abs. 2, Abs. 3 SGB IX is a medical rehabilitation benefit if its priority intention is to achieve the beneficiary's participation in society.","797":"Seven standardized external quality assurance (QA) procedures are currently being applied in geriatric rehabilitation in Germany. Five of these procedures are case-based (Gemidas, GiB-DAT, KODAS, EVA-Reha, Evaluation Procedures of the Medical Review Board of Saxony), and two are institution-based (Quality Seal for Geriatric Rehabilitation in Rhineland-Palatinate, Quality Seal for Geriatrics BAG KGE). The institution-based procedures focus on the quality dimensions \"structure\" and \"process\", whereas the case-based procedures mainly focus on the collection of administrative data, and to a limited extent on the quality dimensions \"outcomes\" and \"patient satisfaction\". The outcome quality parameters used in the case-based QA procedures are usually the \"place of discharge\" versus the \"place of residence\", the \"improvement in coping with daily activities\" (mostly based on the Barthel Index), and the \"improvement in mobility and gait\" (based on the Timed Up &amp; Go). So far, outcomes to be specified at the beginning of rehabilitation measures have only been defined in few procedures, and only to a basic degree or on a trial basis. In the institution-based procedures, the data are mainly collected by external data collectors, whereas in the case-based procedures, they are collected by the service providers themselves. In most procedures, data processing and analysis are performed independently of the participating service providers but only partly independently of the agency responsible for the procedure and the whole group of service providers. In the case-based procedures, risk adjustment techniques are not routinely applied in comparisons between institutions. Attempts to implement standardised QA procedures in geriatric rehabilitation may be based on existing procedures and should use this appraisal for developing them further, however taking more into account QA aspects specific to geriatrics.","798":"The WHODAS II (World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule II) is a questionnaire derived from the ICF classification system (International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health) for the evaluation of disabilities and handicaps. Data on its validity and reliability with respect to the consequences of stroke are largely lacking. The present study aimed at measurements of reliability of the WHODAS II in its application to stroke patients and their closest others. Eighty-four patient-relative pairs were assessed six months after stroke with the self- and observer-rating versions. From the patients' and relatives' judgements, Cronbach's alpha was computed as measurement of internal consistency, intra-class correlation coefficients as measurements of the inter-rater reliability of subscales and total scores, and Spearman's rho (rho) for the inter-rater reliability for single items. In addition, the inter-rater correspondence was calculated as the percentage of responses. The internal consistency was found to be good to excellent (alpha=0.81-0.99) both for patients' and relatives' judgements. Inter-rater reliabilities ranged from satisfactory for the subscale Understanding and Communication to excellent for the total score (ICC 0.64-0.94). However, the inter-rater reliability of the items as well as their percental correspondence was hardly satisfactory, with few exceptions in the realms of Life Activities and Self-Care (rho=0.24-0.90 and percental correspondence 29.6%-75.7%). Our results demonstrate that the WHODAS II is a reliable instrument for the assessment of stroke patients, both as a self- and an observer-rating questionnaire. Whereas the correspondence between patient and relative may be disparate with respect to single items - especially those not directly observable -, subscale and total scores seem to allow predictions based on observer judgements. The assessment of stroke patients' disabilities and handicaps through relatives' judgements with the WHODAS II scales is reliable.","799":"Classical multisensory stimulation (MSS) programmes comprises modules for visual, acoustical, olfactorial and vestibularic stimulation. Therapeutic goal is a near-optimally structured and supporting environment adapted to the reduced abilities in perception and cognition of patients in a coma, with dementia, or with a learning disability. A critical review (based on the EMBASE and PubMed databases) shows that there is a shortage of studies as well as poor evidence of the effectiveness of multisensory stimulation approaches in general. A few studies show positive short-term effects concerning behavioural changes in patients in a coma, with dementia or with a learning disability but no evident long-term effects. Verifiable short-term effects, however, legitimate multisensory interventions in brain-damaged patients.","800":"Although acute medical care of cardiac patients has clearly improved, vocational integration and vocational outlook of patients after MI and\/or cardiac surgery did not improve substantially over the last few decades. This study is intended to evaluate a programme aimed at enhancing the return to work of cardiac rehabilitands. The programme is applied in addition to the usual rehabilitation programme and includes job-related interventions by the Social and Psychological Services as well as standardized application of the functional capacity evaluation (FCE). This prospective randomized controlled trial is intended to evaluate the effects of the intervention programme on return to work. 150 patients who received the job-related programme (the intervention group) were compared to 150 patients who received the usual rehabilitation interventions (the control group). The study includes cardiac patients insured under the workers' pension insurance scheme and not older than age 56. Before coming to the clinic they had been unable to work, and problems with their returning to work were anticipated. Exclusion criteria were heart surgery less than three months ago, a cardiac capacity below 75 Watt, and reduced left-ventricular function. Follow-up data collection was performed 12 months after rehabilitation using a mail questionnaire. At the beginning of the rehabilitation programme, comparison of the groups showed no significant differences in biological, psychological and social variables. At 12-months follow-up, the data of 212 participants (70.6% of the participants) were available. Up to this time, 79.1% of the patients from the intervention group had returned to work, whereas in the control group only 62.9% had returned to work (chi(2) test, p&lt;0.05). The results of the 12-months follow-up underline the positive effects of a job-oriented rehabilitation programme for patients' return to work.

For example, therapists frequently make categorical judgements aiming to get information whether specific patient characteristics prevail or not (dichotomous rating format) or which of several alternatives holds for a patient (polytomous rating format). Interrater agreement is an important prerequisite to ensure that reliable and meaningful information concerning patients' state can be inferred from the data obtained. Cohen's kappa (Cohen's kappa) is the most frequently used measure to quantify interrater agreement. The properties of Cohen's kappa are characterized and conditions for the appropriate application of kappa are clarified. Because sometimes specific properties of kappa are not appropriately considered, misleading interpretations of this measure may easily arise. This is the case because the value of Cohen's kappa is affected by information aspects that are independent of the quality of the rating process. In order to avoid such misconceptions, alternative evaluation strategies are described for dichotomous rating formats which enhance agreement analysis and thus ensure a more valid interpretation. In addition, it is shown how weighted Cohen's kappa (omega) may be used to analyze polytomous rating formats.","807":"Thanks to the modern therapy protocols, terminal prognosis of Aids disease is no longer certainty. It has now been updated to a chronic disease with good survival rates demanding follow-up and rehabilitative measures. Rehabilitative care in Western Africa is still rare. The care for Aids patients mainly concentrates on psychosocial activities offered by non-governmental Aids associations. The care is mainly outpatient; the objective is to improve the patients' compliance. Compared to western countries, African HIV-infected patients suffer even more from discrimination and are outcast from their family. Hospital-based rehabilitation is being established. Objectives are primarily to improve compliance and, secondly, to restore physical and mental efficiency as well. Favourable patient compliance is considered to be a good prognostic factor resulting in preventing recurrences and expensive therapy.","808":"This study is directed at the following questions: How many laryngectomees are using which adaptive devices how often? Which devices are they lacking? Which alaryngeal voice has the best results in terms of intelligibility? 218 patients operated on in 6 ENT-clinics in Eastern Germany over the last 25 years were interviewed in person. Items from a German questionnaire for psychosocial adjustment after laryngectomy (FPAL) and from the quality of life questionnaire EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35 were used. Voice intelligibility was measured by an objective test, the Postlaryngectomy-Telephone-Intelligibility-Test (PLTT). The most common communication method in this group is the esophageal voice, only 20% use voice prostheses regularly, and 15% of the patients use electronic devices. 87% of the laryngectomees wear scarves to protect their stoma, and 82% use inhalers. Several patients lack tools for communication, some for protection of the tracheostoma and others devices for showering and swimming. The best speech results are gained with voice prostheses. Health related Quality of Life shows only poor correlation with the use of adaptive devices. In general the health care for laryngectomees in terms of device use can be seen as relatively good but not as optimal. Problematic is the fact that 15.5% of the patients could not acquire an adequate voice, that some devices are missed by patients despite the fact that they are available for purchase, and that some patients do not care for their tracheostoma. It could be useful to consider these findings within medical consultations.

At time of diagnosis women are 5 years older than men (median: 73 vs. 68 years). Up to now, data on frequency and predictors of utilization of rehabilitation of patients with colorectal neoplasms are not available. Therefore, we evaluated this topic in a population-based cohort of patients with colorectal cancer from Schleswig-Holstein. Data were obtained in the course of the Popgen study. Popgen is a population-based molecular genetic study. For this project younger patients (&lt;65 yrs) with colorectal neoplasms (ICD-10 diagnosis C18-C21) who where living in Schleswig-Holstein and who had received the diagnosis between Jan. 2000 and Sept. 2004, were asked by means of a postal self-administered questionnaire regarding their medical care and quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30). Eligible study participants were identified in the epidemiological cancer registry of Schleswig-Holstein. In all, 245 patients participated and sent back the questionnaire (37+\/-15 months after receiving the primary diagnosis). Of 241 persons with a valid answer, 119 (49%) participated in medical rehabilitation (62 females and 56 males, Chi (2): p=0.180). The rehabilitation lasted 3.76+\/-0.94 weeks, and in 36.7% of the cases the rehabilitation started within two weeks after being discharged from the hospital. In a regression model in which T-category, N-category, gender, age, education, health insurance (private or statutory), living with a partner, stoma, radiation, chemotherapy, complications or side effects of the therapy were included as independent predictors for the utilization of rehabilitation, only the factor \"living with a partner\" was identified as a significant predictor: patients without a partner more often received inpatient rehabilitation than patients living with a partner (odds ratio=3.8; 95% confidence interval [1.3; 11.7]). Colorectal neoplasms are a huge burden for the patients due to therapy and comorbidity. Therefore, colorectal neoplasms are an important indication for attending rehabilitation. About one half of the Popgen study participants took part in inpatient rehabilitation. It still remains to be clarified whether the utilization rate observed indicates adequate medical care or not. ","810":"Secondary lymphedema is one of the most frequent long-term side effects affecting up to 30% of all breast cancer patients after local surgical and radiation treatment. Destruction of the lymphatic system causes a progressive and chronic condition with functional impairments and disabilities limiting patients in their daily activities and involving nearly all aspects of their quality of life. Also, problems in the occupational area may be caused by lymphedema. The need for improving oncological management for early diagnosis and referral for effective treatment of lymphedema is a major goal of breast cancer heath care while survival improves. A systematic consensus process was performed involving all relevant partners and providers of lymphedema health care to develop a practical documentation concept and make recommendations according to the evidence of clinical studies and currently available guidelines. A practical concept of documentation with defined assessment points was developed for evaluation and monitoring of lymphedema, which included the assessment of quality of life parameters with recognised instruments by the patient themselves. Consensus recommendations for the postoperative management, prevention, treatment and follow-up of breast cancer patients along a clinical algorithm for in- and outpatient care were finalized. With improved survival, long-term side effects with major impact on quality of life become a most important end point criteria of oncological treatment. The clearly defined documentation concept and the comprehensive recommendations for lymphedema management may assist clinicians and patients to make timely decisions about in- and outpatient health care practice to optimize the interface between acute medicine and rehabilitation. Patients' compliance with treatment and prevention routines will be as important as ensuring the continuity of care. A longitudinal prospective study evaluating the effectiveness and efficacy of the consensus recommendation is currently being implemented. ","811":"Herniated discs usually occur in middle aged persons. For some the pain is so serious that an operation is necessary. Yet despite modern micro-surgical methods for operations, approximately one-third of the patients continue to report ongoing limitations. The reasons for insufficient success of therapy however lie not only in the illness as such. This study is intended to examine the changes in the subjective success parameters of pain-related impairment and the ability to function in herniated disc patients during rehabilitation. Using multivariate analyses, the influence of sociodemographic, illness-specific, work-related and mental variables on changes in goal variables is shown. 214 herniated disc patients were interviewed before the operation, after post-operative therapy, and six months after surgery. Before their operation, herniated disc patients experienced a severe limitation of activity and ability in everyday function due to pain. About three-fourth of the patients experienced significant improvement in both variables after the operation and post-operative therapy. The influence factors for a successful therapy outcome were male gender and higher educational level. Risk factors were increasing age, a desire for a pension, severe illness symptoms and severe pre-operative depression. In addition to somatic therapy, higher risk patients should receive psychological or social and employment counselling as a support to post-operative therapy.","812":"Rehabilitants with chronic orthopaedic diseases are assigned to either the traditional or the behaviour-medical rehabilitation approach by consultant physicians of the rehabilitation department within the Deutsche Rentenversicherung Bund (German pension insurance agency). The clinical relevance of this assignment was evaluated at the Rehazentrum Bad Pyrmont-Klinik Weser within a randomised controlled trial. In a sample of 363 rehabilitants the agreement of consultant physicians with the ratings of physicians and psychologists in the clinic was analyzed. We also tested whether rehabilitants treated in their assigned approach benefit more from the treatment than patients who by randomisation were not treated in their assigned approach. Results indicate that psychiatric comorbidity frequently is taken into consideration as a decision-making criterion in the assignment made by the consultant physicians. However, there is only little agreement between the assignment by consultant physicians and the ratings by treating physicians and psychologists. Further, rehabilitants treated in their assigned approach did not benefit more from the treatment than patients who due to randomisation had not been treated in their assigned approach but in the other. Therefore, the procedure applied so far for assigning rehabilitants to either the traditional or the multidisciplinary rehabilitation approach is not sufficiently valid. Concluding, implications for the modification of assignment criteria are discussed.","813":"","814":"","815":"","816":"The legal foundations for provision and realization of geriatric rehabilitation benefits are contained in particular in Book 9 of the German social code, SGB IX (covering rehabilitation and participation of people with disabilities). This paper discusses claims foundations and benefit prerequisites of geriatric rehabilitation taking into consideration the relations between Book 5 (on health insurance) and Book 9 of the social code. The article includes a definition of \"geriatric rehabilitation\" in light of the SGB IX, describes the benefit carriers' obligations as well as the procedure in place for determining geriatric rehab need, in this context appraising the designation as \"geriatric patient\" in terms of its appropriateness as an identifying criterion in determining need. Provision of geriatric rehab benefits is contingent on a potential for attaining rehab goals as specified by SGB IX as well as on fulfillment of the benefit prerequisites. Responsibility for the content, extent and quality of geriatric rehabilitation lies with the benefit carriers, as is the case for the obligation to secure availability of the required numbers and quality of rehabilitation facilities and services. The article specifies the legal foundations of the various benefit types (ambulatory, mobile rehab, under a Personal Budget, integrated benefit provision, or early rehab), and discusses geriatric rehabilitation in the framework of an insurance-based medical care system as well as of activating care.","817":"The success of psychosomatic rehabilitation based on psychoanalytical therapy was analyzed within the framework of a two-year follow-up in patients with somatoform disorders and in patients with social-medically relevant problems, who had been on sick leave for more than six months. Both groups of patients are often considered to be difficult. They were compared with patients of other diagnostic categories and with patients with shorter periods of sick leave. All in all, the physical and mental state of health showed lasting improvement, and demands on the health service and frequency of days off sick decreased. Patients with somatoform disorders partly proved to be more seriously affected at the time of admission, treatment outcomes, however, were to a great extent comparable to patients of other diagnostic categories. Patients who had been on sick leave for more than six months were found to have been more seriously affected at the time of admission and also to have been unable to benefit from rehabilitation to the same degree as those with shorter periods of sick leave. The success of rehabilitation does not seem to depend so much on diagnostic categories but rather on the duration of disablement. In cases of inability to work a specific treatment that pays greater attention to the somatic concept of illness as well as the low level of motivation for psychotherapy in this patient group could lead to better treatment outcomes.","818":"The propagation of telemedicine has influenced the development of cardiac rehabilitation as well. Especially on an outpatient basis, there is an increasing number of publications about exercise training at home controlled by telemedical ECG. These trials, however, are predominantly feasibility studies including only few patients. In addition, most of the patients were male, classified as uncomplicated low-risk patients, and the vast majority was not included until weeks and months after the acute event. So far, there is no randomized controlled trial about telemedicine in cardiac rehabilitation in a large representative population. Furthermore, in most of the studies, only telemedically conducted exercise training was evaluated, and education classes as well as psychosocial interaction with the multidisciplinary team were not considered. The argument most often cited for the further spread of telemedicine, i.e. that its use will reduce the costs of medical care, has been proven so far neither. In conclusion, telemedical supervision of exercise training at home is technically feasible. As controlled data are lacking, risks and benefits of telemedical interventions in cardiac rehabilitation are not well evaluated yet. By no means may the sole telemedically supervised exercise training at home replace the multidisciplinary cardiac rehabilitation on an in- or outpatient basis. However, as there is the great opportunity to facilitate access to cardiac rehabilitation programmes for patients living in rural areas as well, the application of telemedical techniques should be further evaluated scientifically in this setting giving special attention to cost-effectiveness in times of limited financial resources.","819":"For a number of years, work-related interventions in medical rehabilitation (MBO) have been developed. Basically, these interventions concentrate on vocational problems of rehabilitees whose health disorders are strongly associated with contextual factors of the environment as well as personal factors. Previous studies showed a close relationship between the success of an intervention and identification of a specific demand. In fact there are several clinical concepts regarding specific demand. But there still is a lack of appropriate instruments for use in identification of occupational challenges. Therefore SIMBO (Screening Instrument for Identification of a Demand for Medical-Vocational Oriented Rehabilitation) has been developed recently. By using a scale for the intensity of work-related problems as well as a cut-off point, SIMBO is able to identify patients with and without a demand for work-related interventions. Analyses relative to construct validity and predictive validity were carried out on two different samples--a multi-clinic sample (patients with musculoskeletal disorders) and a sample from the German statutory pension insurance agency DRV Westfalen (successful applications for medical rehabilitation). In this context the cut-off level discussion is very important. By means of the multi-clinic sample--irrespective of cut-off definition--the SIMBO-decision and the clinical identification of MBO-demand were found to agree in 74-78% of the cases. This corresponds to a maximum adjusted correlation of r=0.59 (phi coefficient). Compared to the external ratings of vocational problems given by DRV staff in handling the applications, however, only little agreement is found (64%, r=0.25). In fact, SIMBO had in 77% (r=0.50) of the cases been able to correctly predict work-related problems to be expected. So the result obtained using this instrument is far better than prediction of these problems in the external ratings by DRV staff (54%, r=0,21). Also, return to work (RTW) in good health after six months can be predicted correctly by SIMBO in 77% of the cases. This means that the probability of RTW in good health is reduced by 90% (Odds Ratio=0.1) if work-related problems had been identified by SIMBO. Concerning its clinical as well as predictive quality, the validity of SIMBO-based ratings of work-related problems has been proven. Further, it has become obvious that SIMBO is suitable as an easy-to-handle tool for identification of a need for vocationally-focused interventions for use by the social insurance agencies which finance rehabilitation. Further interesting questions arise relative to application in different indications as well as potential uses as an outcome instrument. ","820":null,"821":"","822":"","823":"The \"patient-individual neurological care pathways\" are a concept for qualified decision-making about rational rehabilitative strategies in the treatment of neurological diseases. Such clinical pathways include available scientific evidence and treatment guidelines. In neurological rehabilitation all treatments have a decidedly interdisciplinary character. All members of the team need highly specialized knowledge, a high potential for teamwork, as well as efficient organisation of work time. Here, computer aided decision-making tools such as the \"patient-individual neurological care pathways\" facilitate rational decisions and reduce the need for reorganization of therapies. In rehabilitation of neurological patients a symptom-oriented and function-related perspective of the individual treatment goals is indispensable for optimal choice of therapy approaches. This function-oriented classification of patients and creation of individual treatment plans are realized within the Excel-based care pathways. This system has been proved on the one hand as an instrument for streamlining and optimisation and, on the other, as a useful tutoring tool in the medical rehabilitation process.","824":"In medical rehabilitation settings the use of appropriate assessment instruments is essential in many ways. A high quality of psychometric scales has to be ensured in order to allow for an appropriate interpretation of diagnostical data as well as for the evaluation of treatment outcomes and for quality assurance within rehabilitation clinics. Assessment scales developed by means of Rasch analysis possess desirable properties, especially because person parameters reach interval level by definition, and the assumption of only one latent dimension suffices to predict respondents behaviour sufficiently. Accordingly, Rasch scales are strictly one-dimensional and thus allow for unambiguous interpretation of diagnostic results. In this article it is shown which specific properties characterize Rasch scales and how Rasch analysis can be used in order to allow for a more differentiated and clinically meaningful data interpretation and to enhance analysis of clinical data.","825":"This article describes major aspects of the rehabilitation system of the former German Democratic Republic, GDR. Based on presentation of the actors in the medical and occupational rehabilitation system, differences are pointed out in comparison to the notion of rehabilitation in the former Federal Republic of Germany, FRG. The article focuses on the system of rehabilitation after stroke, which is outlined with relevant scientific literature. The health and rehabilitation system of the GDR was company-centred. Patients in rehabilitation received comprehensive care and guidance, and especially the companies played an integrative part and adjusted the occupational activity of the patients in rehabilitation to their physical and mental abilities in order to avoid early retirement. On account of the political and social transformation process as well as transfer of the health and rehabilitation legislation of the old FRG, the company-centred rehabilitation system of the GDR was replaced, implementing West German rehabilitation structures in East Germany as well.","826":"Physiotherapy and occupational therapy have changed over recent years influenced by our growing neurophysiological knowledge especially about motor learning. Understanding the direct effects of therapeutic interventions on the central motor system is crucial for further development of therapeutic approaches. Recent studies are discussed dealing with the facilitatory effects of different therapeutic interventions and the question whether or not the activation of the healthy upper limb has a facilitatory or inhibitory net-effect on the damaged central motor system. In a controlled study using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) we could show that motor system excitability is not influenced by the contraction type (isometric or isotonic), neither in healthy nor in stroke patients. Two TMS-studies could show that voluntary exercises of the non-affected hand alone or in bimanual tasks do not have an inhibitory effect on the damaged central motor system. However, the strongest facilitation of the damaged motor area could be achieved by voluntary activation of the affected extremity. The therapeutic approach in severely or completely paretic upper limbs should, hence, be focussed on functional compensation. As soon as voluntary activity is obtainable intensive voluntary exercises should however be preferred, with contraction type (isometric or isotonic) seeming not to be important.","827":"Insomnia is a common phenomenon in cancer patients; nevertheless, there are only a few intervention results published covering this topic. In a former study we examined the effects of a psychological sleep management programme with two intervention groups (n=80, n=71) and one control group (n=78) and showed significant improvements over time, indicating that 50% to 80% of the intervention group participants benefited with moderate or large scale effects on several sleep variables. Now we reanalysed data to look for predictors for those patients who improved best. Almost no demographic, cancer-related or quality of life variables predicted treatment response and persons with greater sleep disturbances at the beginning do benefit the same as persons with less problems. Additionally, better acceptance of the chosen intervention form (cognitive-behavioural programme with autogenic training or with muscle relaxation technique) positively predicted good outcome. Explained variance associated with different outcome variables varied between 9% and 18%. Therefore training should be offered for all cancer patients with sleep problems, and they should have a choice between different relaxation techniques.","828":"Aim of this project is the development of an evidence based guideline for the rehabilitation of breast cancer patients, funded by the German Pension Insurance scheme. The project consists of four phases. This paper is focused on the 2nd phase, i.e., analysis of procedures in rehabilitation based on evidence based therapeutic modules. As a result of a systematic literature review 14 therapeutic modules were defined. From a total of 840 possible KTL Codes (Klassifikation Therapeutischer Leistungen, Classification of therapeutic procedures), 229 could be assigned to these modules. These analyses are based on 24685 patients in 57 rehabilitation clinics, who had been treated in 2003. For these modules the number of patients having received those interventions as well as the duration of the modules were calculated. The data were analysed with respect to the influence of age and comorbidity. Moreover, differences between rehabilitation clinics were investigated according to the category of interventions. Our findings show great variability in the use of the therapeutic modules. Therapeutic modules like Physiotherapy (91.6%), Training Therapy (85.2%) and Information (97.8%) are provided to most of the patients. Younger patients receive more treatments than older patients, and patients with higher comorbidity receive more Physiotherapie, Lymphoedema Therapy and Psychological Interventions than patients without comorbidities. Data analysis shows wide interindividual variability with regard to the therapeutic modules. This variability is related to age and comorbidity of the patients. Furthermore, great differences were found between the rehabilitation clinics concerning the use of the various interventions. This variability supports the necessity of developing and implementing an evidence based guideline for the rehabilitation of breast cancer patients. The next step will be discussing these findings with experts from science and clinical practice. ","829":"The concept and results of a pilot project to develop a quality assurance programme for outpatient medical rehabilitation in musculoskeletal and cardiac diseases are discussed. The processes developed and the results that were achieved using the instruments in 24 pilot institutions are described. The quality of structure was assessed by defining and applying basic and detailed criteria; a version of peer review for outpatient treatment was developed to test the quality of process. The quality of results was determined by means of a prospective study with two or three measurement times and implementation of generic and disease-specific measurement instruments. The process was tested on n=1475 patients with musculoskeletal diseases and n=843 patients with cardiac diseases. The level of the quality of structure in the participating centres is quite high; 89-93% of the structure features required were fulfilled. The peer review indicated that the process had 25-40% serious shortcomings in cardiology and 15-20% for musculoskeletal diseases. The quality of results measurements show that the participating outpatient rehab centres achieved medium effects for the majority of the core rehab dimensions for the respective indications, but the findings also showed that at the time the follow-up reports were made there was often a reduction of positive effects and high effects were quite rare. While there were marked differences in quality of structure and process among the various institutions, there were only slight differences among the outpatient centres regarding quality of results. A scientifically sound quality assurance programme was developed that covers specific aspects of outpatient rehabilitation, to a great extent using the same structures that have been implemented in the quality assurance programmes for inpatient treatment. To implement the results presented here, the scientific findings will need to be evaluated in the respective committees of the cost-carriers. The tests of the programme in 24 pilot institutions showed an overall high level of quality, but also revealed potential for improvement in some areas.

The legislator has left it to the central associations of health insurance funds and to the relevant umbrella organisations of care providers to develop these measures as well as the basic requirements on internal quality management in order to reach a joint agreement about it (cf. section 137d [1] and [1a] SGB V). The corresponding agreement was concluded on April 1, 2004. Whereas configuration of the internal quality management to a large extend lies in the discretion of the individual rehabilitation center, although it has to be geared to the objectives and principles set out in the agreement under section 137d SGB V, participation in the external quality assurance procedures of the central associations of health insurance funds (QS-Reha procedure) is obligatory for all rehabilitation centers with a care supply contract according to section 111 or 111a. The QS-Reha procedure comprises a survey of the central quality dimensions (structural, process and outcome quality as well as patient satisfaction) and permits related quality comparisons, which are utilized by the health insurance funds for quality oriented patient allocation and remuneration. The QS-Reha procedure had been developed to implement the legal requirements for external quality assurance in the field of medical rehabilitation ( section 135a in conjunction with section 137d SGB V) as well as to create a basis for quality focussed remuneration and patients allocation, whereas the Eva-Reha database had been developed by the Medical Service of Health Insurances in Rheinland-Pfalz for single case documentation with the objective of utilizing these data for internal quality management and, beyond this, also for various aspects of quality development across centers. The results generated in the framework of external quality assurance and internal management have to be integrated in the concept of internal quality management as they account for important sources of information with respect to the analysis of strengths or weaknesses of the facility. Irrespective of their origin quality relevant results should be integrated into a benchmarking system providing information to the operational and medical management of a rehabilitation center on the effectiveness and efficiency of the medical rehabilitation services provided. Up-to-date data, such as those generated by the Eva-Reha database, or sample survey data as those from the QS-Reha procedure can equally be used for such a benchmarking system and complement each another in a meaningful way. In this paper the main features of the QS-Reha procedure and the Eva-Reha database are described, with the objective of pointing out the particular perspectives of their data structure and results for continuous improvement in the framework of internal quality management.","836":"On completion of the funding period of six years within the federal programme for research in medical rehabilitation, an evaluative summary is given of the work performed and the experiences made in the cross-sectional projects offering methodological support. While specific research profiles had prevailed in each of the eight regional research networks, two institutions had been implemented with similar task assignments within all networks; i. e., (i) a central office, and (ii) a center for methodological support (CMS) had been available in order to enhance methodological research infrastructure and research quality of the clinical projects. This article outlines the support offered as well as further tasks of the CMS.

The group training is aimed at supporting the participants in coping effectively with stress, avoiding over- or under-stimulation and strengthening positive experiences. In a control-group study design, data was collected from 19 participants of the training group and 11 participants of a (waiting) control group. Data collection was carried out before and after the training. In the pre-post comparison the training group shows a reduction of symptoms in general and especially in somatization, obsessive-compulsiveness, anxiety, and paranoid ideation. The participants showed improvements in quality of life in the areas of capability, ability to enjoy and relax, positive and negative mood. In respect of attitudes of competence and control they showed improvements in internal control attitudes. Also, as regards illness coping and prevalent coping styles, active and problem-oriented coping styles were found to have increased to some extent. In the problem solving training, 84.2% of the participants stated in their self-ratings that they had been able to achieve positive changes in a specific problem area. From a methodological angle it has to be pointed out that the study had examined a very small group.

However, there is a lack of evaluated diagnostic instruments for determination of an indication for and evaluation of specific work-related interventions. This article presents an analysis of the diagnostic quality of work-related self-rating instruments as well as their evaluation from a practical perspective. 281 psychosomatic inpatients showing high levels of occupational stress were studied using a set of work-related questionnaires on admission: individual coping skills (AVEM), work-related therapy motivation (FBTM), work satisfaction (ABB), leisure activities, experienced control at work, as well as occupational concerns and social stressors at work. Furthermore a sub-group of 78 patients who had completed a specific work-related group programme during their inpatient treatment were interviewed three months post-treatment. The instruments used were examined for reliability, underlying dimensions (factor analysis), health relevance (correlations with the SCL-90-R total score GSI as health-related external criterion), and sensitivity to change. (1) Reliability: Measuring procedures fulfilled the requirements of measurement accuracy. (2) Underlying dimensions: Factor-analytical investigations of relevant occupational constructs identified six aspects of occupational coping relevant for rehabilitation practice: \"occupational resilience\", \"occupational (over-)commitment\", \"occupational gratification\", \"well-being at work\", a motivational factor of \"occupational identification vs. withdrawal\", and \"leisure activities\". (3) Health relevance: Variables of \"occupational resilience\" and \"occupational gratification\" showed the highest correlations with indicators of psychosomatic health. (4) Sensitivity to change: Work-related instruments proved to be predominantly sensitive to change. The work-related self-report instruments proved satisfactorily in application with psychosomatic patients.

The Institute of Hospital Management (IKM) in a multi-centre study promoted by Deutsche Rentenversicherung Bund and Deutsche Rentenversicherung Westfalen is conducting a study regarding potential diversion of healthcare expenditures from acute care towards rehabilitation as a result of DRG introduction in Germany. For documentation of potential short-term changes in patient populations and patient streams, extensive data have been collected in the first two phases in 2003\/04 and 2005\/06 for a total of 1342 cardiologic and orthopaedic patients. Indication-specific comparison of the two phases showed significantly shorter stays in the acute sector as well as shorter transition times between the sectors, resulting in an intake of patients into rehabilitative care at an earlier stage of their recovery process. Significant diversion of treatment efforts from the acute to the rehabilitative sector, regarding increased nursing effort and potential changes in the therapeutic and medical treatment to be provided, has not been proven as yet. The increase in wound problems expected by practitioners was confirmed in the orthopaedic area by an increasing number of wound healing disturbances and haematomas; in bypass-patients, an increasing number of pericardium and pleura bruises was found. The analyses performed on the data collected revealed no limitations in the patients' ability to participate in rehabilitative measures when the first and the second phase of the study are compared. To be able to depict the further course and interdependencies of changes, continuous systematic observation of developments would be desirable. To ascertain a lasting impact of DRG implementation at least a third study-phase will be necessary, which should be placed at the end of 2008, at the time when the DRG convergence phase will end.","845":"With introduction of the new Federal Medical Licensing Regulations (Approbationsordnung) in Germany, integrated teaching in \"Rehabilitation, Physical Medicine, Naturopathic Treatment\" (Querschnittsbereich Q12) has become obligatory for the first time.

The Project Group has developed a quality assurance concept for the outcome quality of sociomedical evaluations with personal examination and for evaluations on the basis of medical records.

The primary criteria are: plausibility and conclusiveness, reproducibility, neutrality; the particular criteria are: formal and content programming, medical-scientific foundations, understandability, completeness, transparency, and efficiency. Both, the primary and the particular criteria are operationalized through examination questions. To fulfill a primary quality criterion, all related examination questions have to be answered in the affirmative. The particular criteria are related using a scoring system. The quality assurance programme also provides for a peer-review procedure; however, the manual for this procedure has yet to be developed. Research projects will be needed to determine the methodological requirements that have to be fulfilled for the proposed peer review procedure. Prior to implementation of the programme with the financially responsible pension insurance agencies it will be necessary to estimate the amount of time and manpower involved.","847":"Rehabilitation in Germany is an important sector of the medical system. Rehabilitation need of insurees who claim rehabilitation benefits is assessed by the financially responsible agency (mostly pension funds). Legal regulations allow little time for this decision so insurers aim at making decisions from the records only. Information on the specific case often is however insufficient. Self-administered questionnaires have been employed in the past to remedy that problem. In this article typical problems are illustrated which arise when administering additional questionnaires to assist the assessment, and solutions for these problems are shown. Important questions concern the instruments that should be used, technical problems of computer-aided assessment and processing of the data, and possible legal objections. Also, general problems and limitations of the approach are discussed.","848":"For sociomedical assessment on application for medical rehabilitation by the German Statutory Pension Insurance no valid diagnostic assessment tools exist. In the present study two expert surveys and current guidelines were used to develop an algorithm of decision-making which is based on 13 criteria for rehabilitation need. The algorithm was evaluated in a prospective, longitudinal survey in the sociomedical services of five Bavarian Statutory Pension Insurance agencies on a sample of applicants with primary musculoskeletal disease (n=243). The medical experts rated the criteria after they had made their decision on the applications. To examine validity of the algorithm, concordance with the medical expert decisions and individual need for rehabilitation was analyzed. Respectively results of the algorithm were compared with data in course of the measure (rating by the clinician, patient questionnaire). Analyzing data, there is evidence for problems in rating the criteria by assessment on medical records; on average 9.2 (s=2.4) of 13 criteria could be rated. There is statistically significant concordance between decisions by the algorithm and sociomedical decisions based on assessment of medical records (kappa=0.37, p&lt;0.001) or examination (kappa=0.71, p&lt;0.001). Applications with positive recommendation by the algorithm have a significantly higher degree of subjective rehabilitation need (d=0.38). The results illustrate the need for measures to improve the basis of information by medical records. By reason of heterogeneity in practical application of criteria for rehabilitation need, operationalisation and explicit diagnostic algorithms are necessary to improve objectivity of making decisions.","849":"In earlier studies the lack of correlation between subjective need for rehabilitation of the applicant and the medically determined objective need for rehabilitation was reported again and again. The correlation between fatigue and subjective need for rehabilitation was not yet examined so far. Nevertheless fatigue is not defined sufficiently in the ICD, so interactions between chronic fatigue and somatic diseases are not taken into account appropriately. The following questions are considered: How high is the degree of chronic fatigue in insurees applying for rehabilitation? Is there a correlation between degree of fatigue and need for rehabilitation? Is it possible to predict approval of medical rehabilitation by fatigue and need for rehabilitation? How will insurees accept a screening accompanying their application for rehabilitation? The study is based on data of 500 (response rate 85.6%) insurees of the pension insurance Braunschweig-Hannover, who had applied for medical rehabilitation between 1\/2004 and 3\/2004. The screening instrument included: scales on functional activity, mobility, social support, coping (IRES), the Chalder Fatigue Scale, SCL 14, Items concerning need for rehabilitation. As statistical methods t-, chi (2)-test, correlations, covariance-analysis and regression analysis are used. 70.2% of the patients claiming rehabilitation reported relevant clinical symptoms of chronic fatigue. There were no differences in age, work status, motivation, or expectations of returning to work, but differences in sex. Patients with chronic fatigue met more citeria of need for rehabilitation. But the approval of medical rehabilitation could not be predicted by fatigue and need for rehabilitation. Nevertheless the acceptance of the screening was high in the insurees. Patients with chronic fatigue met more criteria of need for rehabilitation. But the approval of medical rehabilitation could not be predicted by fatigue and need for rehabilitation. We assume that the reduction of activity and participation is associated with the degree of fatigue. It is discussed that the information an investigator may derive from a screening which is accepted by the insurees claiming medical rehabilitation will complete the collected clinical documents in a meaningful manner.

The IREPRO List of Indicators offers a systematic scheme for the sociomedical exploration and evaluation of the prognosis for reintegration and the need for rehabilitation in claimants for disability pension due to mental illness. A set of ten indicators was defined and its practical use tested in an expert-based process of development. In a manual each indicator is thoroughly described in a standardized manner including a five-point rating scale. In a profile sheet the ratings of all ten indicators are visualized, appropriate therapeutical and rehabilitative means are assigned, and the final judgement of prognosis is deduced. At present the IREPRO List of Indicators offers a good tool to structure the process of decision making and contributes to enhancing transparency and uniformity of the process. It can also be used to discuss cases among colleagues. The basic principle can be transferred to other fields of sociomedical expert opinion-building. The article describes requirements and difficulties in psychiatric disability assessment, the list of indicators and experiences gained from the process of development.","851":"The CEBRA project aimed at developing a computer aided procedure by which applications for rehabilitation can be assessed according to uniform and transparent criteria so that the applications together with a recommendation for decision-making can be transferred to the sociomedical services for final decision. For this, we first analyzed the existing manuals and guidelines for assessing applications for rehabilitation with the aim of identifying the main criteria, and then to translate them into measurable parameters. We then developed questionnaires for physicians treating the applicants as well as for the applicants themselves. Finally, algorithms were defined which compress the various combinations of these parameters into a recommendation for decision-making. Between October 2004 and March 2005, a pilot study was performed which ran parallel to the normal processes of decision-making by the insurance administration. In the pilot study, 436 applications were included for which questionnaires were available both from a physician and an applicant. The recommendations given by the CEBRA programme were finally compared with the decisions that had in fact been made by the administration in these cases. The results of the pilot study showed that the algorithms employed are capable of distinguishing very clearly and in a meaningful way between applicants with only minor medical problems and disabilities, on the one hand, and with medium or severe problems on the other. The comparison with the administrative decisions in these cases showed a similar rate of approval (80%) in both procedures. This means that the CEBRA programme does not change the general rate of approval. With respect to the individual cases, however, the comparisons revealed no statistically significant concordance between the two procedures. Reasons for this finding may result from the fact that--even though the same persons were compared--the information underlying the CEBRA recommendations or the administrative decisions, respectively, were not the same and may in fact have been quite different. In sum, we conclude that the CEBRA programme can very well improve the basis of information as well as the objectivity of making decisions on applications for rehabilitation.","852":"The present article provides an overview of principles and standards for diagnostic decisions and evaluation. Assessment aims to answer concrete questions. Clinical and statistical judgements represent two strategies for the integration of diagnostic information. It is illustrated that the hit-rate is closely linked to validity, base-rate, and selection-rate. Depending on the psychological question it might be necessary to either detect many \"appropriate\" or reject many \"inappropriate\" persons (sensitivity-specificity). In the case of multiple criteria three strategies are available, for which adequate practical applications are proposed. As far as the assessment process is concerned, recommendations are available for hypothesis-guided data collection and integration. As a special assessment problem simulation\/aggravation is discussed. A listing of quality aspects shows how to identify good evaluations. Finally, procedures to maintain a high quality are recommended.","853":null,"854":"","855":"Often it is reported in medical studies that an expected effect could not be detected. This may be the case if the sample size had been too small to detect an effect which actually exists. This often is due to the fact that sound sample size estimation had been omitted prior to the study outset. As a result, it is not known how many persons should have been involved in the study to detect this effect if present. On the other hand, if sample size estimation has not been realized, more persons than needed might be included in the study. This is problematic for economic and in particular for ethical reasons. The aim of this paper is to point out the principles of sample size estimation as well as to emphasize its importance not only in general but also in medical rehabilitation research.","856":"After discharge from inpatient psychosomatic rehabilitation patients often face problems to transfer and stabilize the modifications they have achieved in the clinic. Using targeted outpatient aftercare interventions up to eight weeks after discharge from the inpatient programme we tried to support this transfer, thus enhancing treatment effectiveness. The evaluation was carried out as a field experiment. Patients were matched into pairs and then allocated randomly to either a control or an experimental condition. The experimental group, which had participated in specific aftercare measures after inpatient therapy, was compared to the control group at \"discharge from clinic\" and \"twelve weeks post-discharge\" relative to a number of variables relevant in therapy outcome. Twelve weeks post-discharge patients who had participated in aftercare measures show significantly better progress relative to their physical and psychological complaints than patients in the control group. Also, they are more capable of coping with psychosocial demands of their everyday life. They experience better control of their symptoms and they are more successful in attaining the goals they have set for themselves for the time after discharge. The findings show that supplementing psychosomatic inpatient rehabilitation with specific aftercare measures will lead to better transfer and to increased effectiveness of psychosomatic rehabilitation. Also on account of our results, outpatient rehab aftercare programmes have in the meantime become a regular component of inpatient psychosomatic rehabilitation in Germany. ","857":"Patients who are referred to psychosomatic inpatient rehabilitation are mostly suffering from long-term illnesses. Therefore, it is necessary to take pre- and post-treatment into account. Epidemiological questions are frequency and type of pre- and post-treatment and their relation to course and outcome of rehabilitation. Pre-treatment, recommendations for follow-up treatment, and course of treatment in 1284 patients of the department of behaviour therapy and psychosomatics of the rehabilitation centre Seehof were assessed. Before admission, 75.4 % of patients had been in psychiatric treatment, and 31.3 % had received psychotherapy. The inpatient stay was significantly longer in patients with psychiatric pre-treatment and those with a combination of psychiatric treatment and psychotherapy. These patients were more often unemployed and showing an insufficient social network. Pre-treatment was unrelated to changes in the SCL-90-R, to physician ratings of therapeutic outcome or the ability to work at the end of rehabilitation. Patients pre-treated by a general practitioner, psychiatrist or psychotherapist returned to that therapeutic setting after rehabilitation. Patients only treated by general practitioners were referred to specialist treatment. These data show the need to integrate inpatient rehabilitation in long-term pre- and post-treatment. One effect of inpatient rehabilitation is to optimize treatment. This requires good communication across different areas of health care.","858":"To analyse the frequency and circumstances of falls in an inpatient rehabilitation centre. In a survey all falls reported to the Austrian accident insurance carrier were analysed and external circumstances of falls were evaluated. The survey covers a period of 64 months (Jan 2000 to April 2005): 10 820 inpatients (234 502 patient days); mean age 52.8 years; 1,252 patients aged &gt;\/= 70 years; 47 % male, 53 % female. Of 223 accidents registered, 140 (62.8 %) were falls. Of these, 17 patients had to be referred to a surgical unit for further treatment. In total, 1.29 % of all patients fell during their stay (with report to the accident insurance carrier), 0.16 % suffered major injuries from falls (with referral to surgical unit). Females fell more frequently than males. 39 % of the falls were associated with physical therapy. Most falls occurred in daytime. The location in the centre or the day of week showed no major influence on the frequency of falls. Falls occurred slightly more often in the first part of the three-week inpatient stay. The high total number of falls shows that falls are important in an inpatient rehabilitation centre for rheumatic and orthopaedic diseases. The analysis did not reveal any special location inside the rehabilitation centre with an increased risk of falls calling for urgent interventions. The active and activating physical therapies do not seem to increase the number of falls significantly. ","859":"The need for standardized and unified performance capacity assessment in orthopedic rehabilitation has led to the attempt to use an existing standardized procedure. Graduated disease features have been defined which are relevant for work and their effects on performance capacity been formulated as rules. In this way so-called disease-conditioned performance capacities are obtained which help to identify problems in carrying out various activities. These activities can be directly assessed using tests. Appropriate tests are listed in a table.","860":"In view of a frequently poor success rate of rehabilitation programmes in patients with low back pain, a specific intervention programme was developed addressing the subgroup of patients with endurant pain coping behaviour and evaluated within a research project sponsored by the National federation of pension insurers, VDR. In terms of a control group design with 4 points of measurement (beginning and end of rehabilitation, 6- and 12-months follow-up), an intervention group (n = 163) was compared to a control group (standard programme of an orthopaedic rehabilitation clinic, n = 252). Data were collected using the KSI, BDI, IRES, FFbH-R and a pain questionnaire. Subjects were blue-collar insurants, aged 46 on average with a pain history of 9.6 years. Findings show a stronger reduction of pain intensity and strain, significant enhancement of functional capacity as well as a greater decrease of sick leave days and pension requests. These results are presented over the course of the 4 points of measurement as well as in relation to the intervention programme, which focuses on the endurant pain coping behaviour. The consequences of implementing such therapy components into standard rehabilitation programmes are discussed.","861":null,"862":"Responsibility at company level for the employment of workers with health-related problems or disabilities has increased, inter alia because of integration management at company level according to section 84 (2) of the German Social Code Book IX. Although several recommendations exist, no standard is available for auditing and certification. Such a standard could be a basis for granting premiums according to section 84 (3) of Book IX of the German Social Code. AUDIT AND CERTIFICATION: One product of the international \"disability management\" movement is the \"Consensus Based Disability Management Audit\" (CBDMA). The Audit is a systematic and independent measurement of the effectiveness of integration management at company level. CBDMA goals are to give evidence of the quality of the integration management implemented, to identify opportunities for improvement and recommend appropriate corrective and preventive action. In May 2006, the integration management of Ford-Werke GmbH Germany with about 23 900 employees was audited and certified as the first company in Europe. STANDARD OF INTEGRATION MANAGEMENT AT COMPANY LEVEL: In dialogue with corporate practitioners, the international standard of CBDMA has been adapted, completed and verified concerning its practicability. Process orientation is the key approach, and the structure is similar to DIN EN ISO 9001:2000. Its structure is as follows: (1) management-labour responsibility (goals and objectives, program planning, management-labour review), (2) management of resources (disability manager and DM team, employees' participation, cooperation with external partners, infrastructure), (3) communication (internal and external public relations), (4) case management (identifying cases, contact, situation analysis, planning actions, implementing actions and monitoring, process and outcome evaluation), (5) analysis and improvement (analysis and program evaluation), (6) documentation (manual, records).","863":"","864":"In a descriptive study, 122 construction industry workers were treated in an especially workplace-oriented inpatient rehabilitation measure. Effects were assessed by written questionnaires using the SF-36 questionnaire, the questionnaire for employees self-assessment (FBS) and further standardized instruments for job strain and demand at time intervals of 0, 4 and 13 months from rehabilitation participation. Along with high rehabilitation satisfaction, improvement of quality of life and decreasing disability complaints are reported, which keep stable and significant for at least one year and thus are indicators of sustainable rehabilitation success.","865":"Chronic exhaustion and fatigue are increasingly important in rehabilitation medicine. Objectives of this study were (a) to describe the effects of in-patient rehabilitation on patients with chronic fatigue syndromes, (b) to identify predictors for treatment outcome, and (c) to analyze the impact of comprehensive diagnosing on these issues. A total of 171 patients with chronic exhaustion or fatigue (90 % female, mean age 55 +\/- 10 yrs) from a rehabilitation hospital with a complementary medicine-based treatment concept were included in a prospective observational study. Within the longitudinal study patients were examined three times (on admission to hospital, at discharge as well as six months later). Participation rate of the postal inquiry was 69 %. Besides items constructed ad hoc, Patient questionnaires included the Symptom Checklist and assessment instruments for depression, quality of life, sense of coherence as well as for changes in experience and behaviour. Treatment outcome was defined as sum score of binary-coded response criteria. The pattern of complaints differed clearly between diagnostic subgroups (neurasthenia, affective disorders, adjustment disorders) before treatment. At discharge from hospital patients showed clinically relevant improvements lasting for six months after rehabilitation. Multiple regression analyses revealed a statistically significant relationship (R (mult) = 0.59) between predictors and outcome at discharge from hospital. A better result was associated with higher trust in treatment success, active information seeking on complementary medicine, healthier feeding habits, better somatic health and a decreased mental status, with regard to the status before treatment. The prediction of outcome after six months was comparably poorer (R (mult) = 0.42). Treatment success was higher in the absence of a diagnosis of neurasthenia, in patients accepting the group-oriented treatment concept and in patients not believing that their disease was due to their own way of living. Trust in the success of the treatment was a highly ranked predictor for longer lasting outcome, too. The results underline the importance of motivation aspects for treatment outcome indicating that individual expectations and attitudes should be considered in a more distinct way when allocating patients to rehabilitative programmes.","866":"Urinary incontinence following stroke is an extensive problem for the patients and their relatives that influences the well-being and care in the future. There are a lot of therapeutic interventions available, their effectiveness, however, is not known in detail. For rehabilitation practice the ongoing question is how Urinary Incontinence (UI) can best be treated in a way that the patients daily life is not compromised. The search for clinical trials was carried out in PubMed, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library, restricted to German and English papers published between 1989 and April 2005. Medical, nursing and physiotherapeutic interventions for treating UI after stroke were described and analysed. The clinical trials were divided into process-oriented trials and those looking at individual interventions. The process trials could be divided into three different groups with an overall success of 82-95 %, 50-56 % and 23-36 % respectively. Behavioral methods (caregiver-induced, patient-active and other interventions) and medical interventions are available. The studies of the most successful group include staff education and application of interventions based on an assessment procedure and a guideline. No clinical trial on individual interventions reached a result like the process-oriented studies. For treating urinary incontinence a multimodal approach is necessary: special education of the nurses, applying and acting in a problem-solving process, for example in the Rehabilitation Cycle and delivering care based on an assessment procedure and guidelines. Development of a guideline for treating urinary incontinence after stroke can be recommended. Further research in the efficacy of individual interventions is needed. ","867":"Psychotherapists are considered to be sceptical of empirical measures of quality assurance. It is generally recognised that the success of these measures mainly depends on how they are accepted by the people involved. The acceptance of a quality monitoring system among psychotherapists was investigated with a standardised assessment instrument. Practical relevance and practicability of the system were judged positively on the following dimensions: \"support of clinical diagnostics\", \"examination of the outcome\", \"reflecting on the therapeutic process\", \"documentation\", \"integration in the therapeutic process\", \"pressure to succeed and control\" and \"work loading\". The factors \"professional experience\", \"profession\" and \"sex\" had just a small influence on the degree of acceptance of the quality monitoring system. Psychotherapists consider a practically relevant and economical quality monitoring system as useful. ","868":"The \"Quality Community Medical Rehabilitation\" (QGmR) is a voluntary association of several rehabilitation clinics in Schleswig-Holstein. The QGmR is closely oriented along the quality assurance programme of the national pension insurance scheme. As local initiative its emphasis lies in patient outcomes. The patients of the QGmR were interviewed twice (pre-post: before and four months after rehabilitation), and all patients were included consecutively during a defined period of time. After a pilot phase the main study of the QGmR was accomplished between 2002 and 2004. Twenty Schleswig-Holstein rehabilitation clinics with six diagnostic groups and a total of 3094 patients participated (2026 at both points of measurement). The majority of the patients interviewed were orthopaedic patients, and the smallest number were patients with heart disease and neurologic conditions. Most patients showed clearly health-related impairments before rehabilitation compared with population-referred data, four months after rehabilitation patients showed significant improvements in all health-related parameters. In addition to health improvement the patients showed a high satisfaction with all areas of the rehabilitation treatment and processes they were asked to judge (administration, therapy, care) independent of diagnostic group or rehabilitation clinic. But, also independent of diagnostic group and clinic, there were clear deficits in the field of post-rehabilitative treatment. Some of the results varied according to diagnostic group and clinic. The results of a comparison between the clinics showed some differences to the effect that some clinics were better than others, but these differences were not very large although statistically significant in a few cases. Nevertheless the \"best\" can be determined, which could motivate the clinics to participate in regular quality assurance working groups.","869":"With the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, ICF and its adoption by the World Health Organization in May 2001, the concept of \"functional health\" reached a new dimension. Prepared and developed further over many years, the concept of a comprehensive and internationally consented classification system completed the shifting of paradigm in our notion of disease and disablement, bringing along far-reaching consequences for theory and practice in particular in rehabilitation. Symbolizing this paradigmatic shift, destigmatization, resource orientation, context factors, and participation are among the central notions of the concept. The ICF is a foundation for seeking international agreement across the bounds of disciplines and is amidst an intensive transfer and implementation process, also in Germany. Due to the multitude of actors and activities involved, it has become almost impossible even for those taking a strong interest in the matter to keep up with developments and fields of applications, let alone to achieve consensus in these respects. The German Society of Rehabilitation Sciences therefore initiated a problem-oriented stocktaking of the present situation. This article seeks to point out a number of important developments and trends in order to provide initial orientation and overview. The stocktaking is intended to contribute to further disseminating the ICF, at the same time however to outline several crucial fields of application and development. To be continued and deepened, this preliminary stocktaking underlines several core developments along with a number of conceptual issues still unresolved for the time being. Notwithstanding a high degree of acceptance of the concepts underlying the ICF, continued and, as far as possible, coordinated efforts toward implementation will be required at all levels.","870":"","871":"","872":"","873":"This article describes the utility of factor analysis in the context of developing questionnaires for clinical use in rehabilitation. The basic principles of both exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis are presented in order to give the necessary knowledge for choosing between both concepts. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses complement one another, and there is a place for both in the process of questionnaire development. Finally, the potential use of factor analysis for scaling procedures as well as intercultural validity studies is outlined.","874":"Questionnaires measuring patients' subjective health or health-related quality of life are indispensable tools for the evaluation of effects revealed by intervention studies in the field of medical rehabilitation. These patient-reported outcomes should appropriately reflect change over time. Unfortunately, \"sensitivity to change\" has so far not been adequately examined for German health-related quality of life questionnaires, especially not in a comparative way. Therefore, indices of sensitivity to change for three widespread generic assessment tools have been determined: IRES-3, SF-36, scales of the SCL-90-R. A prospective comparative study was conducted in n = 1145 inpatients with orthopaedic\/rheumatologic and cardiac diseases from 16 rehabilitation clinics. All patients received usual care. Their subjective health-status was assessed at two to four weeks before admission (t0), admission (t1), discharge (t2), and three months after discharge (t3). At each time point, they completed the IRES-3, SF-36, and relevant scales of the SCL-90-R. For the time interval t1-t2, Guyatt's responsiveness index (GRI) was calculated and compared across scales and instruments. Virtually all GRI coefficients for scales and aggregated scores, respectively, reached statistical significance. With respect to the GRI distributions of the diagnostic groups, most coefficients were located in a middle to upper range. While the results for the scales do not clearly indicate which assessment instrument should be preferred, GRI coefficients for higher aggregated scores suggest the IRES-3 to be most sensitive to change. These results can be helpful in selecting a health-related quality of life instrument or certain subscales for evaluation studies in the field of medical rehabilitation. ","875":"Ten years after its introduction, the German Pension Insurance's quality assurance programme is firmly established within the rehabilitation system. Regular, substantive reporting to rehabilitation centres and pension insurance organisations has contributed to improving the quality of rehabilitation. Legal codification of quality assurance stipulations has existed since 2001. The programme is in constant development, e. g. by optimization of patient interviewing and inclusion of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. New programmes, e. g. in inpatient rehabilitation of children and youths or in outpatient rehabilitation, are being developed together with the German health care organizations. In the field of vocational rehabilitation quality assurance had started out with a conceptual study followed by projects concerning client interviewing, evaluation of documentation instruments, and analyses relative to the most important outcome factor, namely the vocational reintegration results achieved. External quality assurance is a mayor input factor for the rehabilitation centres' internal quality management. In future, rehabilitation centres will be asked to demonstrate the appropriate use of this information. It will remain the centres' decision which method of quality management system implementation they choose. Quality assurance results of every centre are planned to be made publicly accessible in the medium term, in particular to the insureds. Moreover, the results of the quality assurance programmes are intended to clearly impact the allocation of patients as well as the remuneration of the rehabilitation centres concerned. Quality assurance and quality management will continue to play a major role in the political discussion of health care.","876":"In cooperation with the Federation of German Pension Insurance Institutes (VDR) and with the VfR Norderney e. V., the university of Witten\/Herdecke has developed a clinical guideline on medical rehabilitation for patients after lumbar disc surgery. Methodically, development of this guideline was based on the following three steps: (1) consideration of recent scientific literature, (2) analyses of structures and processes employed in rehab clinics, using consultations with clinic managers, with occupational groups involved in rehabilitation and analysis of patient files, as well as (3) the consensus process. One central result was the statement of substantial paucity of research on evidence for many therapeutic interventions used in orthopaedic rehabilitation of patients after lumbar disc surgery. Analyses and investigations in rehabilitation clinics showed a wide range of therapeutic interventions, used to very different extents. Development of the guideline therefore took place on the basis of consensus-based processes. Using formal consensus techniques according to recommendations of the Association of the scientific medical societies in Germany (AWMF), the guideline presented was developed in cooperation with the occupational groups involved in the rehabilitation process. Its structure focuses on the therapeutic targets, and it includes a clinical algorithm illustrating the orthopaedic rehabilitation process in a simple and understandable manner. The guideline presented is based on recent knowledge and corresponds to stage S2 of development. A further implementation project will evaluate practicability and acceptance of this guideline.","877":"Developed within the German Pension Insurance scheme's Guidelines programme, the Guideline for Rehabilitation in Coronary Artery Disease has been publicly available since January 2005. Pension Insurance routine data on the therapeutic benefits and services provided (based on the Classification of Therapeutic Procedures, KTL) were analyzed to assess the extent to which rehabilitation facilities had complied with Guideline requirements already in 2004. In January 2005, the results were disseminated together with the Guideline to the rehabilitation facilities which had participated in Pension Insurance rehabilitation of patients with coronary artery disease in 2004. In an accompanying survey information was requested concerning acceptability and applicability of the Guideline, of the presentation of KTL data, as well as reasons for non-adherence to Guideline requirements. In February 2005 a written, anonymous survey was conducted among 72 clinical directors of rehabilitation facilities. The survey instrument contained three standardized questionnaires covering the aspects cited above. The response rate was 73.6 % (n = 53). Descriptive analyses were performed. Views of the Guideline: The Guideline fulfils most of the seven quality attributes surveyed (completely fulfilled: 11.3-32.7 %, basically fulfilled: 49.1-64.2 %). Volume, structure and clarity of the guideline are judged to be \"very good\" by 62.3 %, 50.9 % and 36.5 % of the respondents. The KTL-procedure codes forming part of the Guideline to be used to assess guideline adherence, were considered appropriate by 88.5 % to 98 %. Consent to Guideline requirements varies between 80.8 and 34.6 %. Views of the audit feedback based on KTL-data: Depending on the various data table types, 37.7 % to 20.0 % of the respondents stated that the tables should remain unchanged in future evaluations. 28.0 % to 39.0 % consider the tables to be very useful for quality management. Reasons for non-adherence to Guideline recommendations: according to the clinicians, the most important reason for deviation from Guideline requirements is incomplete or incorrect coding of therapeutic procedures. The Guideline for Rehabilitation in Coronary Artery Disease basically fulfils the formal, methodological and content-related quality criteria considered to be most relevant by the clinical directors. As expected, the greatest need for discussion is focussed on the actual Guideline requirements. Form and content of the KTL-feedback are well accepted, and the feedback itself is considered relevant for everyday practice. The main reason given for non-adherence to guideline requirements (i. e., inaccurate coding) should not be overstated as the KTL-analyses was based on data from 2004, when the guideline had not yet been published. The Guideline for Rehabilitation in Coronary Artery Disease is acceptable and practicable, and it is moreover tied in with external quality assurance activities in place (i. e., the quality assurance programme of the statutory Pension Insurance scheme). The audit feedback given in this framework provides rehabilitation facilities participating in the programme not only with comparative analyses but also with input for their internal quality management actions. Future activities within the external quality assurance programme should inter alia focus on more targeted implementation activities and repeated KTL-based appraisals. ","878":"The present article outlines the challenges in occupational rehabilitation arising from the successive erosion of the financial foundations of the welfare system, from changes in industry as well as in health, education and labour-market policy. Five perspectives are discussed to design and develop strategies in occupational rehabilitation. Among these are: (1) Rehabilitation in companies is mostly based on miscarried efforts to prevent separation. The discontinuance and the re-integration in a position or in a company have therefore to be regarded as an interlocking process between vocational training centre, social insurance agencies and employers; (2) Regional vocational rehabilitation centres with the objective to promote participation in work life may advance to institutionalized junctions to connect the rehabilitation landscape and would represent the logistic context; (3) The development of participation benefits should mainly be directed towards individualized allocation of resources as well as the possibility of direct transfer to work in close cooperation with employers; (4) Structural solutions and process-innovation could be supported by application-orientated research; (5) A new consensus to assign future tasks and objectives should be defined among the responsible bodies and service organisations involved in occupational rehabilitation.","879":"","880":"","881":"","882":"","883":"Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) report a significant impact of their symptoms on functional health. In outcome assessment of clinical studies on IBS, however, functional aspects other than gastrointestinal symptoms seem to be disregarded to a great extent. To analyze the content of outcome measures used in clinical IBS trials. A systematic review was performed in terms of a quantitative content analysis using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) as a coding scheme. Outcome measures were selected from all randomized controlled trials on IBS published in PubMed from the beginning to April 2002. From the outcome measures pre-specified text passages, so-called coding units, were extracted and linked to the ICF. A coding unit had to describe a single health aspect or an internal or external factor with an impact on health. If the outcome measure was a test the goal of the test was semantically implicated. Only second-level ICF categories contained in the outcome assessment of at least 10 % of the studies were considered. All steps of the review were performed by three independent raters. 99 studies were included. Single items were used as outcome measures in 88, clinical and paraclinical tests in 42 and questionnaires in 24 studies. Ninety percent of the coding units (n = 2271) could be linked to the ICF. ICF categories describing gastrointestinal symptoms were considered in the outcome assessment of 37 to 85 studies depending on the type of content compared to extra-gastrointestinal symptoms in 10 to 22 studies. Health information of ICF components other than \"body functions\" was scarcely included. Clear secular trends for individual ICF categories could not be found. Only a single IBS-specific questionnaire considered health information other than gastrointestinal symptoms. Outcome assessment of clinical IBS studies is mainly based on gastrointestinal symptoms. The assessment of other health aspects like comorbid psychological symptoms or social consequences of the disease seems to be similarly important and should be considered in future trials. This would also facilitate the understanding of IBS as a biopsychosocial health condition, both in matters of aetiology and consequences. ","884":"A work-related orientation within medical rehabilitation represents concepts with a stronger focus on the patient's individual vocational requirements and is based on different vocationally-orientated strategies of treatment. \"Medical Occupational Orientation\" (\"Medizinisch-berufliche Orientierung\", MBO), the model of Klinik Niedersachsen in Bad Nenndorf, places Functional Capacity Evaluation according to Susan Isernhagen (EFL) at the centre of rehabilitation diagnostics and therapy. This study investigates the effects of the MBO model relative to activities and vocational participation of patients with musculoskeletal disorders faced with vocational problems and on management at the interface between medical and vocational rehabilitation. Presented are findings of a randomized follow-up study aimed at evaluating the MBO model. A total of 494 patients of LVA Westfalen, a regional insurance agency, took part. A need for MBO was diagnosed for 222 patients. These patients were randomly assigned either to the MBO model of treatment (experimental group --&gt; U[+]) or to the conventional medical treatment (control group --&gt; K[+]). Patients without a need for MBO (U[-], K[-]) were treated likewise. The written questionings took place at the beginning (t (1)) and end of rehabilitation (t (2)), as well as six (t (3)) and twelve months (t (4)) after the patients' discharge. Currently, the results are based on the 6-month follow-up. Concerning the activities, an MBO-related effect in the experimental group (U[+]) has been found for the Pain Disability Index (PDI), effect sizes being d (u+) = 0.82; d (k+) = 0.17. The risk of unemployment six months after rehabilitation is decreased for MBO(+) patients who participated in the MBO model. In addition, the clinic can make effective prognosis concerning subsequent participation in vocational rehabilitation for both experimental groups (U[+], U[-]). Established for the first time in a randomized controlled trial, the findings presented show that patients with musculoskeletal disorders who are faced with particular vocational problems will achieve significantly better results concerning activities and vocational reintegration if their medical rehabilitation had been based upon an EFL-centred MBO approach.","885":null,"886":"In light of the growing age of the population in Germany and worldwide as well as the increasing of chronic diseases, there can be no doubt about the importance of medical rehabilitation. Yet the unbalanced proportions of treatment (costs), effectiveness and efficiency have been discussed critically in the past. The Statutory Pension Insurance scheme responded to this imbalance with a comprehensive quality assurance programme. Furthermore, a nation-wide Rehabilitation Research Funding Programme was established. Still missing, however, are transfer of scientific results into practice and a quality assurance programme that focuses on outcomes and effectiveness. In 2001, in Schleswig-Holstein, a \"Medical Rehabilitation Quality Community\" was initiated. The Community aims are a higher level of transparency of rehabilitation treatment procedures, providing proof of effects on patient outcomes, and comparison of effects achieved in different rehabilitation clinics, based on patient surveys. After completion of funded pre- and main phases, the Medical Rehabilitation Quality Community will be continued on a self-initiative and self-financing basis. In this paper, procedures and feasibility of the project are described. The main empirical results (outcomes, patient satisfaction, treatment after rehabilitation, n = 2026, and indication related benchmarking) will be presented in a subsequent article.","887":"On account of the \"rehabilitation sciences\" research funding programme of the German federal research ministry and the statutory German Pension Insurance scheme, as well as an extensive Pension Insurance quality assurance programme, major scientific progress has been achieved in rehabilitation in terms of structures, processes and outcomes. Continuing the systematic assessment and evaluation of the increasing knowledge available, the German Pension Insurance scheme has introduced a comprehensive practice guidelines programme for the development of process guidelines in rehabilitation. In the framework of this sponsored programme and exemplary for the field of cancer rehabilitation, practice guidelines are also being developed for the rehabilitation of breast cancer patients. This article summarises the results of the first phase of this project, which had included a systematic literature analysis of the interventions in the rehabilitation of breast cancer patients, an analysis aimed at verifying whether these interventions had been evidence-based as well as at deriving specific recommendations for treatment in the framework of in-patient rehabilitation. The existing national and international guidelines for the treatment of breast cancer were analysed for this purpose, and a systematic search of the established literature databases (Medline, Psyndex, PsycINFO, CINAHL, DIMDI and EBMR) was carried out. Both ambulatory and in-patient interventions were included, whereas diagnostic, medical and nursing procedures as well as drug trials were excluded from the analysis. In all, some 200 articles have eventually been extracted for systematic analysis from a total of 480,317 articles. The articles were analysed and evaluated according to the Oxford Level of Evidence. Various interventions for breast cancer patients could be validated as treatment modules by this literature analysis, such as: relaxation techniques, physiotherapy, sport therapy, massage, lymph drainage, psycho-social counselling and therapies as well as artistic therapies. There are considerable differences among the modules with respect to their various levels of evidence. Whereas good levels of evidence could be found for relaxation techniques, sport therapy and psycho-social counselling and therapy, only a low level of evidence was found for lymph drainage and artistic therapies. In summary, it can be stated that different levels of evidence are applicable concerning the various interventions available in the rehabilitation of breast cancer patients. The next step ahead toward development of treatment guidelines will involve systematic consultations with experts in this field.","888":"Self-report questionnaires have become wide-spread and are an integral part in different fields of rehabilitation. However, it is still unclear to what extent the validity of the patients' reports is affected by motivational factors. How difficult is it for the patient to fill out questionnaires? What are the situational characteristics in which the patients fill them out? The present study aims to identify the situational, motivational and cognitive requisites of the respondents and to analyse possible impacts on the validity of self-reports. A total of n = 105 patients scheduled for inpatient rehabilitation were interviewed by means of a guided open-ended interview in the admission phase. It is a consecutive sample of all admissions in two rehabilitation clinics in Schleswig-Holstein, which provide each patient with a questionnaire to fill out prior to their stay. The analysis involved a description of statements (categories) that have been derived by content analysis based on the patient interviews. In addition, physicians rated various patients' characteristics at the end of their hospital stay. The participation rate of the patients was 95.5 %. Of all patients, 95 % filled out the questionnaires at home, 69 % without a break. 57 % of the patients interviewed had filled out the questionnaires by themselves without any help, another 22 % worked it through together with their partner or spouse. The extent of influence on the responses appeared to be dependent on the amount of help necessary. In a substantial number of patients the questionnaires were regarded as an \"official\" document that had to be worked through meticulously. Physicians attested 96 % of the patients to have provided honest reports with regard to personal characteristics, and 95 % to have shown a sufficient degree of willingness of self-disclosure. By and large the patients' perceptions of themselves fit with the perceptions the physician in 76 % of the patients from the physicians' point of view. All patients except one were attested a positive motivation to take part in rehabilitation activities in the clinic by the physician. In individual cases there were substantial deficits of cognitive capacities necessary to work through a questionnaire, as well as limitations in literacy. Four patients had insufficient mastery of the German language. The vast majority of the patients possessed sufficient motivational and cognitive prerequisites to provide valid self-reports. Patients with problems in responding asked partners or others for help, its impact on the self-reports being as yet not clear-cut. In individual cases it can not be ruled out that patients who think about early retirement provide distorted statements. ","889":"The object of this study was to investigate the connection between self-efficacy and socio-medical status as well as the connection between changes in both areas in patients with somatoform pain disorder. In the framework of a naturalistic design, a total of n = 316 patients with somatoform pain disorder were investigated at the beginning and end of psychosomatic in-patient rehabilitation regarding self-efficacy (Aachener Selbstwirksamkeitsfragebogen - ASF) and socio-medical status (application for pension, subjective need for pension, periods of sick leave, pain chronicity). The data were analysed by linear structural equation models in confirmatory factor analyses with cross validation. The postulated model for correlation between self-efficacy and socio-medical status at the beginning of the in-patient treatment could be confirmed and showed a significant correlation coefficient between both areas. The postulated model for correlation between changes in self-efficacy and socio-medical status from beginning to end of the in-patient treatment could also be confirmed and showed a high correlation coefficient between both areas. In patients with somatoform pain disorder self-efficacy showed a significant correlation with the socio-medical status. Moreover, high correlations were found between changes in both areas. The increase of self-efficacy should therefore be a major goal in all therapies. ","890":"An inpatient rehabilitation programme for HIV-infected patients is described. Since the early nineties some 1,200 patients with HIV infection have been treated in our internal and orthopaedic rehabilitation clinic. Beside internal and orthopaedic diagnostics, supporting compliance with antiretroviral therapy, motivating the patients for regular moderate exercises and specific nutritional counselling are major issues of the programme. From the psychological point of view, the patients are offered to aquire relaxation and stress coping techniques, to take part in non-smoking courses and to use individual psychological counselling in case of depression or panic. In addition, all HIV-infected patients are offered individual advice on their disease and necessary changes in lifestyle. Finally, the programme includes social medical evaluation and counselling. As the majority of the patients are still working or are of working age, evaluating the capacity for work and potential introduction of occupational rehabilitation measures are prominent. Almost 70 percent of the HIV-infected patients who had been treated in our clinic over the last few years were fully capable of returning to their previous occupation. Our experiences demonstrate that statements such as rehabilitation of AIDS patients being useless because of its missing prospects of success, are not up-to-date any longer. Since introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy many patients with HIV infection are able to return to their previous occupation if they receive the necessary medical und psychosocial support.","891":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of an in-hospital (stage I of rehabilitation) individualized motivation programme for life-style change on the cardiovascular risk factors of patients after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). 142 consecutive patients undergoing CABG because of coronary heart disease were divided into two groups. Group I received the usual care; Group II received the intervention (individual motivation programme). Medical variables concerning all cardiovascular risk factors and the current medication plan were evaluated on admission and one year after surgery. After 12 months significant reductions in systolic blood pressure (p = 0.002), LDL-cholesterol (p = 0.023) and triglyceride (p = 0.046) were found in the intervention group on comparison of the two groups. The HDL cholesterol improved in the intervention group and decreased slightly in the control group. Both groups showed an improvement in diastolic blood pressure, Body Mass Index, blood cholesterol and blood glucose values. The intervention did not show a significant influence on smoking and medication habits. An individualized motivation programme starting in the acute hospital may positively influence cardiovascular risk factors with ongoing success. ","892":"Investigation of the influence of an oncological inpatient rehabilitation programme on anxiety and depression in women with breast cancer. 198 women with breast cancer, aged 25 to 75 years, filled in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) German version at the beginning and end of inpatient rehabilitation. Focus was set on the frequency of anxiety and depression. Therefore proportions with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were built. The before-after comparison of HADS-scores was made using the signed rank test with two-sided level of significance of alpha = 5 %. In addition effect sizes were calculated. Possible relations between the scores at the beginning of rehabilitation and the patients' age or the interval since diagnosis were analysed by calculating correlation coefficients. At the beginning of rehabilitation a state of anxiety was probable in 23.2 % (CI [17.3 %; 29.1 %] of the women and one of depression in 9.1 % (CI [5.8 %; 13.9 %]). In other words, they reached a level of &gt;or= 11 score points on each scale. No correlation was found with the age of the patients or the time interval since diagnosis (|r| &lt;or= 0.192). At the end of rehabilitation 67.5 % (CI [61.0 %; 74.0 %]) and 60.9 % (CI [54.1 %; 67.7 %]), respectively, of the women showed an improvement of anxiety and depression. The before-after difference was a median + 2 points (anxiety) and + 1 point (depression), resp., with a positive value representing an improvement. The changes after rehabilitation were statistically significant with p &lt; 0.0001. The effect sizes ranged from 0.37 to 0.50. After the end of primary therapy, women with breast cancer frequently suffer from anxiety or depressive disorders, with no correlation to the patients' age or time since diagnosis. By an inpatient oncological rehabilitation programme both anxiety and depression can be improved very successfully. Whether these results represent a long-term effect is currently being evaluated in a randomised prospective study. ","893":"The present study had the objective of evaluating the psychometric characteristics of the shortened 16-item version of the German Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment questionnaire (XSMFA-D), which was designed for routine assessment of functional capacity in patients with various orthopaedic disorders treated either surgically or medically. A total of 382 patients from seven different samples with either osteoarthritis of the knee, osteoarthritis of the hip, rheumatoid arthritis or rotator cuff tear treated either in surgical hospitals or rehabilitation settings were assessed both before and after treatment. The XSMFA-D was compared with both questionnaires measuring similar constructs and widely accepted indicators of health status in musculoskeletal disorders. Psychometric characteristics were computed. The internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) exceeded 0.90 in most cases for the function index and was between 0.80 and 0.90 in most cases for the bother index of the XSMFA-D. Retest-reliability was between 0.80 and 0.95 for the function index and between 0.60 and 0.92 for the bother index. Correlations between the XSMFA-D subscales and the other questionnaires were substantial, showing construct validity. Criterion validity was also demonstrated as significant relationships with accepted external parameters such as function tests, judgements by physicians, pain self-ratings by patients and disease severity scores were found. Sensitivity to change was as high as for the other assessment instruments used in this study. The XSMFA-D, a very short assessment instrument, proved to be practical, reliable, valid and sensitive to change among the various patient samples studied. It may be recommended for the assessment of patients' state as well as the evaluation of treatments. ","894":null,"895":"","896":"Attention deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most frequent psychic disorders of childhood, characterized by high persistence and an increased risk for the development of externalising disorders of behavior. Due to ADHD increased problems can be frequently observed at school as well as in the social and emotional context of the child. Concepts for in-patient rehabilitation have not been developed, although effective modifications of the behavior of ADHD patients appeared to be achievable under the conditions found in in-patient rehabilitation. The present pilot study aimed to evaluate whether this newly developed concept has any benefit on psychological problems, coping and quality of life. In total, n = 28 boys with ADHD 7 to 12 years old were included into a quasi-experimental pre-post design and completed self-report questionnaires on psychological problems, coping and quality of life. In addition, 26 mothers evaluated the behavior problems, psychological problems and quality of life of their sons at the beginning and the end of in-patient rehabilitation. During a 4-week in-patient rehabilitation all children and their mothers took part in a multimodal training containing components of behavior therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy (self-instruction, self-management, and stress management), applied in child-, parent-child- and parent-centered interventions. Parents estimated the behavior problems of their children as significantly reduced after in-patient rehabilitation as compared to before. In addition, psychological problems and quality of life improved significantly in self- and parent-proxy reports during the in-patient rehabilitation. Our results support the hypothesis that this multimodal therapy concept is an effective tool for the treatment of ADHD patients. However, a replication of our results in a control-group study on a larger population is required. ","897":"Inpatient rehabilitation is an important contributor to the treatment of child and adolescent obesity with comorbidity in Germany. Thus far outpatient follow-up care has not been subject to research. The main goal of this study is the development and longer-term evaluation of a programme for structured outpatient follow-up care by primary care physicians after inpatient rehabilitation of obese children and adolescents. This multicentre, randomized, parallel controlled clinical trial enrolled 521 children and adolescents aged 9 - 16 (avg. 13.3) years in 7 cooperating specialized rehabilitation facilities. The patients were randomized at the end of their multimodal inpatient treatment that lasted for 5.9 (+\/- 1.2) weeks. The intervention consisted of 12 half-hour outpatient consultations by the primary care physicians utilizing a modular consultation guideline and an internet-based training programme. The control group received standard care. Outcome variables included anthropometric measures, questionnaires on eating behaviour, physical activity, quality of life, self-efficacy and subjective rating of the intervention. Measurements were performed at the beginning (t1) and end (t2) of inpatient rehabilitation as well as 6 (t3) and 12 (t4) months after discharge. There was a highly significant improvement of BMI-z-score (standard deviation score of the Body Mass Index), relevant behaviour, quality of life and self-efficacy between t1 and t4. On intention to treat analysis no differences were detected between intervention and control groups. The intervention was utilized by only 50 % of entitled. The BMI-z-score reached a minimum at t3 (6-month follow-up). Predictors of longer-term BMI-z-score decline were psychological suffering, poor eating behaviour, low physical activity and high socio-economic status. In multivariate linear regression improvement of eating behaviour and physical activity correlated with the improvement of BMI-z-score. This low-level outpatient intervention did not improve the demonstrated longer-term effectiveness of inpatient rehabilitation. An interdisciplinary outpatient follow-up care in groups with inclusion of the parents is recommended. ","898":"The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of the modular educational program for children with epilepsy and their parents (FAMOSES). This program was developed by an interdisciplinary project group to improve knowledge, coping, treatment outcome, emotional and practical adaptation to the condition. A prospective, controlled, multi-center, pre-post study design was used to examine the efficacy of the program in the treatment group compared to the waiting group (control group). Questionnaires included epilepsy specific scales regarding knowledge, attitudes, restrictions in daily living, epilepsy related fears, coping with the chronic disease and generic instruments (quality of life, KINDL). 55 parents of the treatment group completed the questionnaires three months before the course and three months later; the corresponding waiting group included 48 parents. Respectively, 31 children, who participated in the program, completed the questionnaires immediately before the course and three months later; the corresponding waiting group included 19 children. Children, who attended the program, showed improvements in the domains perceived restrictions (significant, medium effect size), absence from school and seizure frequency. Not significantly greater compared to the control group were the improvements of knowledge, attitudes and fears regarding to the epilepsy. Parents of the treatment group showed significant enhancements in epilepsy specific knowledge (large effect size), attitudes toward the epilepsy, management of epileptic seizures and significant reductions of fears and restrictions of their child with epilepsy (small to medium effect sizes). ","899":"The article presented is based on data of a multicenter study examining the effectiveness of an inpatient rehabilitation program for children and adolescents with asthma. The study took place from August 1996 to November 2001. It shows more noticeable long-term improvement of disease management and lung function parameters after in-patient rehabilitation (n = 226) than after out-patient rehabilitation programs (n = 92). The re-analysis of the data examines the influence of medication on these results. A decisive effect on treatment results for both in- and outpatients can be achieved by complying with the guidelines recommended by the medical societies. However, at the same time the results demonstrate that prescribing a correct treatment plan is not always sufficient. The significant improvement of outcome parameters (functional restriction, lung function, days absent from school, visits to a physician) of the rehabilitation group shows the importance of rehabilitation for teaching strategies for disease management and increase in compliance.","900":"So far, the routine programmes of the statutory pension and health insurance institutes for quality assurance in medical rehabilitation have not included facilities for children and adolescents. Thus, a conjoint project of the statutory pension and health insurance institutes to assess and to describe the structure quality of in-patient medical rehabilitation clinics for children and adolescents was initiated. The aim of the project was a survey and an analysis of the currently existing clinic structures and the development of criteria for an evaluation of the structure quality. The Institute of Medical Psychology, University of Hamburg and the Department of Quality Management and Social Medicine, University of Freiburg were engaged to conduct the project. A questionnaire was developed in a multi-stage process with expert involvement which covers general information, characteristics of structure quality as well as structure affiliated process characteristics of clinics. The survey was planned as a cross-sectional study. Data collection was accomplished from 1.12.2004 - 15.3.2005. A total of n = 177 facility addresses were available. The return rate was 83.3 %. Eventually, n = 79 facilities were included in the analysis. In sum, the results underline the heterogeneity of services in the field of child and adolescent rehabilitation. The results allow an analysis of the current clinic structures as well as a first comparison of clinics on the basis of the assessed structure characteristics. ","901":"In recent years a significant increase in most chronic mental and physical illnesses among children and adolescents was reported. Thus, medical child and adolescent rehabilitation plays a major role. Therefore, early diagnosis and multimodal intervention in childhood and adolescence is necessary, to prevent a chronic course of disease. Patient education programs have been shown to be effective in the treatment of chronic illnesses. Those programs are mostly aimed to improve the compliant behavior and disease management. Consecutively, the health status and quality of life should be improved. Due to the implementation of guidelines and evaluation studies the quality of rehabilitation programs was ameliorated during the past 15 years. However, future research should develop flexible rehabilitation programs in particular (rehabilitation duration, rehabilitation near or far from place of residence, rehabilitation chain with in-patient, partially out-patient, and out-patient programs), whose effectiveness has to be proven.","902":"","903":"","904":"Many study designs in rehabilitation science give rise to correlated data. For example, patients are followed over time, different responses are measured for each patient, or patients are observed in logical units. Standard statistical methods, however, are only valid for independent responses, and careless application of these methods for actually correlated observations might give erroneous results. By means of a simple example, we show how using methods for correlated data can indeed give a gain in statistical power. In the following, different approaches (Summary measures, Repeated Measurement ANOVA, MANOVA, and Mixed Models) to deal with correlated data are presented. We conclude that among these, the Mixed Models approach is the method of choice because it allows flexible modelling of correlation structure and is, meanwhile, also available in standard statistical software packages.","905":"The goal of manual therapy is to decrease pain and to increase function of the spine and peripheral joints. The method introduced by Maitland is widely used in manual medicine. However, no objective changes in the mobility of the thoracic spine after performing manual mobilization have been published in the literature. The aim of this study is to reveal possible changes in the segmental mobility of the thoracic spine after posterior-anterior manipulations without thrust in comparison with a control group. In addition, significant changes within the treatment group were examined. Thirty-six volunteers were randomized into an intervention (16) and a control group (20). The intervention group was treated two times a week for three weeks. The control group received no treatment. The mobility was objectively measured by using Medimouse. No significant difference in the mobility of the thoracic spine could be shown within the intervention group and in comparison with the control group.","906":null,"907":null,"908":"The WHO Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health enables the description of functional health, disability and impairment on an international and interdisciplinary level in a common language. The fundamental underlying assumption of this Classification, which is orientated around a bio-psycho-social model of health and impairment, has been accepted by rehabilitation scientists in general. Unfortunately, the WHO does not make any recommendations as to how this classification could be applied in practice. In this article, various problems are outlined which could occur when the ICF is applied. Furthermore an example from a psychiatric rehabilitation institution illustrates the way the ICF could serve as an instrument for an extensive rehabilitation management programme. Here, Stucki's use will be made of Rehab-Cycle model. This describes a comprehensive sequence of steps which help analyse the patients problems from a patient-centred standpoint, to set up a schedule for treatment and to evaluate the results. Within Stucki's model the ICF is used as a system to analyse problems upon which intervention can be set. This method is illustrated with an example from a rehabilitation case. Summarizing, it is pointed out that through easier communication (as a result of the ICF) interdisciplinary productivity and efficiency will increase. On this basis it is possible to achieve a more comprehensive multimodal approach in the treatment of people suffering from psychic impairments or disability.","909":"Whether rehabilitation services are initiated, applied for and (granted by German statutory pension funds) according to objectifyable need is uncertain as long as we lack a scientifically valid and operationally defined concept of \"rehabilitation need\". Traditionally three criteria are mentioned: neediness, ability, and prognosis. The text extends and specifies these criteria based on theoretical grounds, research evidence, and sociolegal considerations. It introduces a screening algorithm to objectify and assess individual rehabilitation needs focusing, as far as they are risk factors for participation restrictions, on a central disorder and its complications, risk and prognostic factors, comorbidities, motivational and other context factors. It proposes to relate more or less complex disturbances of functional health to more or less complex rehabilitation programmes and to indicate the typically complex (\"holistic\") in-patient rehabilitation only for equally complex health impairments and participation restrictions. Illustrative empirical data relate to three disorders, diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic disabling back pain, and chronic obstructive lung disease.","910":"","911":"The programme for research in rehabilitation has been established by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the German Pension Insurance scheme in 1998 to further develop the methodology in this field. In addition to other effects, the large number of projects has strengthened the research structure in Germany. An important aim of the programme is the transfer of the research findings into the practice of rehabilitation. The initiators also organize this transformation process in terms of a long-term task. The paper describes the transfer of findings in the topics selected by the Pension Insurance scheme: patient education, access to rehabilitation, and vocational orientation in medical rehabilitation. Furthermore, additional activities concerning the transfer are outlined. To improve the practice of rehabilitation by transferring research findings is of great importance for the Pension Insurance scheme.","912":"In 1998, the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and the German pension insurance scheme established a funding programme for research in rehabilitation. This initiative led to the establishment of eight regional research networks in which numerous research projects were sponsored for eight years (1998-2005). Within the framework of this funding programme, various self-assessment instruments were developed, adapted or improved in order to measure patient-reported outcomes and predictors. In sum, the analyses meet high psychometric standards. In this paper, a comprehensive review is given in five important assessment fields of rehabilitation research in Germany: Health-related quality of life (generic, disease-specific, children and adolescents, preference-based), evaluation of specific therapy and education programmes, motivation, screening for vocational problems and screening for comorbid mental disorders. The instruments are critically discussed, and perspectives for further research are pointed out.","913":"A main problem of the German rehabilitation sector is to meet the increasing demand for rehabilitation treatment while available resources are scarce. Thus, health economic evaluation is gaining more importance for decision making in the rehab system. In the \"Rehabilitation Sciences\" research funding programme the relevance of health economic analyses was recognised from the outset. In nearly all regional networks health economic analyses were conducted - though with different scope. In the first funding period the main focus of health economic evaluation was on (1) patient education programmes and (2) the comparison of inpatient versus outpatient rehabilitation. The projects of the research funding programme have initialised health economic evaluation of rehabilitation in Germany. It was shown that health economics can contribute relevant results for designing rehabilitation concepts. The article concludes with an outlook on the main future questions of rehab economic evaluation.","914":"Return-to-work and protection of work-related participation is stated as a primary objective of rehabilitation by the statutory pension insurance institutes. A general continuous management of work-related participation in rehabilitation is a prerequisite for optimal results in view of stay in work and return to work. This means an extended vocational orientation in medical rehabilitation, individualized occupational rehabilitation according to need and capacity in connection with closer linkages between medical and occupational rehabilitation. In the course of the \"Rehabilitation Sciences\" research funding programme and beyond it, quite a few research projects and scientific activities aimed at development, testing and evaluation of -new screenings and diagnostic instruments with better findings of vocational related needs in medical and occupational rehabilitation, -specific methods of therapy and models for treatment settings with immediate reference to the work related restriction and capacity, as well as -models of the organization and forms of cooperation between medical and occupational rehabilitation. This paper reviews the projects and findings in these research fields in relation to the requirements for an increase of general continuous vocational orientation in rehabilitation.","915":"Patient education is considered to be a major feature of medical rehabilitation in chronic disorders. The rehabilitation sciences research programme funded by the German Pension Insurance scheme and the Federal Ministry of Education and Research comprises a considerable number of evaluation studies carried out with methodological rigor. Over two funding periods, patient education programmes were developed and evaluated with respect to their medical, psychosocial, occupational and economic effects. In this article, a conceptual definition of patient education is presented. Then, the aims and results of ten patient education studies of the funding programme as well as of several implementation projects are described. When integrating these results into previous research taking both a national and international perspective, it can be concluded that patient education programmes are effective regarding medical psychosocial and socio-economic outcomes, although effects sizes may vary. However, in some disorders the state of the research is still unsatisfactory and results are either scarce or heterogeneous. In particular, it is unclear whether such programmes are widely used in medical rehabilitation on a routine basis. Several education programmes provide train-the-trainer opportunities, others are still in the process of development or evaluation. Implementation projects such as those described in the article are aimed at closing these gaps and disseminating research results into the practice of rehabilitation.","916":"The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and the German Pension Insurance scheme established a funding programme for research in rehabilitation. This review presents the findings of 38 available evaluation studies analyzing the effects of medical rehabilitation in Germany in different indications. With a total of 10 studies, the effectiveness of rehabilitation in chronic low back pain was evaluated most frequently. The other research projects analyzed the effects of rehabilitation in psychosomatic diseases (9 studies), cardiac diseases (9), cancer (4), neurological diseases (3), bowel diseases (1) and rehabilitation of children and juveniles (2). According to the results at hand, medical rehabilitation significantly improves the patients' state of health at the end of the rehab measure. Effectiveness is maintained in numerous patients also in the medium or fairly long-term. Hence, rehabilitation accomplishes a prerequisite for further gainful employment. Most of the patients treated have been suffering from chronic illness for many years and have developed psychological complaints besides their serious somatic symptoms and impairments. Here, rehabilitation takes on a fundamental assignment in the care of chronically ill patients. The projects carried out under the promotional focus highlight concrete perspectives for evidence based enhancement of medical rehabilitation. This, amongst others, also holds true for the positive experience with treatment modules within specific vocational training and with patient education. Some of the insights gained are already being realized. As a current task of development, the findings point to further improving the sustainability of rehabilitation's positive impact particularly in chronic low back pain. Pertinent conceptual approaches can be derived from the projects presented.","917":"The evaluation of rehabilitation programmes may be distorted by regression to the mean: In a group of patients with extreme measurement values, these values tend to be less extreme on a following point in time due to merely random components and regardless of a \"true\" treatment effect. If this effect is not taken into account the effectiveness of rehabilitation programmes may be estimated wrongly. In this paper regression to the mean is explained comprehensively, and common misunderstandings are clarified. It is shown which conditions are crucial for occurrence of regression to the mean and which factors determine its strength. Furthermore it is shown how regression to the mean should be controlled in repeated measurement designs.","918":null,"919":"The ICF (International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health) calls attention to the complexities associated with disturbances of health. The question raised is how the various constituents and the resulting network as defined by this Classification can gain importance for medical expertise under the statutory pension insurance scheme concerning work-related capacity. Possible variations of strategy are discussed: clinical intuition, algorithmic pathways, proved medical diagnostics, particular diagnostics of activity according to ICF. A genuine \"silver bullet\" is not in evidence thus far. It cannot be expected that diagnostics relating to a certain sector of the ICF will basically eclipse the rest. Future standards of medical expertise should specify as clearly as possible the impact of the diverse diagnostic findings on the assessment of work-related capacity. Framing emphasis in this way cannot be performed by the ICF on its own.","920":"Work hardening programmes are suggested for brain-injured patients who were unemployed during the rehabilitation period or could not return to their previous job due to specific impairments. The aim of this vocational intervention is to obtain information about the chance of competitive re-employment and about potential obstacles preventing it. In 1994 the city of Munich has established opportunities to perform work hardening programmes in selected municipal work domains. Between 1994 and 1998, 28 patients from the neuropsychological department of the Munich-Bogenhausen municipal hospital underwent such an intervention. 18 persons could be contacted for structured telephone interviews addressing their work histories after discharge from the rehabilitation unit. Three former patients who had retired immediately after the work hardening intervention did not attempt to resume working. Among the remaining 15 patients, six were able to resume full-time competitive work at follow-up, four persons were still employed but had been forced to limit work demands, and five persons had retired. A positive course of reintegration was seen in three patients who received a special vocational support following the work hardening intervention at the same place of work. A negative outcome resulted in four persons who were recommended to participate in vocational retraining. A poor general life satisfaction was reported particularly by retired persons.","921":"In Germany, the number and proportion of elderly people will continue to increase. Only few hospitals and rehabilitation units are currently providing inpatient geriatric services. Concepts for graded geriatric care see ambulatory geriatric rehabilitation (AGR) as an independent service und as a complement to pre-existing structures in geriatric care. In 2004, the national association of statutory health insurance funds established recommendations for AGR, which include criteria of structural and process quality of ambulant geriatric rehabilitation. This article describes various aspects of these framework recommendations (target groups, rehabilitation indicators, and equipment of services). In addition, the classification of AGR within the legislation of the statutory health insurance system is evaluated. The financing of AGR by the statutory health insurance system and the preconditions for accreditation of AGR-services within this system are discussed. The authors conclude that discrimination between existing partially-inpatient day clinics and AGR services is not appropriate. Furthermore, there is no legal basis for such a discrimination; on the contrary, the terms partially-inpatient and ambulatory rehabilitation services can be seen as a uniform benefit according to book 5 of the German social code, SGB V. Therefore there is no differentiation between AGR and partially-inpatient rehabilitation in the statutory health insurance system.","922":"Chronically mentally ill patients often need special rehabilitation to be able to re-enter competitive employment. We know only very little about predicting favourable or unfavourable rehabilitation courses. The present study seeks to examine the relationship between successful rehabilitation -- as defined by a progress in professional ability -- and individual parameters obtained at initiation off-take. Data of 101 subjects who had completed a rehabilitation programme serve as the basis. At the beginning of rehabilitation, sociodemographic, intellectual, psychopathological and quality of life measures were obtained. Each participant was assigned to one of two rehabilitation outcome groups: progress vs. stagnation, determined by the vocational status after programme termination. Both groups were then compared regarding the aforementioned parameters at programme onset to identify substantial predictors for rehabilitation success via regression analysis. High level of functioning, fewer periods of unemployment, a high level of work-related adaptation, and young age at programme onset were found to be predictive of progress in vocational status. Objective parameters have a higher predictive potential regarding vocational reintegration of psychologically ill people compared to subjective criteria. Psychiatric diagnoses as defined by DSM-IV do not reveal relevant connections with subsequent vocational successful reintegration, whereas the initial level of functioning has a definite predictive value. ","923":"The prevalence of comorbid mental disorders in rehabilitation patients is high. In spite of the biopsychosocial treatment approach in rehabilitation, recognition and treatment rates of comorbid mental disorders during medical rehabilitation are low. Therefore this study evaluates a special further-training measure for rehabilitation staff, intended to inform them about the relevance of comorbid mental disorders in rehabilitation patients, to train them in the use of screening instruments, and to discuss needed changes in rehabilitation processes. 14 further-training courses were carried out with 148 participants of different professions from rehabilitation hospitals. Interest in the training was rated to be high whereas previous knowledge of comorbid mental disorders was relatively low. The participants rated the basic conditions of the training as being good. Overall, the steps discussed to improve psycho-diagnostics in rehabilitation were rated as being important and realistic. Especially early recognition of mental burden, the use of screeners for detection, and the naming of diagnoses of mental disorders in discharge reports were considered as most readily realized. The results underline the importance of further-training for improving psycho-diagnostics in rehabilitation clinics, not only to ensure the biopsychosocial treatment approach in rehabilitation but also in view of reducing costs in the health care system.","924":"The patient questionnaire \"Indicators of Reha Status\" (IRES, Version 2) is used for assessing the need for rehabilitation and the success of rehabilitation. It is one of the most frequently used questionnaires in measuring subjective health conditions in medical rehabilitation in Germany. Based on the data of 8600 inpatient rehabilitees, the underlying structural model is examined by a confirmatory factor analysis. The model deviates in part from the original model of the questionnaire authors. The modified model was tested within 12 sub-groups. The sub-groups were divided depending on sex, age and indications (orthopaedic, cardiologic and psychosomatic) of the patients. Multi-group comparisons made between those 12 sub-groups showed specific structures within the groups of psychosomatic patients while no differences between female\/male and younger\/older patients were found. Furthermore, comparable structures of orthopaedic and cardiologic patients were found. Therefore the dimension values of the IRES patient questionnaire are not suited for a comparison between psychosomatic patients and patients from the somatic indications.","925":"","926":"It appears that from a clinical point of view chronic exhaustion or fatigue is an important factor in rehabilitation. This is, however, first of all a phenomenon that can be described as a function in accordance with the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (JCF), caused by chronic illnesses or chronic excessive stress. The clinical and sociomedical ranking of chronic fatigue or exhaustion in respect of rehabilitation was discussed in the framework of a Workshop at the 12th Rehabilitation Science Colloquium, 2003 from the viewpoints of psychiatric rehabilitation, methodology, sociology and practical rehabilitation, and conclusions for future research were drawn. The definition of chronic fatigue is first of all mainly based on the feeling of chronic tiredness but also on phenomena of disturbed concentration, physical discomfort, headache and disorders of \"drive\" and mood. A psychiatric diagnosis linked with symptoms of chronic fatigue is neurasthenia, which is arrived at according to precisely defined criteria. Depressive disorder is one of the most important differential diagnoses in this sphere. Examinations by general practitioners revealed that about 90 % of the patients who had been diagnosed as suffering from psychovegetative disorders completely agreed with the diagnosis of neurasthenia. Neurasthenia resulted more often in work disability periods than disorders of somatisation and other psychosomatic diagnoses. Basing on the \"IRES\" scale \"vital exhaustion\", singular of even serious changes become evident in about 50 % to 90 % of the patients undergoing rehabilitation, depending on their individual range of indications. As was to be expected, the majority of pathologic findings concerns patients undergoing psychosomatic rehabilitation, since in such cases there is an overlapping with symptoms of psychosomatic diseases. It is, however, remarkable that also in somatically oriented orthopaedic rehabilitation symptoms of fatigue are seen in up to 50 % of the patients. Preliminary studies have shown that these symptoms can be definitely ameliorated within the rehabilitation framework, although pathological signs are still abundantly apparent in follow-up examinations. Markedly severe degrees of \"vital exhaustion\" and \"vocational exhaustion\" are also seen in rheumatology patients undergoing somatic rehabilitation. This agrees with case history details related by many female and male patients. Hence, it appears necessary to adapt rehabilitative intervention to both the psychovegetative and the medical behavioural aspects of this symptom. Scientific classification of the entire sphere of chronic fatigue in respect of rehabilitation requires classification of the relevant functions within the ICF framework. To this end it would be necessary to conduct patient inquiries within cross-sectional studies on the one hand and, on the other, a systematic consensus process among experts would have to be used for allocation to the relevant functions. This is the basis for development of suitable assessment tools for use in prospective studies in order to systematically evaluate the impact on functions and especially their effects on activities and participation.","927":"As a result of the continuing development in recent medicine, and improvements of emergency services, an increasing number of patients are surviving serious disease and injury. This has increased the need for rehabilitation, starting already during the acute hospital stay. Early identification and rehabilitation may reduce overall costs and help patients to regain independence earlier. Since the eighties specialized early post-acute rehabilitation units have been increasingly implemented in German hospitals. With book 9 of the German Social Code (SGB IX) coming into effect in July 2001, early post-acute rehabilitation care in hospitals became accepted as a social right. However, the specifics of early rehabilitation care have not been defined. There is a lack of generally accepted indication criteria for early rehabilitation services. Similarly, the aims, objectives and methods need to be specified. It was the objective of a group of interested experts from different fields and backgrounds to achieve an interdisciplinary consensus in terms of conceptual definitions and terminology for all early rehabilitation care services in the acute hospital. The development of the definitions and criteria was achieved by using a modified Delphi-technique. By publishing this paper the group is providing information about its activities and results. Examples of typical cases from the various fields of early rehabilitation care were identified and described. Furthermore, the report points out a number of other problems in the area of early rehabilitation care, which have yet to be solved.","928":"For a fair comparison of rehabilitation centres with respect to the effects of the treatment provided (e. g. for the purpose of quality assurance programmes), it is essential that those factors which influence the outcome of rehabilitation treatment and over which the rehabilitation centres have no control (the so-called \"confounders\", such as co-morbidity and age of the patients on commencement of treatment) are included in the statistical analysis. Simple linear regression models without random effects and without interaction terms are frequently used for this purpose. However, this method has certain limitations which can be avoided if hierarchical linear modelling (HLM) is employed. HLM has the advantage over standard regression analysis methods in that it can be used to take into account the multi-level structure of a comparison problem, allows predictors to be introduced at the level of the centres and also makes it possible to model variations of regression coefficients for the centres. When the HLM technique is used, separate linear models can be produced for the various hierarchically structured data levels of the question (e. g. the levels \"patients\" and \"centres\" for rehabilitation centres, for example). Moreover, it can be empirically tested with HLMs whether the rehabilitation coefficients (e. g. effects of mean age of patients on the outcome of rehabilitation) differ significantly between the centres. In this article, we describe the use of hierarchical linear modelling on the basis of data obtained from the quality assurance programme of the statutory health insurance schemes in the field of medical rehabilitation (\"QS-Reha\").","929":"Self-competence is a keyword of modern reform legislation in public health and social policy in general and in disability law more specifically. The article defines self-competence from the perspective of constitutional law and describes the new provisions of Book 9 of the Social Code, SGB IX with relation to disabled women and girls. These new provisions are a response to new scientific analyses of the status of disabled women and girls. Their status is determined by multiple discrimination and by threat of sexual violence. Within this context self-competence means capacity for self-determination. Such an interpretation is in line with reforms in disability law, i. e. the adoption of anti-discrimination law. With this reform legislators pursue a shift in paradigm from the medical to the social model of disability. Such a paradigm shift demands new paths to be treaded in rehabilitation. Rehabilitation agencies have corresponding duties to protect and to promote.","930":"Supplementary to the description of diseases at symptom level, the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), edited by the WHO, for the first time enables a systematic description also at the level of disabilities and impairments. The Mini-ICF-Rating for Mental Disorders (Mini-ICF-P) is a short observer rating instrument for the assessment of disabilities, especially with regard to occupational functioning. The Mini-ICF-P was first evaluated empirically in 125 patients of a Department of Behavioural Medicine and Psychosomatics. Parallel-test reliability was r = 0.59. Correlates were found with cognitive and motivational variables and duration of sick leave from work. In summary, the Mini-ICF-P is a quick and practicable instrument.","931":"Patients' expectancies are widely hypothesized to influence the course of rehabilitation. Therefore, an exploratory cross-sectional survey was performed in cardiological rehabilitation patients to analyse the relationships of patients' expectations and rehabilitation outcomes. Patients were recruited from ambulatory heart groups (phase III rehabilitation). All participants judged both their expectations and experiences regarding their inpatient rehabilitation (phase II) in retrospect. Of 300 eligible heart group members, 238 (79 %) consented to participate (81 % male; mean age 65.5 years). Discussions with their physician, in-depth clinical examination, and information regarding treatment and healthy life-style were rated as most important by the patients. Nutritional counselling, gymnastics, massage, walking and the pleasant surroundings of the clinic were also frequently mentioned. One third stated that they had changed their attitudes regarding life-style, stress management, and nutrition as a result of rehabilitation. However, according to their self-reports, changes in body weight were not substantial whereas the proportion of smokers declined. 70 % reported to be interested in attending a future rehabilitation treatment. Patients with high expectations regarding physical training, health counselling, behaviour modification and physician care had better rehabilitation outcomes. When interpreting the results, both the selective nature of the sample and possible recall bias due to the retrospective assessments have to be considered. Our findings may thus be seen as hints as to patients overall judging their rehabilitation in a positive way. However, critical aspects were also mentioned. While these did not touch the general concepts of the interventions, they highlighted specific aspects of its performance and implementation, issues that should be taken into account by the individual rehabilitation clinic.","932":"The introduction of the new interdisciplinary subject \"Rehabilitation, Physical Medicine, Naturopathic Treatment\" based on the 9th revision of the Federal Medical Licensing Regulations (Approbationsordnung fur Arzte) implies new opportunities and challenges for teaching. In order to investigate the transfer of the new subject to teaching practise, a written questionnaire was sent to all German medical faculties. With regard to the implementation of new teaching structures and procedures in the subject, a range of different indicators was examined. 50 % of the medical faculties have been planning for comprehensive teaching sessions as compared to distribution over the whole semester. Lectures predominate with an average of more than half of the teaching time available for the subject. For examination purposes written tests are used in 83 %, compared to only 17 % Objective Structured Clinical Examinations. Considering the diversity among the medical faculties, there is room for improvement in many universities concerning more patient- and practice-oriented medical training as intended by the Federal Medical Licensing Regulations. However, in spite of increased demands, supplementary funds for additional equipment or manpower are rarely provided for. In the future, enhanced allocation of resources based on performance-related evaluation within the medical faculties and teaching competition between universities may provide significant stimuli for advances in medical training also in the new interdisciplinary subject. Further improvement of general teaching conditions is necessary in order to utilize all the opportunities offered by the new Federal Medical Regulations.","933":"","934":"","935":"","936":"","937":null,"938":"In rehabilitation research patient questionnaires are widely used for evaluative purposes, i. e. to measure improvements or deteriorations over time. This is only possible if the questionnaires applied appropriately reflect \"true\" change over time, i. e. they have to be sensitive to change. The aim of this paper is to point out the importance of the \"sensitivity to change\" concept for evaluative assessment tools and evaluative studies, respectively, considering quality of life research as an example. Various qualitative aspects, e. g. scaling of response options of assessment tools, are covered as well as quantitative methods, i. e. study designs and indices. Furthermore, recommendations for interpretation are given.","939":"If medical information of persons with spinal cord injuries is seen more as a useful component of medical care with high responsibility than an inconvenient duty, it can be an important contribution toward rehabilitation. Based upon psychological principles of communication, practical experience and the outcome of the specialized literature, it is possible to show concrete conditions for competent medical conversation in case of delivering bad news. Taking into consideration the suggested behavioural rules that describe how to proceed the informing can become a fruitful element in relationship between medical doctor and patient.","940":"This paper focuses on the improvement of obesity treatment during in-patient rehabilitation. The diagnosis of obesity rarely is in the foreground of assignment to rehabilitation. Obesity is the primary diagnosis in only about 1 % of all adipose patients; the term is also non-specific with respect to the causal role in the Metabolic Syndrome. The effects of obesity (diabetes, hypertension, myocardial infarction, arthrosis) are treated but not the underlying cause. Treatment of obesity can be the primary focus or take place as an adjunct to the treatment of other diseases; it therefore requires different structures and a sufficient number of patients. Life style change is an essential aspect of obesity-specific behavior therapy and requires closed groups. Different modular therapeutic offerings are more suitable in physiotherapy and sports. In general, 85 - 90 % of all patients meet the prerequisites for group settings (i. e., ability to communicate, discipline). A generally accepted uniform pattern of motivational assessment appears to be important to treatment success but has to be postulated as yet. Pre-assessment interviews and subjects' response to proposed therapy settings are useful means of identifying motivated patients. Setting down rehabilitative goals in writing facilitates patients' achieving therapeutic targets. Medical discharge summaries should reflect the process state (motivation, therapeutic modules, concomitant illnesses, target agreements, subjective and somatic changes in quality of life). Ongoing ambulatory care seems important but can rarely be implemented. Accepted indicators of the quality of rehabilitative obesity treatment need to be determined. ","941":"In recent years new avenues of medical rehabilitation have been made possible in order to allow a more flexible and better care for patients. This includes day care and outpatient treatment additional to inpatient services. A further new development are centers which provide \"residential rehabilitation\". It allows a continuous cooperation with physicians and therapists who send patients or take care of them after discharge. Cooperation with acute care hospitals is easier. Inpatient care, day care and outpatient care can be better integrated. The social network of the patient can easier be taken into account in treatment planning. Patients can be supported when going back to work. Contact with self-help groups can be arranged while the patient is still in treatment.","942":"Modifications of the subjective prognosis of gainful employment during in-patient rehabilitation were assessed by means of a 3-item scale (SPE scale) in 180 orthopaedic patients. Statistically significant improvements were found as to the subjective prognosis of gainful employment and other measures of vocational ability as well. Patients showing lower risk at the beginning profited to a greater degree from rehabilitation as compared to patients with higher scores in SPE scale. To improve the effects of rehabilitation for patients with a high subjective risk as to gainful employment specific interventions are recommended. Further research is discussed.","943":"Re-analyses of extensive datasets as well as theoretical considerations have led to the conclusion that the patient questionnaire \"Indicators of Rehabilitation Status\" (IRES) should be revised in several respects. The new version IRES-3 was developed on the basis of a theoretical model of rehabilitation following the ICF (International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health) as well as of elements of the earlier version IRES-2. In addition, we included the results of expert panels on the definition of treatment goals in medical rehabilitation. The IRES-3 was tested in 453 patients in rehabilitation clinics of seven diagnostic areas. To compare the IRES-3 with other generic instruments, the SF-36 and the HADS were employed at the same time. For purposes of cross-validation, an external sample could be used. The dimensional structure was tested in confirmatory factor analyses. With rare exceptions, the tests showed good values for item difficulties, ceiling and floor effects, internal consistencies and test-retest-reliability. Convergent validity could be established for the IRES-3 when compared to relevant scales of the SF-36 and the HADS. Indices of sensitivity to change were comparable, if not somewhat superior to the effects on comparable scales of the SF-36. The assessment of the construct validity and the dimensional structure of the questionnaire led to the definition of eight dimensions which can be interpreted as somatic, emotional, functional, occupational, social, pain, coping, as well as health information and behaviour. The dimensional structure of the IRES-3 can be regarded as theoretically meaningful as well as empirically proven. STANDARDIZATION: For purposes of standardization, data were collected on a sample representative of the population aged 30-75 years in Germany. These data allow a norm-oriented interpretation of scales and dimensions of the IRES-3 for patients in rehabilitation. The questionnaire is ready for application, including a computer programme for data entry and analysis. ","944":"","945":"What does it mean that a screening test has a sensitivity of 80 % and a specificity of 80 %? What conclusion can be drawn as to the probability of a patient tested positive having the target disorder? Is this probability dependent on the prevalence of the target disorder? These are the questions addressed in the present paper. The classical concepts of sensitivity and specificity are presented as well as the more modern and clinically relevant concepts of the predictive values of a positive and a negative test. The author employs different didactic methods such as 2 x 2 tables, graphical illustrations and natural frequencies for elaborating on these often intermixed concepts in a clear and easily understandable way.","946":"The call for a more specific and transparent service and reimbursement system for medical rehabilitation is not new. However, in practice, the idea was not followed up for a long time. This situation changed with the introduction of German Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs) for acute care settings. It is now strongly being discussed whether such a sophisticated lump sum reimbursement system might also be a viable alternative in the field of rehabilitation. There still exist different opinions over the suitability of a lump sum-system for medical rehabilitation, but the main direction seems to be clear. There is no doubt that medical rehabilitation requires a needs-adapted, differentiated patient classification system. The benefits of such cost-homogeneous groups are evident. They support medical and management services and are suitable for both internal and external use. The main intent of the project presented was to develop such a patient classification system, adapted to the requirements of medical rehabilitation. The project concentrated on orthopaedic and cardiac rehabilitaton. For these two areas, needs-adapted and cost-homogeneous groups (RBG, Rehabilitationsbehandlungsgruppen - Rehabilitation Treatment Groups) were developed in order to adequately represent the underlying service portfolio and to act as a link between acute and post-acute care. In addition, severity level indicators were identified, in order to explain for different needs and resource volumes and in order to create severity-RBGs representing patients with the same severity level. Based on these groups, a needs-adapted lump sum reimbursement system can be developed, allowing for a differentiated service and cost controlling. The project described formed part of the Research Funding Programme Rehabilitation Sciences defrayed by the German Pension Insurance and the Federal Ministry for Education and Research. As part of the Freiburg\/Bad Sackingen research network, it was realised at the University BW, Munich.","947":"The ninth book of the German social code, SGB IX, has intensified questions on the effectiveness and usefulness of medical rehabilitation, a multimodal multidisciplinary team care model, especially but not exclusively for chronic back pain. In 2002 back pain was the reported leading cause for 29 % of all medical and other rehabilitative services provided by German statutory pension funds. A previous systematic review of all available German studies (January 1980 to June 2001) analysed the effectiveness of inpatient rehabilitation for chronic back pain. The present report provides an update and critical appraisal of the review. Again we conducted a systematic search for relevant German studies from between July 2001 and December 2003 using electronic data bases, hand-searching of congress abstracts and postal questionnaires. The quality of relevant studies was assessed according to the recommendations of the Cochrane Back Review Group. For each study effect sizes for up to six central outcome parameters were calculated using pre-post comparisons from short and medium term follow-ups, they were correlated with prognostically relevant characteristics of the studies and samples. The combined weighted intra-group effect sizes were compared with results from international studies. 16 studies, both controlled and uncontrolled, were included. Again we could not identify any study confirming the effectiveness of medical rehabilitation in chronic back pain compared to no treatment or usual care. The methodological quality of the new studies did not seem to exceed that of the earlier ones. Depending on the outcome variable, small effects (e. g. on functional ability) to relevant effects (e. g. vitality) can be observed at or immediately after the end of rehabilitation. Now the effects after three to 12 months seem to be smaller than previously observed. The small size of medium term effects indicates a basic problem of inpatient rehabilitation for chronic back pain in Germany. This becomes even greater when the results of international controlled studies are used as reference. Possible reasons for the disappointing situation (weak methodology, inappropriate selection of patients, weak intervention) are to be discussed. At present, we have no convincing evidence for a general effectiveness of Germany's system of inpatient rehabilitation for chronic back pain. ","948":"There is a lack of questionnaires assessing the motivation of inpatients to scrutinize occupational stresses and deal with them as part of their psychotherapeutic treatment. Work-related stress contributes significantly to the development of mental disorders. Vocational reintegration is an outcome criterion for the success of vocational rehabilitation. Patients are often not motivated for dealing with occupational stresses during inpatient medical rehabilitation. Therefore it is necessary to assess patient motivation at the beginning of treatment, in order to assign them to specific interventions, e. g. promoting motivation. A questionnaire (Fragebogen zur berufsbezogenen Therapiemotivation -- FBTM) consisting of 84 items was developed, based on published questionnaires for psychotherapy motivation. 283 psychosomatic rehabilitation inpatients were administered the FBTM, subsequently analyzed by item and factor analyses. Based on a second sample (n = 282) confirmatory factor analyses and validation of the questionnaire were executed. Item and factor analyses revealed a four factor structure. 24 items constituted the subscales that could be described as \"intention to change\", \"wish for pension\", \"negative treatment expectations\" and \"active coping\". Reliability (Cronbach's Alpha) was satisfactory with coefficients between 0.69 and 0.87, and only low correlations could be found between the four subscales. Correlations with other measures were most pronounced for the subscale \"intention to change\". Some significant but low correlations could be reported between the FBTM and a standardized questionnaire of psychotherapy motivation (FMP). Confirmatory factor analyses of a second sample (n = 282) confirmed the original four factors. First evidence of sensitivity could be observed in a sample of patients who took part in an intervention promoting work-related therapy motivation during psychosomatic inpatient rehabilitation. The FBTM is a reliable and valid instrument assessing work-related therapy motivation of inpatients, as a relevant therapeutic measure in psychosomatic rehabilitation. Further validation, especially the analysis of predictive validity is desirable. ","949":"This article presents the final results of a project comparing the economic effects of outpatient and inpatient rehabilitation in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The data analysed have been derived from the total population of applicants for orthopaedic-traumatologic rehabilitation who are suitable for outpatient rehabilitation in all criteria. The randomized and controlled study at first verified whether the outcome parameters of the two variants of rehabilitation are approximately equal. If this condition is fulfilled the differences between amounts and periods of payments and costs incumbent on the pension insurance agency are analyzed. And in fact, the final results confirm that, in suitable patients, outpatient rehabilitation can achieve approximately the same outcomes as inpatient rehabilitation -- but at distinctly lower cost.","950":"","951":"","952":"","953":"In clinical practice ratings by physicians and therapists are among the most frequently used assessment procedures. It is shown, which statistical measures should be used to assess the reliability of such ratings. Additionally, potential causes of insufficient reliability are presented.

The test battery had before been consented by a task force of the German Association for the Prevention and Rehabilitation of Cardiovascular Disease, DGPR. It integrates generally approved and well-tried assessments for depression\/anxiety, social isolation (vocational) stress, and subjective vocational disability. The questionnaire was administered to a convenience sample of 426 patients undergoing inpatient cardiac rehabilitation. Results on the psychometric properties, a comparison of the cardiac sample to the general population, as well as distributions of quartile ranges are reported. Also, a preliminary appraisal of the need for further assessment or treatment is made. The results confirm that the short test battery is suited for assessing psychological and social problems in cardiac rehabilitation patients.","955":"The goal of this paper is presentation of an inventory for the assessment of basic capabilities underlying work and occupational behaviour of psychiatric patients in the course of their treatment and rehabilitation. The \"Osnabruck Work Capabilities Profile\" (O-AFP) is an instrument filled in by staff, which consists of three scales comprising ten items each, measuring \"Learning Ability\", \"Social Communication Ability\" and \"Adaptation\". In the study presented, these scales were confirmed by factor analyses of data from 194 schizophrenic patients. Test analyses yielded good item and scale characteristics. The only exception to this are elevated item difficulty scores of the third scale (adaptation). This was attributed to specific effects of selecting the sample of patients. Furthermore, low or insignificant correlations with the patients' symptom scores indicate the discriminant validity of the scales. It is concluded that the O-AFP is well suited for application with different forms of occupational therapy.","956":"A one-week booster group treatment in rheumatic diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, spondylarthropathies, fibromyalgia) was developed in order to stabilize rehabilitation effects after medical rehabilitation. The program took place in an inpatient setting 3 - 5 months after rehabilitation, aimed at refreshing and deepening already learnt contents as well as teaching new subjects (e. g. about dietetics). Training and educational elements are given priority in this concept. A total of 140 patients participated in 19 booster weeks. At the end of each booster week the acceptance was assessed by questionnaire and in a round-table discussion. Comprehensibility and group atmosphere were judged very positively. The course was also considered very helpful, helpfulness being rated with marks about 2 (1 = very helpful, 6 = not at all helpful). Participants especially appreciated the course's framework as a group setting emphasising the exchange of experience with co-patients. At the same time, however, participants wished more individualized treatment such as physiotherapy or massage. With regard to the quantity of the various therapy elements, participants would have preferred more traditional spa therapy, more medical treatment by a physician, more group physiotherapy and sports. They would also have liked more breaks. In general fewer psychological elements, less discussion and reflection but more physical activity was wished for. Little difference was found between the various diagnoses, but the program was rated slightly more positively by the patients with spondylarthropathies. Overall, the great number of people participating in the program and their acceptance of the booster week are positive. Patients appreciated the group setting and the possibilities of exchanging experience on a high level. But it was difficult to change patients' traditional expectations concerning medical rehabilitation to a behaviour-orientated course like ours. It is worth thinking about whether this concept should play a greater role in traditional medical inpatient rehabilitation programming. ","957":"Multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary team models are often used to describe teams in medical rehabilitation. There is only little evidence whether these models are used in the daily routine of medical rehabilitation and to what extent the quality (team work) and effectiveness (team success) differ between the models. For the present study an interview guide was designed to assess the team models. In each of the six clinics phone interviews were conducted with one member of the management. Data on teamwork and team success were collected with a staff questionnaire. The questionnaires were distributed to all employees (n = 266; response rate n = 127, 48%) of the six teams. Two teams were classified as interdisciplinary teams and four teams as multidisciplinary. The comparison between the two models shows better results for the interdisciplinary team model. Several methodical restrictions (e. g. unconsidered moderator variables, representativeness of the sample) need to be considered. Systematic analyses of teamwork as presented are essential to identify the conditions of successful teamwork and also form the basis for implementation of team development measures in medical rehabilitation.","958":"In October 2003 the 9 (th) revision of the Federal Medical Training Regulations (Approbationsordnung) came into effect. The new compulsory interdisciplinary subject \"Rehabilitation, Physical Medicine, Naturopathic Treatment\" offers the opportunity to teach all students in comprehensive concepts of Rehabilitation such as the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) of the WHO and the new book 9 of the German Social Code (SGB 9), as well as Physical Medicine and Naturopathic Treatment. Since the content of this new subject has not been defined up to date a joint task force of the German Society of Rehabilitation Science and the German Society of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation was founded in order to recommend teaching standards. As part of these teaching standards educational objectives are introduced in this article. They should guide the persons in charge of teaching the subject in the medical faculties. In some areas the students should acquire profound abilities and skills in addition to knowledge. The medical faculties may focus on different educational targets according to their individual teaching profile.","959":"Although created already under the Law on statutory health insurance reform 2000, implementation and actual practice of the instrument of \"integrated health care\" (section 140 a-g of the German Social Code, Book V) have noticeably been gaining momentum only since the Law on statutory health insurance modernization (GMG) came into force on January 1, 2004. In this process, the issue of coping with the interface between medical acute care and medical rehabilitation emerges as an increasing focus of the debate over future-oriented development of service provision structures. When Book IX of the German Social Code -- Rehabilitation and Participation of People with Disabilities -- came into force on July 1, 2001 its stipulations became binding also for the Statutory Health Insurance domain (Book V of the German Social Code), notably in as far as regulations of healthcare infrastructure, contents of benefits and services as well as their performance are concerned. Moreover, more than 75 % of the medical rehabilitation benefits granted are performed by rehabilitation providers outside the scope of the health insurance system. This contribution points out that the development of integrated care structures which also cover medical rehabilitation benefits and services is subject to interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary requirements that, partly to a considerable extent, differ from or go beyond the framework conditions usually applicable in the acute-care sector.","960":"Current health policy reform efforts in Germany include introduction of a DRG (Diagnosis Related Group) based funding system in the hospital sector as well as integrated delivery of health care and disease management programs, developments that will directly affect the medical rehabilitation sector. Decreasing lengths of hospital stay induced by the DRG system will inter alia entail a shifting of cases and costs to subsequent sectors. Moreover, hospitals might not least seek compensation for shorter hospital stays by extending their scope to include rehabilitation and long-term care services. Introduction of the DRG system in acute-hospital care has resulted in major changes in respect of early rehabilitation. Existing specialized early rehabilitation facilities providing high-quality care face serious funding problems on account of the newly introduced early rehabilitation DRGs. For hospitals previously not involved in early rehabilitation on the other hand, incentives arise to set up new early rehabilitation structures although the need for these additional capacities obviously is questionable. Introduction of the DRG-based funding system has reinforced the discussion about applying a flat-rate system also in the rehabilitation sector. This form of remuneration however is inappropriate to medical rehabilitation concepts. On the other hand, a remuneration system incorporating cross-institutional per-diem fees and \"treatment time\" budgets might enable using essential advantages of flat-rate payment without having to expect repercussions for the quality of care. In the context of integrated care and disease management programs the issue at stake for rehabilitation primarily is to be able to contribute its specific competencies appropriately. Also, integrated health care is bound to result in stronger competition among the various health care sectors. If rehabilitation is set to face this competition, further research efforts will urgently have to be made along with ongoing development of clinical practice guidelines.","961":"Clinical practice guidelines - seen as an aggregation of scientific evidence - and evidence based medicine are of relevance and importance for everybody involved in health care. Nevertheless, the discussion of their pros and cons is controversial. Major criticisms concern methodological aspects, a disregard of the patients' perspective, potentially increasing costs and the limitation of doctors' autonomy possibly caused by streamlining therapy. Supporters emphasize the improvement of care that comes with using proven therapies, patients' empowerment, cost reduction and equity in the distribution of resources. Following medical practice guidelines the liability for medical malpractice may be limited, but non-adherence to guidelines does not entail liability per se. Clinical practice guidelines in the rehabilitative sector differ from those in curative medicine by being required to achieve more complex goals than maintenance, recovery and improvement of health. Activities in the rehabilitation sector address two main topics: The integration of rehabilitation into curative guidelines, e. g. by participating in the German clearing process for guidelines, and the development of guidelines specific to rehabilitation. There are a number of guideline initiatives, e. g. with the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies (AWMF), the Federation of German Pension Insurance Institutes (VDR) and the Federal Insurance Institute for Salaried Employees (BfA). The BfA project is the first to allow integration of evidence based medicine into the quality assurance programme of the German Pension Insurance complementing it with differentiated criteria for the assessment of therapeutic processes. Taking evidence based medicine increasingly into consideration and the continuous process of introducing rehabilitative clinical practice guidelines are going to improve health care for people with chronic diseases.","962":"The so-called shifting of paradigm in medicine has inevitably led to an increasing importance of medical rehabilitation, especially geriatric rehabilitation, within the system of medical care in the Federal Republic of Germany. Nationally valid guidelines for assessing the indication of geriatric rehabilitation and for recommending options for appropriate allocation have been elaborated within the framework of the German statutory health insurance system. In addition, manpower and equipment requirements for ambulatory geriatric rehabilitation facilities have been agreed on. These guidelines include clarifications concerning the following: definition of the geriatric patient; definition of the patient in need of geriatric rehabilitation; demarcation of geriatric rehabilitation from organ-specific rehabilitation; operationalization of assessment procedures and allocation recommendations concerning geriatric rehabilitation; requirements profiles for ambulatory geriatric rehabilitation facilities. Essential prerequisites for successful implementation of these national standards are among others: turning towards the bio-psycho-social model of health and disease advocated by the World Health Organization; overcoming the traditional deficit model of aging and old-age in favour of a resource-oriented approach in service-provision policies; rejecting the one-sided fiscal thinking in the current debate over service-provision policies in geriatric rehabilitation.","963":"Rehabilitation has a long tradition in Germany compared to other countries and is based upon a differentiated, social law foundation. Rehabilitative offers are provided as standard benefits by different social insurance schemes (pension insurance, health insurance, accident insurance, etc.) and are an independent task of care not included in acute care. A high degree of institutionalisation and specialisation are specific characteristics of rehabilitation in Germany. A country-wide network of indication specific, mostly larger institutions is available for medical rehabilitation in Germany. This emergence of centres and the location of many institutions in more rural regions give rise to the fact that rehabilitation often cannot take place close to the places of residence of those who are in need of rehabilitative offers. Until the mid-nineties, rehabilitative benefits have been performed almost exclusively on an inpatient basis, which is another characteristic of medical rehabilitation in Germany. Since then the discussion about ambulant rehabilitation has been increasing. Several initiatives are aimed at supplementing the present in-patient offers through ambulant measures. This article describes and analyses the present efforts for the development of ambulant rehabilitation. In reference to the guidelines of the BAR (Federal Rehabilitation Council) concerning ambulant medical rehabilitation, adopted by all institutions involved in 2000, the current situation and the state of implementation are discussed, and advancements necessary in the authors' view are considered.","964":"In the sector of medical rehabilitation in Germany, a quality assurance programme has been established over the last decade. What distinguishes this programme in comparison to other sectors of the health care system is its comprehensive approach (including quality of structures, processes and outcomes), the special attention given to patients' needs, its scientific foundation, and its implementation throughout the sector. Participation in this programme is obligatory for all in-patient rehabilitation facilities. For out-patient rehabilitation, a specific programme is currently being developed. The feedback report to the facilities gives them concrete indications of existing strengths and weaknesses and thus offers them a start for developing their quality by means of internal quality management. The article begins with a presentation of the instruments and procedures applied as well as selected results of the previous surveys in the context of external quality assurance. Subsequently, the most important approaches to internal quality management are explained. The article ends with a description of the strengths and weaknesses of the existing quality assurance programmes and proposes steps to be taken for their further development.","965":"In 1998, the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and the German pension insurance scheme established a funding programme for research in rehabilitation. This \"Rehabilitation Sciences\" research funding programme comprises eight regional research networks for eight years in two periods (1998-2002, 2001-2005). In our paper we review the findings of the first funding period in five of the research fields: patient education, need for and access to rehabilitation, vocational training in medical rehabilitation to enhance return to work, comorbid mental disorders in patients with somatic diseases, and gender differences. Several activities aimed at transferring research findings into practice are outlined. Finally, the impact of the funding programme is summarized and perspectives for further funding are given.","966":"","967":"","968":"","969":"","970":"Even though reporting of effect sizes is recommended in methodological guidelines such as the CONSORT Statement (Consolidated Standard of Reporting Trials), these quantities are still rarely included in reports on studies in rehabilitation medicine. The aim of this paper is to emphasize the relevance of reporting effect sizes and to illustrate different methods for their calculation. The implications of using different methods for calculating effect sizes are also discussed.","971":"Modern patient based outcome measures like the SMFA-D (German Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment Questionnaire) are able to detect the impairment and functional capacity of patients with musculoskeletal extremity disorders. The SMFA-D was successfully evaluated in several cohorts treated operatively for osteoarthritis of the knee and hip, rotator cuff tears and rheumatoid arthritis. The aim of the present study was the evaluation of the SMFA-D in patients with conservative treatment for hip osteoarthritis. 69 patients with osteoarthritis of the hip were enrolled in a prospective controlled clinical trial. All patients completed the SMFA-D, SF-36, WOMAC, FFbH-OA. A standardized test of walking speed and the functional status of the patient as judged by the physician were recorded. Statistical analysis were done for the following: re-test reliability (ICC), internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha), validity and responsiveness. Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) was alpha = 0.89 and alpha = 0.97 for the SMFA-D scales. The retest reliability (ICC, unjust, mixed effect) was 0.91 (p &lt; 0.001) for the function index and 0.73 (p &lt; 0.001) for the bother index. Both indices correlated significantly with the FFbH-OA (r = 0.66 to r = 0.84), the WOMAC (r = 0.55 to r = 0.86) and the scales of the SF-36 (r = - 0.34 to r = - 0.85) on all three time points, which supports construct validity. There was mainly a significant correlation between the SMFA-D scales and the functional status of the patient (r = 0.21 to r = 0.44), pain reported by the patient (r = 0.43 to = 0.54) and the self selected walking speed (r = 0.28 to r = 0.51), which supports external validity. We were able to differentiate operatively and conservatively treated patients (discriminant construct validity). At the end of the rehabilitation program we were able to demonstrate small to medium treatment effects in SMFA-D and SF-36. The WOMAC and FFbH-OA were not able to demonstrate these treatment effects. Even in patients with conservative treatment of hip osteoarthritis the SMFA-D represents a reliable, valid and responsive measure. The use of the SMFA-D can be recommended as a patient based outcome measure. ","972":"Within the scope of a multicenter study regarding the outcome quality of inpatient psychosomatic rehabilitation a structured catalogue of therapy goals (SZK, strukturierter Therapiezielkatalog) was developed. The catalogue contains 89 predetermined therapy goals as well as the option to formulate further goals in own words. The SZK is available both as a patient and as a therapist version. At the beginning of treatment up to five primary objectives are chosen from the list. At the end of treatment and at the 1-year follow-up the level of achievement of objectives is assessed. Moreover the SZK contains the option to mark goals as not relevant any more and to add goals which came up during the treatment and to evaluate them regarding the level of achievement. The study on hand asks for empirical identification of the target structure. Furthermore, reliability and validity of the calculated measures of goal attainment are analysed. As the most important finding the SZK turns out to be a practical and economical assessment instrument for goal-oriented evaluation.","973":"To obtain a standardized method for performance capacity assessment in social medicine reference to a generally accepted model of performance capacity is necessary. Further, such a model enables description of the effects of chronic disease on performance capacity. This article describes how the term \"performance capacity\" can be reduced to operational basal parameters by a hierarchic breakdown, with the domain \"physical performance capacity\" having the most complex structure. Furthermore the construction of a graduation according to work-load taxonomies for every parameter is shown. The collection of data on the level of basal parameters is essential to assess the concrete performance capacity. To apply the model as a basis for estimating the effects of chronic disease, graduated disease features have to be created. The benefit of the procedure described lies in increased transparency of the decision process. Hence, performance capacity assessment will gain reliability and objectivity.","974":"What follows for the outcome of rehabilitation, patients' satisfaction and work organisation in a rehabilitation hospital if the patients obtain their discharge reports for signature before they leave? This has been investigated in a pilot study at the University Rehabilitation Hospital in Bad Wurzach, Germany. The pilot study was so successful that the hospital continued to use the new procedure. Only very few refused their signature, most patients were happy to obtain their discharge reports immediately and to have the opportunity to discuss the report with their physician if desired. Physician judged patients' participation slightly more pointly while the known discrepancies between physicians' and patients' point of view remained, i. e. the physician doesn't \"touch up\" knowing the patient will read his report. Integrating the patient in the process is a major step towards patients' empowerment. Both the influence on patients' satisfaction and changes in work organisation are discussed in the paper. A timely discharge examination and an optimised computer-supported workflow, transformation of loosely coupled activities in a process managed by time frames are preconditions for being able to have the discharge report ready before the patients leave. Monitoring the timely delivery then becomes obsolete.","975":null,"976":"","977":"The term \"statistical significance\" is often misunderstood. The result of a study may be labelled to be \"highly significant\" as if implying \"highly important\". Statistically significant, however, does only mean that a study result might have been found with a predefined probability (conventionally set at 5 %) even when the null hypothesis is true in the population, i. e. the effect found in the study sample does not exist in reality. Whether a result proves to be significant or not largely depends on sample size. Thus, in a large sample minimal effects of no practical relevance may turn out significant whereas in a small sample even large, important effects may fail to reach the significance level. As a consequence, when presenting the results of a study the effect size should be reported together with a confidence interval indicating the probable range that contains the population effect.","978":"The implementation of a quality system in health care organizations offers huge potentials for improvement and development. But the realization of such systems necessitates high investments, which small companies and family businesses often are unable to raise. The German Association of Spa Accommodation Resorts (VdKB) commissioned two consultants to develop a reasonably priced implementation concept of a DIN EN ISO 9001 quality system specially adjusted to small companies and family businesses in medical spa and rehabilitation services, which was successfully accredited in May 2003. This paper describes fundamental requirements in combine management systems, considers the pros and cons of management combines and demonstrates the practical realization of combine requirements on the example of the VdKB-combine system.","979":"In 2002, the peer review for the somatic indications of medical rehabilitation was further developed. This process was aimed at adjusting the peer review checklist to the \"Guide for the Uniform Medical Report of the Statutory German Pension Insurance Scheme\" (\"Leitfaden zum einheitlichen Entlassungsbericht der Rentenversicherung\"), at harmonising the peer review with the version used in the quality assurance programme of the German health insurance and at reducing requirements by focusing on criteria relevant in the individual case. This paper reports on the consensus process carried out and outlines the modifications of the peer review procedure.","980":"This paper presents research results on stepwise occupational reintegration in patients with orthopaedic diseases, predominantly back pain. A retrospective questionnaire study was performed from January to May 2003. We questioned 534 insurants of the LVA (statutory pension insurance institute) in Schleswig-Holstein who had completed orthopaedic rehabilitation between 1999 and 2001 and had been recommended for stepwise occupational reintegration. The participant rate was 47% (n = 250 completed questionnaires). The standardized survey included demographic as well as illness-, rehabilitation- and job-related information. Particularly, information about the beginning and implementation of the stepwise occupational reintegration programme, its evaluation by the insurants, and their reintegration into working life was gathered. Stepwise occupational reintegration was recommended for 4.5% of the rehabilitation patients; 57% of them acted on this suggestion. The results show a positive appraisal of the stepwise occupational reintegration programme in general and high rates of reintegration (more than 80%) at mid-term. However, the dropout rate of 15% is quite high. The results suggest a necessity for optimization especially regarding initiation of the stepwise occupational reintegration programme, patient motivation, and better support for patients during the programme. Thus, a close linkage of stepwise occupational reintegration with accompanying rehabilitation programmes offers promising perspectives for purposive occupation-orientated rehabilitation programmes.","981":"The multidimensional and heterogeneous etiogenesis of chronic low back pain requires multimodal as well as specific treatment programmes. Aim of the present study was to increase the specificity of treatment already at the interface \"family health care - assigning institution - rehabilitation clinic\" by supporting the assignment to orthopaedic or psychosomatic rehabilitation through extensive diagnostics and deriving a patient's profile of risk factors in the forefield of rehabilitation. In a prospective randomized control group design the rehabilitation success in 309 persons (age 22 - 58) suffering from chronic low back pain was compared on risk factor specific vs. conventional assignment. Between 22 % and 27 % of the assignments following conventional criteria have to be considered as false. On the other hand, rehabilitation success did not turn out to have been increased by specific assignment. In conclusion, implications for more far-reaching change in treatment programmes within and subsequent to stationary rehabilitation are discussed.","982":"Treadmill training with body weight support was applied in 30 patients who had suffered an ischaemic stroke, with the goal of improving their independence in the activities of daily living (ADL). The following inclusion criteria were used: inability to walk (FAC-score 0 - 2); motor abilities (the ability to sit without support, a palpable muscle function of the hip extensors, abductors and the knee extensors in the affected leg); adequate cooperation, motivation and vigility; absence of muscle contractures which would affect gait; onset of therapy no later than one year after the incident. The average duration of treadmill training was 6,6 weeks. The patients' age was an average 68 years (48 - 82). 87 % of the patients were able to improve their gait within the Functional Ambulation Categories (FAC) scale. 60 % of the patients achieved the ability to walk independently without technical aid. Apart from improving their gait, the patients also attained significantly increased scores in the motor scale of the Rivermead Motor Assessment (gross function) and the motor part of the ADL scale of the Barthel Index (items 2 - 4) and the Functional Independence Measure (items 3 and 4). Treadmill training is establishing itself as an important therapeutic approach in gait rehabilitation with patients with acquired brain damage.","983":"The cost pressures in the German health care system continue to rise. In the context of the introduction of the DRG system, adequate treatment of paraplegic and tetraplegic patients within the financial limits will become even more difficult. In dispute with health care insurance companies, scientifically sound studies have been lacking to justify a treatment lasting up to six months as an in-patient of individuals with acute spinal cord injury or disease. The FIM (Functional Independence Measurement), established as a reliable tool in the evaluation of the functional development of patients presenting with acute spinal cord lesions, has been used as the basic tool in our study. Under the conditions of a specialized spinal cord injury centre the FIM showed a statistically highly significant increase of functional independence during the entire course of treatment. No therapeutic standstill could be detected in order to determine a point of discharge. Even in the last six weeks of treatment significant progress in functional independence can be observed.","984":"","985":"","986":"","987":"","988":"","989":"The impact of missing data on the analysis of empirical data is a frequently unrecognized problem. Missing data may not only result in a decrease in the actual sample size but potentially biasing effects on statistical findings have to be considered as well. Two important points are made in this article: Firstly, it is shown why the identification of potential causes of missing data should be an inherent part of any data analysis; secondly, the handling of missing data should be based on appropriate assumptions in order to avoid biased results and problems concerning the interpretation of empirical findings.","990":"The structure of a rehabilitation unit is an important feature of the quality of care. Adequate and qualitatively good structures provide the basis for appropriate therapy offers and treatment and eventually, a better health for rehabilitants. The quality of structures is generally recorded without any evaluation of the aspects in particular. The definition of standards is the basis for such an evaluation. The project presented is aimed at the definition of relevant structural standards for rehab units with inpatient treatment for musculoskeletal, cardiac, neurological, gastroenterological, oncological, pneumological and dermatological diseases. Here, the distinction between basal criteria which have to be fulfilled by every rehab unit with inpatient treatment and criteria important for a well-aimed assignment of patients with specific needs (\"assignment criteria\") should be made. Apart from the documentation of structural attributes, the structural quality of a rehab unit can be described individually as well as in comparison with other units. Relevant structural criteria were defined in expert meetings by means of a modified Delphi-technique with five inquiries. Overall, 199 \"basal criteria\" and \"assignment criteria\" were defined. All criteria can be assigned to the two domains general structural characteristics (general characteristics and equipment of rooms; medical\/technical equipment; therapy, education, care; staff) and process-related structures (conceptual frames; internal quality management; internal communication and personnel development). The structural standards are applicable to units for musculoskeletal, cardiac, neurological, oncological, gastroenterological, dermatological and pneumological rehabilitation financed by the two main providers of rehabilitation, the statutory pension insurance scheme and the statutory health insurance scheme for all other five indications. The definition of structural standards agreed by experts in a formal consensus process, provides comprehensive and concrete requirements for German rehab units with inpatient medical rehabilitation. If the two main providers of rehabilitation both use the standards this can be regarded as a hallmark on the path to a unitary programme for quality management. The results enable units to analyse their weak points not just on an individual basis but allow also for a comparison between units, along with contributing to optimizing the structural quality of rehab units.","991":null,"992":"The present economic analyses of orthopaedic inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation (IPR resp. OPR) focus but on the evaluation of the expenses from the cost carrier's perspective. Lower intervention costs were related to OPR, whereas comparable social and clinical outcome was achieved. Comprehensive assessment of the economic consequences (resource utilization and lost productivity) of low back pain have not been performed up to now. Therefore, as part of a prospective follow-up study (1) a comparison of overall cost-of-illness and cost components 12 months prior and after IPR and OPR, respectively, was carried out in patients with low back pain and (2) the relative changes of these cost components were compared in a full-cost-analysis from a societal perspective. A total of 150 matched pairs (SR and AR) were followed prospectively over 12 months. Disease related costs in the year prior to the intervention were evaluated retrospectively. Prior to IPR and OPR overall costs amounted to 7010 and 7710 Euro, respectively, per person and year in patients with low back pain. As the main cost component of overall costs, sick leave (SL) periods account for 74% (IPR) and 76% (OPR), respectively. Inpatient costs represent the main component of direct costs. In the year after the intervention the costs due to sick leave periods still represent the major cost component (46 and 52%, resp.) of overall costs (3370 and 3600 Euro, resp.). Disease related cessation of work including work disability accounts for about 10% of productivity costs after IPR and OPR. Indirect costs still make up for the major part of overall costs (58 and 62%, resp.). No differences of cost components and their relative changes can be seen between patients participating in IPR and OPR, respectively, within both time frames. The comparison of overall costs in the 12 months before and after IPR and OPR reveals a cost reduction of 52% (IPR) and 53% (OPR), resp. This decrease of costs is mainly related to the reduction of SL periods, though costs due to inpatient treatment decrease as well. Summarizing, the present full-cost-analysis from a societal perspective shows no differences of cost components and cost changes between orthopaedic IPR and OPR in the 12 months prior to and after the intervention. Comprehensive cost-analyses reveal no obstacles for further implementation of OPR in the treatment of low back pain. Future development and diversification of rehabilitation measures should aim at evaluating real resource consumption during the intervention in detail as a basis for further allocational decision making.","993":"This investigation addressed the question whether non-medical personnel could produce similar ratings to physicians when applying ADL scales. A sports scientist was trained in the assessment of stroke patients with the Barthel Index, the Activity Index and the Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living Scale. He and a rehabilitation physician assessed 20 stroke patients in first in-patient rehabilitation with these instruments. Measurements of inter-rater reliability were calculated for scores, subscales and single items, and for the latter also rater correspondence. Inter-rater reliability was good to excellent for all scores and subscales (ICC: 0.82-0.99). Reliability and correspondence was good to excellent for the items of the Barthel Scale, satisfactory to excellent for those of the Activity Index. Some 25 % of the items of the Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living revealed unsatisfactory reliability but still high inter-rater correspondence. Results indicate that physicians and non-medical personnel are able to apply these scales reliably to stroke patients.","994":"Setting preferences and expectations before and appraisals and criticisms after neurological rehabilitation of stroke patients who fulfilled German phase-D criteria (cooperative and independent in basic ADL-functions) were longitudinally assessed in a rehabilitation centre with in-patient and out-patient facilities of comparable therapeutic quality and intensities, and followed-up for 6 months. 53 patients fulfilled inclusion criteria, of whom 16 opted for and received out-patient rehabilitation, 21 opted for out-patient rehabilitation but had to receive in-patient treatment mainly for geographical reasons, and 16 preferred and received in-patient rehabilitation. Setting preferences and setting assignment did not influence patients' expectations. When assessed at discharge and after 6 months, a considerable number of patients expressed changes in setting preferences and altered reasons for setting choice. At rehabilitation onset, patients were generally optimistic that rehabilitation would lead to an improvement of functional abilities and health status. This optimism was not fulfilled, although patients improved in functional independence\/activities of daily life and physical dimensions of quality of life. The subjective realization of expectations was neither associated with setting preference nor with realized setting. Improvements of functional disabilities and independence were not correlated with rehabilitation satisfaction. Patients were less disappointed with rehabilitation outcome the more they improved in dimensions of quality of life (or vice versa). The fact that setting preferences are indifferent and not stable over time indicates deficits of information and decision capacity in rehabilitation patients after stroke and may be explained by characteristics of this disease and a specific, short time-limit for decision-making. For the evaluation of rehabilitation programmes, it can also be concluded that multidimensional assessments such as the SF-36 cannot be replaced by patient satisfaction scores.","995":"","996":"What is meant by intention-to-treat? Why should data be analyzed in controlled trials in a way that all participants are included in the group to which they were randomly assigned, regardless of whether they completed the intervention given to the group? In this Tutorial, the logic of the intention-to-treat principle is outlined. It is shown that study results may be biased by excluding patients post hoc thus producing spurious effects that do not exist in the population under study. The intention-to-treat strategy avoids this bias.","997":"Book 9 of the German Social Code, effective as of July 1, 2001, was designed to bring about fundamental improvements in the situation of people with disabilities or at risk of being disabled. Somewhat more than two years after having come into force an extensive hearing on political level took place concerning the translation into action of this code. At the same time the legislator is planning first amendments to the Code. The author draws an interim balance concerning the translation into action of Book 9 of the German Social Code. The main emphasis of this statement is on the establishment of common service points as well as on the state of the arrangement of common recommendations at the Federal Rehabilitation Council.","998":"With different methodological approaches (postal survey, case analyses and focus group discussions) we investigated the attitudes of general practitioners (GPs) regarding the need, demand and effectiveness of medical rehabilitative measures. General Practitioners have a rather positive attitude towards rehabilitation in general. Male GPs have a tendency to be more sceptical than female GPs. With regard to the different measures within the German system, GPs show a differentiated opinion. They see a high number of patients who have a good benefit, though their definition of benefit differs from the statutory criteria for needs and outcomes. Patients and GPs mostly agree in their estimation of the outcome. Recent political ideas on improvement of the rehabilitative system are discussed on the basis of the results.","999":"In cooperation with the Hochrhein-Institute for Research in Rehabilitation (HRI), the Association for Assuring the Quality of Education in Physiotherapy Schools in Germany (ISQ) has developed a quality assurance programme for physiotherapy schools. It aims at assessing the quality of physiotherapy schools in Germany, and to award a quality seal based on compliance with defined criteria. First, a catalogue of quality features and criteria relevant for education in physiotherapy was developed. It is based on the analysis of questionnaires that had been sent to all German physiotherapy schools, to selected physiotherapists and leading physiotherapists in hospitals, to competent federal authorities, and to three school-classes with group discussions. The persons addressed named 360 different quality features. They were collected in a catalogue, revised in a multi-stage Delphi procedure, and approved consensually. The final criteria were transformed into basic quality requirements, and formulated as a check-list. Assessment of the quality features is carried out by trained visitors. In addition, the satisfaction of students is assessed with a questionnaire. The results of the interviews and the questionnaires are fed back to the schools in a quality report. Schools meeting all basic quality requirements are awarded the seal of quality. The seal is valid for three years. Since January 2003, this procedure is available for all schools in Germany. Until September 2002, a pretest of visitations and student questionnaires had been carried out with 31 member schools of the ISQ; according to the resulting quality reports, none of these schools would instantly be awarded the quality seal. In all, more than half of the schools do not meet 10 of the 42 basic criteria. Fundamental deficiencies have been found in the documentation pertaining to supervision of practical training. In terms of training, further training and professional development of their teachers and associated professors, needs for improvement could be shown in more than 66 % of all visited schools. Only 9 of 31 schools could produce a written syllabus. Additionally, the requirements of teachers conferences and equipment of libraries were not met by the majority. A general problem among the schools is inadequate documentation in many fields.","1000":"To investigate the impact of the way of allocation for rehabilitation on rehabilitation success in patients with chronic low back pain it was necessary to define appropriate criteria of success. A multidimensional model of success is presented in this article. First, the outcomes of rehabilitation are described and statistically tested. No statistically or clinically relevant changes between pre and post measurements were found. For further analysis of predictors and group comparisons it is necessary to define multidimensional success. For this purpose, cluster analyses are introduced as a possible model, resulting in three groups of patients with differing outcomes, i. e.: 20 % patients with declined pain symptoms, 40 % patients without any changes, 40 % patients with increased symptoms. No impact of the way of allocation for rehabilitation could be verified.","1001":"Work-related stress is an important determinant of the development of psychosomatic complaints and of the success of psychosomatic treatments. In order to specify work-related stress and resources in relation to the general population, 461 consecutive inpatients in psychosomatic rehabilitation were compared to matched pairs (age, sex, occupational status) from a representative community survey, the German Socio-economic Panel (GSOEP). Psychosomatic inpatients reported overall higher work stress than their matched pairs of the general population, the rank order of the stress factors as well as sociodemographic and occupational determinants were comparable. Patients also rated resources lower than their matched pairs. They reported much higher strains due to conflicts with supervisors and found less support among their colleagues. The items studied are useful to describe work stress profiles of psychosomatic rehabilitation patients and serve as a basis for therapeutic work.","1002":"Non-medical factors such as age, years of schooling, and job satisfaction play an important role in determining whether patients resume their work after rehabilitation treatment. One element is the way the work situation is perceived by the patient. Usually, aspects of strain or job concerns are assessed. But employment does also include positive and rewarding aspects, though, such as meaning or social contact. According to the concept of work-role quality, theoretically these are independent constructs: someone may perceive job concerns and job rewards at the same time. In this study a short questionnaire (FRQ-B), broadly adapted from Barnett, Davidson and Marshall (1991), measuring job concerns and job rewards was developed and administered to a sample of cardiac rehabilitation patients. Psychometric analysis shows the factorial validity, consistency and construct validity of the instrument. Prediction of the return to work status three months after discharge from rehabilitation could be achieved on the item and subscale level. The effect sizes were comparable to other significant variables (e. g. psychological status, NYHA-status, wish to work). Specificities vary from 30 to 60 percent. The best predictor seems to be the Fear Avoidance Belief Questionnaire (FABQ), assuming a causal relationship be-tween work and illness. An analysis of subgroups using the FRQ-B reveals patients who experience little job rewards as well as many job concerns as a group with a high risk of not returning to work. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of assessing work related variables when dealing with return to work after rehabilitation treatment. Interventions to change the perception of the working place situation should be initialized and focussed early in rehabilitation treatment. The need for further research integrating the concept of work-role quality is discussed.","1003":"","1004":"","1005":"This paper describes a paralyzed patient diagnosed with severe infantile cerebral palsy, trained over a period of several months to use an EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) for verbal communication. The patient learned to \"produce\" two distinct EEG patterns by mental imagery and to use this skill for BCI-controlled spelling. The EEG feedback training was conducted at a clinic for Assisted Communications, supervised from a distant laboratory with the help of a telemonitoring system. As a function of training sessions significant learning progress was found, resulting in an average accuracy level of 70% correct responses for letter selection. At present, \"copy spelling\" can be performed with a rate of approximately one letter per minute. The proposed communication device, the \"Virtual Keyboard\", may improve actual levels of communication ability in completely paralyzed patients. \"Telemonitoring-assisted\" training facilitates clinical application in a larger number of patients.","1006":"A sample of 184 Turkish migrants who had been treated in a department for psychosomatic rehabilitation, were included in a study using retrospective analysis of their clinical documents. Somatoform disorders and depressions predominated among the main diagnoses but somatic diseases and risk factors were frequent as well. Because of insufficient outpatient treatment, diagnostic procedures concerning somatic state often became necessary during the rehabilitation measure, uncovering previously unknown somatic diseases in 16% of the patients. The main focus of the psychotherapy offered to the migrants had been slightly more on unburdening from suffering, also it included more psycho-educational elements, but apart from this the quality and quantity of treatment hardly differed from a sample of German patients. Hence, though based on higher efforts and costs, the psychosomatic rehabilitation offered to the Turkish migrants had been implemented according to current standards. An important effect of inpatient rehabilitation seems to have been the working out of an overall therapeutic concept comprising all psychic and somatic problems. The very poor results in social-medical respects found in the study have with increasing experience been considerably improved in the meantime.","1007":"We investigated processes of and subjective reasons for resource allocation in three out of four rehabilitation specialists of a regional office of a major health insurance. Decisions of health insurance personnel include approval of and duration of rehabilitation treatment and choice of clinical provider. Insurance specialists are mainly involved in documentation and coordination, whereas decisions mainly follow expert recommendations, mainly of the medical service. Allocation is based primarily on somatic impairment and disability, psychosocial function, motivation and rehabilitation potential are regarded as secondary. Goals and expected results of rehabilitation are neither individually defined nor their achievement evaluated. Decision processes are dominated by routines and agreements. Only exceptionally, defined rules and procedures are applied. Active case management is hampered by a highly specialized internal structure of the investigated insurance fund. The optimal fulfillment of individual requirements for a limited-time rehabilitation treatment is the central criterion for decision making. However, the specialists lack detailed information concerning appropriateness, quality and efficacy of rehabilitation providers, especially when taking patient-related variables into account. Instead, they trust that only high-quality institutions are contracted. Systematic control and feedback of rehabilitation results is not available. The surveyed rehabilitation managers do not include cost aspects in their decision-making. They would regard this as alien to a member- and patient-oriented policy. Improvement potentials with respect to rehabilitation case management are being reviewed.","1008":null,"1009":"In rehabilitation research new therapies have to be evaluated within randomized trials as the best choice for proving the efficacy. Randomized controlled trials are widely accepted as the definitive method for evaluating the efficacy of new therapies. The random assignment of patients to their treatment ensures the internal validity of the comparison of new treatments with controls. Often patients in a randomized trial only represent a small proportion of the patients who satisfy the inclusion criteria of the trial. This will especially be true in rehabilitation medicine because of strong preferences of the patients for one or the other therapy. An assessment of the external validity of trial results can best be achieved by comparing the study population to the population of patients who met the eligibility criteria but did not consent to randomization. The Comprehensive Cohort Design (CCD) is designed to have the opportunity of recruiting all patients fulfilling these eligibility criteria regardless of their consent to randomisation. Advantages and disadvantages of this study design will be discussed in detail and on the example of the SARAH-study.","1010":null,"1011":"This paper reports the results of a peer review system that was implemented in the context of the quality assurance programme of the statutory German Pension Insurance scheme. The data reported refer to the 2000\/2001 data collection period for medical rehabilitation in the somatic indications. Examination of inter-rater reliability for judgements of individual raters shows satisfactory results only in orthopaedics. In the quality assurance programme, rehabilitation centres are usually evaluated by the mean of 20 rater judgements. The reliability of this aggregated measure is satisfactory in all indications. The results of 561 rehabilitation centres show that those quality criteria are in particular need of improvement that refer to subjective concepts of patients (e. g., subjective theories of illness). Between peer review procedures in 1998 and 1999, the quality scores of rehabilitation centres had improved whereas between 1999 and 2000\/2001, no further improvement can be shown. However, those rehabilitation centres with a low quality score in 1999 (lowest quartile of the distribution) underwent a positive development between 1999 and 2000\/2001. Reasons for this trend and possibilities for improving interrater reliability of the peer review process as an element of the quality assurance programme of the German Pension Insurance scheme are discussed.","1012":"The particular relevance of employment for financial independence, acquisition of social skills and, hence, an increase in self-confidence is undeniable, and has for several years now been increasingly considered an essential component of care notably in psychiatric disorders. Vice versa, unemployment is deemed a potential risk factor with regard to poorer therapeutic response and social integration as well as a higher incidence of crises in persons with mental illness. Schizophrenia is among the psychiatric disorders very often resulting in unemployment and subsequent early pensioning. Planning for vocational rehabilitation early-on during acute care therefore is considered of greatest importance especially in this patient group. This article gives a brief overview of the main concepts drawn on in preparing the vocational rehabilitation of patients with Schizophrenia, focussing in particular on their relevance for daily practice and the possibilities for evaluating their effectiveness.","1013":"Potentials, opportunities of performance--a spectrum of alternatives which can be activated when required as a single measure, varied or in total, low- or high-powered, specifically adjusted or compressed. There are dynamism and power to it! This sounds and feels different from what is demanded all over the world: \"standards\" or even \"minimum standards\", minimum quality standards and minimum performance levels, standard equipment, reducing things to the lowest possible common denominator, uniformity, not meeting clients' needs but serving all in the same way, not in the sense of optimum but of minimum. These short polemics are to elucidate the fundamental difference between client focus and client orientation. At certain times in the process of vocational rehabilitation, men and women with mental problems or illness need individually conceived, if necessary improvised, individually composed and well-coordinated services. What kind of men and women we cope with is stated in the chapter on \"Target groups\", neither completely nor exhaustively--there are no limits to the fantasy and the opportunities of development of clients. In a second major chapter, an attempt is made to show--regarding to some carefully, not arbitrarily selected but not all--the criteria for whom the Berufliche Trainingszentren (BTZ) have developed adequate, client-focused, individual potentials.","1014":"Within the setting of external quality management of mother-child rehabilitation centres the short-term and medium-term therapy effects as well as the disease profiles of patients were analysed. This paper is focused on the changing of the main symptoms among the mothers. The patients' state of health is essentially characterized by physical and psychological exhaustion as well as by multimorbidity. It is strongly associated with the mothers' current situation of living. Before intervention the patients' health status was significantly impaired. Directly after the treatment high or very high therapy effects were found. All indicators are still higher after 6 months than they were at the beginning of the treatment. The results of a quasi-control population give evidence that these effects are caused by the treatment. First trends about the children treated show that behaviour problems can be reduced and the quality of life enhanced.","1015":"Disease management programmes will increasingly be introduced in Germany due to the new risk adjustment scheme. The first disease management programmes started in 2003 for breast cancer and diabetes mellitus type II. German rehabilitation will have to face several challenges. Disease management programmes are strongly based on the notion of Evidence so that proof of the efficacy of a care giving task should be present. Verification of the evidence of the specifically German rehabilitation treatments must therefore be given. However, integration of rehabilitation in disease management programmes could lead to changes in the alignment of German rehabilitation. The essence of German rehabilitation, notably its holistic approach, could get lost with integration in disease management programmes.","1016":"Rehabilitation after stroke has to face specific problems when treating patients with more or less severe disabilities in cognition and communication. Correspondingly, stroke rehabilitation takes a special position within the larger field of rehabilitation, and relatively little is known outside the neurological scientific community about the status of patients at admission, the case mix in the centres and the short- and medium-term effects of rehabilitation. The present study describes in some detail the initial status in unselected samples of consecutive patients (n = 768) from three neurological rehabilitation centres. The description shows a very inconsistent picture in all centres, ranging from patients with no neurological deficits to patients needing intensive care. Across the centres, we found remarkable differences in case mix. In order to measure the effects of rehabilitation after stroke, an instrument was developed that combines a physicians' questionnaire aiming at an assessment of the severely disabled cases with a patients' questionnaire for the less severe cases for which the physicians' questionnaire would show \"ceiling effects\" so that improvements could no longer be depicted. The application of the instrument showed that about 50 % of the sample were not capable of answering the patients' questionnaire. For the patients with neurological deficits, the functional parameters of the physicians' questionnaire showed significant improvements at discharge that can be interpreted as \"strong\" effects (effect sizes 1.0-1.3). For the patients with less severe deficits (and usually in later stages of the rehabilitation process), the patients' questionnaire showed \"strong\" improvements on the somatic and psychosocial scales both at discharge and 6 months later. On the functional scales, however, only small improvements were found. Finally, predictors could be identified that explain a large amount of the variance for length of stay (R(2) =.42) as well as for the effects of rehabilitation (R(2) =.74). When comparing effects across rehabilitation units with differences of case mix, these predictors should be statistically controlled in order to assure fair comparisons.","1017":"A new orientation of rehabilitation in Germany has been initiated by the social political representatives in legislation and government, based on conceptualizations of self help movements in Europe and Germany. The goal is to form a new rehabilitation which is dedicated to participation and partnership of citizens with disability (\"Nothing about us without us\"). Empowerment is envisaged and resources supplied by legislation to allow to implement these new concepts (personal budget). To guarantee these new rights they have been codified in a new, 9th book of the German social code (Sozialgesetzbuch IX, SGB IX). This new perspective gives rise to major evolutionary impulses in rehabilitation, notably disabled persons' participation in self-assessment, in formulating their rehabilitation goals, determining and controlling the rehabilitation process, terminating rehabilitation (co-signing their discharge reports), as well as evaluating the outcome (quality control of rehabilitation results). They have the right to get all their medical information (right of informational independence). Seven guidelines of people with disability are formulated to support implementation of the new rehabilitation.","1018":"","1019":null,"1020":"The revised version 3 of the questionnaire \"Indicators of Reha Status\" (IRES-3) was recently tested and introduced to the scientific community. The IRES-3 differs considerably from the previous version. It now comprises 16 multi-item scales that are combined to 6 dimensions and 3 single items that are combined to a 7th dimension. The aim of the study was to receive a further impression of the psychometric properties of the IRES-3 in a clinical population. 1818 patients with musculoskeletal diseases from 10 rehabilitation hospitals completed the questionnaire at admission and at discharge. In addition to descriptive statistics (scale properties, internal consistency, sensitivity to change) logistic regression models were used to analyse the characteristics of patients in comparison to a random sample drawn from the general population. From a psychometric point of view the scale properties are sound. The internal consistency of the multi-item scales ranges from Cronbach's alpha = 0.77 to 0.93. The sensitivity to change ranges from SRM = 0.03 to 1.00. All scales of the IRES-3 are able to discriminate between the clinical and the general population. In all scales the clinical population demonstrated a higher level of burden than the general population. In our clinical population we were able to reproduce the measurement properties as reported by the authors of the IRES-3. The scales of the IRES-3 demonstrate good internal consistency and respond to change. A high discriminative validity of the instrument could be demonstrated. To further test the instrument the formation of dimensions by the authors of the IRES-3 has to be awaited. ","1021":"This paper gives a critical view on \"Goal Oriented Measurement\" (ZOE, Zielorientierte Ergebnismessung) with the IRES (Indicators of Rehabilitation Status) questionnaire. Gerdes (1998) proposed this method for individualizing outcome measurement in rehabilitation research. The rationale of Goal Oriented Measurement is described and differentiated from Goal Attainment Scaling and Patient Preferences. Subsequently, important shortcomings of Goal Oriented Measurement are pointed out: insufficient validity with regard to selecting clinically relevant problems, possible regression artifacts, unsuitably aggregated scores, possible reactivity, possible changes of individual problems, possible deteriorations in problems not initially selected, and plurality as well as small size of subsamples. Overall, Goal Oriented Measurement has to undergo substantial improvement.","1022":"The SF-36 Health Survey and its 12-item abridged form is an instrument for the assessment of health related quality of life that can be used with healthy persons and patient populations. Its use has been recommended within a large German multicentre rehabilitation research programme. The paper examines missing data across all five study projects of the North German Network for Rehabilitation Research (NVRF) as well as psychometric properties of the instrument. In addition, data were compared to representative norm data using the SF-36 (SF-12) in the German National Health Survey. Results showed that there were few missing data in the SF-36. Examining the impact of age, gender and health status yielded effects of higher age and female gender on missing data. Psychometric analyses showed good to excellent results of the instrument in terms of scale fit and reliability. In terms of convergent validity, medium to high correlation of the SF-36 subscales with comparable instruments (e. g. SCL-90-R) could be found. Summarizing, the SF-36\/SF-12 can be recommended for use in rehabilitation research. Analyses regarding sensitivity should be conducted in future studies.","1023":"Physician-accompanied vacation trips for heart patients (so-called \"heart vacations trips\") have been offered since 1981 and have been regulated by guidelines by the German Society of Prevention and Rehabilitation of Cardiovascular Diseases since 1993. The goal of this evaluation is to assess the satisfaction of the participants and to analyze the long-term impact on health-related quality of life. Between October 1995 and May 1998, 22 vacation trips with 228 participants were evaluated. Satisfaction with the vacation trips was assessed by a questionnaire specifically designed for this study. Health-related quality of life was measured with 5 discrete scales from the standardized and validated instrument \"Profile of Quality of Life for the Chronically Ill\" (\"physical capacity\", \"ability to enjoy and relax\", \"positive mood\", \"absence of negative mood\", \"sociability\"). The proportion of satisfied or very satisfied participants ranged from 81 % (accommodations) to 94 % (physician care). Regarding health-related quality of life, significant or borderline significant improvements were observed on three of the five scales (ability to enjoy and relax: p = 0.02, positive mood: p = 0.001, physical capacity: p = 0.08). Stratified analyses showed improvements for younger participants (&lt; or = 70 years) on all five quality of life scales, whereas no statistically significant improvement was found for older participants. Participants who had a cardiovascular disease other than coronary heart disease showed significant improvements on four scales, whereas participants with coronary heart disease only showed an increase on the scale \"positive mood\". This evaluation shows that physician-accompanied vacation trips were assessed very positively by the participants and that these trips are associated with long-term improvement in health-related quality of life for specific groups of participants.","1024":"Questions and results concerning the quality of cardiac rehabilitation are discussed, and the outcomes of a study on 104 female and 206 male patients suffering from first coronary events are reported. No gender differences were found as far as rehabilitation utilization or rehabilitation programs are concerned. Rehabilitation programs and medicinal therapy were the same in women and men. Satisfaction with the in-hospital rehabilitation was slightly higher in women, but there were no gender differences in the preferences for cardiac rehabilitation features. Gender in Germany seems not a relevant variable in cardiac rehabilitation. Further questions for research on gender differences are discussed.","1025":"Surveys with a main focus on back pain tend to isolate the complaint from possibly concomitant pains, other symptoms and disorders. Severe chronic back pain is assumed here to imply more than pain in the back. We report results from a two stage survey conducted in 1998 - 2000. The initial postal questionnaire addressed all 10,000 actively employed blue collar workers from a regional pension fund (Landesversicherungsanstalt Schleswig-Holstein) aged 40 - 54 and residing in or around Luebeck\/Germany (68 % males). Subjects reporting severe and disabling back pain were invited to a socio-medical examination. The response and participation rates were 58 % and 65 % respectively. Non-response and non-participation seem to result in minor though opposite, effects. The prevalence of current back pain (back pain of any severity within the past 7 days) is high (68 %; including 16 % with severe, disabling back pain) despite the preponderance of males and a probable healthy worker effect. 82 % of subjects participating in the second round reported recurrent or persisting back pain on the day of examination, in the majority with a chronic fluctuating and overall deteriorating course pattern. 18 % reported no current back pain and hence gave prospective (and additionally retrospective) evidence of an episodic-intermittent course of the disorder. The former group showed significantly more pains, bodily complaints, dysfunctional cognitions, emotional distress and concomitant disorders. 35 % of them indicated back pain as their dominant health problem; 49 % identified back pain and another disorder as dominant, and 16 % reported other prominent health problems. More than 70 % of \"other\" disorders originated from the musculoskeletal system often involving the extremities. Back pain is very common among blue collar workers. Severe disabling back pain is usually associated with numerous other pains, bodily complaints, disorders, and indicators of psychological distress (\"amplified back pain\"). However, even amplified back pain is not always the sole or dominant health problem. Assessing the degree of \"amplification\" seems helpful in splitting a previously homogeneous group of severely affected back pain sufferers-with possible prognostic and therapeutic consequences. ","1026":"","1027":"","1028":"","1029":"The psychometric properties of a 3-item scale for the assessment of subjective vocational disability were tested in 4279 blue-collar workers. Internal consistency of the scale was estimated by Guttman scaling. To evaluate construct validity the scale was compared to other measures of vocational ability, functional capacity, comorbidity, psychic status, and indicators of occupational handicap. The results are highly satisfactory, and the scale can be recommended for further use in rehabilitation research. Ongoing research is discussed.","1030":"The results of many studies show that physical recovery and social integration of cardiac patients are negatively influenced by a persistent depressive disorder. For this reason issues of occupational integration should be considered from this point of view, too. Correlations between various occupational groups and depression were investigated with 907 cardiac patients at the beginning and at the end of a follow-up treatment. The results were compared to those for 756 persons in corresponding age groups from the general population. We found that at the beginning of rehabilitation the depression values of the HADS did not show any significant differences between the various occupational groups, however, their values were significantly higher than those found in the general population. During rehabilitation the HADS values decreased significantly. At the end of rehabilitation, unskilled and semi-skilled workers had significantly higher depression values than skilled workers and persons in higher positions. Consequences for medical rehabilitation are discussed.","1031":"Fear of an increasing disease progression (fear of progression) is among the main psychological stresses in patients with cancer, diabetes mellitus (type 1 and type 2) and chronic arthritis. The questions the study seeks to answer are: (1) Which are the main fears of these patients?, (2) How and in which circumstances in life do they occur?, (3) Which are the triggers of the fear? To answer these questions, a sample of 65 patients were researched through interviews. The results indicate that the predominant fears of cancer patients are the fear of dying and the unpredictability of the progression of the disease. Patients with chronic arthritis most frequently fear being physically dependent on someone else. The most common anxiety of diabetes patients are long-term complications. For all three groups of patients job-related fears cause a high amount of distress. These results contribute to the development of a standardised fear of progression questionnaire.","1032":"Chronic back pain has a high personal impact, is frequent and of outstanding economical relevance. Analysis of the international literature indicates strong or moderate evidence for the effectiveness of multimodal multidisciplinary team care of chronic back pain. Our review aims at a complete review and critical appraisal of German studies of inpatient medical rehabilitation. We conducted a systematic search for relevant German studies (1\/1980 - 6\/2001) using electronic data bases, manual search of congress abstracts and postal questionnaires of 712 German rehabilitation clinics. Relevant studies were categorized according to the recommendation of the Cochrane Back Review Group. For all studies, aims, participants, type of intervention, evaluation time, main outcomes and results were extracted and tabulated. The effect size for 6 central outcome parameters (pain intensity, functional status, catastrophizing, depression, vitality, days on sickness leave) were calculated using pre-post comparisons and were integrated into short and long term weighted means of intra-group effect sizes. 30 studies, both controlled and uncontrolled, report a multitude of positive changes with inpatient rehabilitation treatment. Improvements included both somatic and psychological parameters. However, methodological quality was often poor; only three studies fulfilled the criteria for high quality. Comparison of meta analyses of German and international studies indicates partly good agreement (e. g. changes in pain intensity), partly discrepancies (e. g. functional ability in daily activities). Taken together, inpatient rehabilitation treatment for chronic low back pain in Germany appears to be of low to moderate efficacy. In the era of evidence based medicine, inpatient rehabilitation has to show its usefulness, necessity and efficiency as any other type of health care. For the German system of inpatient rehabilitation of chronic back pain available evidence is not conclusive, due to a lack of randomised controlled studies. The prevailing design of observational cohort studies has severe limitations in proving a causal relationship between outcomes and intervention. The international literature however provides more valid evidence in favour of the multimodal multidisciplinary intervention in chronic back pain. Under the assumption of a \"class effect\" of medical rehabilitation the German data seem to corroborate the conclusions drawn from international studies. ","1033":"After introducing DRGs (Diagnosis-Related Groups) in the prospective payment system for German hospitals, the use of per-case reimbursement for medical rehabilitation as well is being discussed. In particular two systems have already been tested internationally. FIM-FRG were especially developed for a prospective payment system for inpatient rehabilitation facilities. RUG-III are used for reimbursing long-term care in nursing homes and are based on a per-day payment. It is recommended to test the FIM-FRG or one of the refined systems in Germany in a pilot project.","1034":"In this paper, the concept of Shared Decision Making, i. e. the participation of the patient regarding the selection of therapeutic goals and treatment options, is presented. The degree of patient participation in medical decisions varies widely across different models of the physician-patient relationship. According to the paternalistic model, the physician knows best what is in the patient's interest; patient participation is limited. This model clearly does not take into account patients' autonomy and desire for information appropriately. In contrast, the informative model claims that values are well-known to the patient while the physician's role is restricted to providing him with the necessary information. However, the assumption of fixed values may be challenged. Patients expect their doctors to be not only technical experts but also caring persons. In the interpretive model, the physician's task is to help the patient to identify and express his values. In the deliberative model, both physician and patient engage in an open discussion about the values the patient could and should pursue. The physician is allowed to present his own preferences, and conflicting values are discussed explicitly. Thus, the patient is empowered to choose between alternative preferences. This model forms the basis of shared decision making, which involves at least two participants who engage in a process of both mutual information and interactive discussion. Patient participation should result in a greater sense of personal control, more satisfaction with treatment, better compliance and transfer into the daily routine of disease management and, consequently, better outcomes. Although it is largely unknown whether these outcomes are achieved, indirect evidence may be gained from systematic reviews showing that a favourable physician-patient communication (i. e. allowing patients to express their information needs and concerns and to receive both information and emotional support) produced better outcomes regarding both mental and physical health. There are several barriers to shared decision making. No information exists regarding the degree to which physicians are interested in shared decision making. While there is ample evidence that patients' needs for information are high, patients' wishes for participation seem to vary widely, though. Both physicians and patients require the ability to make shared decisions. Structural restraints include time and institutional inflexibility. To conclude, shared decision making is a promising approach to enhance patient participation in rehabilitative care.","1035":"","1036":"In comparison to other countries, the German health care system can be characterized by an exceptionally extended system of inpatient psychotherapeutic treatment. About 20,000 beds are available in three different, partly mutually competitive medical settings: psychosomatic\/psychotherapeutic hospital treatment, psychiatric hospital treatment and psychosomatic rehabilitation. The article first describes the latest developments and issues concerning the demarcation of tasks in these three therapeutic inpatient settings. The implementation of guidelines may contribute to a common understanding and function as a rational corrective with regard to the treatment appropriate for each individual case. Previous efforts to develop guidelines for the treatment of patients with psychiatric disorders are described. A special focus is put on the question of whether existing guidelines already fulfil the specific requirements for the rehabilitative treatment of these patients. The analysis reveals substantial deficits concerning the development of guidelines for the inpatient psychotherapeutic treatment in general as well as for the specific setting of psychosomatic\/psychotherapeutic rehabilitation. Given this situation, the authors propose a strategy with 5 stages to the development of guidelines for this target group.","1037":null,"1038":"Multidisciplinary team care is an opportunity to improve the long-term metabolic situation of patients with diabetes mellitus, hence can help reduce the individual and financial burden of diabetes-related complications. The aim of this study is to evaluate the extent to which patients undergoing rehabilitation carried by the German Federal Insurance Institute for Salaried Employees (BfA) were treated in accordance with recent evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on diabetes mellitus. We extracted specific treatment recommendations relevant to inpatient rehabilitation from national and international evidence-based guidelines and allocated them to general subjects of diabetes care (e. g. [disease specific] education, physical activity, psychosocial interventions). In the \"Classification of Therapeutic Procedures (KTL)\", an instrument used to classify therapeutic procedures in rehabilitation, we then identified those procedures that represented the recommendations of the guidelines. The coded procedures were allocated to the general aspects of diabetes care, too. In total, 9 \"therapeutic modules\" were designed, each containing guideline-recommendations and coded procedures. Using the KTL codes documented as a routine in discharge reports, we were able to describe, analyse and evaluate the procedures performed during rehabilitation. The data set we used contained KTL codes and medical information from 9,456 patients whose rehabilitation was carried by the BfA diagnosed with either diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2, who received an inpatient rehabilitation procedure during the years 2000 and 2001. The number of patients who received at least one procedure out of the particular therapeutic module is as follows (numbers in brackets represent the total number of KTL codes in that therapeutic module): Therapeutic module \"Education (3)\" - 98.66 %, \"Exercise Training (63)\" - 92.42 %, \"Nutrition Training (14)\" - 96.44 %, \"Stress (18)\" - 35.33 %, \"Motivation (15)\" - 82.87 %, \"Coping Skills (15)\" - 27.42 %, \"Social Work (26)\" - 11.44 %, \"Alcohol and Nicotine (24)\" - 3.69 %, \"Diabetic Complications (81)\" - 75.42 %. On average patients received procedures out of 5.2 different therapeutic modules. The results were consistent over subgroups (type 1\/type 2 diabetes, men\/women) but varied considerably between clinics. The care provided in clinics with higher numbers of diabetic patients is more in line with guideline specifications. A substantial number of patients received procedures out of the therapeutic modules \"Education\", \"Exercise Training\", \"Nutrition Training\" and \"Motivation\". In other therapeutic modules (e. g. \"Alcohol and Nicotine\") deficits were noted. These deficits as well as the substantial variation between clinics demonstrate the need to develop clinical practice guidelines for rehabilitation of patients with diabetes. In principle, the results of this study have to be interpreted carefully because we did not examine to which extent the documented processes are in accordance with the realities. Inpatient rehabilitation of diabetic patients carried by the BfA can be characterised as multidisciplinary and in accordance with the recommendations of recent evidence-based guidelines. Certain problematic aspects should be put into focus. A guideline taking into account all rehabilitative aspects, including the preparation for and the care after the rehabilitation process, can be instrumental in reducing deficits in rehabilitative care as well as differences between clinics. To gain wide acceptance, guideline development should be coordinated by a scientific institute and involve members of all groups concerned (e. g. the rehabilitative team, GPs, patients). Within certain limits the \"KTL\" instrument permits evaluation of process quality in rehabilitation of patients with diabetes mellitus. ","1039":"This project aims to develop an evidence based clinical guideline for the rehabilitation of cardiac patients considering recent scientific literature (stage 1), procedures received by cardiac patients undergoing rehabilitation carried by the German Federal Insurance Institute for Salaried Employees (BfA) based on the Classification of Therapeutic Procedures (KTL) (stage 2), and expert agreement of the professionals involved (stage 3). This study presents the results of stage 2. The analysis of the KTL-statistics was carried out to determine whether it is essentially necessary to implement a guideline and to define \"critical\" aspects, i. e. aspects that require high priority implementation. The project is part of a research programme funded by the BfA. 317 out of the 840 possible KTL-codes were attributed to one of twelve therapeutic modules that--according to the results of stage 1--are characteristics of cardiac rehabilitation. For these modules the number of people having received therapeutic procedures belonging to the respective module the duration per patient and per week were calculated. The influence of concomitant factors such as age, gender and indication were analysed multivariately. Furthermore, the hospitals involved were compared. The analyses are based on approximately 87,400 KTL-entries from 5,494 patients (indication: \"myocardial infarction\" or \"coronary artery bypass surgery\") treated in 2000. On average the patients receive therapeutic procedures \"stemming\" from 5.5 modules. More than 90 % receive procedures assigned to the modules \"endurance training\" or \"motivation\", respectively, and almost 70 % from \"nutrition training\". The other modules are rendered not consistently and occasionally to a relatively small degree. Younger patients following a myocardial infarction receive therapeutic procedures more frequently and longer while older patients after bypass surgery are treated less frequently and for a shorter duration. There is substantial variability between individual clinics. It appears to be necessary to implement clinical practice guidelines in all evaluated therapeutic modules but \"endurance training\" and \"motivation\". An evidence based clinical practice guideline for the rehabilitation of cardiac patients should detail the kind and extent of procedure(s) required. It should also inform about the lack of evidence for variations in treatment with respect to age, gender, or indication. To facilitate monitoring of the degree of implementation of the guideline precise instructions for the documentation using the KTL should be developed and implemented. As a next step towards an evidence based, empirically proven and acceptable guideline this project's results will be discussed with experts from science and clinical practice. ","1040":"The importance of guidelines increases continuously on the political level whereas on the user level reservations and uncertainty persist. Consequently guidelines are not considered as they should be. Guidelines will develop their effectiveness only if they are firmly implemented in the delivery process. Acceptance problems spring from problems in development and from aspects of dissemination and implementation not sufficiently considered so far. Therefore a lot of countries have developed quality criteria for guidelines and programmes for quality promotion. To further the use of guidelines in the care process aspects of dissemination and implementation have to be recognized even in the development process. This has not been recognized sufficiently so far. Implementation of guidelines is a systematic approach which has to be connected seamlessly with other activities (e. g. quality management). The implementation process should be accompanied and evaluated so that a continuous adjustment is possible. Most of the existing guideline programmes do not consider this sufficiently. The following contribution gives a survey of results and introduces means and instruments for assessment and implementation of guidelines.","1041":"Clinical practice guidelines are relevant to all parties involved in the health system. For rehabilitation under the German pension insurance scheme, there are two main aspects: the integration of rehabilitation into the curative guidelines in terms of \"local tailoring\" on the one hand and the development of guidelines for rehabilitative processes, demand-oriented control of rehabilitation access, and rehabilitative aftercare on the other hand. The elaboration of effective standards is aimed at avoiding over-provision, under-provision or misdirected provision of care and, simultaneously, at ensuring that quality assured treatment is offered to the rehabilitees. Also, it is intended to increasingly implement evidence-based medicine in a sector of the health system in which research has so far been underrepresented. Implementation of guidelines in the rehabilitative sector will allow to disseminate existing knowledge in targeted manner, to systematically fill the gaps and to broaden the knowledge base as a whole. Furthermore, guidelines can facilitate integration of the different sectors in health care provision by operationalising the interfaces both with curative medicine and primary prevention. Throughout the process of guideline development for rehabilitation the specific characteristics of this sector must be kept in mind. Since therapeutic interventions are multidisciplinary and multimodal in nature guidelines have to be comprehensible and applicable for all members of the multiprofessional team. Corresponding to the relative paucity in rehabilitation research there is no sufficient evidence base for numerous therapeutic interventions. Accordingly, guidelines in rehabilitation will--initially--consist of a mixture of evidence- and consensus-based recommendations. Also, the specific goal of rehabilitation under the German pension insurance scheme, namely maintenance or recovery of the capacity at work, has to be borne in mind. There are many initiatives by the providers of rehabilitation as well as the scientific medical societies to develop and implement rehabilitative clinical practice guidelines, e. g. the guidelines programme of the BfA (Federal Insurance Institute for Salaried Employees), which is aimed at developing rehabilitation process guidelines for selected indications, the guidelines activities of the VDR (Federation of German Pension Insurance Institutes), and the input of the \"Guidelines\" commission of the DGRW (German Society of Rehabilitation Science). It is hoped that in the years to come the parties involved in German health care provision will be open to the advantages of clinical practice guidelines. Rehabilitation under the German pension insurance scheme, with respect to its experience with quality assurance, its responsibilities for structure and concept and a growing acceptance on the part of care providers, already holds a well-founded starting position.","1042":"","1043":"","1044":"","1045":"In Germany the assessment of needs for technical aids occurs widely unsystematic and without the possibility to verify the advice process. A systematic assessment of individual needs for technical aids that follows standardised indication criteria so far has not been paid much attention. Compared with this, the advice and supply measures in the Netherlands are increasingly based on a systematic and comprehensible analysis of the individual inquiry. This analysis is called \"indication and selection advice\" and is usually carried out by therapists. Under Dutch law, consultants can act rather independently of any commercial interest. The basics of the analysis derive from the ICIDH and theoretical models of occupational therapy. Besides an overview of the legislation on the supply with technical aids in the Netherlands, the procedure of needs assessment plus a specific instrument based on occupational therapy knowledge are presented. The realization of advice as a defined part of the supply process required a new definition of tasks for occupational therapists. The resulting changes in the comprehension of professional roles are briefly described, too. The results of this investigation regarding the practice of needs assessment in the Netherlands suggest that changes are also required in the German service delivery system and its legal basis. Because of their specific expert knowledge of indication and selection of suitable technical aids, a more extensive involvement of occupational therapists in this key process of measures of home adaptation and the supply with technical aids is recommended in Germany, too. The development of practicable, standardised instruments to assess individual needs is advisable because it will contribute to increased efficiency of the supply with technical aids.","1046":"In Germany, complex and intensified outpatient geriatric rehabilitation is currently scarcely practised, mainly in model projects. The evaluation of these projects is exclusively conducted in uncontrolled studies. In our project \"AMBRA\", two different organisational models of geriatric rehabilitation are compared: a mobile rehabilitation team based at a geriatric hospital department and an outpatient rehabilitation centre run by GPs trained in geriatrics. Outcomes were assessed in terms of capability of self-care (Barthel-Index), mobility (Tinetti-Test, Timed \"Up &amp; Go\"-Test, TUG), and depression (Geriatric Depression Scale, GDS). They were documented at three points in time (start of rehabilitation, end of rehabilitation, 6 months after end of rehabilitation) and analysed by multivariate analyses of variance (repeated measurements). 162 complete patients histories were taken in the first 18 months of the project. They show significant improvements in capability of self-care and mobility (both Tinetti-Test and TUG) between the beginning and the end of rehabilitation (adjusted for age, sex, cognitive function, diagnosis, rehabilitation model). On a medium-term basis, these results remained stable (TUG declined, however). Average GDS values did not change significantly. There were no significant sex- or age-related effects. The patients' cognitive function influenced changes in the results of the Barthel-Index and the Tinetti-Test. Patients with skeletal diseases showed less favourable trends in the Barthel-Index as did patients with cognitive impairments caused by vascular disease in the TUG, but these patients also benefited in the course of the model rehabilitation procedures. Differences in trends between patient groups of the two models were observed in the Barthel-Index. 96 % of patients previously living at home were still living there at the end of rehabilitation, 91 % were still living there 6 months after the end of rehabilitation. At the end of rehabilitation, 67 % of patients described an improvement of their personal situation associated with the rehabilitation procedure. Six months later, 82 % described an improvement or a stabilisation of their personal situation. Our results show positive medium-term rehabilitation trends concerning medical and subjective outcomes. In order to analyse effectiveness, we will have to wait for the results of a regional control group which is being recruited.","1047":null,"1048":null,"1049":"This article reports on a questionnaire concerning individual problems in psychosomatic rehabilitation. A sample of 858 patients answered the questions at the beginning and on a one year catamnestic measurement. First, the frequency of occurrence of several symptoms was asked. Second, the rehabilitants were asked to indicate for each symptom if it was an important problem before treatment. This procedure of identifying problems was done at the beginning (prospective marking) and also at the one year follow up (retrospective marking). The questionnaire allows to compute eight subscales and one global scale regarding all items (classical approach). Frequency of occurrence decreased with an average effect size (ES) of 0.56 on the global scale. In the next step, measurement was individualized by regarding only items which were marked as relevant problem. By prospective marking, effect size was 1.32. By retrospective marking, no growth of effect size in comparison to the classical approach was found (ES = 0.56). The results indicate that the prospective approach of identifying problems is the better way of individualizing measurements. Moreover, the impact of individual problem definition on outcome was demonstrated.","1050":"The \"Ergotherapeutische Assessment\" (EA, occupational therapy assessment instrument) is designed as a generic instrument assessing disabilities with consequences on everyday life.

The EA is integrated in an assessment network currently in development intended for occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech therapy and, optionally, for further professions. The profession-specific approach should enhance the intrinsic motivation for self-evaluation and thus the learning organisation.","1051":"In an exemplary way the case study of M. S. shows that the statements concerning aptitude, which are based on intelligence structure tests, lead to false positive judgements under certain preconditions. Particularly if you postulate learning disorder and partial amnesia, the standard status diagnosis via intelligence and achievement tests has to be supplemented by a method of testing by which the dynamics of cognitive processes can be recorded. In the individual case study of M. S., learning disorder and partial amnesia have been disclosed via the dynamic learning test by Seitz (1998). They did not become manifest when only the routine diagnostic methods were applied. Against the background of socio-legal implications of the specific case some demands on psychological diagnosis and valuation are being discussed from the practician's point of view. They subsequently lead to certain demands concerning academic research. This applies above all to the dynamic learning test which is described above. It states as a result a linear relationship between the effort put into learning and the quantity of learning (the slope is interpreted as an individual constant). The dynamic learning test is also likely to be interesting in respect to pure research in general psychology and the formation of theories.","1052":null,"1053":"The recommendations for aftercare listed in discharge reports represent a core component of communication between inpatient psychosomatic rehabilitation and ambulatory follow-up care. The standardized discharge report used by the pension insurance institutes makes use of a generic category system for systematization and simplification of recommendations for aftercare. Neither the practice of making recommendations for aftercare as observed by therapists and physicians responsible for treatment in the inpatient setting nor the appropriateness and differentiation of the category system has previously been systematically examined. A randomized sample of discharge reports was analyzed for this purpose. A sample of 500 discharge reports from an inpatient-oriented psychosomatic rehabilitation setting were analyzed regarding the categories of recommended aftercare measures and their relationship with socio-demographic variables, clinical diagnosis and sociomedical variables. Outpatient psychotherapy represents the most frequently recommended aftercare treatment, being suggested in nearly 70% of the patients. Further substantial percentages were found in recommendations for areas including occupational rehabilitation, somatic-medical recommendations, and recommendations for health behaviour and self-help groups. In approximately one quarter of the patients, recommendations for aftercare were given that were coded under the category of \"other suggestions\". In younger and socio-medically burdened patients, recommendations for the fields of occupational rehabilitation and psychotherapy were more frequently given. In patients with a somatic illness or a somatoform disorder as the primary diagnosis, recommendations within the field of outpatient psychotherapy were found less frequently, while recommendations in the somatic-medical area were more commonly found. The results give some support for the clinical validity of the form of recommendations given for aftercare measures in an inpatient psychosomatic rehabilitation setting. At the same time, the analyses indicate excessive as well as insufficient differentiation in the generic category system for follow-up treatment recommendations, which could lead to a loss of valuable information at the interface between inpatient and outpatient treatments. ","1054":"Sustained psychosocial burdens as a consequence of stroke not only affect the stroke victim but frequently their spouses and significant others as well. The present study analyses the extent of emotional burden in spouses of stroke patients (Beck Depression Inventory, BDI and Beck Anxiety Inventory, BAI), examining the relationships of emotional burden in spouses with the medical assessment regarding stroke severity (Barthel Index, BI) and with the spouses' own perceptions of the stroke patients' impairment (Patient Competency Rating, PCR) as well as determining the factors that were independently associated with emotional burden in spouses. 82 spouses of stroke patients are examined in our study. The questioning was realised on admission into inpatient or partially inpatient rehabilitation centres. Initial results indicated that relatives of stroke victims have higher scores for anxiety compared to the general population. The assessment of disability in the stroke victims by their spouses correlates directly with the psychosocial burden of the spouses. By using this methodology, a high-risk group of spouses could be identified. The predictors of emotional burden in spouses (Anxiety and Depression) are gender of spouse and the spouse's subjective perception of disability in the stroke victim. The age of spouses and medical assessment of the severity of stroke on the other hand have no predictive value for the extent of emotional burden in spouses.","1055":"To study goal-setting for patients with psychological stress in orthopaedic and cardiac rehabilitation centres. A questionnaire assessing patients' somatic, functional and psychosocial status (\"IRES\"-questionnaire) was administered to 3109 patients with musculoskeletal diseases and 1670 patients with cardiovascular diseases from a total of 26 rehabilitation centres at their admission and discharge. For all patients, physicians filled in the \"Physician's Sheet\" (\"Arztbogen\") that assesses patient-specific goals of therapy. Nearly 50 % of the patients suffered from psychological stress at their admission. Of the patients with high psychological stress (higher than in 90 % of the general population) only 11.1 % (musculoskeletal diseases) and 3.4 % (cardiovascular diseases) were diagnosed as having a mental disorder (ICD-10 diagnosis in the range of F00 - F99). High psychological stress reported by patients themselves is associated with only a small increase of goal setting in psychological therapy documented in the \"Physician's Sheet\". The most important factors that influence the predefinition of psychological goals of therapy are high multimorbidity, an ICD-10 diagnosis in the range of F00 - F99, low age, high motivation for rehabilitation and being a woman. However, statistically significant differences between rehabilitation centres in the predefinition of psychological goals of therapy were detected. It can be assumed that differences in concepts of therapy are responsible for this finding. The results show that physicians use the patient's self-assessments of their psychological stress only to a small extent while planning psychosocial interventions and care. The predefinition of goals in a context of \"forced\" consideration of patients self-assessments leads to a higher degree of consistency between patients' judgements and goal settings. It also shows a slightly higher predictive power for rehabilitation effects than the predefinition of goals of therapy without noticing patients' self-assessments. This demonstrates the usefulness of a patient-centred screening instrument for psychological stress in orthopaedic and cardiac rehabilitation. ","1056":"Using routine data collected in 2000 for the quality assurance programme of the German Pension Insurance subjective mental impairment and disorders documented in discharge letters of patients undergoing rehabilitation funded by the Federal Insurance Institute for Salaried Employees (BfA) (n = 19,272) were correlated with psychological treatment and inpatient somato-medical rehabilitation provided. The results show discrepancies between self-evaluation, original diagnosis and treatment received. The frequency of treatments varies between hospitals. The differences in treatment are attributed rather to a varying quality of implementation of the bio-psycho-social concept than to a lack of human resources.","1057":"The detection of patients with comorbid mental disorders is of high clinical importance in cardiac and orthopaedic rehabilitation. To simplify detection of cases, screening instruments are recommended. This study investigated the discriminant validity of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-D) to identify patients with comorbid mental disorders and specifically affective or anxiety disorders. 213 patients with cardiovascular diseases and 206 patients with musculoskeletal diseases participated in a two-stage survey. Patients were assessed with the GHQ-12 and the HADS-D; and they were examined for DSM-IV mental disorders by clinical standardized interview (CIDI). Validity of the two screenings regarding the detection of mental disorders was compared using ROC-analysis. In both patient groups the HADS-D performed better in nearly all analyses compared to the GHQ-12, especially in the detection of affective disorders (AUC in cardiac patients 0.78, in orthopaedic patients 0.79). Both screening instruments can be used for the detection of comorbid affective and anxiety disorders in patients with cardiovascular and musculoskeletal diseases. Limitations in performance of screening instruments are due to the different methodological approaches of tests as well as to difficulties in diagnosing mental disorders in patients with physical illness.","1058":"An association between mental disorders, musculoskeletal and cardiovascular diseases has been reported in many clinical studies with inpatients. However, no data exist about the prevalence of mental disorders in patients undergoing rehabilitation treatment for musculoskeletal and cardiovascular diseases. The present study investigates 4-week, 12-month and lifetime prevalence rates of comorbid mental disorders in more than 1700 patients out of 10 rehabilitation clinics. The patients were screened (GHQ-12, HADS) in the context of a two-stage epidemiological survey. In the second-stage examination a subsample of 369 patients was interviewed with a standardized clinical interview (CIDI) in order to obtain DSM-IV and ICD-10 diagnoses of mental disorders. 43 % (musculoskeletal) and 36 % (cardiovascular) of the patients have high GHQ-scores (cut off &gt; 4). Furthermore, up to 24 % of the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular patients have elevated scores on the HADS subscales depression and anxiety (cut off &gt; 10). For the 4-week period, prevalence rates of mental disorders in the sample of patients with musculoskeletal diseases are 31 % and 20 % in the sample of patients with cardiovascular diseases. The most frequent current disorders are affective and anxiety disorders. The high psychosocial burden expressed by the patients and the prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders emphasize the importance of (1) effective diagnostic strategies to recognize mental disorders, (2) specialized psychological services in rehabilitation clinics, which provide psychological support and effective interventions for patients with musculoskeletal and cardiovascular diseases.","1059":"There is a close association between psychological strain as well as psychological disorders and somatic diseases. Psychological impairments are embedded in a complex interacting model of somatic illnesses and psychological strain and not only a reaction due to physical disease. Comorbidity of depressive or anxiety disorders and medical diseases have been consistently reported in clinical studies whereas the association between substance abuse, somatoform disorders and eating disorders with chronic somatic disease has been examined less. This article describes relevant explanation models as well as risk factors, e. g. neurobiological, psychological and social factors, which have an impact on this association between mental disorders and chronic physical diseases. Moreover, etiological models for the comorbidity of oncological, cardiovascular and musculoskeletal diseases on the one hand and psychological disorders on the other hand are explained. Epidemiologic and family genetic investigation models will improve the knowledge about comorbidity in the future. Combining these approaches with neuroscientific and biopsychiatric models will enhance the knowledge about pathogenesis of comorbid disorders. Beside the scientific aim, the correct diagnosis and treatment of comorbid mental disorders is an important issue. Therefore improved diagnostics and treatment of psychological disorders has a substantial function in medical rehabilitation.","1060":"","1061":"","1062":"Further development of needs-based, efficient health care structures in particular for people with chronic illness, and in conjunction with them, is the paramount objective of SGB IX, book 9 of the German social code. To achieve this it is necessary to define treatment sequences across sectoral boundaries in health care, and to establish cooperation between community-practice physicians, hospitals, rehab and long-term care facilities, cost carriers, and people with disabilities. In this context, the article discusses the current rank of rehabilitation and participation, points out the underlying conflicting issues and interests, and posits the preventive-integrative rehabilitation paradigm at the very centre of health protection networking.","1063":"Regional networking facilitates flexible and individual integration of vocational programmes in medical rehabilitation. We present a pilot project of Theresienklinik II in cooperation with the Education centre for occupation and health (Bildungszentrum Beruf und Gesundheit) in Bad Krozingen. Orthopaedic and cardiac patients who are in danger to lose their capacity to work, participate in an integrated vocational reorientation programme during extended medical rehabilitation. The aim of the pilot project is an early assessment of motivation, work hardening, aptitude and interest, in order to accelerate vocational retraining and reintegration. Within one year 30 patients participated in the programme. Presented are the contents and course of the pilot project. First results show a high patient satisfaction with the programme.","1064":"The article describes the necessity of medical information also in patients with severe injury, as a conclusion of subjective illness theory (\"lay theory\") and other theoretical considerations. Analysing the data of a retrospective questionnaire investigation, 71 persons with spinal cord injuries were explored concerning psychological issues of rehabilitation. The results show empirical evidence of expected positive psychological correlations if patients are satisfied with their medical information. There is a low rate of well-informed patients as well as a high need for this particular information about diagnosis and prognosis; possible reasons are discussed and the lack of information is argued.","1065":"In Germany and other countries a possibly lower programme attendance in cardiac rehabilitation of women compared to men has been critically discussed for many years. Up to now however there are only limited data related to gender-specific utilization rates and programme attendance. In a longitudinal study with three points of measurement, 496 men and 172 women after an acute myocardial infarction and their physicians were asked to complete questionnaires referring to different aspects of the medical and psychosocial situation as well as to provision of acute cardiac care and rehabilitation services. The results show that currently in Germany no gender differences exist in the use and provision of cardiac rehabilitation. Whether this apparently \"fair\" distribution in relation to gender can be seen as an adequate supply however is questionable in the context of different needs - especially with respect to the different psychosocial conditions of women and men.","1066":"New therapies in rehabilitation medicine have to be evaluated with clinical trials. For drug approval the methodology of clinical trials is standardized world wide and the results of these studies are widely accepted. This standard should be achieved in clinical trials in rehabilitation research, too. One of the standards is the existence of a control group, comparing the effect of the new intervention against controls. In addition, the investigational and control groups must be equal in terms of the structure of possible confounders. Randomisation is the best possibility to distribute the patients to the therapy-groups, confounders will be equally distributed by chance. Other procedures for assignment to the study groups can result in confounding and lead into biased results. In spite of these advantages, randomisation is not generally accepted in rehabilitation research up to now. There are some reservations, mostly ethical, organisational and methodological ones. However, randomised clinical trials should be conducted in rehabilitation research in order to obtain more convincing results. Our intention is to bring some input in this debate and to present basics and practical aspects of randomisation.","1067":"","1068":"","1069":"Effective as of July 1, 2001, the new Book 9 of the German Social Code is designed to bring about fundamental improvements in the situation of people with disabilities or at risk of being disabled, to be realized by replacing welfare and provision by the notion of participation: By making available the social services and supports needed, people with disabilities are to be enabled to participate in the life of the community and, notably, in working life. Focussing on people with disabilities, the author outlines some of the reformatory approaches and innovations in Book 9 and describes the steps taken by the various rehabilitation carriers over the last few months in order to implement the legislator's intentions, hence to improve the situation of people with disabilities.","1070":"The SGB IX is the legal basis of rehabilitation in Germany since 2001. It is embedded in the codification of the German social code, the Sozialgesetzbuch (SGB). There it has an intermediate function between the general social law and the special laws of the social insurance and social security institutions. Rehabilitation in Germany is working in a system of several different institutions with different legal roots. In special these are compensation of damages caused by employment accident and war and the avoidance of disability benefits by rehabilitation and activation. Inequality of treatment of disabled people according to the cause of their disability and to their employment status are accepted less; common principles of rehabilitation are being searched. Important reforms of rehabilitation law have taken place in 1974 and 1975. Since then problems have become visible in implementation and in the coordination of the complex system. SGB IX is a new effort for a general rehabilitation law. Open questions remain in handling the relations between rehabilitation and sickness treatment, long term care and prevention. Important are the newly defined terms for participation (Teilhabe) and disability (Behinderung), which build the linkage of SGB IX with constitutional law and with the health sciences. A weak point is still the relation of disability and age. Political attempts for unequal benefits in health insurance endanger the now reached level of rehabilitation law.","1071":"In this study, we report on the development and validation of a questionnaire measuring job satisfaction in rehabilitation centres. The questionnaire \"Fragebogen zur Mitarbeiterzufriedenheit in Rehabilitationskliniken\" (\"MiZu-Reha\") consists of 75 items. Three scales measure work climate, leadership and work organisation\/communication. Further items assess weak points of work organisation and job satisfaction with several predefined aspects (e. g., career opportunities and salary). The scales have good internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha between 0.86 and 0.94. The dimensionality of the scales was established by confirmatory factor analyses. Correlations between the MiZu-Reha scales and independent satisfaction measures indicate the validity of the questionnaire. Correlations between the MiZu-Reha scales and indicators of patient satisfaction, process quality and outcome are in all cases positive (the higher the job satisfaction, the better the quality of rehabilitation), though weak and statistically not significant. Rehabilitation centres differ clearly from each other regarding job satisfaction of their employees. This shows the usefulness of clinic comparisons based on the MiZu-Reha. The questionnaire can be utilized in external quality assurance programmes, in the context of internal quality assurance measures (e. g. the Business Excellence Model of the European Foundation of Quality Management, EFQM) and in the use of management instruments such as the Balanced Scorecard.","1072":"The Lequesne Algofunctional Index is a widespread international instrument and recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for outcome measurement in hip and knee diseases. Up to now there has been no German version of the questionnaire fulfilling the guidelines for cross-cultural adaptation and providing satisfactory metric quality. Based on these guidelines, we developed the German version of the Lequesne Algofunctional Index regarding osteoarthritis of the hip and knee joints presented in this article. All of the questions it contains have been worded as whole sentences, questions concerning walking performance have been substantiated by examples. In testing of the metric outcome (hip: n = 112; knee: n = 83), both questionnaires showed an excellent reliability (IKK &gt; 0,88). As a validity criterion, the correlation with the WOMAC score was tested. We received a Spearman coefficient between 0,63 and 0,81, indicating a high correlation. Time needed to fill in the Lequesne score was 2 min. in patients, physicians took 1,2 min. to evaluate the questionnaire. Regarding the questionnaires handed back, the Lequesne score showed better results than the WOMAC index. Sensitivity, measured by the \"standardized response mean\", was good in both regions for the total score. Comparing the data received on pain-related questions, the WOMAC score however showed a better sensitivity. The German version of the Lequesne Algofunctional Index is a suitable outcome instrument to measure the intensity of pain, walking capacity and activity of daily life in patients with osteoarthritis of hip and knee joints.","1073":"Type 2 diabetes is considered a multidimensional health impairment which includes several components like risk factors, cofactors and complications. The early and consequent therapy of all of these components reduces secondary complications. Instead of simply applying drug treatment, a more holistic concept including behavioural medicine therapy and empowerment of patients has been found much more effective. The facilities required for such a multifactorial therapy by different health care professions could easily be provided by the medical rehabilitation services available under the German pension insurance scheme. However, this emphasizes the demand for standardized protocols to achieve an objective allocation of rehabilitation services to individuals in need. In an epidemiological study on 12 429 working insurants (age 41 - 60 years) of the pension insurance fund in the region of Luebeck, persons suffering from type 2 diabetes were identified and evaluated regarding a need for medical rehabilitation. Therefore, an algorithm was developed quantifying the multidimensional disturbances which accumulate in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The following indicators are taken into consideration: risk factors like eating behaviour, lack of physical activity, smoking and stress; metabolic parameters such as HbA1c and plasma lipids; cofactors like hypertension and depression and, additionally, the acute complication of hypoglycaemia. Based on this rehabilitation score, 19 % of cases in a preliminary evaluation of 79 patients with type 2 diabetes showed a need for medical rehabilitation therapy.","1074":null,"1075":"In the past ten years, the German pension scheme has launched several initiatives that can be regarded as milestones on the way to a scientifically founded rehabilitation system. These initiatives were: the Rehab Commission (1989 - 1991), the Quality Assurance Programme (since 1994), and the German Research Funding Programme \"Rehabilitation Sciences\" (in cooperation with the Federal Ministry for Education and Research, since 1996). As a next step on this way, we propose an initiative aiming at a systematic development and implementation of clinical practice guidelines for the main diagnostic groups in rehabilitation. Guidelines for diagnostic and therapeutic decisions are an instrument to sift through the abundance of fast changing knowledge in medicine, to assess the existing knowledge according to its scientific evidence, and to transform it into recommendations for clinical practice. In rehabilitation, guidelines seem to be particularly needed because specialized knowledge is mostly disseminated through an informal \"training on the job\". Our proposal intends to establish a reference centre for each of the main indications (cardiology, musculoskeletal diseases, etc.). These centres should cooperate with experts from clinical practice and research, as well as with representatives of the cost-carrying agencies and patient organisations, and should systematically analyse the processes of rehabilitation in the most important diagnostic groups. Guided by a \"process matrix of rehabilitation\", these analyses should identify the points at which far-reaching decisions are called for during the processes of rehabilitation. At these points, the knowledge base available for rational decisions should be examined. When there is no sufficient scientific knowledge, consensus conferences should be organized in order to collect and assess the available expertise of practitioners and to establish guidelines for clinical practice. Since compliance with such guidelines could be easily checked in the routine quality assurance programme, this proposal seems to be a promising way of improving the knowledge base in rehabilitation in a rather short time.","1076":"","1077":"Since the recent changes in the German social code the outpatient rehabilitation system gains importance. While more and more studies investigate the medical outcomes of outpatient rehabilitation, the economic effects have hardly been examined so far. This article first presents fundamental methods to use for economic evaluation of outpatient rehabilitation and subsequently outlines the findings of a project comparing the economic effects of outpatient and inpatient rehabilitation in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The study statistically covers the total population of applicants for orthopaedic-traumatologic rehabilitation who are suitable for outpatient rehabilitation. A randomized and controlled study, it investigates outcome parameters of the two variants of rehabilitation compared. If the results are approximately equal, the differences between amounts and periods of payments and costs for the pension insurance agency are analyzed. And in fact, the results obtained so far from the investigation confirm that, in suitable patients, outpatient rehabilitation can achieve approximately the same outcomes as inpatient rehabilitation - but at distinctly lower costs. Although in the short term (i. e., at the end of treatment) outcome levels are somewhat lower, better results found even one year later however indicate a more sustained effect.","1078":"This article describes the development of an outpatient concept for the day-clinic withdrawal treatment of alcohol dependent persons in a Hamburg institution for addiction aid. It reports the initial, selected results of a comparative follow-up study of patients discharged during the years 1998-2000, who either receive ambulatory treatment in the day clinic (n = 270) or inpatient treatment in the institution's special clinic (n = 462). Assessable questionnaires are available from 131 outpatients of the day-clinic treatment and 173 patients of the inpatient treatment form. The response rate - with reference to the group of those who were reachable - was 57.2 % for patients of the day clinic and 53.2 % for patients of the special clinic. The results of the study arrive at the conclusion that both treatment forms can be seen as thoroughly comparable with regard to primary outcome measurements (for example reduction of psychological stress, abstinence rates, reintegration into occupational life). Rehabilitants treated in the inpatient setting more frequently report that they had already contacted centres for further treatment and self-help groups during the rehabilitation phase, which however doesn't lead to a change of participation behaviour following the rehabilitation phase. This serves to confirm the assumption that an additional offer of a day-clinic service in the area of addiction rehabilitation provides a further, effective treatment concept that sensibly supplements the otherwise inpatient-oriented treatment landscape. The results indicate the quality of the work performed in the day clinic studied (as well as in the inpatient clinic) and should encourage the funding agencies and employees of other day clinic institutions in the field of addiction rehabilitation to participate in evaluation and quality assurance measures, thus continuing to bridge the gap between the (theoretical) state of knowledge concerning outpatient rehabilitation and the degree to which it can be successfully realized.","1079":"As publications from the domain of psychosomatic rehabilitation pertaining to the conceptual approaches and effects of partial-hospitalization rehabilitation have so far relied on very small case numbers, the effectiveness of partial-hospitalization rehabilitation was analysed in 318 patients in comparison to a large sample of rehabilitants who had participated in fully inpatient rehabilitation. No relevant differences were found among the groups studied in sociodemographic respects or range of diagnoses. The same was true concerning the level of complaints present at the onset of rehabilitation. Good rehabilitation outcomes were achieved in both groups, however, the effect sizes found for changes in depressiveness and indulgence to complaining (\"Klagsamkeit\") (GSI from the SCL-90) were lower in the partial-hospitalization group than in the patients in fully inpatient rehabilitation. Also, the relatively high share of partial-hospitalization patients discharged unable to return to work might be clinically significant. While our findings confirm the good results reported from other disciplines, they nevertheless are a reminder of the need for very careful selection of patients for partial-hospitalization rehabilitation, in order not to withhold \"better\" rehabilitation than could be provided on a partial-hospitalization basis from patients with special sociomedical problems. The best rehabilitation outcomes seem to be achieved by those patients who, towards the end of fully inpatient rehabilitation, were granted transition to the partial-hospitalization programme.","1080":"Since the mid-90s outpatient rehabilitation has been developed by public health insurance companies and pension funds. Outpatient rehabilitation is defined as comprehensive multidisciplinary and medically supervised service which in neurological rehabilitation mostly follows inpatient rehabilitation. In the present paper partial results of a larger study (by Schoenle and Leyhe, 2000) are reported with respect to the follow-up of the effects of outpatient versus inpatient rehabilitation 6 month after termination of the treatment. Major results are the endurance of the effects over the observed time interval and the equivalent effectiveness of the two forms of rehabilitation. Distinct effects were observed for the two patient groups (more progress in the body related functional disturbances for inpatients versus cognitively related progress for the outpatients). The results reflect intrinsic features of neurological rehabilitation and the current organizational status of neurological rehabilitation in Germany.","1081":"Fifty stroke patients who had already regained basic ADL-functions were investigated at the beginning and end of either inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation of similar therapeutic intensity in the same institution. For geographic reasons, outpatient treatment could only be offered to a subgroup of patients. Neurological deficits, extended ADL-functions and quality of life (SF-36) were assessed. Patients who chose outpatient rehabilitation exhibited milder neurological deficits and better ADL-function at onset. On average, outpatient rehabilitation took about 8 days more than inpatient treatment. Under rehabilitation, gains with respect to ADL-functions and the QoL-dimensions \"physical role function\" and \"physical functional ability\" were realized. The magnitude of changes did not depend on setting. A decrease in \"general health perception\" may be related to the inpatient treatment of patients who would have preferred an outpatient setting. Brief periods between stroke and onset of rehabilitation and longer duration of rehabilitation treatment were significantly associated with better outcome with respect to ADL-functions.","1082":"In view of the increasing demands for more co-operation and integration among health care providers and \"uninterrupted\" care delivery processes increasing attention is being paid to establishing the determinants of a more flexible form of rehabilitation setting. Interest is focused particularly on determining at what stages and under what conditions specific choices of rehabilitation setting are made. In 1838 patients admitted consecutively to a cardiological rehabilitation clinic, the study investigated how many patients opted for outpatient rehabilitation and what factors influenced the patients' choice of rehabilitation setting. A total of 165 (9 %) of the 1838 patients chose outpatient rehabilitation. Patients who prefer outpatient rehabilitation are mainly male, belong to a higher social class and are younger. Patients who choose inpatient treatment feel more restricted by their illness. This is also revealed in the difference in coping strategies employed. Patients who prefer the inpatient setting show a greater tendency towards rumination than outpatients. It is thus comprehensible that these patients hope to gain a greater distance from their day-to-day problems. The results indicate that patients' willingness to take advantage of outpatient forms of rehabilitation is moderated both by sociodemographic, psychosocial and disease-related variables as well as by context variables. It is embedded in the complex biopsychosocial conditions governing rehabilitation. One consequence for managing the introduction of more flexible modes of rehabilitation could be to avoid dirigistic and unidimensional control parameters. The results indicate that more flexible disease management cannot follow fixed rules, but rather that the planning of individual requirements should be taken into account.","1083":"In a one-year prospective study of patients participating in a multidisciplinary outpatient or inpatient rehabilitation program (OPR\/IPR) for chronic back pain the following issues were investigated: (i) the frequency of low labour force participation (LFP), i. e., work loss due to the disease or total duration of sick leave (SL) of 6 weeks or more; (ii) prognostic indicators at the beginning of the rehabilitation program (T1) for low LFP after one year (T2); (iii) the significance of the type of rehabilitation IPR vs. OPR in relation to the identified prognostic indicators for LFP. A total of 413 patients participating in OPR (n = 299) or IPR (n = 114) for chronic back pain returned a postal questionnaire after one year. Low LFP was found in 30 % of all patients without significant differences between OPR (32 %) and IPR (25 %). Compared to the year before T1 the proportion of patients without SL between T1 and T2 increased from 12 % to 48 % after OPR, from 15 % to 47 % after IPR, respectively. In multivariate logistic regression analyses adjusted for type of rehabilitation the following prognostic indicators of T1 for low LFP were identified (p &lt;\/= 0,05): SL of 6 weeks or more in the year before T1 with an odds ratio (OR) of 11.1; intended termination of employment (OR = 3.2), household income of less than 3300 DM per month (OR = 2.2); reduced social functioning (SF-36) (OR = 2.0). Regarding LFP no significance of the type of rehabilitation (IPR vs. OPR) was found in relation to the identified prognostic indicators or after adjustment for differences (i) in the characteristics of the patients at T1, and (ii) in the duration and number of single measures of the rehabilitation program. One year after IPR or OPR the rate of return to work is similar (about seven out of ten patients). The identified prognostic indicators may stimulate further research of the improvement of the rehabilitation processes. No evidence was found against the expansion of OPR. ","1084":"In a parallel design the study examined an outpatient rehabilitation model project for patients of the pension insurance scheme of Rhineland-Palatinate (LVA Rheinland-Pfalz). In 6 centers for the rehabilitation of musculoskeletal diseases patients were assessed at the beginning and at the end of rehabilitation as well as six and twelve months after discharge. In this article the final results concerning therapeutic measures as well as health-related and economic outcomes are presented. Not included are aspects of differential utilization and the perception of the rehabilitation by the clients, which will be published in a separate article. No large differences were found concerning participation in the various therapeutic measures. As measured by the main score and the sub-dimensions of the IRES patient questionnaire, effects of the same magnitude were found for the parallelized samples. Equally, no differences in outcome quality were found concerning the great majority of medical parameters documented in a doctors' questionnaire, the rate of applications for pension, occupational status twelve months after rehabilitation, as well as the reduction of sick-leave. The economic evaluation was carried out only from the perspective of the pension insurance agency. Considerable differences were found in the net costs of rehabilitation: although there are no user charges for patients in outpatient rehabilitation, mean expenditure was about 970 EURO lower than in inpatient rehabilitation. The study findings demonstrate that the concept of interdisciplinary rehabilitation has been realized in the outpatient centers as well and that the centers have reached an effectiveness comparable to that of inpatient rehabilitation. At least those patients who actively choose the outpatient setting gain as much as patients in inpatient rehabilitation.","1085":"Cardiac rehabilitation plays a pivotal role in the care for cardiac patients. Yet without sufficient continuity in the care process, the good results achieved in the different stages of therapy and recovery may not last. The aim of this contribution is to highlight the interfaces of cardiac rehabilitation in regard of process continuity as an aspect of the quality of health care. The results show that continuity between the acute care unit and inpatient rehabilitation programmes (phase I - phase II) seems to be sufficient whereas integrating phases II and III may be open for optimizing.","1086":"Regarding the ongoing dispute on strengthening outpatient medical rehabilitation programmes, questions arise about the quality of different (organizational) forms of rehabilitation (inpatient and outpatient). The aim of this contribution is to draw a comparison between the structures and processes of inpatient and outpatient facilities for cardiac rehabilitation. Additional questions will be posed regarding the prerequisite factors for improving structures and processes in the quality assurance and management framework.","1087":"Regarding the dominance of inpatient medical rehabilitation programmes efforts have emerged over the last few years to strengthen outpatient medical rehabilitation programmes in Germany. The goal of cardiac rehabilitation is the recovery of physical, psychic and social wellbeing in people with a severe heart condition. For this contribution the central outcomes of cardiac rehabilitation were compared between different rehabilitation programmes (inpatient and outpatient) and cost-effectiveness analyses were made. These results were obtained within the scope of an evaluation study commissioned by the statutory health and pension insurance agency. In summary, the different rehabilitation programmes can be regarded as comparable concerning effectiveness and costs following rehabilitation.","1088":"The survey of psychosocial, somatic and economic outcomes is regarded as standard in establishing the effectiveness of various rehabilitative forms of medical care. Another important part is the patient's perspective for the subjective valuation of the entire measure or different facets of the rehabilitation measure. During a comparison of the effectiveness of different forms of care of orthopaedic rehabilitation (inpatient, outpatient in the hospital, outpatient) 1176 patients were questioned in writing at 4 different time points. The results concerning the general measurement of the satisfaction with the rehabilitation measure showed a high level and a high acceptance in all forms of medical care at the end of and after the measure. The result relating to the selection of the correct hospital for the specific troubles of the patient was positive as well. This can also be stated for the patients' estimation of the contacts between the doctors and the physiotherapists. At the end of measure, all the patients in every form of care viewed these contacts as being helpful. The outpatient offers were viewed a bit better by the patients concerning the contacts to doctors and physiotherapists. The extent of the care specific to the different occupational groups was estimated by almost all patients of all forms as being just about right. Additionally, the course organization and the work of the administration had a good evaluation - with slight advantages for the inpatient forms.","1089":"In addition to outcome quality, the quality of structure and process is an essential parameter for health care. In the context of a study comparing the outcome and costs of inpatient and different outpatient rehabilitation settings, the structural and procedural quality of the participating rehabilitation facilities were examined as well. Data were collected using questionnaires, interviews, treatment plans and visitations of the rehabilitation facilities. The analyses show a great correspondence of structural and procedural quality between the different rehabilitation settings. Particularly the data gathered by questionnaires show few differences. Points of significant difference include the more extensive equipment and the more favorable personnel key with regard to physicians in the inpatient clinics and the outpatient settings within these clinics. The outpatient rehabilitation facilities outside of rehabilitation clinics are characterized by a stronger accentuation of functional therapy, in particular physiotherapy and sports therapy. Functional therapy is of greater importance in the self-concept of the outpatient rehabilitation facilities and is also applied there more often.","1090":"This article presents main results of a study comparing outcome and costs of various all-day outpatient and inpatient orthopaedic rehabilitation forms. The results were obtained within the scope of a comprehensive evaluation programme commissioned by the federation of health (VdAK) and pension insurance institutes (VDR). The purpose of this evaluation was to examine the quality of different types of various rehabilitation care. The outcome comparison comprises a longitudinal follow-up of various somatic, psychosocial und occupational reintegration parameters up to one year after rehabilitation as well as outcome assessments from the perspective of patients and physicians in rehabilitation centres and general practice. The costs are estimated on the basis of data from health and pension insurance funds. The results show extensive corresponding of results und assessments in the different forms of rehabilitation care for comparable patient groups. There are no indications of poorer care quality in outpatient rehabilitation, while economic analyses show better cost effectiveness in outpatient treatment by comparability of treatment, patients, and results. Results suggest that outpatient care, offered in the same quality as in the examined rehabilitation centres, is an alternative or complement to inpatient care at least for those patients, who can be treated in both the outpatient and inpatient setting.","1091":"In Germany the statutory health and pension insurance schemes are the main providers of medical rehabilitation, the majority of rehabilitation measures being given in an inpatient setting. Over the last few years, the health and pension insurance schemes have strengthened the extension of outpatient rehabilitation, and have funded a comprehensive evaluation study in this context. In this evaluation study outpatient rehabilitation in centres with different conceptual backgrounds is compared with inpatient rehabilitation in rehab clinics, indications considered being cardiology and orthopaedics. Overall, 14 rehab centres and more than 2000 patients were included in the project. The patients were interviewed and medically examined before and after the measure. A follow-up was done after six and twelve months. In addition to the rehabilitants themselves, the rehab centre physicians as well as the office-practice physicians were interviewed about the outcome of the rehab measure. One year after rehabilitation, data were collected from the relevant health and pension insurance funds concerning the benefits the patients had received. Due to the study's non-experimental design, validity of the results is confined to rehabilitants participating on an outpatient basis and who had been found medically suited for this type of rehabilitation, were capable of travelling to the rehab centre on their own within less than 45 minutes and had voluntarily opted for the outpatient setting. The findings of the study show that outpatient rehabilitants' motivation and expectations differ from those found in inpatient rehabilitation. The health economics analysis performed is restricted to the costs involved in the rehabilitation measure as such as well as the health-related benefits provided to the rehabilitants in the twelve-month study period. The issue of whether increasing outpatient rehab measures will lead to decreasing costs in the rehab system as a whole had not been considered in the framework of this project.","1092":"","1093":"Up to now, the majority of rehabilitative measures in Germany has been performed in inpatient programmes. In the past 10 years an extension of outpatient rehabilitation can be noted. Because of new social welfare legislation the legal disadvantages for participants in outpatient rehabilitation have been eliminated on the 1st July 2001. In the past year, the Federal Rehabilitation Council as well as various rehabilitation providers have developed further and specified their concepts in outpatient rehabilitation. Concept requirements include still the principles of holism, interdisciplinarity, goal-oriented rehabilitation and team-work of rehabilitation staff. The extension of outpatient rehabilitation in the sphere of German pension insurance scheme is documented by the increase in models respectively regular services and rehabilitative measures. The results of the evaluation suggest, that the outpatient realisation of a comprehensive rehabilitation concept yields comparable results as the inpatient realisation. In some regions there is a strong cooperation between pension insurance institutes and corresponding health insurance companies in order to extend outpatient rehabilitation. A quality assurance program for outpatient rehabilitation will be developed. It can be expected, that the extension of outpatient rehabilitation goes on and that thereby the possibilities of a more flexible medical rehabilitation grow.","1094":"","1095":"There are only few studies on the evaluation of the efficiency of oncologic rehabilitation. The objective of this study was to determine the efficiency of a complex rehabilitation programme consisting of medical care, physical therapy, sports therapy, psychological support and health care seminars. Therefore the rehabilitation requirement at admission and the rehabilitation result at discharge were assessed in a patient sample. To determine the rehabilitation requirement and the rehabilitation result, a self-assessment patient questionnaire was used (IRES, Indicators of Reha Status). This questionnaire allows establishing essential patient's parameters, which, besides the medical reports and the doctors' and therapists' opinions, are relevant for the Reha aims and important for the treatment strategy. The IRES instrument is a reliable, valid, sensitive and standardized multidimensional test instrument for assessment and outcome measurement in rehabilitation comprising parameters of somatic, functional and psychosocial issues. With the questionnaire the rehabilitation requirement was determined at the various measuring points as \"Reha-status\" with the three main dimensions \"somatic status\", \"functional status\" and \"psychosocial status\" or as distress scales (score values 0 - 10). The data were collected at admission to inpatient rehabilitation (T0) and at discharge (T1). At T0 967 patients with various oncologic diseases (breast cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, urogenital cancer, haematological and lymphatic systemic diseases, and various other types of cancer) were included into the study. At discharge (T1) 900 patients were included; subject to evaluation at T0 and T1 were n = 883 patients. Average age was 55,7 +\/- 11,9 years; 55,7 % were female, 44,3 % male. According to \"Reha-status\" 44 % were \"extremely suspect\" (IRES-score 5,4 +\/- 0,8), 26 % \"suspect\" (6,8 +\/- 0,4), and 30 % \"normal\" (7,9 +\/- 0,6) in comparison to a norm-reference test. Pre\/post analysis (T0\/T1) of the sample revealed a significant improvement of \"Reha-status\" (T0 = 6,6 +\/- 1,2\/T1 = 6,81 +\/- 1,3; p &lt; 0,001). Significant improvements were also noticed for the subdimensions \"somatic status\" (T0 = 5,9 +\/- 1,5\/T1 = 6,1 +\/- 1,6; p &lt; 0,001) and \"psychosocial status\" (T0 = 6,9 +\/- 1,5\/T1 = 7,2 +\/- 1,5; p &lt; 0,001), whereas \"functional status\" had not changed significantly (T0 = 7,1 +\/- 1,6\/T1 = 7,2 +\/- 1,5; p &gt; 0,05). Especially distinct improvements were observed in \"psychosocial status\" and in the distress scales, which are particular relevant in oncological patients. This investigation demonstrates that use of the IRES instrument is feasible also in clinical routine, hence supporting the determination of the patient's individual rehabilitation requirement and his or her individual rehabilitation aims. The findings confirm that during rehabilitation measurable and statistically significant positive effects are achieved in the somatic and psychosocial fields. In summary, this study shows that the complex programme of oncological inpatient rehabilitation achieves relevant changes within important distress issues of the patients. ","1096":"A report is given on the realization of a steering mechanism of a hand orthosis for a patient with paraplegia. An EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) was used here for the first time, transferring purely mental activity to a control signal. This means that the patient has the capability to open or close the hand orthosis only by imagination of a movement. At this time, after a training period of about four months, the patient is able to move the hand orthosis with a certainty of almost hundred percent. The restored grasp function was verified by a grasp function test. Results are compared to those obtained using a conventional EMG-controlled orthosis.","1097":"Interfaces can cause disruptions in the care provision process. They can, however, also signify a differentiated and specialized division of labour of the care providing system. Three models for the description of interfaces are presented and compared: a linear model oriented towards the continuity of the provision of care for individuals, the Principal Agent (PA) Model from contract theory, and a complex systems model. In all three models coupling and information management are identified as essential interface functions. In regard to optimisation possibilities, the linear model leads to the case-management concept, the PA Model to integrated forms of provision and systems theory to context controlling.","1098":null,"1099":"The forthcoming introduction of the DRG-system as a new hospital funding system in Germany reinforced the discussion about a reform of the already existing funding system in medical rehabilitation. Experience and concepts from acute medicine, however, cannot be transferred directly to rehabilitation. The development of a patient classification system is a presupposition for prospective payment systems. Initial attempts in rehabilitation-specific patient classification systems already exist, even though a comprehensive approach is not yet noticeable. International patient classification systems scarcely seem to be transferable due to the specific German case-mix. The specific differences between acute medicine and medical rehabilitation relevant for the valuation of funding systems are analyzed. Particularly a reduction of the length of stay as a primary aim for the introduction of the DRG-system does not seem appropriate for medical rehabilitation. The existing funding system in medical rehabilitation is analyzed from an economic point of view. The cost management of the German pension insurance, being one of the rehabilitation providers in Germany, has achieved high quality standard of treatment as well as cost restriction. This funding system has been further developed during the last couple of years. Future developments are shown.","1100":"The forthcoming introduction of a DRG system in Germany has entailed numerous uncertainties for the agencies involved, for medical and care staff as well as all others having to do with the health care system, the patients included. As had previously been the case in other countries, this innovation is going to effect major changes in Germany as well. Notwithstanding, efforts to enhance specific, efficient and quality-assured medical care can, and are intended to, be undertaken in the future as well. This short report summarizes the impact introduction of a DRG system has had at the interface between acute care and subsequent rehabilitation in Sydney, New South Wales; concluding, future developments are outlined.","1101":"With the statutory health insurance reform act 2000 the German government started to introduce a new hospital funding system based on an internationally used diagnosis related groups (DRGs) system. In June 2000 the German self-administration board (consisting of the German hospital federation, the German statutory health insurance funds and the association of private health insurers), which is in charge of realizing this project, decided to develop the future German (Refined) DRG System (G-DRG) with reference to the Australian Refined DRG System (AR-DRG) Version 4.1. Replacement of the previous German hospital reimbursement system by the new DRG-based hospital funding system is planned for January 2003 on a voluntary basis. From January 2004 on, the change of the reimbursement system is to become mandatory for all hospitals with the exception of psychiatry. The new reimbursement system is intended to not only cover acute hospital care but also parts of early rehabilitation, palliative and sub-acute care. Because of its economic incentives the effects of DRG introduction in Germany will not only be limited to the hospital scene but will also affect rehabilitation.","1102":"","1103":"","1104":"","1105":"","1106":"After World War II, further development of the social protection schemes in place seemed an urgent requirement given a rapidly unfolding industrial society. At the request of Federal Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, four renowned social scientists drafted the \"Rothenfelser Denkschrift\" published in 1955, which, on the basis of thorough analysis, presented concrete proposals for reshaping the field of social protection. Quite a few of these suggestions have since been incorporated in various books of the German social code, and some of their ideas are quite topical also in the context of the statutory health insurance reform to come. So, curative treatment and rehabilitation might both be considered indispensable constituents of health and social provision, with seamless transitions required in the interest of those affected as well as of meaningful utilization of resources.","1107":"The purpose of this study was to gain a phase specific survey concerning amount, types and costs of technical aids (TA) in a German neurological rehabilitation centre. Further, a number of common rehabilitation outcome parameters were to be related to technical aids provision. A prospective study included all patients (N = 509) with stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), brain tumour and multiple sclerosis (MS) admitted within a two-year period to the Klinik Berlin. The TAs prescribed were registered separately for each phase concerning type, amount and costs. In all, 108 different technical aids were recorded, and the direct costs for these technical aids were calculated. Outcome parameters used were the Barthel Index (BI) at admission and discharge, length of stay, and discharge destination. The mean (median) length of stay in phase B (C) was 76 (56) days with a mean (median) increase of BI score of 25 (15) points. Patients in phase D staid 35 days (median) at the clinic, their BI had been 100 points (median) already on admission. 93,3 % of all patients returned home (phase B and C 78,2 %). On average, patients in phase B and C received 2 technical aids\/person, in phase D the median was 0 technical aid\/person. On discharge, patients in phase B had an average of 3 technical aids\/person, phase C patients had 4,5 TA\/person and phase D patients 1 technical aid\/person (median). The mean cost of a technical aid was 670 DM in phase B, 405 DM in phase C, and 290 DM in phase D (median). Technical aids are important components in rehabilitation, especially for severely affected patients, who receive the most expensive technical aids such as wheelchairs and bath tub lifters. High competence in questions related to technical aids is absolutely indispensable for any unit dealing with these patients. On the other hand, less affected patients mostly receive walking aids and grab bars. Future studies should deal with utilization rates and satisfaction with technical aids at home, as well as with cost-effectiveness issues. ","1108":"As of January 1, 2000 rehabilitation clinics in Germany are obliged to implement and develop a quality management system. This study aims to depict the implementation of quality management (QM), to trace the preferred QM models, identify the reasons for and experience with the introducing quality management, and inquire into the quality tools used in rehabilitation clinics. Postal study of a representatively selected random sample of 298 rehabilitation clinics, stratified along the criteria state, number of beds and financially responsible agency, using six questions with nominally scaled items. Questionnaire design provided no clues as to the responding clinics. The study was designed along the Total Design Method. 89 % of the responding clinics have implemented a QM system, or are about to or planning to do so. Only 11 % reject quality management. 59 % implemented their system in 1998, 1999 or 2000. Among the reasons for implementing a QM system, items related to potentials of quality management predominate, whereas demands by third parties are given only very rarefy. The response rate was 59 %, i. e., the study can be considered representative. The high share of clinics taking a positive view on quality management is however somewhat modified by the fact that 40.4 % of the clinics have adopted or are planning far traditional quality assurance methods. Whether these systems will satisfy the legal requirements in place (SGB V) is doubtful. Adjusted, responses show that 48.9 % of the clinics are running QM systems, are about to or planning to implement one. Many of the responding clinics have already implemented a QM system or are about to do so. A majority of the clinics however rely on traditional quality assurance methods. Whether quality assurance will satisfy the legal requirements in place (SGB V) re an internal quality management system must be awaited. ","1109":"There are various potential explanations for weight-loss and poor physical performance in patients with chronic pancreatitis: In severe chronic pancreatitis the decline in enzyme secretion is an important cause for the malassimilation syndrome frequently seen in these patients. Occasionally, difficulties may arise in establishing this decline and in quantifying the secretory capacity of the gland. Many patients limit their food intake because of the pain caused by eating. In untreated patients with diabetes, glucosuria may contribute to their malnutrition. Insufficient funds for food due to alcoholism and anorexia may also be of some significance. Concomitant gastrointestinal diseases and malabsorption following gastrointestinal surgery are frequently found in patients with chronic pancreatitis. Neurological complications and traumatic lesions after accidents - often in connection to the underlying alcoholism - are joined by physical inactivity and thus contribute to the development of muscular atrophy and decreased physical performance. Consequently, rehabilitation of patients with chronic pancreatitis is challenging: They not only need expert medical treatment of both the symptoms of chronic pancreatitis and the concomitant disorders. Therapy must also include dietary support, careful physical training, and - in cases caused by alcoholism - psycho-social support. So far, the multi-professional competence required for these purposes can only be expected in a specialized rehabilitation centre.","1110":"The article reports on a study in which elements of a group-oriented reconditioning programme for patients with low back pain were incorporated into the routine of an in-patient orthopaedic rehabilitation clinic. The specific elements of the new programme consisted of stable group structures during the whole stay of 3 to 4 weeks, and of 3 to 7 hrs. walks in hilly ground three times a week. The effects of this programme were tested against a standard programme with a mix of passive and active elements using a controlled study design. 92 persons participated in an experimental group and 81 persons in a control group with no significant differences found between the two groups at admission. Effects were measured by means of a physicians' questionnaire and a multidimensional patients' questionnaire (IRES) answered at admission, at discharge, and at six- and twelve-month follow-up. The results of a two-factorial analysis of variance with repeated measures showed that the interaction between group and time on the summary score of the IRES was not significant, although the experimental group showed somewhat better effects at all times of measurement. The discussion focuses on the reasons for this result, among which the unexpectedly good effects in the control group are named, as well as certain difficulties with the implementation of a strongly activity-oriented programme into the course of a \"normal\" rehabilitation clinic.","1111":"","1112":"This contribution is focused on the core tenet that the process of choice of occupation must encompass in its everyday routines the disabled person's biography, his or her life experiences, biographical self-appraisals as well as action orientations.

Biographical Diagnostics is presented here as a method seeking to access the individual in the process of choice of occupation in an understanding manner. It constitutes a new concept in terms of a biography-based, hermeneutic case approach conceived for implementation in the everyday routines of vocational rehabilitation. Two case examples serve to explicate the method of Biographical Diagnostics and set out the relevancy of a biographical orientation in the process of occupational choice.","1113":"Effects of Treatment in Mother-Child Rehabilitation Centres. The study aims at an external evaluation of mother-child rehabilitation centres in Germany. The centres taking part in the project will get detailed information about their present state of quality in the dimensions of structure, process and outcome as well as patient satisfaction and job satisfaction of the employees. This article focuses on quality of outcome. Two main questions are addressed: How do women treated in mother-child rehabilitation centres assess their health problems at admission, and what are the effects after three weeks of inpatient treatment? The results show that in comparison with a German norm population, 55 % to 75 % of the women in the present study reported intense distress in all dimensions of health (somatic, functional and psychosocial). The analysis of effects after treatment confirms a distinct improvement of health status reported by patients as well as by doctors and therapists. Data of a follow-up after 6 months will show whether these positive effects can be maintained.","1114":"Symptoms, Effects on Quality of Life, Judgement and Expectations of Treatment in Active Ankylosing Spondylitis: The Patient's View.In ankylosing spondylitis uncertainty prevails among rheumatologists on how to define and measure activity. In the present study the patient's view of activity was evaluated. What does active ankylosing spondylitis mean for the patient? In a standardized interview the patient was asked to describe, from his own experience, what active ankylosing spondylitis means, what bothers him most, what helps most, and what he expects from therapy. For the patient, active ankylosing spondylitis means pain (99 responses), mobility restriction (19), muscle tension (10), inability to stay supine (6), restriction in chest mobility (5) and dyspnea (5). Fatigue was mentioned by two patients. In active states patients are mainly bothered by pain (77), mobility restriction (55), consequences for social life (20) and work (18), disturbed sleep (17) and difficult breathing (16). Drugs (84) and physical activity (42) were judged the best treatments during active ankylosing spondylitis. It was no surprise that pain and mobility restriction were cited most often by the patients. Breathing difficulties were cited rather often, whereas fatigue seems not to play an important role for most patients. The results suggest that modern rheumatology may have underestimated the relevance of difficult breathing and paid too much attention to fatigue.","1115":"\"Zest for Life Instead of Strain of Illness\" - Implementation and Evaluation of a Programme Activating Chronic Back Pain Patients in a Rehabilitation Clinic.A group training was developed for chronic back pain patients in a rehabilitation clinic to enhance coping, to activate internal and external resources, and to make transfer to everyday life easier. The training consists of 12 either physiotherapeutic or psychologically oriented sessions. The training was evaluated in a longitudinal, quasi-experimental control-group design. Patients of the intervention group (n = 144) and control group (n = 157) rated the usefulness of the rehabilitation for private and working life at the end of the in-patient phase (t1) and three month later (t2). They also evaluated selected elements of the rehabilitation (t2). Results show that the anticipated usefulness of the rehabilitation was rated higher at the end of the stay than three months later. This indicates frustration after returning to everyday life. Patients of the intervention group rated the transfer possibilities to working life higher than the control group. They also are more satisfied with the psychological parts of the rehabilitation. After minor revisions, such as strengthening the topic of employment, the training now is implemented in the clinic for all patients with chronic back pain.","1116":"Gender-specific Aspects in Chronic Low Back Pain Rehabilitation. Little is known about gender differences in utilisation, outcomes and evaluation of orthopaedic rehabilitation for chronic low back pain. The purpose of this article is to review and analyse the literature on rehabilitation and recovery of men and women with chronic back pain. In Western societies, chronic back pain is one of the most common causes for utilising medical rehabilitation services. In general no significant gender differences in the prevalences of back pain are found, but men are more sick-listed and early retired due to musculoskeletal diseases. Also, more men than women participate in medical rehabilitation programmes. National and international studies pinpoint the fact that differences exist between women and men with regard to participating in an orthopaedic rehabilitation programme. Additionally there is some evidence that different physical and psychological therapy services have different effects on health status of women and men. Mixed results are available regarding gender differences concerning the outcomes of rehabilitation programmes. Rehabilitation activities after discharge from in-patient programmes and these being performed within the home setting are primary indicators of recovery. Gender differences have been identified regarding various types of activities, apparently because especially family roles interfere with activity. Further research must be conducted so as to increase the understanding of women's and men's experiences relative to orthopaedic diseases and orthopaedic rehabilitation services.","1117":"","1118":"","1119":"","1120":"This paper provides information about the research programme \"In-plant interventions in the German car industry to increase job opportunities for employees with (severe) disabilities\".

Training on the job is one of the most important aspects in this programme, and data have therefore been gained from qualitative interviews with representatives of different firms. The results presented are based on the analysis of qualitative interviews with 13 employers involved in the pilot project. All interviewees underline: Training on the job alongside non-disabled persons is thought to offer good opportunities for lasting vocational integration since it enables trainees to grow accustomed to the conditions and demands of work and is thought likely to lead directly to employment. We discussed a range of mechanisms through which a societal obligation to train and\/or employ disabled people could be implemented and highlighted the role of \"rehabilitation services\" which support the trainee by psychological, educational and social services and support the employer.","1122":"While the public has been paying attention to the topics illness and disability with respect to public health, long-term care insurance and public old age insurance systems for years, the risk of becoming disabled at work has been considered less. Research in this area has for a long time been focused on questions regarding first-time entry and return to work of disabled persons into the regular labour market. Also, much policy research has tended to deny an active role of the enterprise as an independent player and creator of policy in the management of disability. Hence only little documentation of employers' programmes and strategies as well as analysis concerning the question of job retention is available. In order to cover the research deficit a study with regard to employment careers of severely disabled was conducted in Rhineland-Palatinate from 1997 to 1999. The study pursues two different paths: On the one hand living and working conditions of this group are analysed, on the other the study's purpose is to give an overview of employers' disability management practices from the severely disabled employees' point of view. This article deals with the results of the policies within the enterprise study. It concerns the analysis of the following issues: Does disability have a negative impact on the employees' careers? Which measures are preferred by the persons interviewed and why? The final question, whether the need for supporting measures ascertained may be satisfied by the existing instruments available under the German Severely Disabled Persons Act must be answered with a clear \"No\"! Employers and disabled employees need alternative measures of support.","1123":"This article analyses various methods of predicting whether patients in orthopaedic rehabilitation will return to work. In this regard, items of patients, physicians in charge of rehabilitation and general practitioners have been collected and compared to working time lost due to illness. In total, 72 % of patients had successfully returned to work after one year. The patients whose reintegration could not be achieved could be identified best by asking if they believed that they would be in a position to work until the statutory retirement age (96 % identified) on the one hand and on the other hand by the physicians' estimate as to the degree the last gainful activity might be resumed (90 % identified). In this context, the criteria have to be laid down very restrictively in order to sufficiently filter out patients not likely to return to work. The patients likely to return to work are identified best by means of the following characteristics: lack of intention to retire early (96 % identified), planning to return to work directly after rehabilitation (88 % identified), and little working time lost due to illness prior to rehab (86 % identified). In general, a major percentage of patients not likely to return to work can be identified by these statements of patients and physicians. The statements of general practitioners are clearly less valuable for prediction and show only weak correlation with the respective statements of the physicians in charge of rehabilitation.","1124":"Vocational reintegration is one of the major goals of cardiac rehabilitation. 70 % of blue-collar workers under 50 years of age resume their job after in-patient cardiac rehabilitation. 10 % are hindered to do so by cardiac problems. Specific measures exist that may facilitate work resumption. As these measures should be started as soon as possible there is a need for predictors of return to work which can be obtained easily and at an early stage. Subjects of this prospective study were 650 patients (10 % female) under 50 years of age who participated in an in-patient cardiac rehabilitation programme under the workers' pension insurance scheme. At the beginning of programme participation, problems in work resumption as expected by the patient and by his physician were obtained, as well as depression and anxiety scores (HADS-D). Physicians' and patients' expectations concerning problems in resuming work turn out to be significant predictors of the vocational situation of the male patients six months following medical rehabilitation. The depression score obtained at the outset of the programme is the only predictor of return to work in female patients.","1125":"The necessity to offer special therapeutic programmes focusing on job related problems in psychosomatic rehabilitation has become increasingly evident. Which patients should participate in such programmes? This question has not yet been discussed with regard to its theoretical and methodological implications. In clinical practice the decision has been based on the therapists evaluation. 105 patients, consecutively admitted in a psychosomatic hospital were interviewed with a screening questionnaire about their job related strains and the perceived interaction between symptomatology and job. According to the literature guidelines for inclusion of psychosomatic patients to a special work hardening programme were used. Therapists were asked to independently assign their patients to the programme. The overlap between the two procedures was small. While the guidelines focussed on a high level of job strain and the patient's motivation for a job-related therapeutic approach, the therapists' decision was based on duration of inability to work, impairments at work due to the symptoms, conflicts with colleagues at work and the patient's ability to perceive problems in a differentiated manner. Considering the problem of inclusion-criteria for a work hardening programme, the highly complex constellations behind routine therapeutic decisions in psychosomatic rehabilitation became evident. To integrate medical diagnosis, symptomatology, psychological models, job strain, the patient's social situation and values, is a neglected but important goal of rehabilitation sciences and should be a base for a concept guiding the development, evaluation and establishment of work related therapeutic programmes.","1126":"","1127":"","1128":"","1129":"","1130":"This article presents the findings of an image analysis carried out for a rehabilitation clinic for addictive diseases.

The study covers the clinic's actual and ideal image, discriminating frequency of referrals, diagnostic categories, region, and type of institution. Results concerning the real profile indicate that on average the dimensions cooperation, communication with regard to personal contact, and reputation of the clinic were more critically judged than the issues information, communication with regard to discharge reports, standards of quality, and consideration of patients' needs. Cooperation, communication with regard to personal contact, and quality standards turned out to be the most important criteria from the referring agencies' perspective (ideal profile). A statistical comparison between those with high and low assignment rates suggested that customers rated the clinic more favourably than non-customers. Thus, it seems that the clinic's image has considerable influence on referral decisions. Particularly interesting is the additional finding that the referring institutions perceive pension insurers' directives to be of secondary relevance.","1131":"Medical staff working in rehabilitation often criticize their in-patients' lack of motivation to cooperate in therapy. Consequently, very often the aims of the therapy would not be reached. That, again, causes expenses that could be avoided and it also causes frustration on both sides. On the basis of Schwarzer's Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) we designed a questionnaire on motivation to predict the degree of the in-patients' cooperation in therapy during rehabilitation. The results presented here are based on an interim analysis of 508 questionnaires answered by LVA insurees (Landesversicherungsanstalten, wage earners' pension insurance funds) who had applied for rehabilitation in a clinic. The applicants suffered from illness of the back and spine as well as degenerative illness of the joints. A first examination of the scales Specific Outcome Expectancies, Specific Self-efficacy and Intention of the questionnaire showed very good statistical results as well as correlations between these variables that correspond to HAPA. It also turned out that there is a direct connection between the scores of the motivation variables (e.g. Specific Self-efficacy) and that of cooperation in therapy. These initial test results indicate a generic character of the instruments used in this research project. They also point out starting points for interventions to increase motivation that are to be developed.","1132":"Osteoarthritis of the knee is considered to be the most common degenerative joint disease and finally ends up in a total knee replacement. Pain relief, restoration of a passive knee stability and improvement of functional ability are the primary goals of arthroplasties. But at the surgeons' closing, the patient for the present has just a knee \"ready to function\". Making the new joint function and recovering quality of life are the major outcome criteria for the rehabilitation process. This retrospective research was performed to evaluate three different rehabilitation programmes provided for patients receiving knee arthroplasties. Included were 124 patients with unilateral knee arthroplasty due to primary gonarthritis. All three rehabilitation clinics were able to improve the functional ability of the affected joints significantly, without any quantitative differences among them. The main influence factor in reaching the therapy aim (defined as: full extension and flexion &gt; or = 90 degrees) seems to be the length of stay in the rehab clinic, which in turn is dependent on the presence of complications. On the other hand complications did not directly affect the achievement of the rehab goal, neither did age of patients, number of days between discharge (from acute care) and admission (to the rehab clinic), nor any accompanying illnesses. There, hence, have to be additional factors which influence the length of stay and so indirectly the rehab aim, factors which obviously are not accessible to quantitative objective measuring methods.","1133":"The results of our integrated conservative and operative concept of therapy to compensate insufficient shoulder muscles following brachial plexus palsy or other nerve damages are presented. To improve stability and function of the shoulder in case of deltoid and supraspinatus paralysis 19 patients (3 female; 16 male; average age 37 years, range 17 to 61 years) underwent a shoulder arthrodesis. In 69 patients (12 female; 57 male; average age 31 years, range 19 to 69 years) a trapezius transfer was performed. The indication for a rotation osteotomy of the humerus to improve loss of external rotation due to paralytic infraspinatus muscle was determined in 5 male patients (average age 30 years, range 15 to 42 years). Our results are based upon an average follow-up of 21 (6-70) months after shoulder fusion, 21 (2-68) months after trapezius transfer and 28 (3-62) months after rotation osteotomy of the humerus. The trapezius transfer resulted in increased function of abduction of 6.6 degrees to 35.9 degrees (10 degrees-90 degrees) and forward flexion of 12.6 degrees to 30.9 degrees (5 degrees-85 degrees). A more stable condition of multidirectional shoulder instability was experienced by 64 patients (92.8%), and 65 patients (94.2%) were subjectively satisfied with the outcome of the operation. The strength and extent of functional improvement was, on average, greater following shoulder arthrodesis: abduction 10.3 degrees to 57.4 degrees (20 degrees-80 degrees), forward flexion of 12.6 degrees to 57.1 degrees (20 degrees-105 degrees). 17 patients (89.5%) were subjectively satisfied with the outcome. Patients who had undergone external rotation osteotomy showed an average deficiency of external rotation of 30 degrees before operation. After osteotomy an improvement of 29 degrees to 3 degrees external rotation was achieved. All patients were satisfied with the increase of function. In patients with failed shoulder muscles, particularly after brachial plexus palsy, secondary operations according to the individual pattern of muscle failure result in an improvement of shoulder function and stability, as well as patients' satisfaction. Therefore, adequate conservative treatment before and after reconstructive operations is of great importance.

Public projects take up a lot of social resources which hence are no longer available for other purposes--especially when you look at existing budgetary limits. A decision in favour of one specific project always implies a decision against some other project. A classical method to evaluate public projects is the cost-benefit analysis, which leads a shadowy existence owing to its difficulties in practical application (first and foremost in identifying and quantifying). In this article a possible application for cost-benefit analysis is demonstrated on the example of an institution for initial vocational training of young people with disabilities or at risk of becoming disabled. The main point here is to widen the focus from simply looking at fiscal expenses, revenues and savings towards also taking notice of social, psychological and health orientated facts. In this view it is very consequent to enlarge the \"normal\" economic balance sheet by drawing up a special social balance sheet which illustrates advantages and disadvantages difficult to measure at a monetary basis. A comprehensive decision basis is thereby achieved considering \"both sides of the medal\".","1136":null,"1137":"","1138":null,"1139":null,"1140":"The purpose of the present study is to investigate the needs of persons with spinal cord injuries in the context of psychological support and their psychic stress during the period of initial rehabilitation. Using a questionnaire the following aspects are covered: professional psychological behaviour, social relationships, sexuality, function of bladder and intestines, pain, and coping with handicap. Replies received from 71 paralysed persons suggest the existence of general needs as well as different needs in groups. Among the grouping variables are age, sex, kind and degree of paralysis. It seems both feasible and advisable to take the findings into account in an individually adjusted way, thus including the frequently demanded preventive psychological work as an important part of rehabilitation.","1141":"A cardiac medical center and a hospital for cardiac rehabilitation are compared. A total of 44 male patients were administered the German version of the \"Ward Atmosphere Scale\" (KUS). Both hospitals differ widely regarding manpower, costs, financing, and organization of services. Patients perceive a more rehabilitation oriented atmosphere in the rehabilitation hospital (e.g., support, preparation for the time after discharge from the hospital, personal orientation). On the other hand, the comprehensive medical potential of the cardiac centre is reflected in the patients perceptions of a stronger medical technology orientation. The results are discussed with regard to the validity of the questionnaire and as to the importance of a rehabilitative orientation.","1142":"This paper reflects the thinking, experience as well as diagnostic and therapeutic strategies of the Gelderland specialized clinic for psychotherapy and psychosomatic medicine with regard to extrinsically motivated patients, i.e., patients \"sent\" for treatment. The objective is to develop a therapeutic concept and to establish guidelines concerning the sociomedical aspects to be taken into account in this patient group. The problem analysis should start out at the situation at hand initially: Not only do these patients as a rule refuse to take an active part in therapy; they all to often attempt to sabotage any rehabilitation offers perceived as running counter to their own desires and goals (e.g. pension, retraining, collection of benefits during illness-related unemployment, etc.). Attempts to elucidate the psychosomatic problem complex of these patients are in addition hampered by their predominantly body-centred concept of disease. The particular motivational and therapy-related features of these patients are illustrated by case studies. A standardized procedure for sociomedical performance appraisals is presented which takes the specific features of this patient group into account and has stood the test in the clinical setting. Special mention should be made of: pre-admission diagnostics, inpatient psychodiagnostics, multidisciplinary systematic behavioural observation of the patient in the framework of group therapy, and a sensitive approach to conveying diagnostic results to the patient. The double role of psychotherapist and appointed expert is one demanding the highest degree of professional expertise. Besides, the expectations of the social security and financially responsible agencies which \"sent\" the client have to be taken into account as well. The sociomedical evaluation serves as the starting point for all therapeutic efforts and identification of the extent of a patient's extrinsic motivation. Along with a thorough review of the patient's medical records, pre-admission diagnostic efforts are in place in this respect for assessing a patient's motivation for therapy.","1143":"Self-help groups are communities of people with chronic illness or disabilities and their families who join in an effort to cope with their condition and\/or psychosocial live problems through mutual help. Their areas of work range from therapeutically focussed support to legal and social counselling and support to the personal help an individual member may need. Self-help groups for the various health conditions or disabilities are considered an important component of ambulatory rehabilitation at community level. Along with social, cultural and leisure activities, health education plays an important role in terms of prevention. For survivors of stroke or brain injury, however, the availability of self-help offers continues to be highly inadequate despite a huge need for assistance, counselling and follow-along services after discharge from rehabilitation in this very patient group.","1144":null,"1145":"Pretesting of a questionnaire for evaluating day-patient rehabilitation, which included comparison of the \"Hannover Functional Ability Questionnaire\" (FFbH) and the SF-36 subscale \"physical functioning\" (SF-36 PF), gave rise to more extensive validity testing of the two instruments. In the framework of an expanded pretest, a questionnaire including FFbH and SF-36 PF was sent out to 520 adult former patients who had undergone inpatient orthopaedic rehabilitation following total hip or knee replacement an average 16 months ago. Return rate was 76%. Checks on plausibility showed no complaints about the Hannover Functional Ability Questionnaire while, on the SF-36 subscale, it was found that 16 of 374 patients (4.3%) had confused positive and negative ratings. Moreover, problems were found concerning the wording of several items (understanding, multidimensionality). In contrast to the FFbH, the SF-36 subscale shows weaknesses in the formulation of its items and particularly its ratings.","1146":"Research was done about the agreement between test results and checklist information concerning psychomotor development. The Movement ABC checklist and the Movement-ABC-test were administered in 34 children from the child and adolescent psychiatry unit of the UZ Gasthuisberg, of Leuven, Belgium. The children were 25 boys and 9 girls aged 4 to 12 years. There was a moderate association between the test results of the children and the judgements of the carepersons, suggesting that use of the checklist instead of testing cannot be deemed a good alternative.","1147":"Following the assumption that the motivation to participate in a rehabilitation program is a multidimensional construct we surveyed experts to develop a first version of the patient questionnaire of rehabilitation motivation (PAREMO). In this article we describe the results of the pilot study with regard to the test-theoretical analysis of the questionnaire. Patients of cardiologic, orthopaedic and psychosomatic rehabilitation clinics were participants of this study. After several subsequent steps of analysis the PAREMO was reduced from an initial 150 items to 46 items. The questionnaire now contains a structure of six factors: 1. need for assistance and psychological burden of suffering, 2. restrictions in everyday life because of physical burden of suffering, 3. reactions of significant others to the illness, 4. readiness to change in terms of preventive behaviour, 5. hopelessness and scepticism, and 6. initiative and knowledge. These factors explain almost 50% of the total variance. Cronbach's Alphas range between 0.71 and 0.91 for the subscales, the corrected item total correlation means range between 0.45 and 0.65. The statistical results as well as the naming of the scales are preliminary to this date, they are being reanalysed in another study.","1148":"A training programme for rehabilitation of people with mental illness is presented, designed particularly for schizophrenic patients who need occupational rehabilitation. The training goal is to connect aspects of the schizophrenic disorder with vocational issues. It is aimed at supporting the participants in developing a realistic and appropriate vocational perspective in line with their illness related restrictions and current vocational possibilities, seeking to find out the individual's optimal ability to take stress so as to avoid over- or understimulation in vocational respects. The ZERA training has been developed for implementation in different medical and vocational rehabilitation settings for persons with mental illness. An initial control-group study was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of this group training approach, and preliminary results have revealed changes in the experimental group in accordance with the objectives of the training and encourage further research.","1149":"A central aim of reformatory efforts, as a consequence of the \"Psychiatrieenquete\" 1975 (a fundamental report of the situation of psychiatry in Germany), had been dehospitalisation of patients with chronic mental illness and their reintegration into the community. Despite a meanwhile well-developed range of community-based services, patients with severe mental illness only rarely get adequate care by these services. This holds especially true for patients with an unfavourable course of disease such as schizophrenia, severe personality disorder, skid-row alcoholism with multiple problems or for patients with double diagnosis. The reasons are barriers set up by the various services and their underlying concepts as well as structural problems in the health care system. Adapted to the special needs for help of these patients, we present a model for the community-based care of this group, combining elements of community psychiatry, addiction treatment and help for the homeless.","1150":"Weekly cost diaries are instruments to measure direct and indirect costs prospectively by using patient data. First we searched MEDLINE for information concerning the use of diaries in health care and their methodological evaluation. Based on a Dutch weekly cost diary we developed an instrument for patients with acute or chronic back pain to be completed following participation in an inpatient rehabilitation measure. Its use was tested in an explorative pilot study. We asked for all costs and resource use due to back pain (all direct medical and non medical costs as well as indirect costs) occurring in a 4-week follow-up period, irrespective of the cost carrier. The total response rate was 58%. Patients spent an average 13 minutes a week for completing the questionnaire, without reporting any major methodological difficulties. Some 30% percent of overall costs were direct costs, the majority being non-recurring costs for assistive devices such as mattresses and mattress frames. Excluding these, monthly direct costs per patient were 270 DM on average. Indirect costs, mainly due to absence from salaried work, amounted to an average 1634 DM per patient, with marked variation. Our study results show that this instrument is basically useful and feasible in this indication. Further studies with larger and representative samples are needed to evaluate data quality. It is suggested that weekly cost diaries can be useful tools in particular in decentralized health care systems to measure costs from the societal perspective.","1151":"Follow-up concepts in the oncological field are subject to constant change, in response to continued progress in the diagnostic and therapeutic spectrum available and building on scientifically founded, rationally conveyed as well as individualized measures, also taking into account the availability of financial resources. In the foreground are conveying a sense of security and acceptance, life-long support of the patient in both, somatic and psychosocial complications, winning the patient's partnership in primary and secondary prevention also with his or her relatives, and verifying, on a continual basis, the outcome quality of oncological interventions through adequate documentation in clinical registries.","1152":"Medical rehabilitation in Germany is traditionally performed primarily in the inpatient setting. It was not until recent years that model forms of outpatient offers were first tested. In this article we will present the results of a comparative evaluation of inpatient and outpatient\/partially outpatient oncological rehabilitation measures. Within the framework of a retrospective questionnaire study, oncological rehabilitants from both settings will be compared with regard to questions concerning the process of participation, rehabilitative goals, oncological interventions and perceived outcome from the perspective of the patient. An overall result is that persons who were treated in the outpatient setting, when compared with those treated in the inpatient setting, show more congruency than discrepancy with regard to all of these key topics. The results will be discussed with respect to further development of the rehabilitative health care system.","1153":"The article is concerned with the basic ideas of outcome quality within the field of oncological rehabilitation and expresses the position which is held by the Section for Rehabilitation, Aftercare and Social Medicine within the German Cancer Society. The authors explicitly express the necessity of rehabilitation-specific goals and corresponding outcome criteria as opposed to the goals and criteria of acute oncological treatment. In the formulation of goals and criteria, the medical-somatic, occupational-rehabilitative, social and psychological levels are considered. The consequences which arise from these outcome criteria with regard to the rehabilitative health care system for cancer patients are discussed.","1154":"The article concerns itself with the issue of process quality in inpatient institutions for oncological rehabilitation and expresses the viewpoint of the German Cancer Society's Section for Rehabilitation, Aftercare and Social Medicine (ARNS).

These standards are also discussed with regard to various specific cancer diagnoses such as, for example, breast cancer, gastrointestinal tumours, lung tumours and brain tumours, as well as with regard to patients in specific treatment measures such as bone marrow and stem cell transplantation.","1156":"The study focuses on the outcome of oncological rehabilitation in the inpatient setting. An oncology-specific questionnaire for the measurement of individual therapy goals was developed within the perspective of a goal-oriented evaluation concept. The article focuses on the first time-point of measurement (beginning of the rehabilitation measure) within a longitudinal study. 407 patients were studied either directly following their initial hospital treatment or at a later time-point during the course of the cancer illness. The presentation of the results include firstly a description and analysis of the patients' medical and psychosocial situation (including variables such as the perceived state of health and quality of life), as well as individual rehabilitation goals formulated by the patients themselves. Moreover, an analysis is performed of the expectations, hopes and fears of patients at the beginning of an oncological rehabilitation measure in the inpatient setting. Subgroup analyses focus on the influence of sociodemographic and emotional variables on the patients' expectations and goals.","1157":"Survival rates of most paediatric cancers are steadily improving as a result of improvements in diagnostics and treatment protocols. Long-term survival renders physical late effects and psychosocial adjustment problems ever more visible. The focus of this article is on school re-entry and social reintegration as core tasks of comprehensive rehabilitation efforts. So far only few systematic programmes exist in Germany to facilitate school re-entry and social integration of paediatric cancer survivors. The article outlines the prerequisites for such interventions and provides examples of re-entry programmes.","1158":"An association between mental disorders, especially affective and anxiety disorders, and cancer has been reported in many clinical studies with inpatients. However, no data exist about the prevalence of mental disorders in patients undergoing acute care or rehabilitation treatment for cancer in Germany. The present study investigated 4-week, 6-month and lifetime prevalence rates of comorbid mental disorders in cancer. 256 patients from 2 rehabilitation clinics and 2 acute care hospitals were examined with standardized screening scales for psychological burden (GHQ-12, HADS) and quality of life (SF-36). Somatic parameters and interventions were assessed through standardized medical records from the attending oncologists. In the second-stage examination a subsample of 120 patients were interviewed with standardized clinical interview (CIDI) in order to obtain DSM-IV diagnoses of mental disorders. 44% (acute care) and 49% (rehabilitation) of the patients have high GHQ scores (cut-off &gt; 4). Furthermore, more than 20% of the cancer patients have elevated scores on the HADS subscales depression and anxiety (cut-off &gt; or = 11). Prevalence rates of mental disorders in the rehabilitation sample are 34% for the 4-week (vs. 24% in the acute care sample), 45% for the 6-month period (vs. 38%), and 79% for lifetime (vs. 49% in the acute care sample). The most frequent current disorders are affective (13% rehabilitation vs. 11% acute care) and anxiety disorders (17% in both samples). The rates of affective and anxiety disorders are much higher than the frequency of these disorders in recent epidemiological studies of the normal population in Germany. The high psychosocial burden expressed by the patients and the frequency of depressive and anxiety disorders emphasize the importance of (1) effective diagnostic strategies to recognize mental disorders, and (2) specialized psychosocial services in oncology, which provide psychological support and effective interventions for cancer patients in acute care and rehabilitation.","1159":"","1160":"In Germany, Susan Isernhagen's Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE) system has increasingly come into use over the last few years at the interface between medical and vocational rehabilitation. With implementation of these work-related tests of functional capacity it is possible to obtain valid statements concerning the further vocational prognosis. Along with evaluative testing by experts from different disciplines, the further steps towards integration occur on a well-founded basis. Therapies may thus be adjusted to the requirements of work, either at the former workplace or a new one, or possibly of a vocational (re-)training measure. Also, it is possible to directly deal with work-related issues in the report given at the end of rehabilitation, to initiate preliminary integrative steps in order to achieve a seamless, job retention-focussed transition back into work life. Work is simulated at different levels of loading capacity, the functional deficits of the rehabilitees are addressed in a specific, job-related manner, so as to enable an early return to work after rehabilitation.","1161":"","1162":"Organizing leisure time in an active way with lots of experiences is getting more and more important in western society. Accordingly, sports activities and travelling as well as their combination, holiday sports activities, are in great demand. A general idea of the literature in that field with regard to the possibilities and difficulties of handicapped persons is that holiday sports activities are considered apt to offer outstanding prerequisites for handicapped and nonhandicapped people getting closer to each other. Starting out on this basis, this survey is mainly dedicated to the following questions: What is the situation for handicapped persons in holiday sports activities? Is holiday sporting in a position to meet the expectations of social integration, and to what extent? A questionnaire about these items was answered by wheelchair users, making it clear, on the one hand, that there are hardly any offers for disabled people to take part in holiday sporting activities. On the other hand, the survey confirms that holiday sports activities are well suited to answer major demands of the integration issue, i.e., communication and interaction as well as other factors conducive to social integration. Subsequently, the author formulates the request that access to and participation in holiday sporting activities be made easier for disabled people so that greater use can be made of these special opportunities for social integration.","1163":"The literature on the role of sports in the treatment and rehabilitation of schizophrenic patients is meagre and no systematic interdisciplinary review of the subject exists. This article reviews the existing literature and summarizes the relevant research findings. It also discusses practical experiences derived from a model project designed to study the role of sports in the management of chronically ill psychiatric patients, which showed that social interaction as well as the ability to organize time and leisure activities improved as did self-esteem, body awareness, and overall physical activity. Sports activities as part of the care of chronically ill psychiatric patients are effective as well as cost-effective and should receive more attention in both practice and research.","1164":"In a cohort of patients with chronic schizophrenic disorders (n = 115) characterized by many social deficits and a high level of psychopathology, suggestions concerning rehabilitation were examined in an exploratory way and analysed referring to their relevance for community psychiatric care. The schizophrenic patients were followed up 1 and 12 months after discharge from hospital using an extensive array of instruments (among others: Needs for Care Assessment, Berlin Inventory of Care Needs). Included was a guided interview focusing on patients' subjective views relevant for the course of the disorder and for therapeutical procedures. Using a content analysis of the verbal material received at both points of study, the following main defining elements of the term rehabilitation (or reintegration, resp.) could be identified from the patients' perspective: vocational reintegration, independent residential setting, recovery of normality, and acceptance of responsibility. The rate of individualized confirmation in each category established after the first interview was between 75% and 93% 1 year after discharge from hospital.--Results from multiple and logistic regression analyses demonstrate that a higher degree of differentiation concerning individual rehabilitation suggestions exerts influence on the extent of subjective and normative needs for (psychiatric) care at the first point of study and moreover can be identified as a predictor of the decrease in the normative needs for care during the study period. To differentiate schizophrenic patients' suggestions referring to this subject can therefore be declared a therapeutical task. Furthermore it is a must to adjust individualized expert-based and subjective suggestions concentrating especially on the patients' main point of emphasis, i.e. vocational rehabilitation.","1165":"For efficient rehabilitation it is important to identify, as early as possible, the patients likely to be successfully returned to work after rehabilitation. The aim of this pilot study was to develop a statistical model for predicting this return as reliably as possible. The model uses only information readily available at the beginning of rehabilitation. A multiple regression analysis with backward elimination was used from a routine data base and identified 8 variables of prognostic value. The model offers a comfortable possibility to predict the probability of return to work of a patient on the basis of routinely registered data. The prognosis was found correct in 68% of those returning to work after rehabilitation (sensitivity) and in 80% of those who did not (specificity). Further work to improve the model for prognosis in rehabilitation research is considered reasonable.","1166":"There is need for comprehensive assessment of patients suitable for occupational therapy. The \"Ergotherapeutische Assessment\" (EA) occupational therapy assessment instrument has been developed recently by a group of experts in the field. Its main purpose is to significantly support occupational therapists in diagnostics, planning, communication and evaluation of therapeutic outcome. In a first step, EA was tested in a field study with regard to practicability, acceptance, and its effects on process quality. The EA was applied in 329 patients by 22 occupational therapists (office, institution) who had been specially trained (handbook, instruction session) prior to the study. In addition, participants had to answer standardized evaluation forms with respect to the general therapeutic success, relevant functional changes possibly not covered by the EA, and professional benefit in the areas under investigation. In summary, the value for practicability as described using a 10-point scale was 5.8, and 7.6 for acceptance. With regard to process quality, the ratings were 7.3 for diagnostic effect, 6.0 for definition of therapeutic aims, and 6.8 for improvement of communication between members of the rehabilitation team. The internal consistency of the five individual modules of the instrument as calculated by Cronbachs alpha was between 0.72 and 0.95. Changes considered relevant by the participants and not reflected by the instrument accounted for 9% only. The correlation coefficient for the evaluated general success of the patients and category changes found on the basis of EA severity ratings was 0.48.","1167":"Practical experience in adjusting complex computer-assisted (CAS) communication aids has resulted in a search for prognostic criteria useful in evaluating the efficacy of technical aids. Such evaluation implies a holistic approach as is included in the ICIDH-2. These circumstances are demonstrated by examples ranging from mechanical to computer-assisted (CAS) aids. \"Reciprocity\" has turned out to be a valid semi-qualitative criterion in describing the dynamic equilibration of the rehabilitative issues involved. Only a dialogical situation with reciprocity will lead to sustainable participation. In case of technical aids, a conjunction of abilities and the qualitative level of activities in disabled people have to be taken into account to provide all dimensions of participation. In this holistic approach, social participation and balance will equally be respected. The differentiation of social systems with unequal consequences for people with disabilities in terms of environmental factors, or e-code of the ICIDH-2, have to be considered for prognostic evaluation with regard to efficacy and possible participation. A comprehensive psycho-socio-functional rating therefore has to include a comparative (socio-structural or morphological) analysis of the environment at hand. This approach will invariably show that technical aids alone are unable to ensure individual independence but, rather, may lead to isolation if there is no regional or local networking based on partnership and close interpersonal relations to be drawn on \"technically\".","1168":"","1169":"","1170":"No net without a spider! After work accidents the victims can rely on the infrastructure created by the German accident insurance scheme (Berufsgenossenschaften). A surgeon, a so-called transit physician, is responsible after acute treatments also for all phases of rehabilitation. A Case Manager (Berufshelfer), an employee of the Berufsgenossenschaften, advises the victim in all matters, including vocational rehabilitation and personal concerns. Both factors combine to form a network that orientates on the social needs of the injured worker, on the financial tasks of the insurance agency and on incentives to the rehabilitation facilities. The goals comprise \"rehabilitation before compensation\" and \"job retention instead of job loss\".","1171":"Abnormal gait patterns cause an increase in the energy cost of walking in above-knee amputees. Disturbances of the walking pattern are often caused both by the amputated patient himself and by incorrect prosthetic fitting. The early detection and correction of causative factors is of great importance for successful rehabilitation of these amputees. During the follow-up examinations the prosthesis must be inspected for a correct fitting and individually appropriate knee stabilizing components. Prior to any corrective measures it must be excluded that the artificial limb has been put on incorrectly by the amputee himself.","1172":"Dermatological-allergologic climatotherapy is interpreted as a therapy within a specific climate with proven therapeutic benefits, immediate and longterm. Intensive classical dermatological in-patient therapy is combined with specific climatic effects. Primarily, the climate of the high mountains (1560 m) and of the North Sea islands is of proven efficacy for dermatoses and allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis (neurodermatitis), eczema, psoriasis, T-cell lymphoma, bronchial asthma. Specialized therapeutic utilities exist. Directly influencing climatic factors such as insolation, thermic-hygric and aerosol conditions without or with diminished allergic potency and nonspecific stimulating climate factors change immune functions and effect stabilization. The therapeutic immediate and longterm efficacy of the high mountain climate is proven by excellent follow-up results. Its superiority to the dermatological therapy applied at home is evident. Measurement and analysis of climate efficacy has however proven difficult because of its complexity. The findings of several recent clinical and biochemical studies are presented.","1173":"Although patient expectations are important factors of the success of rehabilitation, they have not yet received much attention in research. In the present cross-sectional study, n = 248 rehabilitation patients, n = 160 suffering from chronic back pain and n = 88 suffering from oncological diseases (breast cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer), were assessed at the time of admission to a rehabilitation clinic, using a newly developed self-report questionnaire to evaluate their expectations regarding the process and outcome of their rehabilitation. Results show on an item level that non-specific process expectations such as balneophysical treatments or features of the surroundings of the clinic were most prevailing. Across both diagnostic groups, common goals of rehabilitation such as reduction of complaints, physical fitness and recreation scored highest. On the basis of factor analysis, 10 scales of process expectations were constructed: medical attention, physical training, vocational counselling, balneophysical treatment, health information, stress management training, support groups, relief from the strains of everyday life, alternative medicine, and pleasant surroundings. Nine dimensions of outcome expectations were detected: ability for work, physical fitness, reduction of complaints, behaviour change, reduction of body weight, positive body feeling, vitality, enjoyment of life, and social contact. In the univariate analysis, orthopaedical patients scored higher on balneophysical treatments and vocational counselling (process expectations) as well as reduction of complaints and ability for work (outcome expectations). However, there were effects of age, gender and working status, too. Thus these differences between diagnostic groups turned out to be nonsignificant after controlling for the effects of age, gender, and working status. On the other hand, some effects of the medical condition had been hidden in the univariate comparison and were only revealed when adjusting for the moderator variables. Those differences show that oncological patients had higher expectations than back pain patients. Patients' expectations were correlated with functional status and, to a lesser degree, emotional distress and locus of control. To conclude, our study demonstrated that medical condition, sociodemographic factors, working status and functional capacity are important determinants of patient expectations regarding the process and outcome of rehabilitation.","1174":"Methodology of clinical studies is highly sophisticated in drug research. But clinical trials are also necessary to demonstrate efficacy and safety of rehabilitation treatment. The call for evidence based medicine has also reached rehabilitation. However, in rehabilitation medicine it is much more difficult to design and conduct clinical trials with a high methodological standard. Among the reasons are: A comparable control group is necessary because spontaneous healing and unspecific measures contribute to therapeutic success, too. But what could \"placebo rehabilitation\" look like? The masking of therapies (blinded studies) will hardly ever be possible. Therefore, it is more difficult to achieve the same treatment and observation for the treatment and control group. Treatments in rehabilitation take longer to become effective than a drug and maybe the success will disappear after some time. Therefore, long-term trials and follow-ups are necessary. Such studies are expensive, need a strong organisation, and drop-outs are unavoidable. An appropriate outcome variable does not always exist. \"Return to work\" is an important, reliable and valid variable, but it delivers only one bit of information per patient. As a consequence, smaller progress in rehabilitation can only be demonstrated with large sample sizes. Outcome variables based on time enable studies with reasonable sample sizes. Sometimes it is more difficult to obtain acceptance of randomisation in rehabilitation patients than in acute patients. Some rehabilitation hospitals have only recently begun to take an interest in controlled clinical trials, hence are not so experienced. Nevertheless, controlled clinical trials delivering convincing results are possible in rehabilitation medicine as well. But biometrical consultation is necessary e.g. for study design, study conduction and evaluation. Most important points are the methodology of the study design and its practicability. Especially in these topics rehabilitation physicians and biometrician have to cooperate.","1175":"In Germany, studies in rehabilitation research--in particular evaluation studies and examinations of quality of outcome--have so far mostly been executed according to the uncontrolled one-group pre-post design. Assessment of outcome is usually made by comparing the pre- and post-treatment means of the outcome variables. The pre-post differences are checked, and in case of significance, the results are increasingly presented in form of effect sizes. For this reason, this contribution presents different effect size indices used for the one-group pre-post design--in spite of fundamental doubts which exist in relation to that design due to its limited internal validity. The numerator concerning all effect size indices of the one-group pre-post design is defined as difference between the pre- and post-treatment means, whereas there are different possibilities and recommendations with regard to the denominator and hence the standard deviation that serves as the basis for standardizing the difference of the means. Used above all are standardization oriented towards the standard deviation of the pre-treatment scores, standardization oriented towards the pooled standard deviation of the pre- and post-treatment scores, and standardization oriented towards the standard deviation of the pre-post differences. Two examples are given to demonstrate that the different modes of calculating effect size indices in the one-group pre-post design may lead to very different outcome patterns. Additionally, it is pointed out that effect sizes from the uncontrolled one-group pre-post design generally tend to be higher than effect sizes from studies conducted with control groups. Finally, the pros and cons of the different effect size indices are discussed and recommendations are given.","1176":"The use of assessment instruments in evaluating functional capacity is an important element in the process of social-medical judgement of whether a person will likely be able to reintegrate into working life. Standardized work processes are used in simulating occupational reality over several hours, with all the requirements involved, and the performance found is contrasted with the requirements to be expected at a workplace. Time-tested in the U.S. for more than 20 years and applied throughout Germany for some two years now, the ERGOS work simulation system is presented in the article, using a case example for more detailed description. Using five different work stations, performance data are collected for job tasks such as carrying, working in kneeling position or overhead, and subjected to computer-based comparison with the job requirements information contained in relevant databases. This enables computerized identification of excessive demands, and hence may point to a need for further rehabilitative action. An important feature is objective assessment, as subjective information on the basis of observation or reports of painfulness are raised separately, hence do not influence the findings of the work simulation performed.","1177":"","1178":"","1179":"In orthopaedic-traumatologic rehabilitation, muscular atrophies, joint contractures, bone loss and other restrictions of the locomotor system can be prevented or at least diminished. After an operation in particular, decreases in physical capacity of the locomotor and cardiopulmonary systems are common, which can be countered by special training therapies. Therefore, an effective rehabilitation programme is necessary including specific therapy forms and training concepts based on scientific findings in sports medicine, performance physiology and training sciences, in orthopaedics and traumatology as well as further medical disciplines. Determination of the load on the locomotor system and examination of cardiopulmonary capacity are important basic elements of rehabilitation training. Rehabilitation should include intense muscular and regular endurance training where loads must be tuned to the patient's individual capacity. Overuse syndromes can be avoided by planning regeneration breaks between training units and by continuously controlling the individual parameters of the patient. The costs of intense rehabilitation may at first seem high; however, one year after an operation the financial expenditures in those patients who did not receive intense rehabilitation exceeded all costs incurred for an operation and additional rehabilitation.","1180":"Every year, more than half a million people in Germany experience a stroke or a traumatic brain injury. A high percentage of them leave the hospital with neuropsychological deficiencies of attention, memory, speech or perception preventing them from returning to work. The German rehabilitation system is primarily funded by the statutory pension insurance system and is hospital-based, but only very few brain-damaged patients have the opportunity to be treated there. Hospital rehabilitation programmes often integrate neuropsychological trainings whereas neuropsychologically based outpatient programmes do not exist. Therefore two questions are crucial. First, are those separate neuropsychological trainings effective? Second, are positive effects generalized? Studies concerning these questions are reviewed. Not many of them, however, meet the usual requirements for valid intervention research, and their findings are equivocal. Nevertheless, they suggest that neuropsychological rehabilitation should be undertaken more frequently, which would offer a framework for future efficacy research.","1181":"The scourge of unemployment has been roundly identified throughout Europe as the most pressing social and economic problem on the current political agenda. At Luxembourg in November 1997, the European Jobs Summit brought Europe's leaders together in an historic occasion that mapped out employment guidelines for Europe. The Luxembourg Jobs Summit agreed a set of guidelines for the Member States employment policy under four pillars, employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability, and equal opportunities. One guideline referred to promoting integration of people with disabilities into working life. The Member States subsequently agreed to incorporate the Guidelines into national employment action plans. The question of this paper is, to what extent do employment guidelines and National Action Plans improve the opportunities of disabled persons? This paper seeks to establish a set of fundamental issues concerning employment and disability. Included in this analysis are recommendations in order to achieve a better presence of disabled people in National Action Plans in future.","1182":"","1183":"An overview is presented of the technical conditions, approaches, existing Internet services, famous homepages about rehabilitation in the Internet (WWW) as well as other possibilities of obtaining information via the Internet.","1184":"A decisive element of reliable maintenance of the rehabilitation result achieved by patients undergoing inpatient cardiac rehabilitation has turned out to be comprehensive and successful management of the transition into the outpatient phase. This requires concrete planning and implementation of the concept, to be based on patient-related approaches and including the family physician, relatives, occupational institutions, and local and regional partners such as adult education centres, health insurances, sports clubs, psychological individual care, etc. Problem-orientated planning adapted to the individual requirements and expectations of the patient is of utmost importance.","1185":null,"1186":"The initiation of rehabilitation after lumbar disc surgery in Germany is up to the operating hospital. A decision between outpatient and inpatient rehabilitation is possible. Until now this decision is not based on scientific data but on the individual experience of the hospital. This prospective study compares the effect of outpatient and inpatient therapy: In 65 patients medical and psychosocial data were collected shortly before operation, 1 week and 6 months after surgery. Of these patients, 42 underwent inpatient, 21 outpatient rehabilitation, 2 patients renounced rehabilitation. The outpatient and inpatient rehabilitation groups showed no significant difference in testing before or shortly after the operation concerning subjective state of health and somatic findings. Some 6 months later, long term outcome was identical, i.e. the groups did not differ in psychosocial or medical respects. However, the inpatient rehabilitation group had taken significantly longer to return to work. This pilot study stresses the importance of further research on rehabilitation after lumbar disc surgery. It should be shared by surgeons and rehabilitation experts.","1187":null,"1188":"Specific difficulties in the assessment of reduced performance capacity in patients with gastroenterologic illness led to the development of a standardized and unified assessment method. The following five steps--exemplified for chronic liver-disease--were designed: (1) determination of disease features (and their graduations), leading to reduced performance capacity; (2) construction of a detailed performance capacity model using more concrete factors (e.g. motivation, cognition, cardiovascular-pulmonary system, etc.); (3) deduction of rules between disease features and the concrete factors of performance capacity, describing the expected (unfavourable) limitations; (4) consideration of individual limitations on the level of the concrete factors, and (5) conversion into a computer-aided expert system. The benefit of the method developed lies in prompt and practicable assistance by the expert system and in transparency of the decision processes. Therefore, performance capacity assessment will certainly gain in reliability and objectivity.","1189":"The \"International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems\", Tenth Revision (ICD-10), has to be used by all social security funds in Germany since Jan. 1, 2000. For purposes of the official statistical classification of causes of death, it has been used since 1998. There are a number of fundamental differences between the ICD-10 and the ninth revision. In particular, a considerably higher degree of specification and differentiation warrant a thorough look at the ICD-10 in numerous respects. The Unified diagnoses code of the statutory pension insurance is an extract from the ICD-10 referring specifically to diseases occurring in medical rehabilitation and early retirement contexts. Several new four- and five-digit codes were added for statutory pension insurance purposes, hence are not contained in the original ICD-10. This extract will only turn out a practical tool if the physician is well-qualified in his particular field and is familiar with the sometimes very complex differentiations within the systematical register in volume I of the ICD-10. The article provides an overview of the structure of the ICD-10; deals with major novelties and alterations as well as practical problems; uses various exemplary diagnoses to illustrate a systematical approach in possibly problematical encoding; and recalls several general rules for diagnoses encoding in social medicine.","1190":"Systems for comparing ability and requirement profiles as well as instruments for evaluating functional capacity are current topics in rehabilitation. Only few of them however are related to vocational rehab. This article describes the present state of affairs in the development in procedures, instruments and methods to measure work-related human functional capacity with the aim of vocational rehabilitation and integration, helping to obtain objective results to decide about further steps. They are an addition to sociomedical advice in assessment and vocational centres, and serve to expand the common basis of the WHO International Classification of impairments, disabilities and handicaps (ICIDH). The purpose is intervention. Abilities are contrasted with requirements, as the basis for defining a need for intervention and realizing appropriate action. This is the thinking integrated in the German profiling assessment and documentation system IMBA--Integration von Menschen mit Behinderungen in die Arbeitswelt (Integration of people with disabilities into worklife). Diagnostic, computer based technology and work simulation and measurement to evaluate functional capacity as developed and used in the U.S. is complementary to IMBA. Work simulation is based on databases, such as the D.O.T., and includes standardized work requirement profiles. Such systems have been imported from the United States of America to Switzerland and the Netherlands and now to Germany. There are numerous connections with German assessment systems, and the fundamentals of ICIDH are included. Common application in the field of rehabilitation is dealt with, also in view of pensioning issues. The need for user training and quality management are reported in this article as well.","1191":"","1192":"The BARMER Ersatzkasse health fund has introduced its own procedure to make medical rehabilitation available immediately after acute care (Anschlussrehabilitation, AR). Regional cooperation among hospitals and rehabilitation clinics, a differentiated service scheme as well as extensive quality management are the main elements of this case management system. Results of the basis documentation after conclusion of the test period are presented and aspects of specific demand are discussed.","1193":"The aim of this pilot study done in a neurological rehabilitation center for children and adolescents was to increase the transparency of costs in relation to work and to gain differentiated daily rates according to the kind and amount of nursing and multidisciplinary treatment of patients in different phases (B, C, D) of neurorehabilitation. Presented and discussed are methods and instruments for performance registration and connecting them to costs. As the study shows quite different daily rates are necessary to assure adequate treatment for young patients in different phases--early to late--of neurological rehabilitation.","1194":"Owing to the changes in the laws governing the health care system, medical rehabilitation for patients treated as in-patients is becoming increasingly a subject of discussion, especially for chronic illnesses. Using multiple sclerosis (encephalomyelitis disseminata) as an example, a special database is used to examine the courses, contents, improvements or deteriorations seen in in-patient rehabilitation as experienced by 901 patients who were in rehabilitation clinic in the years 1995-1998. This period was selected to allow the ascertainment of possible effects of far-reaching changes in the law taking effect from autumn 1996 onward. The EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale) was applied, and patients financed by statutory health insurances were compared with those financed by pension insurance funds for length of stay, outcome and therapeutic content. In the case of 256 patients being financed by pension funds it was possible to use the classification of therapeutic services as a basic tool and the connection with degree of disability was recognizable: different degrees of severity of the illness led to different treatment programmes. Health insurance patients were always more severely ill than those financed by pension insurance. Interestingly, the legal changes had no effect on the treatment outcomes of the patients. The data retrieved confirm the efficacy of the rehabilitation programmes.","1195":"Recently, several studies concerning the need for neuropsychologists in early or in out-patient rehabilitation settings have been submitted; however, an analysis of classical in-patient neurological rehabilitation which is most important by virtue of its numerical impact has not yet been performed. An empirical study focussing on the need for neuropsychologists during in-patient rehabilitation (phases C and D) is discussed. The two-year study records deficits observed among all patients with damage to the central nervous system (n = 788) admitted to a neurological rehabilitation clinic in north-western Germany. The deficits were divided into the following groups: memory, visual-constructional, deficits involving the planning process, attention deficits and emotional disturbances. Depending on the deficits displayed, patients were prescribed either individual or group therapy, or a combination of both. An empirical pattern of job distribution for neuropsychologists is calculated for the first time based upon findings of the study, which concern the time required for neuropsychological diagnostics, neuropsychological therapy, consultation of relatives and a fixed time-budget established for team supervision and documentation.","1196":"Studies undertaken in the scientific area of general systems theory generally seek to elucidate central interrelationships. This paper its no exception in that it presents a \"general model of psychosomatic rehabilitation\". This new Y-shaped model was inspired firstly by the \"general model of psychotherapy\" and secondly by general systematic considerations on medical rehabilitation. It was first used to assess the progress of patients undergoing inpatient psychosomatic rehabilitation and to determine the relationship between treatment intensity and length of time-sensitive psychotherapy.","1197":"","1198":"Premature discontinuance of rehabilitative measures can be considered a revised decision by the patient concerning participation or a revised decision by the clinic concerning admittance. Such termination of therapy suggests that the individual need for rehabilitation (defined as the fit between the patient's need for rehabilitation and the treatment offered by the rehabilitation facility) is not (or no longer) present, at least at this point in time. Assuming that the individual need for rehabilitation actually existed when treatment was requested or approval for rehabilitative measures was granted, the question arises as to when and how the need changed in such a way that would prevent the treatment from continuing as planned and being concluded in a regular fashion. This question will be taken into focus in the present article by developing a model for the prediction and explanation of prematurely discontinued treatment. This model will give central significance to the intention to co-operate, which is considered a dependent variable by reference to individual symptoms and treatment related expectations. Furthermore, various factors of influence during the stay in the clinic are formulated, which, firstly, have a presumed effect on the intention to cooperate and, secondly, have an influence on whether the intention to prematurely terminate treatment develops from a specific intention to cooperate and whether this is then realized. The model is discussed with regard to its practicability and possibilities for operationalization.","1199":"Presented is a computer-based system for interactive assignment control, designed to cope with the increasing requirements in rehabilitation and health care concerning quality assurance, greater flexibility, as well as enhanced effectiveness and efficiency. Thanks to multi-factor control, medical, organizational and economic parameters can be taken into account selectively. In addition, an unbureaucratic approach to determining length of rehabilitation programme participation is described, which has been implemented successfully for the last three years.","1200":"In Germany, the general practitioner plays an important role in the allocation process of rehabilitative measures. A survey concerning the questions of need, demand and effectiveness of medical rehabilitation measures as seen from the general practitioner's perspective in Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein und Halle\/Saale (n = 956) in 1999 shows that general practitioners have a rather positive attitude towards rehabilitation in general. With regard to the different measures within the rehabilitation system they show a differentiated opinion. As they see a large percentage of over- and underuse of rehabilitation they would appreciate that their information on the patient would be more intensively taken into account in the allocation process.","1201":"Among men and women cardiovascular diseases are among the three main causes for early retirement and participation in rehabilitation programmes. Rehabilitation research has only recently taken notice of the potential effect of gender on the need and outcome of cardiac rehabilitation care. Findings from epidemiological studies suggest that sex differences exist at every stage of heart disease and therefore may also be important for the quality and quantity of gender specific rehabilitation needs. Based on results from epidemiological studies this article first describes some essential biomedical differences between men and women regarding coronary heart disease which should be taken into account when type and amount of rehabilitation programmes are discussed. Afterwards, some recent findings are presented which focus on gender specific aspects of the use and acceptance of rehabilitation procedures.","1202":"Many studies prove the fact that the risk for morbidity and mortality is increased in lower social classes. Most chronical diseases also accumulate in lower classes. However, data are missing as to whether this social disadvantage also affects the use of medical rehabilitation, which could supply support in dealing with the consequences of such diseases. On the basis of questionnaire data of 3021 insures of the LVA pension insurance fund for workers, it was examined whether there are class specific differences in the need for medical rehabilitation and in the intention of insures to apply for such a measure and which kind of class specific barriers and attitudes may hinder the application. The results first of all confirm that insured of lower social classes are specially health strained and have a particular demand for rehabilitative offers. The insured, however, quite rarely rate themselves as requiring rehabilitation, whereas there is no significant class specific difference in the intention to apply for rehabilitation. There are significant differences in the attitudes which influence application for medical rehabilitation. Above all, there are economic considerations and job-related fears which hinder lower class insurees to apply for medical rehabilitation. This calls for action regarding implementation of special screenings and counselling.","1203":"There were substantial changes within the rehabilitation framework due to new laws as well as internal need for more flexibility. In connection with this process, the BfA and the LVA Sachsen initiated a survey among their insured persons, the main points being the need for and use of rehabilitative care. The results of a West\/East comparison are presented. A questionnaire was send to approximately 29,000 insured persons, the overall response rate was 43%. White collar workers in the East reported a better state of health compared with those in the West, with the most profound differences found in females. Subjective health status and subjective working capability were highly associated. The proportion of persons who reported a need for rehabilitation amounts to 24% among the insured with the LVA Sachsen (blue collar workers, East) and 12% among the white collar workers in the East. Independent of the state of health there was also an association between work stress and the need for rehabilitation. Persons from the East were less informed about rehabilitative care than persons from the West. Financial and workplace problems were among the major reasons not to apply for a rehabilitation measure even if there is a need. These reasons were mentioned more often in the East. In conclusion, there are substantial differences between West and East concerning the rehabilitative health sector. A prominent role is played by the employment situation.","1204":"The survey \"Determinants in Applying for Medical Rehabilitation\" intended to examine the interest of using rehabilitation services among workers in need of rehabilitation and clarify the reasons for the decline in applications for rehabilitation since 1995. For this reason 4400 blue collar workers of the regional pension fund (2% of the LVA population aged 40-59 years) were asked with a postal questionnaire. The response rate was 64%. In order to ensure the validity of the intentions stated, the pension fund verified how many workers actually filed an application for medical rehabilitation during the following twelve months. A quarter of the workers answering considered themselves in need for rehabilitation. Of these, 41% intended to file an application, 34% intended not to do so and 25% were undecided. The main reasons for intending to apply were encouragement by the GP and family members as well as the expectation of improving the working capacity. After one year, only 11% of the workers who claimed themselves to be in need for rehabilitation had filed an application for rehabilitation. This low number of applications from workers in subjective need for rehabilitation indicates a deficit in medical rehabilitation provision.","1205":"The demand for rehabilitation services and benefits under the pension insurance scheme has repeatedly seen fluctuations, in particular in the wake of amendments in the statutory prerequisites and benefit scope. Since late 1996, the discussion on the rank of rehab benefits and massive regulatory activity of the law-maker have resulted in major declines in the numbers of applications received. In a nationwide survey, representative statements have therefore been collected on the level of awareness of and attitudes towards the field of medical rehabilitation in the population at large. The findings show that clearly reduced levels of demand for rehabilitation services and benefits, i.e. a nearly 50% drop, will have to be expected in the years ahead. Even among insures whose working capacity is endangered for health reasons, there is quite a number who would rather refrain from applying for rehabilitation. Reasons given in particular include excessive costs due to the additional user charges, doubt of successful participation, and fear of jeopardizing employment. Only about half of the general population is familiar with the actual amount of additional user charges in case of rehab participation, and an even lower share is aware of the exemptions possible. A considerable proportion of the population at large is afraid of adverse occupational consequences in case of participation in a rehabilitation measure, a proportion which however is much lower among persons with earlier actual participation.","1206":"The need for rehabilitation is not absolute and given quality. Determination of the need for rehabilitation depends on various criteria, e.g., the case history and certain legally standardized medical prerequisites. Both the regulation of rehabilitation expenditures and different types of personal excess coverage may be interpreted as efforts on the part of social policy to introduce additional controls (i.e., alongside the medical prerequisites) of the need for rehabilitation. Since rehabilitation benefits are only granted in case the insured has applied for, the demand for personal excess coverage might cause a certain selection of financially powerful rehabilitees. Recent cost-cutting legislation, which inter alia included strict budgeting of rehabilitation expenditures and increased personal excess coverage, had entailed a considerable decline in the number of applications for rehabilitation in 1996 and 1997. Several pension insurance funds started questioning their insured to examine the general interest in using rehabilitation services. The results show a strong need for rehabilitation in the group of the older insured (aged 40 and over), however, only 35% to 40% of the insured in subjective need for rehabilitation intend to file an application for rehabilitation and an even smaller number of insured actually apply for rehabilitation. Major impediments to applying for rehabilitation mentioned are job uncertainty as well as the increased personal excess coverage under the recent austerity legislation.","1207":"Usually, only recent developments concerning application for, treatments and costs of inpatient rehabilitation are in focus and reported regularly to all those involved. This contribution, however, analyses the long-term development of data in the context of rehabilitation under the German statutory pension insurance scheme since 1968, seeking to gain insights relative to the present and future situation in the field of rehabilitation.","1208":"As before the concept and content regarding the need for rehabilitation have still not been sufficiently clarified. In particular, an operationalization of the underlying parameters, as the basis for their measurement is absent. Some exemplary research concepts have been introduced and their methodological implications have been put out. Resulting from this, up till now, in the most developed model, determining the need for rehabilitation has been developed as a latent multi-dimensional variable. A framework, as a starting point for a multi-dimensional investigation regarding the need for rehabilitation has been introduced. According to this, the need for rehabilitation is a multidimensional, qualitative construct, that can not be directly observed and measured. The empirical investigation, which is based on this, limits the description of the need for rehabilitation to the various patterns of determinants, (description by a set of requirement factors and arranged factors) which result in different effects. Therefore different samples regarding the qualitative aspect do not mean the lesser or greater need for rehabilitation based on a continuum of measurement, but different qualitative forms which are visible in different effects.","1209":"Regarding rehabilitation demands, macro-analytical time-series models outline a method for the estimation of effective rehabilitation needs and for explaining the magnitude of the requirements. Their range is limited, in so far as they are unable to clarify the rehabilitation requirement regarding individual micro-level behavioural aspects. For the moment the rehabilitation requirements are hidden units in the models. Differing macro-dimensions have been gradually included in the analysis. The demographic parameters of the potential patients in need of rehabilitation are the fundamental starting point. Rehabilitation requirements are increasingly modelled by the magnitude of the curative requirements. These are characterised in the rehabilitation as \"preliminary or follow up\". Two examples of simple time-series models in rehabilitation--for the development of rehabilitation demand--illustrate empirically, which possibilities and boundaries are set in view of demographic and curative requirements by the interpretative range of the macro-concepts. What is methodically interesting with it, is how the analytical borders of such time-series models can experience a recognisable theoretical broadening, through a projection in real logistical facts--here in the interaction between prognosis and retrospection.","1210":"In Germany, members of social insurance (e.g., pension) schemes have to apply for medical rehabilitation. Usually, the applications are the expression of a subjective demand. If the applications are granted this leads to the actual supply of medical rehabilitation services. Formerly, long waiting lists were common. These have been replaced by a new balance between demand (amount of applications), \"offer\" (capacity of rehabilitation clinics) and the amount of granted applications. In addition to these notions, the article develops the concept of need for rehabilitation services based on sociomedical indications. Consequently, the need for medical rehabilitation can--to a certain degree--be objectified. The concept of need should not be mixed up with that of demand: not every member of a social insurance scheme who objectively is in need of medical rehabilitation realizes the need, not everybody who realizes a need will apply for rehabilitation, and not all applications will be granted. The article gives an overview of different ways of needs assessment.","1211":"","1212":"In 1994, the German statutory pension insurance scheme started to develop a quality assurance programme in rehabilitation clinics, involving scientists giving support to the project. Established as a routine in 1998, the programme is based on the integrated use of different instruments relating to structural, procedural as well as outcome quality. Analysis and evaluation of data follow a concept of clinic comparisons, assessing particular groups of clinics of similar structure. The specific instruments used are described, their development is outlined and their application explained.","1213":"Assessment of non-operative treatment of orthopaedic diseases is sometimes considered difficult. The purpose of this retrospective longitudinal study on the one hand is to evaluate the formal quality of questionnaire data under routine conditions in an in-patient rehabilitation hospital and on the other hand to study the impact of additional psychologic treatment on the outcome of patients who received conservative treatment for chronic orthopaedic diseases. During a 7-month period, a total of 900 patients received a standardized questionnaire at the beginning and the end of a 4-week inhouse treatment for chronic orthopaedic diseases. A questionnaire handed out to the patients at arrival includes 33 items of psychophysiologic interest. At discharge, a modified questionnaire was used, focussing on the course of complaints during the treatment period, and including additional control-questions for consistency. Return of the questionnaires was voluntary, no pressure was applied, no effort was made to correct inconsistent or missing data. The results presented here are based on 105 orthopaedic patients who returned both questionnaires complete with consistent data. Of these, 44 received additional psychologic treatment by a psychologist, while 61 did not. Participation or non-participation in the psychologic treatment was the grouping variable in this study. For only 189\/900 (21%) of the patients taking part in the study complete and consistent questionnaires were available for analysis. For the 105 orthopaedic patients, no significant score differences at arrival between the groups were detected (p = 0.38) using the Mann-Whitney U-test. At discharge, the mean rank sums for the psychological intervention group was 45.7, while it amounted to 58.3 in the control group, indicating significantly stronger improvement of symptoms in the intervention group (p = 0.04). Under routine conditions without any arrangements to ensure data quality a great amount of incomplete and\/or inconsistent data has to be expected. For subsequent studies, this fact has to be taken into account. Irrespective of this aspect, complementary psychologic treatment of certain orthopaedic diseases seems to lead to significantly better results of treatment, as assessed by a psychophysiological questionnaire. ","1214":"Pain is a well known phenomenon in posttraumatic spinal cord injuries. Nearly 10% of the patients develop most severe, invalidizing, as a rule neurogenic pain conditions that are hardly accessible to conventional therapies. A pilot study was therefore conducted with 10 paraplegics and tetraplegics suffering chronic pain, investigating how vibration supported music therapy with the Musica Medica method affected pain experience, tension\/relaxation and well-being. In addition to subjective experience, we measured physiological parameters (finger tip skin temperature, electrodermal activity, heart rate, respiration frequency) during the therapy sessions. All patients had a high acceptance of the method which throughout the group had brought about an increase in relaxation and well-being as well as a decrease of pain experience. The autonomic nervous system variables correlated with relaxation and in addition pointed to an activating impact of the therapy chosen.","1215":null,"1216":"In a period of ten years 159 residents were admitted to a transitional home. 90% of them were diagnosed as chronic schizophrenics with a marked psychic and social handicap. With an average age of 28.7 years and a mean duration of illness of 6.8 years most of the patients had been hospitalized several times; 95% had no job, lived on social assistance or were invalidity pensioners. There was poor success in vocational rehabilitation (22%). Better results were seen in solving the housing problems, showing a clear-cut tendency to move from the family of origin into protected group homes or independent living. Positive effects of social training with gains in life-coping abilities and social competence, i.e., in autonomy in everyday life could be observed as well.","1217":"Since the early 90s, team work has become enormously important as a new model of labour organisation. Team work is the centre-piece of far-reaching restructuring and rationalization processes in companies. New team work concepts generate both risks and opportunities for workers with disabilities. The implementation of teams has been accompanied by a reduction of traditional employment areas in which people with disabilities have often been employed in stand-alone workplaces. Within teams, disabled workers may face discrimination and exclusion if other team members have to be afraid of wage cuts due to performance restrictions. The risk of exclusion has to be counteracted by adaptation and redesign of the working conditions, by selective training, mechanisms to manage social processes and conflicts in teams, as well as by rehabilitation.","1218":"Based on data from a prospective observational cohort study the following article attempts to answer two key questions of rehabilitation research in Germany: (1) What are the utilization rates of rehabilitation measures in patients with long-term work-incapacity due to low-back pain? (2) In this group of patients: does participation in rehabilitation programs correlate with return to work? Patients with long-term work-incapacity due to low-back pain report a severely impaired health status (measured by FFbH, SF-36, numeric rating scale for pain intensity) which calls for comprehensive medical treatment and rehabilitation. 40.5% of study patients received first time medical rehabilitation between three months and one year after the beginning of long-term work-incapacity, 20.5% between one year and two years after the beginning of long-term work-incapacity. These figures were not influenced by age. Considering the severity of impairment we judge these rates as being quite low. There was no positive correlation found between utilization of medical rehabilitation measures or any other medical treatment and return to work. A positive correlation was observed for utilization of first time medical rehabilitation between three months to one year after the beginning of long-term work-incapacity and functional capacity. This effect was demonstrable for patients 50 years of age or younger. (1) In our cohort utilization of medical rehabilitation measures in patients with low-back pain and long-term work-incapacity is quite low. This suggests a considerable amount of underutilization. (2) In order to avoid underutilization the process of accessing medical rehabilitation within the German health care system should be critically reviewed. (3) In the given context of high unemployment rates and the German early pensioning system the use of \"return to work\" as the main criterion to judge effectiveness of rehabilitation measures remains debatable.

This paper analyzes the development of utilization of the ZaR using patient application, admission and discharge data for a one year period (April 1997 to March 1998). Treatment was started for 1,009 patients (mean age 51.1 years; 55% female). While mean duration of a treatment period was 28.5 days, overall utilization of the ZaR was 49%, being higher for the neurological department than for the orthopedic department (74% and 40%, respectively). The variety of patient problems treated was fairly small: more than two thirds of the cases treated were patients after stroke (ICD 430-438) in the neurological department and patients with back problems (ICD 721-724) in the orthopedic department, respectively. Acute care hospitals still play a minor role in referring patients to the ZaR. Referrals of many office-based physicians suggest that the ZaR will achieve its intention to provide rehabilitative services close to the patient's home.","1221":"A study is carried out to examine a demonstration project for partial hospitalization rehabilitation of patients of the pension insurance scheme of Rhineland-Palatinate (LVA Rheinland-Pfalz) using a parallel design. In four centers for the rehabilitation of musculoskeletal diseases the patients are assessed at the beginning and at the end of rehabilitation as well as six and twelve months post using the IRES questionnaire, a phycisians' questionnaire for the documentation of medical parameters, an instrument for client satisfaction and additional questionnaires. In addition the treatment and the costs on the side of the pension insurance agency are examined. Partial hospitalization rehabilitation clients are compared to inpatient ones from three rehabilitation hospitals. Preliminary analyses of patient self-report data show a strong similarity of inpatient and partial hospitalization clients as far as admission parameters, rehabilitation treatment, perception of rehabilitation and its effects are concerned. These results indicate that the pension insurance schemes' concept of interdisciplinary rehabilitation can be realized in partial hospitalization rehabilitation centers as well, achieving an outcome very similar to inpatient rehabilitation.","1222":"Although patients' perspectives play an important role in most area of the health care system, little is known so far about patients' views regarding outpatient rehabilitation. As part of an evaluation study on new model of rehabilitation, we therefore also investigated the patients' views, giving special attention to the commonly suggested advantages of outpatient rehabilitation. In the study, 1013 patients were given a questionnaire, in which patients could evaluate their satisfaction with outpatient rehabilitation and could mark preferences for either inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation. The results confirmed to a large extent the advantages of outpatient rehabilitation. This form of rehabilitation offers the patients a complex therapy close to their residence and can facilitate an early occupational reintegration. Outpatient rehabilitation also offers the possibility to take care of the family and to spend free time with the family. This fact is perceived as one important advantage leading to preference for outpatient rehabilitation. In general, patients were most satisfied with the care given by their therapists or physician, as well as with the treatment. They were less satisfied with the subsequent treatment after rehabilitation. A majority of patients felt left alone after treatment. One of the advantages of outpatient rehabilitation is the possibility of including relatives and the family doctor in the outpatient treatment. However, only few patients agreed, that the family doctor or relatives were sufficiently included in the treatment. Most younger patients prefer the outpatient rehabilitation. One of the reasons given was the possibility of taking care of important jobs at home. The results of our study give evidence for a high demand of patients for outpatient rehabilitation.","1223":null,"1224":"The comparison of patient characteristics and effectiveness of inpatient rehabilitation (IPR) and outpatient rehabilitation (OPR) is of growing importance in terms of flexible and cost-effective structures in rehabilitation. The effectiveness of the treatment is measured applying a goaloriented approach based on the individual rehabilitation goals and the attainment of these goals at the end of the programme. The frequencies of rehabilitation goals chosen by patients in IPR and OPR are similar. Decrease of pain, improvement of muscular strength and improvement of the range of motion are the main goals of patients in IPR and OPR (92-56%). No relevant differences can be seen considering the effectiveness of IPR and OPR, except for the markedly higher improvement of vitality in IPR. Patients in need of rehabilitation whose primary rehabilitation goal is improvement of vitality should therefore preferentially be referred to an inpatient rehabilitation programme.","1225":"Medical rehabilitation in the Federal Republic of Germany has been provided in an almost exclusively inpatient setting up to now. However, in view of an intensified development of outpatient rehabilitation programs there are new challenges to confront. As to indication criteria, new preconditions and handling directives have to be defined in order to refer patients to those rehabilitation programs from which they can profit the most. Up to now, there has been a considerable lack of knowledge as to what kind of criteria must be considered in the transfer process. The present study represents results of expert interviews (Delphi method) regarding this topic. 50 experts from inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation facilities, from the Medical Services of health insurance funds and the pension insurance system, from rehabilitation agencies as well as rehabilitation research, have been questioned since they take important stands on these questions and since their assessment has a guiding quality. An additional study had been directed at the factors which determine present decision-making in terms of inpatient vs. outpatient rehabilitation. The results show that the experts stress the importance of a multitude of different aspects; however, there still is but little consensus concerning the criteria that should invariably be considered in making these rehabilitation decisions.","1226":"Despite the necessity to expand the outpatient rehabilitation system in Germany the development up to now must be described as quite reluctant. As yet there is a considerable lack of information about the demand for such care in Germany. On the basis of a complex study design insurants, applicants for medical rehabilitation, physicians in a rehabilitation hospital and general practitioners were asked how they estimated the demand for outpatient orthopedic rehabilitation care. Resulting data unanimously show a substantial demand in roughly one third of insurants who desire rehabilitation, clearly exceeding the already realized outpatient care. The investigation also illustrated that physicians often are uncertain as to their decisions and that depending on the respective point of view (insurants or different groups of physicians) there are different preferences as to the kind of rehabilitative care for the benefit of one specific patient. The results stress not only the fact that there is a demand for information of insurants and their referring physicians regarding the new outpatient rehabilitation offer, but also reveal the demand for a development of differential indication criteria for outpatient and inpatient rehabilitation, as well as for definite procedural regulations which should be harmonized among all insurers.","1227":"Up to now, the majority of rehabilitative measures in Germany has been performed in inpatient programmes. In the past 10 years discussions have increased about extending a flexible scheme involving outpatient, inpatient and partially inpatient rehabilitation benefits. Some concepts in outpatient rehabilitation were already developed as well by the Federal Rehabilitation Council as by various rehabilitation providers. Concept requirements include the principles of holism, interdisciplinarity, goal-oriented rehabilitation and team-work of rehabilitation staff. The arguments in favour of extended outpatient rehabilitation are being faced with many questions and uncertainty about future needs, differential indication criteria and effectiveness. In order to answer these questions pilot projects accompanied by scientists are being conducted for different indication fields. Preliminary findings of the scientific studies indicate that the inpatient rehabilitation model gains more acceptance than the partially inpatient type. The studies on the whole show that partially inpatient populations differ from inpatient ones on various variables. Considering these limitations in comparability, there is a tendency for partially inpatient rehabilitation to yield similar results as inpatient measures. Additionally, it is important to accurately identify the indication.","1228":"","1229":"In light of the recent constitutional amendment on behalf of people with disabilities, the present article inquiries into the tangible consequences the ban on discriminating against disabled persons has had in the various domains of social life.

In 162 male and female patients up to 60 years of age undergoing inpatient cardiological rehabilitation under the pension insurance scheme for workers, a significant decrease of serum cholesterol values could be observed between the beginning and the end of cardiological rehabilitation of 24.5 mg% (10.6%), with a subsequent increase of 12.5 mg% (6%) seven months later. Independent of a possible medical antilipemic therapy the group of patients with a positive occupational perspective was found to have better controlled serum cholesterol values than pensioners or those patients with a negative occupational perspective such as unemployment or dismissal. It can be assumed that those patients having a positive occupational perspective are more likely to follow dietetic and\/or medical therapeutic regimes.","1231":"In a group of nine paraplegics a significant increase of pulmonary vital capacity could be shown after participating in a two weeks Scuba (self containing underwater breathing apparatus) diving training. During dives and for a certain time afterwards, a satisfyingly sensed reduction of painful muscle spasms occurred. A comparable group of sailing paraplegics did not show any significant changes within the same time. Because of strict ability criteria combined with an enormous effort of care to meet all security precautions this approach to neurorehabilitation can be offered to a limited number of patients only.","1232":"Complications following arthroscopic knee surgery are known from the literature to be relatively rare. It hence is all the more important for the rehabilitation staff to know the possible risks for complications. Usually it is quite sufficient to perform a good clinical examination in case of complications in order to be able to carry out the necessary therapeutic measures in regular contact with the surgeons involved. Among the most dangerous complications requiring immediate therapy are the extraarticular vascular complication, the knee joint infection, and the intraarticular bleeding complication. Responsible teamwork among surgeons and rehabilitation staff will be the key to a successful treatment outcome.","1233":"In order to investigate the long-term effect of clinical rehabilitation measures as well as the additional effect of prescription of a special pillow in patients suffering from chronic cervicobrachialgia a total of 149 patients was investigated. All patients suffered from chronic cervicobrachialgia and were admitted for rehabilitative treatment in the orthopaedic Elfenmaar-Klinik of Bad Bertrich. For a four-week period the patients were treated with physical therapy including gymnastics, electrotherapy, thermotherapy, and massage. Additionally they underwent a health-promoting programme specially designed for patients with spondylopathia. The patients were randomly divided into two groups, one receiving a special pillow (Curavario, Pala-Medic-Company) for the use during and after the rehabilitative treatment (n = 76 or n = 73, respectively). For two weeks before the treatment, during the four-week treatment period and for two weeks after the treatment the patients had to fill in a questionnaire, comprising among others six questions on the intensity of their cervicobrachialgic symptoms (pain-intensity [local pain, radiation of pain], muscular tenseness, paraesthesia and sleep disorders [caused by pain or paraesthesia]). Three, six, and nine month after the treatment period the patients received a similar questionnaire. Immediately after the treatment period a significant reduction of mean pain intensity and muscle tenseness (p &lt; 0.001; Rep.-Mes.-ANOVA) was found. At the same time significantly lower frequencies of pain radiation and sleep disorders caused by pain or paraesthesia (p &lt; 0.001; chi-square-test) were found. During the following nine months the intensity of the symptoms slightly re-increased, however, all parameters were still reduced nine months after treatment compared to the values before treatment (p &lt; 0.01). Before and during the treatment no difference between the two groups could be detected, however, the follow-up showed significantly lower scores of pain intensity (p &lt; 0.05; Student-t-test) and sleep disorders (p &lt; 0.01; chi-square test) in the patients who had received the special pillow. It is concluded that the rehabilitative treatment is effective in patients suffering from chronic cervicobrachialgia and that the complaints in the post-treatment period can be reduced by prescription of special pillows.","1234":"Hip fractures are a health problem of paramount importance for the individual and society. They are associated with a sharp increase of the incidence of immobility, dependency, nursing home placement, and death. In Germany, more than 100,000 elderly suffer a hip fracture every year. 90% of fractures of the proximal femur result from a fall with an impact near the hip. The kinetic energy of a fall from standing height without successful protective reactions is far above the fracture threshold of a femur in a man aged 70 and older, regardless of osteoporosis and sex. Therefore, propensity to fall and mechanisms of falling are more important in the pathogenesis of hip fracture than bone mineral density alone. The combination of age-associated gait and balance disorders, which increase the probability of falls, and age-related decreasing strength of the femur is responsible for the high incidence of hip fractures. Besides the interventions to reduce the fall frequency it is possible to decrease the number of hip fractures by a passive protection of the trochanter. An energy-shunting protector (crash helmet-like, hip padding) has been developed by Lauritzen and Lund (safehip). The protector consists of two stiff shells, sewn into special undergarment. The shells disperse the impact away from the trochanter to soft tissue, and increase the area of contact. A controlled study among nursing home residents has demonstrated a relative risk of hip fracture of 0.44 (95% CC 0.21 to 0.94) in the intervention group, i.e., the protector has reduced the number of hip fractures by more than a half. No hip fracture has happened during use of the protector. Using the protector can improve self-confidence and diminish self-restraint of physical activity, which is not rarely caused by fear of falling. Further investigations of compliance are necessary.","1235":null,"1236":"Current research in medical rehabilitation lacks well designed clinical studies to demonstrate the efficacy, effectiveness and efficiency of rehabilitation interventions. Randomized controlled studies (RCTs) are difficult to conduct in rehabilitation research because of multiple variables and difficulties to include appropriate control groups. Therefore, we propose the development of a rehabilitation database and network for Germany to allow data collection from daily rehabilitation practice in the three areas medical-objective, perceptive-subjective and economical-social, designed after the example of the Uniform Datasystem of Medical Rehabilitation (UDSMRSM). This American database uses the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) to monitor functional changes in medical rehabilitation patients. Quarterly reports are sent out to participating institutions and allow comparisons with other regional, national and international institutions. The database demonstrates an initial step towards the concept of \"evidence-based rehabilitation\" by defining a common rehabilitation outcome and it allows benchmarking with other rehabilitation facilities. This permits the development of quality standards, cost analyses, payment systems and a new research methodology that can identify the most effective rehabilitation method through statistical analysis for focused clinical trials.","1237":"","1238":"","1239":"","1240":"","1241":"","1242":"","1243":"A novel form of residence for persons with physical disablement is presented on the example of the Stuttgart \"House on the Vineyard\".

For this task the general regulations of the pension insurance agencies as well as the conceptions existing in the field of psychosomatics and psychotherapy can serve as a sufficient basis for the conceptual development of partial hospitalization psychosomatic rehabilitation inspite of several differences between them. The elaboration of concrete outlines of this kind of psychosomatic rehabilitation takes place within a framework of structural models which encompasses different variants of institutional, organizational, functional and content forms of partial hospitalization rehabilitation. Moreover, the conceptual development of day treatment in rehabilitation raises several questions of the overall system of psychosomatic rehabilitation and offers possible solutions of general problems in psychosomatic rehabilitation. On this conceptual basis, in the further construction of partial hospitalization in psychosomatic rehabilitation concrete models should be designed and tested in clinical practice along with scientific evaluation.","1245":"The present study had been aimed at identifying factors influencing the rehabilitation outcome of stroke patients and at verifying the rank of these factors from a prognostic angle. It was found on a population of 361 patients that age, gender and the risk factors arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus, when viewed in isolation, do not have a significant influence on rehabilitation outcome. In light of this finding, great prognostic significance is attached to the course of therapy as such. We have been able to show that, in a majority of the patients, a reliable estimate of the final outcome attained can already be made within the initial four weeks of treatment based on an empirically determined targeted weekly gain of 5 Barthel points. It is shown on a group of 118 patients that application of this prognostic index has benefitted some 87% of the patients in terms of duration of therapy.","1246":"In n = 1504 consecutive patients after inpatient cardiac rehabilitation, we investigate how many patients can be motivated to join a so-called outpatient heart group, which sociographical and medical variables influence participation, and whether participation in a heart group prompts a more health-orientated nutrition. Applying a special team-based motivation programme, almost 30% of patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation under the pension insurance scheme for workers can be motivated to join a heart group, who otherwise can hardly be prompted to do so. About 75% of them still participate in the heart group 7 months later. Initial and continuing participation are more probable in patients of middle age, male gender, with previous PTCA, moderately or severely restricted left ventricular function, and--for patients up to the age of 55 years--in case of reintegration or expected reintegration into work life. Patients after heart valve surgery are significantly less liable to join a heart group than CHD patients. Seven months after cardiac rehabilitation, medium cholesterol values have less increased among participants of heart groups than among non-participants. This may indicate a more stabilized health-orientated lifestyle among members of heart groups.","1247":"A great majority (85% to 92%, N = 196) of the cardiological patients in inpatient rehabilitation, who were investigated in this study, expressed clear satisfaction with inpatient care and in particular with medical treatment as well as with the commitment and skills of doctors and other caregivers. The usefulness of treatments and measures was mainly confirmed, especially with respect to remedial gymnastics, physiotherapy and rehabilitation sports. But unspecific offers of inpatient rehabilitation are obviously also evaluated positively, e.g. \"distancing from everyday stress\" and \"cultural events\" outside the clinics. Relaxation training and psychosocial counseling were used only by one third approximately, but most of the users gave \"useful\" or \"very useful\" evaluation ratings. 77% would again choose inpatient rehabilitation if they were confronted with this decision. 15% would prefer partial-hospitalization, only 4% ambulatory rehabilitation. 36% say that \"near-home rehabilitation\" basically is more favourable, but 33% prefer the opposite and say that rehabilitation far away from home has greater advantages. Only 8% consider ambulatory rehabilitation a possible replacement of inpatient rehabilitation, 66% say it is complementary to the inpatient mode.","1248":"Although it has long been undisputed that successful rehabilitation outcomes require early-onset, comprehensive rehabilitative intervention, research findings show that major shortcomings exist concerning the provision of rehabilitative care in hospitals. Contrary to the statutory premises at hand, a majority of hospitals continue to consider rehabilitation a treatment phase scheduled to set in only after completion of acute care. \"Rehabilitation of the first day\", a long-standing demand among the professional community, is hardly taking place at all. The rank of hospital-integrated early rehabilitation has now been confirmed in the framework of a model facility supported by the Federal ministry of labour and social order, with the recently completed scientific follow-along of the Ingolstadt Klinikum department for transdisciplinary early rehabilitation having made available research evidence of the effectiveness and efficiency of early-onset, comprehensive rehabilitation interventions in the hospital, and presented in this article for the first time.","1249":"","1250":"","1251":"The guide dog is the sole living sensory aid recognized by Germany's statutory health insurance and medical rehabilitation system to help a blind person to compensate for the loss of eyesight. The guide dog is also the only recognized mobility aid that enables a blind person to reach destinations with greater speed and confidence by locating obstacles such as steps and ditches and avoiding them. Leading a person through traffic is not a dog's natural trait. Therefore, training and safety standards are essential to ensure smooth teamwork and communication between handler and dog. The guide dog offers much more than a simple technical aid such as a walking stick but not as much as a seeing human companion. To make up for this deficit, the blind person must also learn how to orientate him or herself and not just depend on the dog. For people blinded later in life a reliable guide dog can be an \"aid with soul\" that provides pet-facilitated therapy and companionship. On the other hand, a guide dog with character disturbances, physical deficiencies or insufficient training can become an additional burden and social hindrance--even a danger for the person it is supposed to be protecting and others such as motorists. The puppy chosen to become a guide dog requires expert trainers and host families to rear and socialize it to interact appropriately with other dogs and other human beings. This stable upbringing is particularly important for the dog as it grows up and is confronted with negative influences. The blind person too learns to conceptualize the animal's own \"dog world\" so that he or she can build a firmer bond of trust.","1252":"Blindness entails an altered situation in the areas of information intake and processing concerning the aspects of perception, inter alia spatial, and concept formation.

The central aim therefore is to put the modern computer technology at the disposal of the impaired in a way that enables them to make use of the newspaper without having had previous experience. In a first phase of several months twelve probands in different personal settings will test a first prototype of the newspaper reading machine, a modified and optimated multimedia computer system with modern and speech output, at home. During this period the users will be intensively looked after and undergo psychodiagnostic examination. By means of analysing the data collected in extended talks and questionnaires concrete proposals on how to improve the machine are to be made and a statement about the potential impact of the electronic newspaper on the quality of life of the visually impaired--in the sense of a contribution to their rehabilitation--is to be given.","1254":"Falls prove to be a significant problem in geriatrics. 5% of falls lead to fractures and 10% to soft tissue injuries. We examined retrospectively the rehabilitation course of 78 patients, who had been treated by us after falls leading to injury. Fractures of the neck of femur predominated with 57%, followed by other fractures of the lower limbs with 13%. The remainder of the falls with consequences of injury lead to fractures of other parts and soft tissue injuries. In 34% of the falls, the cause was estimated as predominantly intrinsic and in 11% as extrinsic. 19% of the falls were a mixture of extrinsic and intrinsic factors. In 36% of the cases the cause remained unknown. Before the fall occurred, 72% were independent, 26% needed help and 1 patients was in need of care. After finishing rehabilitation 54% were independent, 34% needed help and 11% were in need of care. 86% were able to return to their usual social surroundings. Rehabilitation after falls with consequences of injury goes beyond mere \"orthopedic\" treatment. To minimize the future risk of fall, a precise analysis of the cause of fall should be implemented.

This decision reflects not only a new political attitude toward the promotion of research but also represents the initiation of attempts to overcome existing research deficits permanently by means of an extensive programme for the promotion of research. In addition to the construction of a scientific infrastructure, the funders most importantly expect results that will contribute to the further optimisation of effectiveness and efficiency in rehabilitation services. An improved scientific foundation of rehabilitative practice will also assist the field of rehabilitation in finding greater socio-political recognition as an interdisciplinary field.

In the framework of expanding early rehabilitation, however, recent years have seen a distinct shift away from a defect-oriented, reductionist view towards a relational-medicine based understanding of patients with severe brain damage, seeking to gain a comprehensive perception of the patient's altered physical existence and taking a multidisciplinary--nursing, medical, therapeutic and neuropsychological--perspective which includes the patient's relatives and family. Historically, a transition is under way away from the classical brain-pathology focus toward a neuropsychologically grounded, differentiated perspective. Along with in-depth differential diagnostics and assessment of rehab potentials (early intervention diagnostics), comprehensive intervention measures are initiated as early as possible by an interdisciplinary team. These include \"coma stimulation\" measures, body language forms of interaction (\"dialogue management\"), and technical communication devices. By building long-term care assistance in ambulatory and residential service delivery systems (\"small social network\"), social reintegration of these very severely affected patients is attempted, involving the familial and social resources available.

In order to obtain a valid picture of the prevalence of back pain this review article focuses on epidemiological studies in the general population. These studies can be divided into general health surveys and surveys with specific reference to back pain. General health surveys including questions on the prevalence of back pain have the greatest methodological differences because of different aims. Due to these different aims, different target populations and different methods these studies depict point prevalences between 0.8% and 41% and 1-year prevalences between 15% and 56%. These general health surveys are contrasted with epidemiological studies especially designed to evaluate the prevalence of back pain. In these studies the point prevalence ranges between 14% and 42% and the lifetime period prevalence between 51% and 84%. Depending on the study reviewed the highest prevalence is found at age 50 to 64. This prevalence pattern may be explained by several effects that are discussed in this article. Severe forms of back pain increase even in the higher age groups, especially in women. Beside this effect the reviewed articles show either no difference between men and women or only a slightly higher prevalence in women.

From the long years of experience in working with this population at the Stephanuswerk Isny rehabilitation centre, an absolute need has emerged to offer particularly intensive social-educational and psychological follow-along supports during the phase of vocational rehabilitation. In response to these insights, cause-oriented action strategies have been devised seeking to prevent relapse among ex-dependent rehabilitees and\/or assist them in their efforts to cope, in order to avoid drop-outs from the vocational rehabilitation programme, with all the adverse consequences this would imply. These action strategies inter alia included drafting a catalogue of criteria applicable before client admission to the programme, as well as a catalogue of relapse-prevention measures during vocational rehabilitation.

Reintegration into the working process could be advanced during the stay, stagnated however after the stay. Classifying the course of rehabilitation, overall or partial success was achieved in more than 80% of the patients interviewed.

Establishment throughout the state of Saxony of a uniform outreach-based ambulatory service ranks as a first component towards building regionalized community psychiatric networks. In light of some twenty years of experience in the old laender, this function is considered a task of the Social Psychiatric Services (\"Sozialpsychiatrische Dienste\", SPDIs). The present study had been directed at a state-wide investigation of the expectations community-practice psychiatrists (n = 165), physicians in psychiatric clinics (n = 95) and staff working in SPDIs (n = 138) in Saxony hold regarding service programmes and operating methods of these newly established service delivery structures. Given the high return rates in this anonymous postal questionnaire study, the findings presented are considered near-representative. A concurrent finding for all of the groups interviewed, expectations concerning the client population to be serviced by the SPDIs focus on the group of persons with chronic mental illness. Also, the expectations expressed concerning major care\/therapeutic services to be rendered by the SPDIs concur in their emphasis on a core area of immediately client-oriented SPDI activities. Between the two medical groups, a major difference found is that community-practice psychiatrists more frequently expect high SPDI commitment regarding sociotherapeutic programmes at an institutional level, whereas clinical physicians expect them to focus on taking over medical therapies in the narrower sense. The expectations SPDI staff hold relative to the therapeutic services to be rendered by themselves go beyond the scope of what has so far been implemented in their current activity, and qualitative content analyses are presented in the article for each of the areas concerned. Along with better staffing levels, removal of in-service organizational and further education deficits are identified by SPDI staff as the two main requirements for stabilizing their operations. In order to counter undue burdening of the SPDI with service expectations and to enable a more clear-cut positioning of its programme structures within a complex psychosocial service delivery system, it is necessary--at least in the state of Saxony--that further needs-oriented establishment and\/or extension of community-based psychiatric services and agencies take place.","1277":"With a view to optimizing the positional management of patients with severe neurological damage, five positioning systems with different operating principles were submitted to suitability trials in a clinical neurological rehabilitation setting.

The experience collected by the various professions involved in positional management over a trial period of six months is summarized in the present report, indicating that none of the positioning systems used has been suitable for all patients alike.

This checklist now permits identifying the positioning systems suitable for the individual patient in an economical manner, and lengthy positioning trials can be dispensed with to a large extent.","1278":null,"1279":"At the request of the association of the Landesverband der Betriebskrankenkassen (BKK) Nordrhein-Westfalen (association of company-health-insurance funds of North Rhine-Westphalia) a first study was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of ambulatory orthopedic-traumatological rehabilitation (AOTR). 21 ambulatory rehabilitation institutes were involved. Motor and psychosocial parameters of 543 patients were evaluated before the beginning of the treatment, immediately after it and 4 months after the end of treatment. On average, patients had 22 treatment units. A wide variety of orthopedic indications was recorded. The AOTR proved a positive effect on all indications, which was shown by an improvement of all measured parameters. Major problems were caused by extensive basic and organizational prerequisites, which led to immediate suggestions for improvement which will be described.","1280":"The success of rehabilitation programmes is assumed to be influenced by patients' expectations and motivations toward these regimens. Yet only few standardized measurement instruments of these patient attributes are available. This paper is concerned with the development of a standardized questionnaire measuring patients' expectations and motivations with respect to rehabilitation programmes. Basically derived from focus group discussions with chronically ill, we defined and operationalized four dimensions of expectations toward rehabilitation programmes. In applying the questionnaire it could be shown that the instrument is easy to use, shows acceptable psychometric properties and is correlated with relevant patient characteristics.","1281":"In rehabilitation of children and adolescents with lower limb deficiencies it is very important that the medical team taking care of the patient works out a treatment plan. Responsible cooperation with the parents is of utmost importance, the focus of all efforts is, of course, the handicapped child. The aims of rehabilitation are illustrated by examples demonstrating the course of successful rehabilitation of children and adolescents with damaged limbs. Equally, the psychological situation of the parents and child is taken into consideration. Children with limb deficiencies or amputation of the lower extremities should be enabled to stand and walk according to their state of development, because standing and walking in particular are among the most important preconditions for the best possible integration. Provision with a prosthesis, orthosis and orthoprosthesis is therefore indispensable for rehabilitation. While a prosthesis replaces parts of an extremity, an orthosis stabilizes the existing extremity. Orthoprostheses compensate longitudinal malformations, have a supporting effect, allow growth to be controlled, and compensate for shortening. Just as important as these technical aids is early medical treatment. The sooner the treatment starts, the better the results.","1282":"A follow-up of patients with hip fractures discharged from a geriatric rehabilitation unit was conducted by means of a questionnaire sent to the former patients, in case of non-compliance calling to ask for participation in the study and completion of the questionnaire. 234 patients were examined, 8 of whom died during rehabilitation. From 91.8% (n = 206) discharged after rehabilitation information about their fate was obtained, from 98.7% (n = 223) if they were still alive. On discharge, mean age was 81 (+\/- 9) years, time of follow up was 2.7 years after discharge. 34.5% had died, 36% of them within the first six months. Of those surviving, 93% still lived in the living conditions they had been discharged to. Comparing the activities of daily living of the survivors as assessed with a modified Barthel index (max. 110 points), at discharge by the occupational therapists, at follow up by the patients themselves, only a slight decrease was seen (95.5 +\/- 19.2 points at discharge; 88.5 +\/- 24.0 points at follow up; p &lt; 0.01).","1283":"This study was aimed at answering the question of whether a four-week inpatient early rehabilitation programme, i.e. within the first two months following total hip replacement surgery, will have a favourable impact as compared to later-onset inpatient rehabilitation measures; a total of 219 patients was studied: 137 were admitted during the first two months post-op (group A), 45 within three to four months post op (group B), and 37 patients were admitted at a later date (group C). Assessments were carried out for pain, walking performance and self-help status (scores) as well as for mobility, gait patterns, walking aids, walking speed, and disablement. In group A patients, significant improvement was achieved for all of these parameters: at the end of the rehabilitation programme (2.4 months post-op) these patients already were more mobile than group B patients at the time of admission (3.3 months post-op). In group B, improvements were found for several parameters. At a later time, the natural healing process had brought about so good a baseline situation in the group C patients that no further improvement was possible. The 162 patients treated successfully, i.e. where score reductions occurred, had been admitted significantly (p = 0.0001) earlier (2.9 months post-op) than the remaining 57 patients (5.7 months post-op). Some 14 months after programme participation, follow-up examinations were possible for 90 patients of group A, and for 27 patients from groups B and C. Further significant improvements had occurred in group A patients only, notably relative to muscle strength and reduction of walking aids. It is concluded from our data that inpatient early rehabilitation will achieve the greatest effect and will substantially reduce the recovery phase with its mobility limitations and daily living handicaps.","1284":"The study was performed as a pilot study evaluating the benefit of a 4-week inpatient postoperative rehabilitation programme. We examined 177 patients admitted after total hip replacement. We found statistically significant improvements of joint mobility, muscle power, gait, walking distance and a significant reduction of various pain parameters. The decline in usage of crutches, improvements in the activities of daily living and the positive patients' assessments were of striking evidence. A short time inpatient postoperative rehabilitation programme achieved significant success through an acceptable expenditure of treatment and resulted in substantially increased mobility and autonomy of the patients.","1285":"Since the beginning of the 1990s more and more health institutions have decided for certification based on the standard DIN\/ISO 9000-9004. Besides this trend the introduction of quality management systems employing a combination of internal and external evaluation processes is constantly gaining importance. Institutions of medical rehabilitation are increasingly aiming at the implementation of quality management systems as well as obtaining certification. Taking into account the currently prevailing basic conditions, the following will therefore submit various quality management models. The feasibility of applying these models to the medical rehabilitation sector as well as their potential contribution to the further development of medical rehabilitation will be analyzed. Following this discussion, the relationship of the described models to the Quality Assurance Programme as currently implemented by the German Pension Insurance will be discussed.","1286":"Creating typical treatment case groups in medical rehabilitation, in short: Rehabilitee Management Categories (RMKs, Rehabilitanden-Management-Kategorien), is a key issue for quality assurance within the frame of modern concepts of Total Quality Management (TQM), not least utilizing current organization and management concepts (Managed Care). So far, the problem of creating highly homogeneous case groups has remained unsolved on the basis of the present methodological framework. Critical prerequisites for any further scientific work on this problem are being established in the field of medical rehabilitation with the help of the Classification of Therapeutic Services (CTS) as well as development of instruments documenting therapy plans for typical rehabilitation case groups, process-relevant quality features and definitions of therapy goals as a basis for quality screening under the Pension Insurance quality assurance programme in medical rehabilitation. These developments have clearly contributed to expanding the theoretical foundations as well as the prerequisites for empirical grounding of Rehabilitee Management Categories in medical rehabilitation under the Pension Insurance scheme. A project for determination of rehabilitation case groups which is based on these developments, is due to start at the Humboldt University and Technical University, Berlin in the near future within a rehab promotion initiative of the German Pension Insurance system in cooperation with the Federal Ministry of Research and Technology. Conceptually, the determination of Rehabilitee Management Categories by far exceeds all previous approaches as (1) it will be generated by an iterative process of empirical service descriptions and theoretical consensus building among experts, (2) not only static parameters but also process-related details will be recorded, and (3) quality requirements will be defined for the rehabilitation process and outcome. As a result, rehabilitation-relevant case groups are to be created, which will include a definition of process- and outcome-oriented quality standards. Unlike previous case group concepts, the new approach encompasses quality management issues as an integral part of its development. Since this concept for determination of Rehabilitee Management Categories incorporates the definition of quality standards, i.e., guidelines, prerequisites will be created for integrating these standards into quality management concepts, as well as service management across the interfaces of the German service delivery system (Managed Care).","1287":"Within quality assurance in medical rehabilitation, patient satisfaction is viewed as one of the essential features. Patient satisfaction is expected to comprehensively cover structure, process and outcome quality. The aim of our study was to evaluate factors on which patient satisfaction with the rehabilitation measure depends. Sociodemographic factors, diagnosis at admission, characteristics of treatment, and the time of evaluation were considered. Furthermore, we examined whether four orthopedic-rheumatologic rehabilitation hospitals differ in respect of patient satisfaction and how patient satisfaction is associated with the result of treatment. Data collection was conducted in four German rehabilitation hospitals. Patient satisfaction was assessed in 1832 patients with an orthopedicrheumatologic disease as first diagnosis three months after discharge, using a postal questionnaire (Raspe et al. 1996). Additionally, 153 patients were assessed at the end of the rehabilitation measure. Besides the satisfaction with the treatment, its result was documented for 100 patients. For all sections of the questionnaire no or small differences could be demonstrated with respect to gender, age, education, and diagnosis. The questionnaire can differentiate between treating physicians and hospitals. The time of questioning had no influence. No relevant correlation existed between patient satisfaction and result of the treatment. The questionnaire assessing patient satisfaction can be applied with little expenditure. The acceptance is high. The questionnaire can assess the current status of many areas of rehabilitation practice, so that quality assurance measures could be introduced immediately. A comparison between hospitals is possible and reveals strengths and weaknesses. Thus, the questionnaire may be used as a quality assurance measure for hospitals and for health care providers. This tool may be used routinely for monitoring and for longitudinal evaluations.","1288":"To investigate agreement between \"indirect\" and \"direct\" methods for measuring outcome of inpatient rehabilitation programmes. A consecutive sample of 610 patients with musculoskeletal, cardiopulmonary and other diseases completed questionnaires 2 weeks before and 4 to 6 weeks after inpatient rehabilitation treatment. Overall response rate was 80%. Patient outcome variables were measured at baseline and follow-up. These included 14 items covering general health, pain, functional limitations, sleep, energy, mood, and social contacts. In the follow-up questionnaire patients were also asked to recall their baseline situation and to answer the same items according to this recalled condition and, furthermore, to report directly the perceived change on a 3-point scale (\"deteriorated\", \"unchanged\", \"improved\"). Thus, three different methods for measuring change could be compared: changes observed prospectively between baseline and follow-up, change as the difference of recalled baseline status and observed follow-up status, and perceived change. Spearman correlation coefficients r(S) and Cohen' Kappa statistic were used to analyse association and chance-corrected agreement, respectively, between these three different methods. Correlation and agreement between the different indicators of change was only moderate to fair with r(S) varying between 0.10 and 0.65, Cohen's Kappa ranged between 0.07 and 0.62. Results of principal components analysis indicated that items representing perceived change did not reflect the substantive aspects of change and were assigned indiscriminately to one single component. Prospective and retrospective methods for measuring change are not functionally equivalent. Whenever feasible, prospective methods using observed baseline and follow-up data (\"indirect\" measurement of change) should be used in the evaluation of patient outcome in rehabilitation. ","1289":"The definition of appropriate and measurable goals for treatment is a fundamental quality feature of medical practice. In co-operation with experts, we developed a catalogue of therapy goals for medical rehabilitation. In a two-stage procedure we first analyzed the target definitions that are currently used in medical rehabilitation. In a second step we used these targets as input for expert panels. Based on a modified model of the WHO classification ICIDH, the goals were defined on four dimensions: somatic, functional, psychosocial and educative. The established goals are relevant and measurable. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of adequate and sound measurement procedures for many goals. Therefore, there is an urgent need for further research in this field.","1290":"Within the framework of their quality assurance programme, the German statutory pension funds in 1994 and 1995 required over 400 rehabilitation hospitals to develop structures permitting to establish comprehensive quality management programmes. In particular, they asked that these hospitals should establish quality circles. Structured information could be gathered from 380 hospitals at the end of a pilot phase. According to this information, 233 hospitals conduct a total of 558 quality circles. However, only 23.5% of these quality circles fulfil the criteria of a well-structured quality circle. Another 34.7% of the reported activities can, in a broader sense, be considered as activities that might be helpful in developing Total Quality Management (TQM) systems, whereas 41.8% account for more routine activities such as floor meetings etc. A detailed analysis of the documented information revealed that a high proportion of quality circle participants are recruited from leadership positions. From a subject matter perspective, quality circles still focus on their conceptualization. Taking into consideration the large number of hospitals, the introduction of quality circles can be considered quite successful.","1291":"A survey of organizational aspects of rehabilitation clinics was part of the Pension Insurance quality assurance programme in medical rehabilitation. The goal of this survey was to strengthen the awareness for these organizational dimensions and to initiate discussion with the goal of optimizing the efficiency of the clinical working process. For the structured description of various conceptual aspects a questionnaire \"Dokumentationsbogen-Konzepte\" was developed and its appropriateness for the indication groups orthopaedics, cardiology and psychosomatics was examined. The focus of this examination was development of different possibilities to give feedback to the clinics. The questionnaire was appropriate for the description of conceptual aspects. Differences both between and within the indication groups were discovered. The instrument can be used in the quality assurance process.","1292":"Comparison between clinics is a basic part of most quality assurance programmes. The classification of structurally similar clinics is a prerequisite for enabling comparisons between clinics according to quality criteria. As a part of the programme point 1 \"structural quality\" of the Pension insurance quality assurance programme in medical rehabilitation, a procedure was developed to classify clinics into structurally similar groups. For this purpose the data of the structure survey of the quality assurance programme was used. The first step was to check whether existing classification systems could be used, which made the need for a new classification procedure apparent. The 942 participating clinics were clustered according to a successive differentiation system employing only quality-neutral criteria, e.g., the indication group, the number of different indications, the part of AHB, number of beds, and the therapeutic focus. Further differentiation beyond indication group was necessary for the indications orthopaedics, cardiology, psychosomatics, addiction and neurology. The procedure is demonstrated using the indications orthopaedics and cardiology as examples.","1293":"The quality improvement programme aims at the comparison of clinics in charge of the statutory pension insurance. The programme has been implemented successively in 1994, supported by researchers and teams of experts on specific subjects. Instruments and procedures have been developed to all programme items including a clinic comparing and information system, thus permitting routine use in practice. Performing regular clinic-comparisons analysing structural quality (equipment, staff, clinical concept, management), procedural quality (recording of rehabilitation process), and outcome quality (success of the rehabilitation estimated by physician and patient) of rehabilitation facilities shall initiate quality competition and stimulate a constant improvement of quality. significant basis, therefore, is a clinic-comparing information and reporting system. The developed instruments and procedures are available for all institutes providing rehabilitation.","1294":"","1295":"Quality of life becomes more and more important in evaluating the effects of treatments. At the moment, different questionnaires to measure quality of life in children and adolescents with asthma are available. The Paediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAQL) was developed by Juniper and co-workers in Canada and has already been translated into German. It is a self- or interviewer-administered instrument for children and adolescents between age 7 and 17. The PAQL contains 23 items in three domains: activity limitation, symptoms, and emotional function. The empirical results suggest that the PAQL is reliable and sensitive to clinical change. Problems associated with the administration are discussed.","1296":"","1297":"","1298":"As psychological factors have a substantial influence on the further medical, psychological and occupational career of a patient with somatic disease, early identification of patients with psychological disturbances is of special importance in medical rehabilitation. The share of psychologically disturbed patients in a cardiac rehabilitation clinic has been screened. Different methods for identification of anxious and depressive patients (by medical and psychological staff as well as a screening instrument) are compared. Concluding, the benefit of introducing a screening instrument as a routine procedure is discussed under the aspect of effectivity.","1299":"Psychosomatic rehabilitation is often initiated when lasting work disability, loss of job, and pension application have occurred. After a review of the relevance of vocational strains and of predictors for reintegration, we present a model of an integrated work hardening programme in Psychosomatic Rehabilitation. Results for 64 patients are illustrated by case vignettes. Especially when lasting work disability and unemployment have undermined the patients' sense of competence and endurance, work hardening promotes return to work, realistic self-appraisal and vocational reorientation. The social and medical assessment and the coordination of vocational rehabilitation measures are improved. The implementation of a work hardening programme requires the provision of a variety of (unpaid) work opportunities, independent assessment of work performance by supervisors and social worker, psychological support and close cooperation with rehabilitation services.","1300":"Developed by Orthotronic Medizintechnik GmbH, the so-called Triflexometer, version 3.22 was tested for its reliability and validity in measuring spinal posture and mobility. Reliability studies on 20 healthy subjects have shown this measurement method to be reliable, yet intra- and inter-rater reliability analyses also revealed that even for this healthy population discrepancies in the various measures may occur, both due to differences in compliance as well as fatigue and learning effects, and due to difficulties in stabilization of the normal posture, to a lesser extent due to certain specifics of the measurement technique (placing the markers, guiding the sensor). In total spinal immobility (ankylosing spondylitis), practically identical measurements are found, as is the case in dummy studies. The validity study on 20 healthy subjects found good correlations between the measurements obtaining using the triflexometer and those for double inclinometer, respectively, and that only minor mean value differences occur for the two methods. Also, triflexometer measurements for total anteflexion were found to correlate with those determined with the fingertip-to-floor method, no correlation was present however between the Triflexometer values and the Schober test. Triflexometer measurements performed on 114 healthy subjects of various ages served to prove that the range of spinal movement in the directions measured (sagittal and frontal) will reduce with age. To a lesser extent, this also applies to hip movement. Overall, our findings prove the triflexometer an easy-to-handle system which possesses high reliability and is suitable for valid and objective noninvasive assessment of global and segmental spinal mobility. Triflexometer examinations are highly uncomplicated to implement, and print-outs of the results obtained permit lasting documentation of the present status.","1301":"Perceptions about one's occupational future are regarded as the initial phase in an ongoing process of occupational resettlement towards achieving gainful activity. Actual gainful activity, however, tends to be increasingly dependent on a number of labour market variables. At the end of an orthopaedic rehabilitation measure, 341 patients with pain syndromes of the locomotor system were interviewed concerning their vocational perspectives and notions, and the data obtained were studied in association with anamnestic and psychosocial factors. It is assumed that both plain expectations (such as returning, or not returning, to work) and multi-layered statements alike (such as the dual message of returning and of not returning to work, at first glance incompatible) will frequently be masked in the interview. Distinct, differing patterns were nevertheless found for the various patient groups regarding pain description, pain course, subjective disablement by pain, subjective job burden, subjective well-being, rehab expectations, and judgement of therapy outcome. Similar differences were stated for the social situation, indicated inter alia by (in)capacity for work, or application for benefit award (severely disabled person status, invalidity pension). Pain drawings, pain severity scaling, differentiated description of various pain qualities, the Pain Disability Index, all emerged as useful and practical additional tools in elucidating these patterns.","1302":"In 361 patients with cerebral stroke a study of medical and neurological complications was undertaken. Among a total of 131 complications (36.2%) a striking incidence of urinary tract infections was seen: 83 cases (22.9%). Patients without complications had an average stay of 61.2 days in hospital, those with urinary tract infections had 77 days (p &lt; 0.05). In patients with cerebrovascular accidents voiding dysfunctions are common. Great care must be taken to prevent complications: indwelling catheters should be used only over short periods of time. In case urinary drainage is needed over a long period of time, suprapubic catheterization should be preferred.","1303":"Presented are 16 patients (4 women and 12 men) of a neurological early rehabilitation ward with various neurological initial situations. Diagnoses range from traumatic brain damages to hypoxic brain lesions caused by complications during anaesthesia, from subarachnoid haemorrhages with consecutive complications, to intracerebral haemorrhages. All patients have been examined at the beginning by an ENT specialist and\/or phoniatrically. Regarding the structure of the patients' complex neurological symptoms, they were all suffering from more or less severe impairments in the faciooral tract. At the beginning of the multifocal neurological rehabilitation treatment all patients had been submitted to dysarthrophony and\/or dysphagia examination according to K. Coombes. We will compare results, objectives and therapeutic developments during the faciooral therapy including physiotherapy and ergotherapy based on the Bobath concept. We will further discuss the periods between occurrence of the damaging event and the onset of multimodular neurological rehabilitation. Further discussed is the influence of secondary complications on the therapeutic development and, finally, the clinical-social outcome of the patients.","1304":"Developed at the Duke University Medical Center of Durham, North Carolina, U.S.A., the Duke Severity of Illness Checklist (DUSOI) is a tool for measuring a person's illness severity. The instrument comprises four parameters of a health problem, e.g. in a given diagnosis, namely: symptoms, complications, 6-months prognosis without treatment, treatment potential. Using the numerical ratings (from 0 to 4) for each parameter of every diagnosis, the following three types of severity score (from 0 [lowest degree of severity] to 100 [highest degree of severity]) can be calculated: (1) the DUSOI diagnosis score for each diagnosis stated, (2) the DUSOI overall score for the set of all health problems stated for a patient, and (3) the DUSOI comorbidity score, i.e., all problems except for any one problem of principal interest. The DUSOI is suitable for patients from the entire chain of medical and rehabilitative care, although it had initially been developed for the ambulatory sector. Completing the DUSOI form is very economical in terms of time needed, and is recommended to be done by the physician in charge immediately following the patient's visit. Alternatively, the form could also be filled in by a reviewer on the basis of the patient's medical record. A certain level of judgement is required on the part of the physician or reviewer carrying out the DUSOI assessments.","1305":"","1306":"In view of backing up the potential for as normal a life as possible in the presence of chronic obstructive respiratory disease, quality rehabilitation concepts have for some ten years been discussed which recommend satisfactory levels of motor activity in particular during childhood and youth as a factor in stabilizing long-term health. A difficult prerequisite in this respect is choosing a sport adapted to the child's age and condition as well as providing adequate motivation, along with awareness of exercise- and training-induced stress and strain reactions. Several years of experience with Judo have shown that, in an ambulatory rehabilitation setting, the needs of schoolchildren with bronchial asthma too, may be answered by this competitive sport provided that several didactic and methodological premises are heeded. In light of its holistic educational approach and intermittent stress and strain profile, Judo is cut out for facilitating integration in the social community, hence contributing toward valuable personality characteristics and growth in a rehabilitative context in the face of the long-term course of the illness.","1307":null,"1308":"From the psychologist's point of view, a routine coronary artery bypass operation is often looked upon by patients as a negative situation. The patient develops the feeling that his or her life has been dramatically altered, thus the patient feels he must somehow make a change in the upcoming pattern of the future. The patient, as well as his employer, is convinced of subjective models of etiology, which cause the attitude that circumstances of living must change rapidly. In this context continued employment is viewed as a significant burden and hindrance, despite an excellent post-operative discharge diagnosis. According to the hypothesis, emotions and attitudes directly concerning the working environment, that lead to an application for early retirement should be identified. Medical and psychological counseling before surgery and post-op rehabilitation, should be carried out to ease the obsession with early retirement and prevent possibly following psychopathological disturbances.","1309":null,"1310":"The group of social-medical problem patients was defined as comprising those patients who are admitted during an on-going invalidity pension award procedure or who are drawing a fixed-term pension, patients who have declared their intention to apply for pension award and\/or have been on sick leave for an uninterrupted 6 months at the time of admission. In light of this definition, some 25-30% of the patients referred to us would be considered social-medical problem patients. The main focus of the present study had been to identify the subgroup of patients who might be expected to profit from psychosomatic rehabilitation notwithstanding their social-medical problems. Improvement in physical symptoms was achieved in 34% of the patients, and in 43% relative to the psychological symptoms present. The group of patients showing the greatest measure of improvement can be described by the following prognostically favourable factors: incapacity for work at the time of admission but no application for pension award made or planned; lower average age, higher motivation on admission, and lower severity of the social-medical problems, no denial of psychosocial factors, and willingness to join group psychotherapy. Prognostically unfavourable factors were found to be a fixed-term pension already awarded, along with repeated participation in rehabilitation measures on purely somatic grounds, and a higher age. Pertinent literature is reviewed in light of these findings, underscoring the significance of the time factor in chronification of neurotic disorders of the capacity for work and gainful activity. Consequently, these patients should as speedily as possible undergo efficient psychosomatic diagnosis and be referred for inpatient psychosomatic rehabilitation.","1311":"Partial-hospitalization rehabilitation is a relatively recent form of rehabilitation, which, as opposed to the ambulatory approach, comprises the entire programme available for inpatient medical rehabilitation except for accommodation and full board. Great expectations are attached to partial hospitalization: it is supposed to cost less than a comparable in-patient measure but matching in terms of quality. However, hardly any empirical data exist so far concerning the effects partial hospitalization rehabilitation is having in these respects. The present article seeks to answer the question of whether from a patient perspective, the outcome quality of this new model is comparable to that of the classical full-hospitalization programmes. In terms of methodology, questionnaires were used to raise the necessary data from two independent samples (i.e., partial vs. full hospitalization) of former orthopaedic rehabilitees of Fachklinik Ichenhausen (Bavaria). Data analysis included some 205 patient questionnaires (57% return rate). High agreement was found among the two groups concerning outcome evaluation, subjective health and patient satisfaction. From a patient perspective, rehabilitation outcome on the majority of variables considered, even is judged slightly better for partial hospitalization patients than for the inpatient comparison group. As none of these results reach statistical significance, these minor differences should however not be overrated. While partial-hospitalization, rehabilitation, hence, has turned out an option which matches traditional full-hospitalization programmes in terms of quality, too great expectations nevertheless are unwarranted: Partial-hospitalization rehabilitation is no general alternative to inpatient programmes as it will realistically be suitable for a small percentage of orthopaedic patients only, hence be unable to replace full-hospitalization programmes to any major extent. Undoubtedly, however, it is apt to contribute to greater flexibility and needs orientation among the services and programmes available in rehabilitation, and may thus be considered a valuable approach for complementing inpatient and ambulatory forms of rehabilitation.","1312":"","1313":"Employment Support seeks to devise solutions for clients who fail to make fullest possible use of their resources for example in work routines or in the context of rehabilitative opportunities. The services provided are intended to support less severely impaired participants in returning to work and, above all, to maintain existing employment, but also try to reach out to individuals with medium or very severe impairment. This target group is characterized by a broad variety of combinations in terms of motor, cognitive and sensory impairments, frequently aggravated by the difficulties of illness coping. Their problems demand broad-based, multi-faceted case management, along with a high measure of practical support. The solutions to be devised have to be tailored to the individual, and support and coaching measures need to be given for longer than could normally be realized by clinical and vocational rehabilitation programmes. Also, crisis intervention services must be available also for relief of the workplace environment. Many of these clients being unable to transfer the experience made in a therapeutic setting to their respective everyday situations, the necessary experience has to be enabled as closely related to real life as possible, facilitating acquisition and training of appropriate alternative behaviours. Mutabor hence is linking employment support with its day centre and intensive ambulatory coaching, which enables better differentiation of the employment support services offered to individual clients, without extra cost to the financially responsible agency.","1314":"The Supported Employment model dealt with in the present article has been discussed since the early nineties also among the German professional public, and is increasingly coming to bear as an innovative element in the system for vocational integration of people with disabilities. In implementing a new, \"integrative\" orientation, it complements traditional approaches by measures in which integration is not perceived as the potentially successful outcome of a predetermined amount of rehabilitee adjustment to \"normalcy\"; it rather is viewed as a method focussed at initiating a process of mutual rapprochement among working world and disabled worker: disabled jobseekers are first placed in competitive employment, then receive all the supports they need to master the requirements of their job. In addition, the Supported Employment concept, by cooperation and linkage with the existing vocational rehabilitation institutions, has taken on a corrective function, which inter alia in the workshops for the disabled, has entailed renewed and invigorated awareness of the rehabilitative mandate, thus generating increased efforts toward this end.","1315":"A neurogenic disorder of acquired speech, aphasia not only is a speech disorder but also implies restriction in communicative independence. In line with the WHO's principle of attending to the consequences of disease as well, speech rehabilitation has to deal not only with aphasia in terms of speech disorder (i.e., impairment) but also with aphasia in terms of communicative ability disorder (i.e., disability) as well as with aphasia in terms of psychosocial interference (i.e., handicap). Current speech therapy orientations can be assigned to these three dimensions and the need for these three levels of approach can be assessed accordingly in light of the course of the condition. Given the speech disorder's frequently limited amenability to therapeutic intervention, a psycholinguistics-communication oriented speech rehabilitation as well as counselling and psychologically focussed measures are increasingly relevant to enable a more appropriate response to reduced communicative independence and ensuing psychosocial handicaps.","1316":"In the framework of medical rehabilitation measures, cardiac patients' physical capacity was evaluated from an occupational medicine perspective, through vocational assessment in the workshops of a vocational retraining centre. Recommendations for vocational reintegration were derived on that basis, available at the end of the rehab measure for presentation to the financially responsible agency as a proposal for immediate implementation. The potential for actual realization of these proposals is further enhanced on account of preparatory clarification of the patients' motivational tendencies in individual and group talks. The vocational assessment performed not least provided an opportunity for strengthening the chronically ill patients' self-confidence regarding their return to work life.","1317":"In order to evaluate the process quality of inpatient rehabilitation we established a peer-review system. In our approach, measurement of process quality is based on the report written by rehabilitation doctors at discharge of their patients. First of all, a list of 52 criteria relevant to process quality was defined by experienced clinicians using the Delphi technique. These criteria may be divided into six dimensions: anamnesis, diagnostic interventions, goals of therapy and therapy, judgement on vocational abilities, recommendations for further treatment and epicrisis. Thereafter, the experts in a manual defined specific requirements for each of the 52 criteria. In a pilot study, we were able to demonstrate reliability and practicability of the peer review system. Using this approach shortcomings in present rehabilitation practice may be detected. Nearly 400 reports from 20 rehabilitation hospitals were reviewed by thoroughly trained peers. Most frequently shortcomings were found in the description of patient's disabilities and in the definition of specific rehabilitation goals. Furthermore, this procedure enables comparison of process quality in different rehabilitation hospitals. In our pilot study we found marked differences in the process quality of the 20 rehabilitation hospitals.","1318":"The scientific program \"Rehabilitation Research in Germany\" includes as a priority topic the evaluation of the effectiveness of rehabilitation regarding return to work. Controlled intervention studies with randomized allocation to treatment and a minimum follow-up of six to twelve months after rehabilitation are of primary importance. It is also recommended that the studies should include economic aspects and consider gender differences. Another request is harmonization of studies with respect to methods, assessment tools, and implementation to improve the relevance of the studies and to allow for combining the results. The authors respond to this request. They make proposals for harmonizing the assessment of outcomes, predictors, and costs as well as for testing gender differences in intervention studies. The proposals address the rehabilitation research networks and aim to provide a basis of discussion and to initiate the necessary consensus finding between the networks. Proposals include (1) a taxonomy of outcomes and predictors for rehabilitation and recommendations for generic assessment tools which allow for data-pooling of studies; (2) a concept for the pre-post and follow-up measurement and recommendations concerning the time interval on which evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of rehabilitation or treatment modalities should be based; (3) descriptions of the content and interpretation of the self assessment instruments which are recommended for cross study comparisons; (4) a procedure to assess the direct and indirect costs, i.e. costs of treatments and costs of disease consequences, which considers especially the assessment of rehabilitative services and their monetary evaluation; (5) provisions for ensuring representativeness of women in intervention studies and procedures for testing differences in treatment outcomes between women and men; (6) a procedure to reach harmonization by establishing a coordination committee including representatives of the research networks, and by using well-established methods such as consensus conferences.","1319":"Embodied in Germany's Basic Law since 1994, the discrimination ban on behalf of disabled persons--in line with similar provisions introduced in other countries--highlights the fact that disabled persons, as individuals and with their lawful rights, have become the point of departure of disability policies, as opposed to the hitherto prevailing social welfare perspective. Banning discrimination alone, though, will enable equal opportunities to be achieved only for some areas of social life; positive discriminations in favour of disabled persons are possible and necessary in addition. When it comes to integration into worklife, banning discrimination against disabled persons will achieve but little. Rather, in a market economy, employers and the general public share a common responsibility, for one, by respecting employers' rights of disposal over their jobs and, for the other, by changing present labour market conditions in favour of disabled persons, i.e., taking measures of positive discrimination.","1320":"Trunk muscle insufficiency plays a central role in the etiology and pathogenesis of low-back pain. Intensity, duration and recurrence of the complaints depend very much on whether rehabilitative measures succeed in achieving lasting strengthening of the trunk muscles by a specific exercise programme. So far we had to rely on subjective criteria to identify insufficiencies of the trunk muscles. Now the Kiel Efficiency Test gives us a measure to objectify and describe this disorder. The test is simple and reproducible, can be performed in any consultation room and has proved to be reliable.","1321":"The understanding of isolated written words by deaf adults was checked using a basic list of 500 German words developed for this study. Even at this basic level about 7% of the words could not be identified by the deaf subjects. There were particular problems with words from colloquial German, function words, terms without mouthing in sign language and cover terms. Concerning rehabilitation the use of sign language vocabulary already known by the deaf for written language vocabulary training and a stronger orientation towards functional everyday communication is recommended.","1322":"Intelligibility of spoken language of deaf adults was assessed by hearing persons. The test procedure was intended to get as close as possible to an authentic communication situation. 5 of 6 deaf speakers are not intelligible to naive listeners. Furthermore, the listeners tend to highly overestimate their understanding of the meaning of the utterances heard. Distorting written reproductions are frequent. There are significant differences between the ability of comprehension of each of the hearing persons. The necessity of visual communication systems and -helps is stressed by the deficits in spoken language found by the study at hand.","1323":"Mother-child health-resort treatments have for many years been a major component of rehabilitative and preventive health care for women. The rising significance of health-promotion measures on the one hand, and increased attention to women's health aspects in rehabilitation and prevention on the other, have made in-depth consideration of the issues involved in target-groups, participation in and conceptual potential of mother-child programmes necessary. In a questionnaire study of n = 103 women participating in a mother-child programme, data were collected concerning their life situation, life satisfaction, psychosocial burdens and psychovegetative complaints, the expectations and needs hoped to be met by the preventive and rehabilitative programme features, as well as the motives for participating. The findings show that the life situation of the women in our study is characterized by a high degree of stress and strain, by physical complaints and dissatisfaction with life. The women clearly state the relationships they see among their current life situation, their subjective emotional state, their health behaviours, and their subjective physical status. Programme participation, on the one hand, has to do with needing a rest and easing of tension; yet on the other hand, the responding women also express a desire to confront current life themes, to find room for reconsidering attitudes, behaviours and the potential for change. Implications for shaping women-specific rehabilitative and preventive programmes are formulated on the basis of the study findings. Future studies in the field of mother-child health resort programmes should be directed at evaluating the treatment programmes available.","1324":"Social rehabilitation, if contrasted with medical and vocational rehabilitation, has hitherto remained a residual category. Vocational resettlement, in conjunction with medical outcome, being the central criterion of successful rehabilitation, it is only on failure in that respect that social rehabilitation aspects come into view. Developments in the society at large, such as changing values, individualization and differentiation of life styles, as well as mass unemployment, working world rationalization, a fragmented labour market and a trend towards shorter working lives, however, warrant renewed attention to the relationship among vocational and social rehabilitation. The problems involved in returning to work after coronary bypass surgery serve to show that occupational resettlement is strongly dependent on the work orientation a patient has developed over his life course as well as on the overall socioeconomic conditions at hand. The ICIDH and its concept of social handicap provides a useful point of departure in seeking to develop a theoretical interpretation of these findings and to expand them towards a systematic concept of social rehabilitation.","1325":"It did not take the provisions of the 5th Book of the Social Code for quality assurance issues to gain significance in the field of geriatric rehabilitation as well. While in the surgical specialties, experience in particular with external quality assurance have already been gathered over several years now, suitable concepts and methods for the new Geriatric Rehabilitation specialty are still in the initial stages of development. Proven methods from the industrial and service sectors, such as auditing, monitoring and quality circles, can in principle be drawn on for devising geriatric rehabilitation quality assurance schemes; these in particular need to take into account the multiple factors influencing the course and outcome of rehabilitation entailed by multimorbidity and multi-drug use; the eminent role of the social environment; therapeutic interventions by a multidisciplinary team; as well as the multi-dimensional nature of rehabilitation outcomes. Moreover, the specific conditions of geriatric rehabilitation require development not only of quality standards unique to this domain but also of quality assurance procedures specific to geriatrics. Along with a number of other methods, standardized geriatric assessment will play a crucial role in this respect.","1326":"Medical rehabilitation measures continue to be delivered nearly exclusively on an inpatient basis. A graded treatment concept comparable to those in place for instance in the acute or long-term care fields, is non-existent, while the medical need for a community-based ambulatory rehabilitation system is uncontested. Not least before a background of ever scacer financial resources among the rehabilitation agencies involved, non-inpatient rehabilitation has been gaining significance as it is generally hoped to achieve greater economy of service delivery. As a logical consequence, the demand for greater flexibility in delivering medical rehabilitation services and benefits is a focus of attention in the current rehabilitation policy debate. Greater flexibility in medical rehabilitation delivery means replacing portions of rehabilitation measures currently provided on an inpatient basis by partial-hospitalization or ambulatory service delivery; or continuing and complementing inpatient rehabilitation measures by non-inpatient ones; or using non-inpatient measures to provide aftercare post-discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. Moreover, ambulatory rehabilitation is intended to reach the population unamenable to attending far-away inpatient programmes. It is of utmost significance for the future evolution of ambulatory rehabilitation that the various financially responsible agencies involved in rehabilitation take a joint position on the subject of non-inpatient rehabilitation. Several proposals are submitted in this respect; for indications in the fields of neurology, orthopedics, cardiology, and geriatrics, catalogues of degrees of severity considered suitable for ambulatory rehabilitation are first presented.","1327":"","1328":"","1329":"","1330":"","1331":"","1332":"Since 1994 Germany's statutory pension insurance schemes have been developing a multifaceted programme to assure and optimize the quality of their medical rehabilitation measures. One part aimed at developing a postal questionnaire for patients 8 to 12 weeks after rehab. It comprises two sections: one for the assessment of patients' perceptions and ratings in relation to rehab structures and processes, the other of changes of their health status. The article describes the development of the first part (\"rehabilitee satisfaction\"). We basically defined relevant sectors and qualities of medical rehab, analysing existing questionnaires, letters of complaint, results of expert interviews and patient focus groups. Mainly based on results from one large study of rehabilitees from two different pension insurance schemes (for blue or white collar workers), we report on psychometric properties of the final instrument, especially its contents, reliability, internal structure, validity and reference values. In February 1997, the instrument was accepted by the association of German pension schemes and may now be used in the routine phase of the quality programme, except for patients with psychosomatic disorders or substance abuse.","1333":"Office-practice physicians' attitudes towards and knowledge of available medical rehabilitation benefits are crucial influences concerning the manner and extent to which they pursue their patients' access to rehabilitation. Covering some 1200 office-practice physicians in the catchment area of a workers pension insurance agency, LVA Oldenburg-Bremen, the present questionnaire study is directed at a closer analysis of these influences. The findings, for one, indicate great diversity of overall approval of rehabilitation measures, for the other they however also reveal varying judgements of the relevancy of rehabilitation benefits for the various disease groups. Suggestions are set out on the basis of our findings on how access to rehabilitation could be upgraded.","1334":"Drastic changes are ahead for medical rehabilitation in the wake of austreity measures in the pension insurance domain. This paper presents consequences for rehabilitation hospitals and their current strategies of coping in the German health care system. Quality management now needs long and medium term planning, rather than short-term reactions. Demographic trends and a changing spectrum of morbidity indicate possible survival strategies. These societal developments are already incorporated in Total Quality Management.","1335":"The key formula \"by all suitable means\" is a structural support for successful occupational reintegration. In this respect, the special system of accident insurance administered primarily through the \"Berufsgenossenschaften\" (BG), differs from the other branches of social security. This system's roots in civil law do not allow any comparison with the principle of public law insurance underlying the other branches of social security in Germany. Under the statutory accident insurance scheme, the employer, i.e., the liable party within the employment relationship, has to compensate any health damage incurred by an employee, subject to the principles of compensation for damages under civil law, in a manner enabling the employee to return to his position in worklife and in society as unscathed as possible. From this general mandate by the legislator, the social partners involved within the self-management of the BGs draw their strength and their dynamics in arranging for organizational methods within the-administrative offices and in cooperation with the health care providers. This control of rehabilitation, i.e., the accident insurance system's share of the responsibility for successful rehabilitation, contributes a great deal to reentergrating insured persons into work and career, returns valuable workers to the employers, thus having a favourable effect for the gross national product of a society, and last but not least provides a support for the social state.","1336":"The Bonn coalition government's determination to reduce incidental wage costs, to be realized by way of benefit cutbacks in the social insurance systems and social assistance domain as well as increasing the burdens on insurers through higher retention and cost sharing levels, has particularly serious implications for people with disabilities and chronic illness. Apart from facing numerous direct changes for the worse, they in addition are affected by restrictive regulations applicable generally, inter alia in the labour market or the health and pension insurance schemes; adverse effects, hence, accumulate and heighten out of proportion. The implications of the Bonn austerity legislation are dealt with in the present contribution on the examples of the health-care reform acts as well as the changes to the federal social assistance act, in as far as they affect the provision and care of disabled individuals in residential or community settings. Also dealt with are various problems arising due to the integration assistance\/long-term care insurance overlap.","1337":"","1338":"Disabled tourists to a greater extent than hitherto possible, wish to integrate in the tourism mainstream and share in the \"civic right to holidaying\", notwithstanding the numerous architectural and transportation barriers to their mobility they still have to put up with. This is further aggravated by the fact that information about the choice of appropriate touristic opportunities is not readily accessed by the prospective holidayer. There hence is a need to step-up communicative marketing efforts in the field of tourism for disabled persons, to enable broader dissemination of available holiday opportunities adapted to the specific, individual needs. Representative studies have been able to show that worries are unfounded that the presence of people with disabilities might have adverse effects on mainstream business. Rather, the desire for harmony that prevails during one's holiday, is suggested to entail a greater ease of interaction. A target group-oriented social management approach should therefore be employed to adequately prepare tourism workers for creative handling of this social-integrative task. Both the tourist industry and tourism policy-makers at federal and laender levels have recognized the need for action towards inclusion of disabled tourists. Founded in April 1996, it hence will be a major task of the National Coordinating Unit, Tourism for All to focus the various interests involved, and to contribute to turning holidaying of disabled people into holidaying without handicap.","1339":"Alcoholic liver cirrhosis is the main indication for orthotopic liver transplantation. Since 1988, 52 patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis have been transplanted at the Department of Surgery of the University of Heidelberg. The survival rates are as follows: 73% of the patients survived for 1 year, 68% for 2 and 3 years, 64% for 4 years, and 57% survived for 5 years. After transplantation, recidivism occurred in 6 patients. Remarkable in this case was the fact that all 6 patients had a relatively short period of abstention prior to surgery (2 to 5 months). In 12 patients, a small carcinoma was found in the cirrhotic liver. This had neither been seen previously by ultrasound nor by computer tomography. In summary, orthotopic liver transplantation is an excellent mode of treatment in end-stage alcoholic liver cirrhosis. However, the patients have to be carefully selected in order to avoid recidivism following transplantation.","1340":"Restitution or improvement of impaired brain function following severe head trauma essentially depends on immediate and systematic application of adequate rehabilitation measures. In an collaborative study of the University of Cologne Rehabilitation Centre and Clinic for Neurosurgery, the question is investigated whether early-onset stimulation therapy might have a favourable effect on the course of recuperation, including possible acceleration in regaining consciousness. For 60 minutes at least twice a day, auditory, tactile, olfactory, visual, gustatory and kinesthetic stimulation is administered to the patient, under medical supervision and with the help of nursing personnel, physiotherapists and the patient's family. In order to record the patient's reactions to these stimuli, heart rate, frequency of respiration, skin resistance, and muscle activity are measured and the patient's behaviour is observed using standardized assessment instruments.","1341":"In a pilot trial in Rhineland-Palatinate two instruments for optimizing medical and occupational rehabilitation of myocardial infarction patients were tested: (1) A regional cardiology working group was founded which selected measures to accelerate the rehabilitation process in model region hospitals. (2) At the pilot rehabilitation clinic a counselling service for patients under a case management trial scheme was established. The evaluation showed that three weeks after the heart attack, exercise ECGs were carried out in 77.1% of pilot trial patients (case group) as opposed to only 54.5% of patients receiving standard treatment (control group). During in-patient rehabilitation, a higher proportion of case patients discussed their return to work with their employers. After rehabilitation, the occupational future still was uncertain in 13.2% of the case group, in contrast with 29.5% of the control group. 91.8% of case group patients (64% of controls) had been briefed about support possibilities facilitating a stepwise return to work according to section 74 SGB V; half a year following the beginning of rehabilitation, case group patients were reentergrated into working life in 56.3% (50% of controls).","1342":"The present paper introduces into the structures, psychometric properties and the development of the \"Interview on the Social Network and Social Support SONET\". SONET is a network-analytical tool based on conceptual and methodological considerations related to the concepts of social network and social support. It was developed by the authors over the last few years. Discussing the most important results on its psychometric properties shows that SONET has good reliability, and acceptably high proof of its validity. Relative to rehabilitation of psychiatric and somatic disorders, SONET may be used in the diagnosis of deficits in social integration and interpersonal relationships of an individual. Additionally, stressful conditions of interpersonal relationships are assessed as well. SONET is also suitable for evaluating rehabilitative interventions at the level of personal relationships. Because no single-case studies have been conducted with the instrument until now, the paper concludes by presenting results from a small sample of schizophrenic and depressive patients demonstrating its applicability for diagnostic, prognostic and evaluative problems in the field of rehabilitation.","1343":"Major economies need to be made in the health care system. The austerity legislation effective as of January 1, 1997 will result in considerable benefit cuts in the statutory health and pension insurance schemes, with major repercussions also in the field of rehabilitation. Possible devices for realizing potential economies are more precise targetting in patient selection, upgrading social-medical expertise, as well as adjusting rehabilitation more precisely to both patients' needs and economical service delivery. Appropriate tools have been developed by the health insurance scheme towards these ends.","1344":"","1345":"","1346":"","1347":"The term rehabilitation hospitalism refers to: retardation of rehabilitation progress behind (remaining) abilities.

By means of a standardized questionnaire, a total of 118 patients (78 male, 40 female) with ankylosing spondylitis were asked about their regular physical activity. The patients' mean age was 47 years, and they have been suffering from the symptoms of the disease for (a mean) 17 years. Twenty-nine percent of the patients practice disease-specific exercises daily. Thirty-nine percent have not received any instructions about the optimal exercises in the previous 5 years. Most information had been given by the physiotherapist at home or at the health resort. Non-specific physical exercises are practiced by half of the patients. Lack of time and lack of motivation are the major factors preventing the patients from greater activity. Deficient mobility was claimed by 37 of the 118 patients to prevent them from practicing sports. Better information, and hence motivation, of the patients are suggested by our findings as the most useful way to foster wider use of physical exercise.","1349":"The present article gives an outline of vocational rehabilitation in the Federal Republic of Germany from the perspective of the statutory accident insurance scheme. Termed \"Berufshilfe\", occupational assistance, the services and benefits provided under the scheme also encompass elements of medical and social rehabilitation of persons who have incurred an industrial injury or occupational disease. Given the scheme's comprehensive catalog of benefits and services, a multitude of possibilities result for assistance to eligible workers and their relatives, which are illustrated by examples. Central to the presentation is the work of the \"Berufshelfer\", the accident insurance agency's case manager for vocational rehabilitation service provision. Along with competence of the accident insurance agency for medical, vocational and social rehabilitation, this case manager is the point of contact for all those involved in rehabilitation in the individual case, hence in particular for the individual affected, his or her relatives, physicians, rehabilitation facilities, employers as well as third parties, moreover being the point of liaison among these various parties and the administration. The primary objective of these entire efforts is to achieve lasting reintegration of people with physical or emotional disablement in employment, career, and society.","1350":"The background for the development of actual assessments for evaluation of vocational integration of disabled people (i.e., EAM, IMBA) in Germany is described. Resulting perspectives for future procedural approaches are presented. So far, the EAM, Ertomis Assessment Method, approach has gained limited acceptance only. In light of WHO and European impulses, as well as the economic constraints at hand, it remains to be seen whether the IMBA information system will turn out a practical and problem-focussed tool. A critical review is done to provide constructive suggestions for further applications of IMBA.","1351":"Given a growing number of elderly people and the related consequences for the health care system, such as increasing numbers of persons with chronic diseases or in need of long-term nursing care, the present rehabilitation system must be extended and new services be introduced. Hospitals in Cologne report that an average 48% of their geriatric patients are in need of rehabilitation measures. Taking into account the patients' willingness and capacity to undergo rehabilitation treatment, the figure reduces to 30%. Based on the number of geriatric patients treated in hospital each year, rehabilitation facilities for 15416 geriatric patients a year have to be provided. About two thirds of the patients require continued hospital treatment after the acute phase. Obviously, these treatments are not only performed in the geriatric departments of the hospitals, as only 161 geriatric beds are available in Cologne. One third of the patients could be taken care of on a partial hospitalization or outpatient basis after the acute phase. Thus, limiting a patient's length of stay in hospital could have a cost-containment effect. As partial hospitalization and outpatient rehabilitation facilities are lacking, the Cologne \"Geriatrics\" study group has developed a concept of \"integrated geriatric rehabilitation\", suggesting the establishment of mobile rehabilitation teams. The concept aims at developing a cooperative network linking outpatient with partial hospitalization and inpatient services, and including the physicians at community level.","1352":null,"1353":null,"1354":"The austerity legislation passed September 13, 1996 as well as the additional austerity measures pending for the field of rehabilitation in the framework of legislation aimed at refocusing self-government and self-responsibility in the statutory health insurance scheme (1. und 2. Gesetz zur Neuordnung der Selbstverwaltung und Eigenverantwortung in der gesetzlichen Krankenversicherung-1st and 2nd GKV-NOG) are going to jeopardize insurees' provision with medical rehabilitation generally. For 1997 alone, economies totalling some 3.2 billion DM have been legislated. By drastically increasing the additional payments to be made, the insured are to an intolerable extent being subjected to contributing towards the cost of their medical treatment. What is more, the 2nd GKV-NOG is to enable health insurance funds to totally exclude rehabilitation benefits from the standard catalog of benefits to be provided. Along with these spending limitations in the social insurance schemes, additional burdens have been imposed on the insured in gainful employment under regulations in the field of labour law effective as of October 1, 1996 applicable in case of participation in an in-patient rehabilitation measure. Thus, the employer is entitled to make deductions with regard to an employee's claim to continued remuneration during sick leave as well as part of his annual paid recreational leave for the duration of the inpatient rehabilitation measure. The population most adversely affected by this policy are those with chronic illness and disability.","1355":"Beginning 1997, considerable cost-cutting constraints have become effective which are entirely founded by fiscal reasons. The resulting restrictions will not remain without consequences for care and supply of patients with chronic diseases and handicaps as well as for the entire rehabilitation system itself. The expected cuts are so serious that they will also affect further rehabilitation prospects and objectives. The extent of the austerity measures-especially the extent of budget capping-is running counter to the factual development of needs.","1356":"The Duke Health Profile is a 17-item generic questionnaire instrument designed to measure adult self-reported functional health status quantitatively during a one-week time window. It is appropriate for both patient and non-patient adult populations. It can be self-administered by the individual respondent or administered by another person. The administration time is less than five minutes. It is crucial that each question is answered. There are 11 scales. Six scales (i.e., physical health, mental health, social health, general health, perceived health, self-esteem) measure function, with high scores indicating better health. Five scales (i.e., anxiety, depression, anxiety-depression, pain disability) measure dysfunction, with high scores indicating greater dysfunction. Most extensive use has been in family practice patients with the broadest spectrum of diagnoses, but it has also been used in patient populations with specific diagnoses such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, endstage renal disease, ischemic disease, and impotence. Both internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) and temporal stability (test-retest) testing have supported reliability of the DUKE. Validity has been supported for the DUKE scales by: (a) comparison of the DUKE scores with scores of other health measures for the same patients, (b) comparison of DUKE scores between patient groups having different clinical diagnostic profiles and severity of illness, (c) prediction of health-related outcomes by DUKE scores. Convergent and discriminant validity have been shown when comparing with other instruments.","1357":"Commissioned by, and at the expense of the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Order, the Ministry of Welfare of the Latvian Republic has been supported by BTZ, Berufliches Trainingszentrum Hamburg, in its drive to set up a rehabilitation centre. Conceptual development completed in late 1991 along the lines of the vocational training and retraining centres in Germany, the RRC, Republican Rehabilitation Centre, was founded in Jurmala on the Gulf of Riga in February 1992, as a limited liability company.

The preverbal and nonverbal forms of communicating, hence, have special relevance in a developmental context. A natural extension of gestic messages, it in particular is the use of signing that is apt to enhance speech and language acquisition and bring about distinct improvement in understanding and making oneself understood. Exchanging messages by sign language can reveal to the child the significance of his\/her own behaviour in the communicative situation, hence reduce passiveness and frustration. The extent to which they are able to support the child's communicative needs in concrete, everyday living is an important suitability criterion also for the various other alternative and augmentative communication devices available.","1361":"Expectations of 315 adults concerning flexible medical rehabilitation were assessed in the framework of a four-week inpatient rehabilitation programme. Especially younger patients (15-40 years) showed greater acceptance to participate in a two-week inpatient rehabilitation programme.","1362":"Patients suffering from complaints of the musculoskeletal system with diagnoses like neurotic and somatization disorders often attribute their complaints to mere organic factors. Only part of these patients are willing to participate in conflict-oriented group psychotherapy. Taking account of the different treatment motivations in inpatient rehabilitation it is necessary to install a differentiated treatment concept with a basic psychosomatic programme and optional group psychotherapy. At the Roland Klinik in Bad Meinberg such a model of integrated short term psychotherapy has been established. In a 1993-94 pilot study we explored the relationship between the initial subjective suffering (in psychic and organic terms) and the use of the different treatment modalities. The degree of suffering from psychic problems emerged as a predictor for the patient's choice of the psychotherapy group. Some relevant factors for the choice of treatment modalities and outcome of therapy are discussed. The findings of this study support further refinement of the existing treatment differentiation.","1363":"The Federation of German Vocational Retraining Centres have recently completed a fundamental revision and update of their conceptual approach, adjusting it to the technological advances at hand as well as to a changing labour market. Novel educational concepts offer broader space for accommodating the needs of individual rehabilitees and for enhancing their competence, technical, methodological and social, in terms of present-day, wholistic rehabilitation. New approaches are being implemented, the vocational training centres opening up for new groups (such as one-parent families) and offering rehabilitation programmes on a non-residential basis as well. Further-training schemes have been devised to ensure that disabled people, too, have access to the current state-of-the-art. An indispensable part of vocational rehabilitation programmes also in the future, the Specialized Services of the vocational retraining centres are going to adapt to the changing situation as well.","1364":"This study shows that additional outpatient\/partially inpatient treatment provided in a cardiological rehabilitation hospital effectively complements inpatient rehabilitation treatment but does not replace it. Our flexible system which comprises a shorter stay in hospital and subsequent partially inpatient treatment allows more intensive treatment of the patient in the early phase of rehabilitation. It supports patients when they have returned home and have to test out how they manage with their restricted physical and mental performance in their social environment. It appears possible to develop criteria to select the individually appropriate form of treatment. The introduction of outpatient\/partially inpatient therapy in a cardiological rehabilitation hospital does not appear to entail disadvantages for the patients. It contributes to more flexible, and in particular to more individualized, treatment. The ongoing pilot projects will show whether in the final analysis this will also entail a saving of costs. Not only in view of their specialist competence are the cardiological rehabilitation hospitals suitable and able to participate in measures to increase the flexibility of cardiological rehabilitation. They should therefore either completely integrate outpatient\/partially inpatient methods in their concept of therapy or after a shortened inpatient treatment. They should then evaluate these methods so as to be able to contribute to an informed discussion on this topic. This also would mean that available resources would be better utilized, which would in addition be of particular importance at present, in a situation dominated by discussions of costs.","1365":"The SASPC-oriented rehabilitation approach, combining patient's somatic situation, activities of daily living, social circumstances as well as psychological status and communication skills, has been developed in the Netherlands with special regard to impairments, disabilities and handicaps of the musculoskeletal system.

The Berne Coping Forms BEFO permit coping representation, for one, from the perspective of the observer (observer rating) and, for the other, from that of the patient (self-rating). The instrument is applicable for any diagnostic area or context, whether preventive programme, acute or chronic conditions, rehabilitation, or assessment of stressors in carers or relatives, and many more. The instrument is comprised of 30 categories of coping modes, oriented by three dimensions (action-,cognitive and emotion-related). Numerous studies have demonstrated adequacy of the instrument's psychometric properties. Associations between observer and self-rating are good, as is repeat reliability of the self-rating form, while the required reliability levels are reached in observer repeat ratings. Interrater agreement is good even with minimal previous training. The instrument has stood the test for differentiated assessment of coping modes in varying forms of illness-generated stress. It moreover permits characterization of coping style changes over time, i.e. in the different disease phases. Also, sociocultural differences and coping effectiveness can be substantiated. BEFO interpretation is determined by the research focus at hand, and presupposes differentiated evaluation of illness behaviour. Training and instruction are thoroughly dealt with in a manual, and comparative videos can be made available.","1368":"","1369":"Every summer, the number of hospitalizations for acute deterioration of a chronic disease increases in the Southern Northsea holiday region. These patients usually are holiday-makers coming to the region for recreation. This study analyzes the relationships among acute illness, reason for going on holiday, existing chronic disease, mode of transport\/arrival, and consultation of general practitioner beforehand. A total of 62 holiday-makers from the region who had been hospitalized for internal illness were included in the study. 80.6% of them knew to be suffering from a chronic disease. In 41 patients, acute deterioration of their chronic condition within a few days after their arrival had resulted in admission to the hospital. Usually, their doctor had not advised against the intended holiday trip. The study findings indicate that chronically ill patients need individualized counselling about potential medical hazards associated with their chronic condition especially in light of the physical and emotional strains involved in an intended holiday. Also, mention should be made of the possibilities for participating in an organized health-resort programme.","1370":"In two randomized patient groups with painful shoulder syndrome and impingement, pain, mobility and working capacity were investigated some 14, 90 and 360 days after a single injection of either Mepivacain Hydrochloride alone or in combination with 20 mg of Triamcinolone Hexaacetonide. Superiority of the combination therapy was found to be statistically significant with regard to pain levels, and very likely with regard to shoulder mobility as well as restoration or preservation of working capacity.","1371":"The present contribution deals with the early rehabilitation outcomes achieved using total knee arthroplasties with major differences in design. Hinged and unhinged total knee replacements are compared for a total of 100 patients included in the prospective study (48 hinged prostheses, and 52 unhinged ones). Evaluation of the functional and subjective parameters included shows that major improvements in total scores had been achieved in both groups already after 5 weeks, even more pronounced after 10 weeks. With a number of differences found for the various criteria assessed, it in particular is the fact of early stability of the joint in using the hinged prostheses that entails speedy progress and a good rehabilitation outcome. Due consideration of the different early outcomes for the various parameters, hence, is imperative in pre-operative decision-making.","1372":"In the wake of German unification, great social change has taken place in some fields. To estimate the impact of these changes on the state of rehabilitation of people with low vision, a standardized questionnaire about their social situation was sent to those 134 adult graduates of the School for People with Low Vision in Thuringia who had already been interviewed in 1989. 56 completed questionnaires could be evaluated, and the data was compared with the data collected in 1989. While there was almost no change concerning medical rehabilitation, an interesting development in the field of financial and social benefits has taken place: Even though the number of people who qualified for support had increased from 41.1% (1989) to 62.5% now, a closer look showed that this had mainly been caused by financial benefits (such as unemployment pay, housing subsidy, etc.) linked to the social decline of the examined group of disabled people. Accordingly, the number of employed people with low vision had decreased from 98.2% in 1989 to 60.7% today. Nevertheless all respondents seem to be secure financially (increase of the net income per month and household for 48.2% of the respondents) and fortunately 78.6% lived in their own flat (compared to only 64.3% in 1989). The general liberalization of public life in the new German Laender is reflected by the fact that 19.6% of the people with low vision felt able to make new friends and that traveling (with 50%) ranked second among the hobbies mentioned. The views people with low vision hold relative to the general living conditions illustrate a general uncertainty in the wake of the changes in the entire social system (statement: \"Everything has become insecure\"--55.4%), but also reveals that better economic background conditions are appreciated.","1373":"20 patients (11 female, 9 male) without low back pain were included in two interrater studies carried out by three physical therapists. The following variables were investigated: shape of the spine, iliac crest heights, twisting of the pelvis, spine test, length of legs, Patrick sign, Schober test, fingertip-to-floor measurements, flexion and extension of the lumbar spine, straight-leg raising, and length of the iliopsoas and the rectus muscles. Intraclass coefficients for the ordinal variables, and kappa coefficients for the nominal variables were calculated for evaluation of interrater agreement. In both investigations, the Schober sign, lumbar flexion, fingertip-to-floor measurements, straight-leg raising of the left leg, and lengths of both legs were almost perfectly reliable. All other variables exhibited a lower reliability between the three therapists.","1374":null,"1375":"The SF-36 Health Survey is a generic instrument for assessment of the health-related quality of life of patients. Originally developed in the U.S. and used in the Medical Outcomes Study, the SF-36 is the empirically validated short form of outcome assessment instruments developed for this study. The SF-36 assesses 8 subscales of the health-related quality of life, or subjective health, which are conceptually subsumed in the areas of \"physical\" and \"mental\" health. On the basis of a translation of the instrument into the German language, the results of psychometric testing of the SF-36 in different populations of healthy and ill persons are described. In addition, the results of a norming study and the use of these data as age- and gender-specific reference information for clinical populations are demonstrated. In its German form as well, the SF-36 appears to be a psychometrically robust and practicable instrument for use in outcome evaluation in rehabilitative medicine.","1376":"","1377":"Advantages of coping assessment for the understanding of individual impacts of severe illness are pointed out, the benefit for a better understanding of the rehabilitation process is demonstrated. After the basic positions and preliminary assumptions are described, the guidelines of the development of the inventory are introduced: Assessment of a broad spectrum of coping with chronic diseases with ratings by the patient himself and by others (doctors, relatives), suitability for process measuring, good acceptance, and economical application. Statistical properties of the questionnaires are reported with respect to achieved acceptance, reliability, and validity data. Using selected results as examples, possible applications in psychosomatic research are pointed out for issues such as illness-specific components of coping with chronic diseases, discrepancies between patients' and doctors' views of coping, and adaptational success. Finally, possibilities and limits of the inventory are discussed in terms of research issues and methodology.","1378":"","1379":"","1380":"Children with profound disablement (hence, in conclusion, all individuals with profound mental retardation) are denied to possess personhood by the bioethicist Peter Singer, on the ground that they lack the capability of reason, of consciousness of self, and of self-determination. The article seeks to point out that Singer's concept of the person is too narrow: the very disposition for development of these abilities in itself is a constituent of personhood. Human social and spiritual interwovenness is considered another essential constituent. Finally, the fundamental difference between \"life worth\" and \"quality of life\" is pointed out, a differentiation which goes unnoticed with Singer. From the premises outlined, and in contrast to Singer's ethics of (one's own) personal happiness, emerges an ethics of solidarity, and of love, bearing also on the issues of euthanasia, abortion, and prenatal diagnostics.","1381":"The task of rehabilitation as defined by law and the concept of psychosomatic-psychotherapeutic treatment require cooperation of different professions in a clinical team. This approach implies a concept of interdisciplinary cooperation in which the contributions towards treatment to be made by the individual members of the multiprofessional team are defined by means of functions and tasks. Participation of the social worker is an integral element of psychosomatic teamwork. The social worker makes an important contribution towards the interdisciplinary arrangement of psychosomatic rehabilitation treatment by taking over functions for maintaining the ward setting, for the psychotherapy process and the rehabilitation task as well as for the working of the team. On the basis of his specific competence he provides independent knowledge, particular ways of interaction, and singular methods of intervention of social work for the psychosomatic treatment carried out by the multiprofessional team.","1382":"In contrast to medical science, education has so far undertaken but little analysis of its tasks in neurological rehabilitation, although these are manifold and essential in achieving successful outcomes. While specific remedial services have been made available to persons with congenital brain damage in the schools for the mentally retarded, a need to catch up in this respect is obvious for persons with acquired brain damage. Extension of the network of neurological rehabilitation facilities has engendered a challenge to (special) education, which now is in the process of developing neuroeducational concepts for therapy and instruction. Starting out from a didactical analysis to identify the conditional and determinative fields involved, the foundations of educational action are set forth, to wit: the theories of intelligence and its development, as well as the concept positing a hierarchy of learning modes. The various modes or types of learning are outlined and illustrated by examples. Further dealt with are prerequisites for specific learning modes to take effect, as well as neurological relationships; the need for cooperating in an interdisciplinary team is substantiated. Starting out from the premise of their fundamental ability to learn, the article then discusses the teaching-learning processes for persons with neurological disablement, with attention paid to both memory, personality dimensions as well as classroom instruction, and the relationship among perception, learning and instruction. Concluding, the author posits participation of persons with brain damage in the process of determining their rehabilitative goals, as well as empathy on the part of the professionals involved with them in therapy, classroom and training.","1383":"In recent years, subjective assessment of functional ability by patients has become an important diagnostic instrument in rehabilitation medicine. We compared three self-administered standardized questionnaires for measuring functional capacity in patients with back pain (the back pain-specific version of the Hannover Functional Ability Questionnaire, the Roland &amp; Morris Scale, and the Measurement of Patient Outcome Scales) with respect to feasibility, reliability, and validity. The sample comprised 119 patients treated for back pain in a rehabilitation clinic in North Germany. Besides measures of functional ability, anamnestic and psychosociological data were collected in addition. Mobility of the spine was assessed by simple clinical tests. The three questionnaires differed only slightly with regard to their psychometric properties and appeared to be equally well suited for measuring functional ability in patients with back pain. The decision for one of the instruments should be based on practical considerations (time for completion, feasibility, availability of reference data).","1384":"The article describes outcomes of a quality assurance study to evaluate defined health promotion measures within a 4-week inpatient rehabilitation treatment. 308 patients, mostly with chronic obstructive diseases of the respiratory tract, have been studied at the beginning and end of inpatient treatment, as well as 6 months after treatment (follow-up). Dependent variables were knowledge of relevant health information and self-assessment of health behaviour. The results show that patients substantially improve their knowledge of health information during rehabilitation treatment. These effects remain stable at the 6-months follow-up. Self-assessed measures of relevant health behaviour at follow-up indicate that behavioural changes have been implemented in daily routines. Different degrees of effectiveness in subgroups are discussed, and steps to further optimize the treatment are proposed.","1385":"","1386":"","1387":"","1388":"Published by the World Health Organization in 1980, the International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities, and Handicaps (ICIDH) provides a conceptual framework for information by enabling classification, and hence description, of the three dimensions of the phenomenon of \"disablement\" (as a consequence of disease, injury or congenital condition). The ICIDH permits a highly complex issue to be easily grasped to a certain extent, and has gained almost worldwide recognition as a valuable tool in the perception of the problem of disablement, in describing this problem and developing solutions for this problem. With modern definitions in rehabilitation using its basic terms, the ICIDH will before long also be established as a tool for purposes of documentation, evaluation and treatment planning in the field of rehabilitation. Notwithstanding its successes, the ICIDH not only raises practical problems but theoretical ones as well. The points of criticism relate to the consequences of disease model, the definitions of the basic terms, and the overlap of basic term extensions. In order to overcome the definitional and overlap problems it is suggested, for one, to clearly distinguish between the phenomena and their symptoms and, for the other, to eliminate any overlap that may exist in the formulation of the concepts the definitions of the basic terms build on. The ICIDH model of disease consequences may be viewed as a preliminary step towards developing a theory of disablement. Such a theory would in particular be designed to enable explanation and prognosis of disablement creation processes as well as development of causally founded methods of intervention in rehabilitation. It should moreover include a theory of the etiologic processes involved in disablement as well as a theory of rehabilitative intervention. The crucial future tasks of the rehabilitation sciences will include the further development of a theory of disablement enabling provision of assistance to persons with disablement, or at risk of being disabled, in a more purposeful and causally founded manner than has been the case so far.","1389":"The present study deals with the issue of how mastectomy will impact selected dimensions of psychological and psychosocial experience and behaviour in the women concerned. The study had comprised 21 women, mean age 55. 73 years, with a breast cancer diagnosis given between 1 and 21 years ago. Data collection was carried out using a 17-item questionnaire standardized for this purpose. Factor analyses produced four clearly interpretable factors. Study findings suggest that breast cancer surgery will not inevitably result in impaired sexual behaviour and experience in the affected women, whereas it is sure to impact, to varying degrees, on the factors and dimensions of \"body image and self-image\", \"psychological and psychosomatic complaints\" as well as anticipated \"performance capacity and social relationships\". Intercorrelations among questionnaire items are set out. It has further been found that the variables \"time of breast removal\" and \"life age\" had exercised only negligible influence on the women's questionnaire response, and that the psychosocial support experienced post-surgery was reported to have primarily come from the circle of family and friends, and less so been extended by self-help groups or medial staff. Concluding, the need for integrated rehabilitative measures is pointed out.","1390":"The treatment course in a 66 year old female stroke patient serves to describe the cooperation among various professions in a geriatric acute-care clinic. The treatment challenges, entailed by the multifaceted stroke sequels, are concretized, and an effort towards interdisciplinary team decision-making is set out, with cooperation among team members offering support and respite. The approach outlined clearly testifies to the need for ongoing team supervision in this field of work.","1391":"A European Commission programme aimed at occupational integration of disabled, disadvantaged and migrant persons, the HORIZON Community initiative had been implemented in the Federal Republic of Germany between 1991 and 1994. Along with an overview of project participants, exemplary innovative approaches to and potential for integrating disabled persons in employment are presented that have been developed and implemented under the programme. Also, the labour market effects achieved for the disability target group are set out.","1392":"Attention is drawn to the specific issues faced--in contrast to other disability groups--in the vocational rehabilitation of persons with mental retardation and learning disorders. Current practice serves as a background for pointing out specific desiderations and outlining possible solutions. In particular posited is the need for a more tangible definition of modularized occupational qualifications as well as upgrading and refinement of flexible, community-based supports to be made available at the special\/general labour market interface.","1393":"The section \"Psychology in the Neurological Department\" at the Hardtwaldklinik I, of Bad Zwesten, can look back at 18 years of experience with neuropsychological group therapy within the neurological rehabilitation setting. The functions of the psychological section can be subdivided into diagnostic tasks on the one hand, and therapeutical interventions concerning cognitive and emotional aspects on the other, with psychotherapy having a mediating function, depending on the individual indication at hand. Depending on the kind and degree of the neurological impairment present, and based on detailed diagnostics, the patients are treated in the field of cognitive performance either individually or in groups. There are groups with different degrees of difficulty in line with type and extent of the selective disorders present. Experiences have shown that neuropsychological group therapy in particular is aimed at a holistic approach to the pattern of interference and the patient's personality. The possibilities for intervention and therapy are diverse, and range from play material to computer-based individual or group therapy. In the framework of internal quality assurance, experiences have shown that the effects of neuropsychological group therapy are not easily validated. In this respect, the subjective estimates of therapist and patient are the predominant, if not the only, criteria in terms of improved mental functioning.","1394":"Early neurological rehabilitation means starting rehabilitation of brain damaged patients already during the acute phase of the trauma or illness. It meanwhile is commonly accepted that early onset of specific neurological rehabilitation interventions will enhance medical improvement and social reintegration potential. On the other hand, the number of treatment places required for adequate early neurological rehabilitation remains a controversial, and as yet unresolved, issue in Germany. In the present study, an evaluation was undertaken for the first time to determine the local demand for early rehabilitation beds in the well-defined region of the federal state of Bremen, based on retrospective analysis of all adults treated for severe brain disease in the major Bremen clinics over a period of 22 months, i.e., between January 1992 and October 1993. A total of 146 early rehabilitation treatments was found, which is equivalent to 80 treatments a year. These results are compared with the figures and recommendations given by Kuratorium ZNS. Also, our findings document the apparent deficits in neurological rehabilitation at the time in the Land Bremen, which undoubtedly jeopardize our daily objectives, the progress and successes achieved in early intensive care.","1395":"From a demographic and health policy perspective, movement and sports are gaining increased importance in terms of their preventive, therapeutic and rehabilitative potential. Successful use of sports therapy and rehabilitation sports in rehabilitating paraplegics, breast cancer patients, and patients with total hip replacement have provided convincing proof of their positive physical, mental and social impact, hence of the substantial contributions they are able to make towards enhancing specific parameters of the quality of life. It is assumed that movement and sports are conducive in particular in chronic conditions, in line with the principle of \"rehabilitation taking priority over care\". Whether reduced health care spending will ensue, will in the final analysis have to be determined through controlled longitudinal studies, which have not been embarked upon as yet. Successful rehabilitation in this domain presupposes adequately qualified staffing in movement therapy-focussed rehabilitation facilities, both in- and out-patient, availability of an uninterrupted rehabilitation chain as well as appropriate follow-up for evaluation.","1396":"The article deals with the development, nationally and internationally, of assessment systems permitting parallel appraisal of an individual's abilities and the requirements presented by the working conditions at hand. By comparison of abilities and requirements, these assessments are aimed at concretizing individual need for intervention as well as prompt practical implementation in view of occupational placement of people with disabilities. The course of development is of special interest in this context as the description of abilities starts out from the basic concepts of the ICIDH while description of the working conditions is based on ergonomic concepts. Uniting these different developments in an integrated system for assessing abilities and requirements, has been achieved by ERTOMIS Foundation, with effective support on the part of K.-A. Jochheim, through an empirically-practically oriented approach, whereas a corresponding multidisciplinary research project funded by the Federal Ministry of Labour, in light of its scientific-theoretical background gave preference to a hierarchical-modular structural concept. At a European level as well, both the European Council (partial agreement) and the European Union Helios II working groups have exclusively acknowledged assessment systems of this kind as providing an important bridge between the field of rehabilitation and the world of work.","1397":"Business and industry, legislators, service providers, people with disabilities, all expect the facilities involved in rehabilitation to engage in quality management. What does this imply? Which regulations exist? How much does it cost? The issues involved in implementation of quality assurance systems in production and human service sectors are discussed on the example of the workshops for the disabled.","1398":"","1399":"This paper describes conceptual and clinimetric aspects as well as fields of application of the Hannover Functional Ability Questionnaire for measuring back pain-related disability (FFbH-R). The FFbH-R belongs to a series of short self-administered questionnaires for the assessment of functional limitations in activities of daily living among patients with musculoskeletal disorders. In addition to the FFbH-R, a specific version is available for patients with polyarticular diseases (the FFbH-P), as well as a combined version of both questionnaires. A new questionnaire for patients with osteoarthritis is currently being developed. Data from various studies indicate that the FFbH-R meets the relevant psychometric criteria of acceptability, reliability, validity, and sensitivity to change. It has been successfully applied in (observational and controlled) clinical studies, in epidemiologic surveys, and in compensation disability evaluation.","1400":"","1401":"","1402":null,"1403":"The contribution community disabled sports is making towards comprehensive rehabilitation of people with disabilities is interpreted much too narrowly by the statutory definition of rehabilitation sports. In the member clubs of Deutscher Behinderten-Sportverband, the German disabled sports association, severely disabled individuals rediscover their potential and self-worth, which may entail self-determination, solidarity with others, and genuine social integration. Renewed awareness of the traditional values of German disabled sports as a self-help movement of those concerned, and characterization of rehabilitation as a complex learning process towards regaining personal autonomy--both call for a thorough reconsideration of ambulatory disabled sports in organizational and funding respects.","1404":"Starting out from the insufficiencies in the psychotherapeutic care for elderly patients, the treatment possibilities available in psychosomatic clinics are delineated. Utilization of these possibilities by the elderly is pointed out, some fundamental aspects of gerontopsychosomatic rehabilitation are discussed, and it is shown that specific aspects must be considered in the treatment of this population.","1405":"The concept of a vocational day-care centre for persons with chronic mental illness is discussed. Work is done with clay, which enables a supply with both very simple and very sophisticated tasks. Clients are able to clearly realize the results of their joint efforts. Analysis of attendance at the centre reveals that especially those who had spent longer periods of time in psychiatric hospital and are already receiving a disability pension came to work most regularly. These findings show that even for those who have definitely withdrawn from gainful employment, individually adapted work opportunities nevertheless remain of considerable importance.","1406":"Presented is a vocational reintegration concept for clients following craniocerebral trauma and other acquired brain damage. Close dovetailing of vocational and therapeutic measures is advocated, as it is mostly the neuropsychological disorders or problems in behaviour and emotional experience that stand in the way of returning to work. A work experience and adjustment setting holds particularly great potential for addressing these difficulties in a day-to-day life-related, remedial manner. Another focus is follow-up care of those clients who have returned to competitive employment. These clients are called on regularly at their workplace by programme vocational guidance\/vocational assessment staff; necessary adaptations are carried out, difficulties dealt with, and possible solutions sought jointly with the employer. A catamnestic study was undertaken to verify how many of the clients included in the programme had achieved long-term resettlement. It was found that the great majority of those who had returned to their former job, have retained their employment some one to two years later, with most of them working at a lower level than before the event. Clients unable to return to their former employer had mostly been pensioned despite the presence of partial working capacity.","1407":"Vocational retraining centres, sui generis, belong to those vocational rehabilitation facilities where disabled adults are afforded an opportunity for comprehensive occupational reorientation, facilities that operate on the principle of \"dual training under one roof\", i.e. combine practical and theoretical contents, which documents their close linkage with the mainstream vocational education system practiced in Germany. An essential modification has for some years now been introduced at the Michaelshoven\/Cologne vocational retraining centre: the traditional conveyance of skills and knowledge (i.e., acquisition of technical competence) has been replaced by attainment of occupational action competence as the focus of rehabilitative efforts. Hand in hand with this concept rooted in the principle of client-concentration, comes implementation of the principles of integration and holistic approach. Integration means that rehabilitees with mental illness participate in the rehabilitation programmes alongside rehabilitees without mental illness. The holistic approach is expressed in a number of closely coordinated elements ensuring that the specific configuration of persons with mental illness and their way of life are taken into consideration from the very beginning of their stay in the Michaelshoven\/Cologne vocational retraining centre. Along with in-depth talks at entry and specific vocational guidance for individuals with mental illness, these elements inter alia include: pre-rehabilitation adjustment, pre-rehabilitation course, an extramural industrial practical, action-oriented training methods throughout, and systematic placement assistance and support--in line with the vocational retraining centre's motto of \"picking up our rehabilitees right where they stand\".","1408":"Starting out from some value theory-based considerations, the author subsequently questions the concept of being \"fully adequate\" (\"vollwertig\", literally: \"full value\") in light of the human condition, and in particular in its relation to persons with disabilities. In the context of biotic, human life as a fundamental value, a critical discussion ensues of the position held by P. Singer concerning person status of beings, with the degree of biotic perfection of man the focal point of discussion here. Extensive thought is given to the rank of human achievement within the social value system, and its meaning to persons with disabilities. Achievement is accepted as a value, given full awareness of its relativity. For persons with profound disablement, for very old and frail persons, an entitlement, without any counter consideration required, to recognition and valuation of their existence is posited, which includes the need to create overall conditions enabling humane dying in light of the concrete circumstances.","1409":"Presented is a diagnostic instrument to assess chronic and acute pain, that allows multifaceted and standardized quantification of pain experience. This tool--the Pain Experience Scale (\"Schmerzempfindungsskala\"--SES)--measures two dimensions of subjectively felt pain, the affective characterization as well as modes of sensory characterization of pain. Applications range from degenerative or inflammatory joint and back pain to headache\/migraine, neuropathias and other pain-related diseases (age 16 to 80 years). Completion, evaluation, and interpretation are done easily. Scale development had comprised 3 steps of research for obtaining a model of invariant structure and homogenous factors. Scale analyses demonstrated the instrument's reliability, and numerous studies illustrated the validity of the scale. They showed that factorial, convergent and discriminant validity can be regarded as given. Moreover, the scale proved to be sensitive in experimental pain studies. Additionally, specific patterns of scores could be observed validly for 18 different groups of disease\/pain. Special efforts were invested to show its sensitivity to change in the course of pains. Here, the Pain Experience Scale proved to be suitable in postoperative pain, drug-based pain therapies, different psychological pain management approaches, physiotherapeutic prevention, and a multimodal treatment programme of a specialized pain clinic. In German-speaking countries, the SES has been in use for several years as a well-proven instrument in medical care, clinical research as well as field evaluation.","1410":"In the framework of pre-rehabilitation courses for German-origin immigrants as well as other rehabilitees of mostly foreign nationality, the Bad Krozingen cardiac care centre has for some two years, i.e. since 1993, undertaken practical trials of a model occupational field-oriented project classroom. To enable rehabilitees to better prepare for their future work or occupational fields, internal differentiation is used to facilitate occupation-specific preparation in a project worksetting, with self-directed activity of the individual in a teamwork situation being the main focus of enhancement. This afternoon \"occupational field-oriented project work\" complements morning classrooms that, aside various other subjects, are focussed on German and maths as well as EDP fundamentals, with electronic text processing in particular viewed as a tool that facilitates written documentation of teamwork, hence is dealt with right at the beginning of the course.","1411":"In the treatment of acute disorders, the complex interactions existing among various geriatric illnesses and age-specific impaired organ functioning, demand a therapeutic outlook oriented towards essential aspects, which can, and should, however be expanded in a holistic sense during rehabilitation. In this context, classic naturopathic techniques offer methods of treatment highly suitable in particular for geriatric patients with reduced general condition, methods that are readily accepted by them and available from the areas of kinesitherapy, hydrotherapy, phytotherapy, dietetics, and the restoration of harmonic life patterns and rhythms.","1412":"Although the medical doctor holds a central steering function in making rehabilitation referrals, hardly any empirically founded information is available on physicians' attitudes towards rehabilitation, their indication considerations and actual referral practice. Prompted essentially by this information deficit, an anonymous questionnaire study was undertaken with 49 rheumatologists concerning their knowledge and experience in rehabilitation, their views of various forms of rehabilitation (inpatient, partial-hospitalization, out-patient) as well as medical further education in rehabilitation subjects. Reflecting a positive basic view of rehabilitation, nearly half of the responding rheumatologists subjectively felt well-informed about rehabilitative issues, with 49% stating that they frequently recommended patients for rehabilitation. As far as preferences are concerned in terms of community vs. non-community rehabilitation concepts, priority is given by 39% to partial-hospitalization rehabilitation (\"most favourable\"); more than 75% of the interviewees however advocated case-by-case decision-making. Accordingly, only 18% consider ambulatory or day centre programmes true alternatives for inpatient rehabilitation, and 78% rather consider them complementary to each other. The advantage of partial-hospitalization rehabilitation close to the rehabilitee's place of living is seen above all in potential involvement of relatives and family doctor. Aspects stated in favour of non-community inpatient rehabilitation primarily are getting away from stressful family surroundings and the comprehensive medical programme available. A strong need for rehabilitation-related further education is expressed, with forms of rehabilitation, psychosocial rehabilitation, and access modes among the primary contents to be addressed.","1413":"Dermatological climatotherapy is used in the treatment of chronic and chronically relapsing long-term dermatoses, such as, especially, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, complementing the dermatological therapies applied at the patient's place of living. It is a classical dermatological in-clinic therapy carried through in specific rough and stimulating climate areas of proven therapeutic benefit, primarily the North Sea climate and certain alpine locations over 1 500 m above sea-level, like especially in the high mountain valley of Davos, Switzerland. Dermatological climatotherapy is a well-tried therapeutic agent which, in comparison to the dermatological therapies applied at home, as a rule has fewer side effects as well as, above all, an additional long-lasting time effect. The latter is of particular importance regarding chronical diseases and cannot be achieved by other therapies. Dermatological climatotherapy, hence, represents an all-entailing therapy form and moreover is the most comprehensive therapy anyway. Dermatological climatotherapy can only be performed in rough and stimulating climate zones with additional special insolation, thermichygric and defined aerosol conditions. On the one hand, the organism is stabilized general by those climatic conditions, and, on the other, the constitutionally damaged skin is affected positively by the direct influence of climate factors. As every climate has its specific overall effect, the therapeutical immediate and long-term effects of a climate have to be proven scientifically by follow-up studies.","1414":"In this article a review is given of the neuropedagogical aspects of children with acquired head injury (cerebral concussion). For this purpose attention has been paid to a study of the literature in the period 1970-1991. The attention has been focused on the most frequently occurring disorders such as cognitive and other neuropsychological disorders, behavior disorders and the post-traumatic syndrome. It appeared that the views about the origin of the disorders are very diverse. This applies in particular to cognitive and other neuropsychological disorders and behavior disorders. A consensus for the existence of a post-traumatic syndrome has not been found.","1415":null,"1416":"Elaborated by the project subgroup for \"Neurological Rehabilitation\" of the Federation of German Pension Insurance Institutes, the phase model presented describes the phases of neurological care and rehabilitation for patients with neurological conditions (notably stroke, craniocerebral trauma, and multiple sclerosis). It deals with acute and intensive care, inpatient medical rehabilitation, as well as the phase of aftercare and the care\/rehabilitation phase where long-term support, attendant and\/or maintenance measures are required (outpatient or partial-hospitalization medical rehabilitation modalities are not included as yet). Based on patient characteristics, care and rehabilitation goals are specified along with the care and rehabilitation tasks that can be derived from these, with great diversity of individual management course being possible.","1417":"The EAM profile system is characterized by enabling comparison of a subject's abilities with the requirements present on the job. The article initially outlines the structure of the necessary abilities and\/or requirements profiles, describes the assessment criteria used, and concludes by presenting a case example, showing that the question of individual employability and placement can be answered by acting upon profile comparison findings.","1418":"The present study had been aimed at tracing possible reasons for insufficient placement of people with physical disablement in the open labour market in the Regensburg region, at gaining insights on the prerequisites of and potential for improving vocational integration as well as at clarifying the relevance of alternative work and employment opportunities in terms of halfway and sheltered settings. Based on a structured questioning schedule, interviews were carried out with 10 experts, 32 physically disabled individuals and 30 employers concerning their placement notions and experience. Generally speaking, it was in particular found that insufficient placement cannot simply be attributed to economic trends; the groups interviewed, rather, differ in some of their underlying assumptions and expectations, a fact which impacts negatively on the integration process. Interaction of disabled and nondisabled persons hence requires greater attention. For the disabled, along with their educational-occupational qualifications, acquisition of communication and social skills is crucial in vocational integration, whereas the companies, in particular small and medium-sized ones, are in need of better information and counselling as well as appropriate supports to be provided by job or placement assistants when hiring physically disabled persons.","1419":"The life situation of young people faced with severe consequences of their physical disablement is deteriorating due to general economic and worklife developments. Their right to occupational qualification is by no means universally honoured, and even those who have undergone vocational training find it increasingly hard to secure a job. This contribution therefore considers overall societal and economic conditions as well as trends forecast, discussing traditional and current views of successful life coping with or without remunerative work. Particular interest is taken in how disabled people themselves see their position in the working society. Problems of transition from school to post-school life settings are pointed out.","1420":"The authors report first results of a program evaluation (n = 560) in a psychoanalytically oriented psychosomatic clinic. Based on a naturalistic design, the study includes three points of measurement (beginning and end of treatment, 1-year follow-up) at which data were collected from patients and therapists. The article gives an overview of the general issues involved as well as of the methodological procedure and presents some catamnestic subjective and cost-relevant singular outcome criteria.","1421":"The Barthel Index has been shown to be a good measure of reduced activities of daily living which can be applied in routine clinical practice in a valid and reliable manner. However, patients with severe brain damage cannot be differentiated appropriately as floor effects show up with increasing severity of neurological impairment, e.g. in comatose and near- or post-comatose patients in early rehabilitation. Aspects of functional deficits relevant in early rehabilitation patients have been introduced to the Barthel Index in a separate section, the Early Reha Barthel Index (ERI). These aspects are: state requiring temporary intensive medical monitoring, tracheostoma requiring special treatment (suctioning), intermittent artificial respiration, confusional state requiring special care, behavioural disturbances requiring special care, swallowing disorders requiring special care, and severe communication deficits. Experience with the ERI gathered with 210 early rehabilitation patients and 312 patients with severe brain damage demonstrate that the extended scale permits differentiation of patients according to severity and to avoid floor effects. Patients can be allocated appropriately to different phases of rehabilitation, i.e., early rehabilitation of patients with very severe brain damage or rehabilitation of patients with severe brain damage. The ERI is quick, economical, and reliable. Given the high cost of early rehabilitation it is expected to be of special interest also to health care providers to ensure that the right patient is looked after in the right bed.","1422":"The paper describes in a very concise manner the importance of social policy in solving certain societal problems that are influenced on the one hand by ethical values and realpolitik power structures on the other. Social policy as a means of societal policy itself is not governed by ethical principles, it can however be used as a tool of transforming society. However, apart from the necessary political power, certain economic preconditions have to be fulfilled in order to realise sociopolitical ideas and a \"socially just\" distribution of the national income. Social measures thus are a compromise between societal policy and political and economic power, aimed at eliminating societal problems that have resulted, or could result, in political activities of individual groups. People with disabilities therefore should not be content with pointing out existing societal problems but should act as political pressure group in order to force solution of their problems.","1423":"","1424":"","1425":"Mutabor is an incorporated society offering intensive home treatment services for persons with acquired brain damage. While family respite is included, the intensive treatment provided is primarily focussed on transferring the potential acquired during clinical therapy into the patients' personal and occupational day-to-day life and\/or on building up new possibilities. Our treatment approach is aimed at enabling the patients to regain an individual and social identity while strengthening the patients' environment through respite care, counselling and ongoing therapeutic support. Mutabor works in close cooperation with medical doctors and therapists in the regional special clinics. Diagnosis and treatment however are weighted differently from what could usually be the case in a clinical setting; we rather undertake a highly individualized scrutiny of what would be practicable and desirable in a specific life situation. The cost is carried by the health insurance funds on a hourly or per diem basis. Our treatment concept is implemented by a team of 37 staff members from the fields of nursing, Occupational Therapy, logopedics\/speech education, kinesitherapy, music therapy, social education, administration.","1426":null,"1427":"Between June 1991 and June 1992, a total of 39 rehabilitees aged 16 to 25 years were examined, i.e., 21 patients suffering from spina bifida and 18 patients suffering from traumatic paraplegia. Diagnostic instruments used were the Freiburg questionnaire on coping with illness (FKV 102), Goldberg et al's questionnaire for the evaluation of subjective wellbeing regarding health, and a self-constructed questionnaire for evaluating satisfaction with rehabilitation. Medical interviews on the present state of health and the present situation were held with each patient. The level of paralysis was taken as an indicator of the motor handicap present. The patients examined showed distinctly less confidence in doctors than adults do. From a subjective point of view, however, the confidence in doctors was good: among the coping strategies chosen, the compliance strategies ranked first and second, respectively, in the two groups. The coping strategy of \"cognitive avoidance and dissimilation\" is distinctly less common among spina bifida patients than among patients with traumatic paraplegia. They are less inclined to hope for a miracle, and take their handicap much more seriously than adolescents suffering from traumatic paraplegia. The higher the level of paraplegia, the more use is made of the coping strategy of \"emotional control and social withdrawal\". Regressive tendencies and depressive modes of coping were equally present in both groups. When investigating satisfaction with rehabilitation and with the own person, both groups showed very high satisfaction with the physical independence achieved and the possibilities of acting independently.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1428":"","1429":"In the framework of a project of the Northrhine-Westfalian disabled sports association, 42 multihandicapped residents of the von Bodelschwinghschen Anstalten Bethel participated in a sports medical study, with usefulness and need for sports medical examination and consultation clearly confirmed. Spirometric testing procedures were shown to require review. Close cooperation among staff, coaches as well as sports medical specialists is indispensable for ensuring meaningful implementation of the results as well as enhanced health through physical activity and sports.","1430":"Presented are selected findings of a study of 62 patients who had participated in a four-week inpatient treatment programme in a health-resort rehabilitation clinic due to complaints of the locomotor organs. The patients' physical and general complaints showed statistically significant reductions in the course of this programme participation. Similar effects were stated as well for the majority of the scales pertaining to subjective health. A correlation between physical activity and subjective wellbeing, or physical complaints, respectively, has not been stated for all of the subjective health-related scales and complaints items. The improvements achieved can be considered proof of the effectiveness of the clinic's overall therapeutic concept as well as of the social relief afforded by the rehabilitation clinic setting.","1431":"Quality assurance is among the dictates of the hour and should, through integral feedback, lead to on-going methodical improvement. It must not be mistaken for merely comprising control measures decreed from higher up. The following is brought forward: 1. Humaneness must be the overruling principle. 2. The methodological specifics of the various disciplines and the needed range of methods on the one hand have to be accepted with all their complexities, yet on the other be tied into an appropriate quality assurance system with certain norms and standards. 3. We were able to develop the \"Barolin-Reha-Scale\", which has proved its efficiency in neuro-rehabilitation and has several advantages over the previously available scales. 4. In addition, on-going patient self-assessment must routinely be carried out, although we certainly are well aware of the many \"subjectivity factors\" involved. 5. The above can only come to bear if meaningful controls are permanently established in addition to the necessary motivational and organisational measures.","1432":"Only part of the invalidity pensioning courses seen can be traced to medically substantiated illness and disablement. Another part of these courses, with an extraordinarily high share in particular from the psychosomatic field, consists of a gradual psychosocial down-grading which, though possibly triggered by illness and disablement, essentially is enhanced, or countered, by specifies of individual personality, family, labour market, or medical doctors' behaviour. The matter dealt with only seems to be a dry one. The fates of those affected are oppressive, regardless of whether pensioning ensues or not. Frequently, the entire family is involved by the improvement taking place. At the same time, enormous spending accumulates due to the coverage provided by the statutory health and pension insurance schemes. It is therefore considered appropriate that an invalidity pensioning study be conducted specifically directed at pensioning behaviours, at clarifying the weight of the various factors involved and at investigating the effectiveness of rehabilitative instruments in the various phases. The findings should form the basis also for improved preventive approaches, such as energetic measures to combat meaningless certification of illness or \"parking-off\" of patients in long-term unemployment, while rehabilitative service provision is totally neglected.","1433":"This report presents a cross-sectional study of the patients in a psychosomatic clinic (n = 112). Possible predictors concerning psychotherapeutic cooperation of patients are presented and discussed. Negative predictors found were: The presence of two or more strictly somatic rehabilitation treatments in the past; a therapist rating of \"not capable of being motivated for psychotherapy\"; a pension application, or a degree of disability of 50 (\"severely disabled person\" status). A positive predictor for psychotherapy is a patient's previous experience with psychosomatic therapies. Some consequences are discussed concerning indication as well as client information, preparation of clients prior to clinical treatment, and cooperation with other institutions providing psychosocial services.","1434":"A protocol annexed to the Maastricht Treaty of 7 February 1992, the agreement on social policy is instrumental in upgrading European social policy and in making it an integral part of the policy of the European Union. It is on the one hand oriented toward appropriate provisions to protect workers in the various EU member countries against disadvantage arising from developments in the economic sector, but on the other also seeks to counter the high level of unemployment currently at hand by fostering concrete action. European social policy, hence, is emphasizing employment policy initiatives including action aimed at occupational and social integration of disabled people, such as the HELIOS II action programme or the \"Employment HORIZON\" Community initiative. The Commission's notions of European social policy development in the forthcoming 1995-1999 period have been presented in the White Paper \"European social policy, a way forward for the Union\". The proposals contained in this White Paper are to be embodied in 1995 in a work programme of the European Commission.","1435":"Presented is an instrument assessing functional independence in rehabilitation. This instrument, the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), was developed in the USA and translated into German. Considerable experience and research has accumulated concerning its application, formal properties and function in interdisciplinary rehabilitation. Application and evaluation of the FIM is demonstrated in a case study. The FIM is shown to be a reliable and highly informative instrument measuring disability according to ICIDH criteria in clinical practice. It reflects reliably the amount of help and assistance required by the individual patient.","1436":"","1437":"","1438":"","1439":"","1440":"The study presented had dealt with the potential of a stationary training car in assessing and improving the driving skills of patients having neurological disorders, with reaction testing and reaction training carried out by means of the training car. The aim had been to verify whether, and to what extent, such a device might contribute to driving fitness diagnosis and improvement. The sample was comprised of patients who, mostly following brain injury, participated in an in-patient rehabilitation programme. It was found that an individual's driving fitness cannot be diagnosed on the basis of laboratory testing alone. The deficits elicited by the tests have to be verified concerning their impact in real road traffic in every individual case, taking adaptive potential into account. In view of improved driving skills, the findings show performance improvements in various reaction tests as well as better driving sample ratings.","1441":"On the basis of the documented course of 83 in-patient rehabilitation procedures in 28 female and 55 male patients who had undergone total gastrectomy due to cancer of the stomach, \"objective\" and \"subjective\" data were analyzed and correlated within an integrative treatment concept in order for one, to obtain as rehabilitation-specific a description as possible of how patients cope with the conditions resulting from their illness, and for the other, to contribute to furthering a multidisciplinary treatment concept, uniting the medical and psychosocial lines of approach. \"Objective\" data, i.e., data based on therapist assessments, inter alia include laboratory and other measures, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions and their gradings, sociomedical and psychosocial parameters, Karnofsky index, as well as Edinburgh Rehabilitation Status scores, while \"subjective\" ones, i.e., data based on the patients' own estimates, included symptom scores and judgements relative to treatment course and the so-called therapeutic environment. Findings are presented in detail for both planes (i.e., \"objective\" and \"subjective\" parameters) and discussed in light of pertinent literature. In particular the \"missing\" (yet perhaps expected) correlations among these planes are considered indicative of an urgent need for inclusion of the patient's behaviour and experience in the rehabilitative-therapeutic process. The partially surprising gender differences found are discussed with a view to behavioural patterns that might be conducive to coping with the malignant disease and its sequelae, an integrative treatment approach found to be of utmost importance, in particular in terms of the (therapeutic) relationship with self and others.","1442":"Patients insured under the pension insurance scheme are subject to a statutory obligation to cooperate in their remedial treatment. In in-patient psychosomatic rehabilitation, a number of problems arise in view of this cooperation, as the patients are hampered in their potential for compliance with this demanded cooperation due to the specific nature of their psychosomatic condition, their personality structure as well as their previous disease history. Moreover, cooperation in psychosomatic rehabilitation involves special requirements in terms of active participation, inner openness and readiness for psychosocial change. In psychosomatic rehabilitation, the patient's cooperation cannot be assumed as a matter of course, rather, it is a task of the treatment process itself, which by appropriate therapeutic means seeks to achieve the patient's motivation and a working alliance, hence to create the prerequisites for cooperation.","1443":"The courses of 118 patients who had suffered a supratentorial ischaemic infarction were observed over a mean follow-up period of 4 years. One goal of this study was to assess the prognostic value of quantitative cranial computerized tomography (CT). The infarct volume was determined using CT and expressed quantitatively as a percentage of the total brain volume. The infarct volume correlated negatively with the global outcome as estimated by the Barthel Index. It correlated positively with the occurrence of psychiatric alterations, disturbances of consciousness or alterations in the EEG. Nicotine, alcohol consumption and hyperuricaemia were the most frequent risk factors identified for men, while for women, especially those over 60, cardiac diseases were the most relevant risk factors. In looking only at the older patients, age, psychiatric alterations and cardiac disease at the time of the stroke were unfavourable prognostic factors. CT lesions in the basal ganglia were also unfavourable prognostic factors. Infarcts in the posterior cerebral artery region were seen as prognostically favourable. During the 4-year follow-up period, the reinfarction rate was 26%. Nearly 50% of the total patient population died. This group was significantly older, had more psychiatric alterations as well as multiple infarct areas in CT.","1444":"A critical examination was carried out on 64 selected case histories of craniocerebral trauma patients, with extraction of as exact data as possible concerning each patient's disease course a difficulty. The majority of the patients severely injured, the study elicited problems during early rehabilitation and discusses the patients' outcomes in view of their vocational and social reintegration. Also dealt with are the problems met with relative to course observation and documentation. Later phases of rehabilitation frequently are complicated by functional loss and deficits, and long waiting lists run counter to the basic idea of early rehabilitation. Treatment shortcomings during the early phase of the acute neurological condition are indicative of the patients' future fate. Discussed is the relevance of rating scales for assessing the course of severe conditions. In view of an ongoing state-of-the-art discussion concerning the concept of neurological early rehabilitation in the narrower sense, a clearly structured treatment approach specifying minimum requirements in terms of staffing, contents, and methods, as well as systematic internal quality control efforts are demanded.","1445":"Trends in treatment of epilepsy in an institution for handicapped patients with epilepsy were investigated in a retrospective longitudinal study. Medications and seizure frequencies in the period 1971 to 1986 were compared in 663 patients living in the institution at least since 1971. The results show that the majority of patients were on polytherapy, being treated on average with 2.95 (1971) to 2.60 (1986) anticonvulsants. The use of phenytoin, primidone and the succinimides clearly declined; the use of phenobarbitol declined slightly. The use of carbamazepine and valproic acid and their mean doses increased. The mean serum concentration of most of the anticonvulsants studied tended to move into the \"therapeutic\" range. The primidone and phenytoin concentrations remained rather low. The frequency of seizures, in particular of grand mal seizures, decreased between 1971 and 1981; from 1981 to 1986, no clear trend could be established. The results are compared with those of studies carried out in various other countries. It is discussed whether special antiepileptic therapy is required for the treatment of handicapped patients.","1446":"","1447":"","1448":"","1449":"","1450":"","1451":"In the present study, a biomechanical in-vitro experimental design for assessing lumbar instability following discectomy had been complemented by computer simulation of the muscular influence. The most impressive changes of the instability parameters chosen, i.e., mobility (flexibility) and neutral zone, occurred in respect of the study movement directions Ty, Tz and Mx (lumbar disc height, anterior\/posterior dislocation, and flexion\/extension). The influence of the multifidus muscle had enabled the flexion\/extension neutral zone changes to be offset. Flexibility (+\/- Rx) was found to have been influenced to a minor degree.","1452":"Pressure distribution measurements have come into use in the 1930s. The technique started as a qualitative procedure, was developed to a semi-quantitative state and has recently attained a strongly quantitative status. An outline is given of the development of the technique, and the capacitive measuring procedure and its area of application are described. The article is focussed on the adaptation of seats for persons with multiple disability.","1453":"A total of 289 stroke patients over age 65 were followed-up 5 years post-discharge from in-patient rehabilitation. Predictors of the course following discharge are investigated and geriatric rehabilitation assessed based on data gathered during in-patient rehabilitation as well as follow-up findings. 40% of the patients were alive 5 years post-discharge; the average annual death rate of 14.6% had been three times higher than among a control group. 67% are living in their own home, 21% in a nursing facility, and 12% in a residence for the elderly; only 3 of the surviving patients had to move to a nursing home post discharge. The patients' independence had reduced by an average 5 points on the Barthel index. Negative predictors for survival had been the presence of cardiac disease, Diabetes mellitus, psycho-organic syndrome and depression at discharge. However, as is the case for age as such, these conditions do not affect survivors' functional outcomes. Two thirds of the patients consider their state of health as constant or improved; only one fifth were rated as having a poor quality of life. The data gathered for the follow-up patients show that geriatric stroke rehabilitation is worthwhile.","1454":"Presented are the rehabilitation outcomes of 134 former students of a special school for the visual impaired in terms of their familial situation and in environmental respects. In the presence of an otherwise satisfactory picture, development of an independent lifestyle seems to be hampered in one third of the interviewees by lack of an apartment of their own. Those concerned are single and live with their parents or in a residential setting, lacking the possibility for setting up house on their own notwithstanding favourable financial and occupational conditions (96% are working). Both insufficient support and a lack of personal initiative and self-assertion are considered contributive factors in these outcomes.","1455":"Among the patients referred for rehabilitation in the latter half of their working life, many are notable due to considerable discrepancies between their objectively ascertainable performance and its subjectively perceived decline. In these cases, the \"substantial threat to earning capacity\" cannot be explained by measurable organ deficiencies. Similarly, treatment efforts focussed solely at improved somatic functioning remain inefficient in terms of stabilization of earning capacity, because they do not bring about changes in the cause of subjective performance deterioration. The author in these circumstances assumes the presence of an independent syndrome, called \"psychosocial disintegration\". He describes the full picture of this disease entity, and suggests causal mechanisms as well as potential for remedial intervention. On account of the considerable social dimension of the disorder outlined, early identification of these gradually developing changes as well as qualified care of the insurants are indispensable. All those involved in treatment and care of the patients or working in some branch of the social security system should be familiar with this psychosocial disintegration syndrome in order to avoid the guidance and counselling mistakes that are frequently the case. As rehabilitation is impossible in case of inhibiting personal attitudes of an insurant, it is advisable to verify the individual's readiness for rehabilitation and\/or to strengthen it by appropriate measures before engaging in costly in-patient service provision. If the needed motivation is to be achieved during participation in a rehabilitation measure, extended service provision will invariably be required.","1456":"Presented are four instruments current in rehabilitation diagnostics. They are investigated concerning their usefulness and merit as well as their possibly specific approach, starting out from the World Health Organization's International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities, and Handicaps (ICIDH), which so far has hardly been commented on in the German-language area, with its effort of enabling severity-specific assessment of need and its extensive exposition on the part of the editor of \"problem awareness\" in relation to the subsequent planes of consideration. The EAM system is focussed on occupationally integrative, job-specific appraisal, attempting to implement standardized performance\/adaptation analysis. This is contrasted with the subjective criteria-based, very consistent IRES questionnaire, which however lacks objective severity appraisal. Additionally dealt with is the \"RPK\" procedure used in evaluating the rehabilitation of persons with chronic mental illness. Overall, it is found that each of the different instruments has its value and merits, although major aspects of rehabilitation and, above all, integration prognosis require differentiated, systemic appraisal and on-going rehabilitation-specific consideration. What is needed is \"understanding\" the nature of disease consequences at the different planes of experience.","1457":"Harmony, coordination and integration are among the factors that ensure continuity in rehabilitation. These fundamental principles are applicable across all social insurance branches, and have in many European countries also entered rehabilitation-related legal systems. In Germany, the lawmaker currently is undertaking an effort to incorporate the numerous rehabilitation-related provisions contained in the different insurance branches of the social security net in a single book of the German social code.","1458":null,"1459":"","1460":"Presented is a brief in-patient psychotherapy concept practiced in the framework of psychosomatic rehabilitation. The clinic's main focus is the treatment of patients with subjective health problems and disorders of the musculoskeletal system and sense organs (\"neuroorthopaedic psychosomatics\"). The conceptual development has been geared both to the specific requirements of the patient population and to the time-limiting and structural factors in psychosomatic rehabilitation. The structural conditions as well as the elements of the integrative therapy approach are set out, with group psychotherapy combining verbal and body-oriented therapy elements the central emphasis. The concept also accommodates the various stages of motivation among our patients. The entire range of supportive therapies, in particular physiotherapy, form an integral part of this concept. This integration of verbal and body-oriented therapy is hoped to enable the fragmentations and compartmentalizations, both with our patients and in the therapeutic team, to be overcome.","1461":"Described is the development of the intrapartnership dynamics in a case of home ventilation of a spouse having amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Led in a heated manner until recently, the ethical discussion on the pros and cons of long-term (home) ventilation could be greatly enriched by introducing relevant systemic views and reasoning. So far, however, there are no published observations in this field.","1462":"An interdisciplinary study was conducted to investigate the use of two reading machines placed at the disposal of visually handicapped individuals in a public location (Freiburg University Library). The machines were designed to translate written text into artificial speech or braille, as selected by the user. Two different configurations were tested, with data collection through interviews and systematic observation. The questions addressed were: whether machine improvement was necessary with respect to user friendliness, speech generalization, and text recognition; whether the machines, designed to be single-person workstations, would be accepted and shared in a public location; and whether it was possible to configure the machines to individuals with different baselines and needs. The results of this study were expected to aid decision-making regarding the suitability of the machines and their location, as well as the kind and extent of technical support needed. The invitation to participate in the study was taken up by 19 persons with visual handicap ranging from severe impairment to blindness. The two reading machines provided substantially increased literature access to users. One of the machines emerged as better suited for the university library setting. Regular assistance for users as well as clarification of organizational details proved necessary to guarantee productive and lasting usage of the machines.","1463":"Based on two self-developed questionnaires, 110 successfully rehabilitated geriatric amputees were examined relative to their motives for continuing to use their prostheses post discharge, or for giving them up in favour of a wheelchair, respectively. Of these 110 patients, 24 reported to be using wheelchairs, 16 said they are using both, and 70 claimed to be using their prostheses most of the time; it however appeared from the control questions as well as information given by relatives that only 53 of these 70 persons were actually using their prostheses most of the time. The main motive for continued use of the prostheses was the desire to be independent, hence to lead an active life; a second major motive was a perception of being full of energy and enterprise, notwithstanding the fact that their actual walking results had not improved but even deteriorated. Those who used wheelchairs did not abandon their learned ability to walk with prostheses because they felt too ill or too weak, but did so because the wheelchair enabled a more comfortable way of life.","1464":"Quality and quality assurance in health care have emerged as key issues on account of recent legislation in Germany. The discussion under way on the contents of quality and quality assurance, though, is turning out a diffuse to controversial process rather than a systematic one, all the more so as quality does not present itself as a static element but as a dynamic one that intertwines in a complex manner with systemic, action and personal aspects. A scenario is developed in light of these insights for the rehabilitation of elderly persons, designed, for one, to outline and systematize some of the complexities of the issue in the geriatric domain. Above all, however, it is posted as a baseline for further deliberations on the subject of quality and quality assurance in geriatric rehabilitation, and hence is designed, for the other, to sketch the necessary starting points for quality assurance measures in the context of a geriatric-rehabilitative infrastructure to be.","1465":"The therapeutic benefit of art therapy in rehabilitation differs from that of art in general in that the creative activity is viewed as a vehicle of remediation in the one case while, in the other, art is an end in itself. In the arts, being disabled may be brought to bear as a quality of the creative processes involved. In no other field have integration and equality of disabled people been realized more fully than in the artistic-cultural domain, while artistic achievements of disabled people, in turn, hold the potential for lasting impact on public awareness generally. Creation of a centre to provide professional training opportunities for persons with disabilities in the performing arts would be desirable. A national umbrella organization of groups and individuals active in the field of creativity, EUCREA-Deutschland is planning to step up its efforts in drawing attention to the importance of arts and culture for disabled people.","1466":"","1467":"Based on the aftercare scope of a neurosurgical clinic, the article reports on 147 brain injured patients of different age when the accident occurred. Issues discussed include disability severity and prognosis, problems of secondary abnormal behaviour, and longer-term occupational outcomes. 25% of the adult brain injured patients were working full-time six months after the accident, 34% worked part-time and received a disability pension, and 41% were disability pensioners without part-time job. The share of occupationally reintegrated persons is higher in the younger age group although they had sustained more serious cerebral injuries than older ones.","1468":"The prognosis following severe craniocerebral trauma is affected by a broad variety of factors. Based on an individual fate 11 years post craniocerebral trauma with persistent coma, some thoughts are presented concerning relevance of subjective and interpersonal factors for the patient's vital and social prognosis and discussed in light of the social energy concept posited by the Dynamic Psychiatry school.","1469":"Associations between somatic as well as, in particular, neurological diseases and suicidal acts are outlined, with studies of different diseases having shown that they represent only one factor in motivating the suicidal act. Biographical predispositions and stressful variables from the current social situation are always added. Depressive and organic brain syndromes that can often be found during neurological rehabilitation are discussed in their significance as risk factors for suicidal behavior, also seeking to identify distinct phases of the rehabilitation process afflicted with high suicide risk. An active and carefully directed approach to exploration as well as grasping the psychopathological symptomatology are fundamental elements in the assessment of suicide risk. In this respect, observations of the patient's behaviour and information obtained from relatives are of special importance in neurological rehabilitation clinics. The \"presuicidal syndrome\" (Ringel) continues to be of high clinical value in assessing the psychodynamics of the individual patient in his development towards the suicidal act. Reflections of suicidal tendencies in countertransference reactions and the communication pathology of suicidal behaviour are more recent aspects that enrich the assessment of suicide risk. Therapeutic management of suicidal patients can firstly be characterized by the principle of specific diagnosis and treatment of the underlying disease; this means that optimum medical care even has a suicide-preventive function. The other principle considers the establishment of a therapeutical relationship as a must, and some critical points in the personal contact with suicidal patients are dealt with in some detail. Especially in neurological rehabilitation clinics, custodial aspects must not be neglected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1470":"Based on the experience in a psychosomatic clinic, drug dependency problems among chronic pain patients are reported. The following three theses have evolved: 1. By far most important of all is the problem of tranquilizer abuse, which entails serious, and sometimes dramatic, withdrawal syndromes. An indication for continuous tranquilizer medication does not exist. 2. Compound preparations are problematical, in particular if they contain codeine. We frequently see abuse and even dependence. 3. Opium derivatives continue to be rarely prescribed in non-cancer chronic pain. Several instances of incorrect pain management have been found, such as prescription to substance abusers, on insufficient indication, or prescription on request instead of time-schedule therapy.","1471":"Gynaecological care is considered a necessary component in the rehabilitative management of paraplegic women, giving rise to a range of issues involving the quality of life of paraplegic patients. Partnership, marital problems, as well as sexual coping certainly play an essential role in this respect.","1472":"A total of 67 patients, both paraplegic and quadriplegic, had participated in a hippotherapy programme over a study period of almost 18 months, with positive effects found relative to spasticity, certain pain syndromes, as well as contraction syndromes associated with impaired joint mobility. Frequently the only effective measure at all, and moreover of astonishingly lasting effect, the spasticity-reducing treatment turned out especially beneficial. Along with these statistically supported findings, a number of associated effects were noted in the physiotherapy and, especially, the nursing sectors, with easier catheterization, more rhythmical bowel function, more balanced mood with improved sleep, and a generally increased openness and motivation. Hippotherapy has proven a valid method within a synergistic approach for comprehensive care in paraplegia.","1473":"More than 90% of diabetic patients with previous neuropathic foot ulcers will experience ulcer relapses within 48 months of follow-up. Custom-made cushioned footwear, according to observations in 217 patients at various centres, can prevent approximately 50% of ulcer relapses. However, the reports quoted lack some precision and clarity as to the etiology of the foot lesions taken into account, the time the footwear had been worn by the patients, the quality of the footwear, as well as the quality of simultaneous foot care, and the total observation period. Future long-term studies on the efficiency of footwear for diabetic patients are warranted, with better standardization. It is suggested that new technical equipment for computerized monitoring of in-shoe foot-pressures during gait should be used for quality control of the footwear of diabetic patients.","1474":"A total of 37 scoliotic patients (33 female, 4 male), aged 20-57 years, participated in a pre-\/post-interview study on the basis of the Frankfurt self-concept scales FSKN (Frankfurter Selbstkonzeptskalen; Deusinger 1986). The patients stayed at the Katharina Schroth Clinic for 4 to 6 weeks, with questionnaires to be filled in 1-2 days after admission (pre-interviewing) and 2 days before discharge (post-interviewing). The study findings indicated a positive impact of the in-patient treatment relative to a variety of patient self-concepts. This is clearly suggested by the self-ratings concerning: general coping ability; own sensitivity and mood; own self-assertion towards groups and significant others; perceived appreciation by others; feelings towards and relationship with others; general self-worth; and own ability to make contact and interact. The statistically significant changes in a positive direction found for 7 of 10 self-concept scales, are interpreted to the effect that the in-patient treatment on the whole has ushered in a process of emotional stabilization in the patients, which certainly would be considered an essential precondition for their continued capacity for work.","1475":"The case example presented outlines the efforts of a quadriplegic young man who has succeeded in finding himself an occupational basis through training as an expert in electronic desktop publishing (DTP). Due to his severe mobility handicaps, computerized workstations for DTP training had been put up both in the training company and in his own home. These Desktop Publishing systems enable even very severely disabled persons to perform at a par with non-disabled persons. If this adapted workplace is connected to a communication network, the work results need not be delivered materially to the place where they are needed or further worked on, but can be dispatched electronically to the addressee. Communication networks enable the disabled person to easily exchange data with other workstations, or, through the use of modems to access the public telephone system, to send messages from his private environment (e.g., for sending fax messages or placing information in his partners' electronic mailboxes).","1476":"The working programme of the Federal Rehabilitation Council includes the subject of reducing participation disincentives for women in the field of vocational rehabilitation. A working conference in 1990 had already dealt with this topic, and its findings were further scrutinized and substantiated in a second conference in 1993, in order to develop concepts more appropriate than hitherto to meeting the specific requirements present in women-oriented vocational rehabilitation measures. In-depth counselling and the possibility of pre-vocational orientation services were considered particularly important. Both concerning their range of occupational options and their timing as well as organizational specifics, the vocational rehabilitation programmes should to a greater extent be geared to the life situation and life planning of women. Consequently, the issue of community-based, and hence family-friendly, provision of vocational rehabilitation services is an increasing focus of discussion. Model projects have already been drafted or started relative to certain aspects in this field of women-focussed further development of vocational rehabilitation, but an overall concept capable of uniting the various approaches and requirements continues to be out of sight. A project group to help remedy this situation has hence been established by the Federal Rehabilitation Council.","1477":"The authors had interviewed 134 former students of the Thuringian low vision school, of Weimar, concerning the course and outcomes of their vocational training as well as their current occupational situation at the study time, i.e. May\/June 1990. The findings show a picture of largely successful vocational rehabilitation within the then-existing societal conditions.","1478":"Since the beginning of psychiatric reforms, all efforts for the chronically mentally ill have been directed toward a life in dignity in the community. Only in the eighties have such measures been integrated into the concept of psychiatric rehabilitation. In connection with the development of new rehabilitative strategies, this indicates a change in the attitudes toward mentally ill persons. The newly developed measures are directed toward the psychological impairment and the social disability. Today, the obstacles in psychiatric rehabilitation are based mainly on the discrimination against chronically mentally ill compared to physically disabled persons.","1479":"Both from a theoretical perspective and by means of several case examples, the article focuses on the issue of overcoming the disturbed pre-verbal communication behaviour presented by patients in the early stage following severe craniocerebral trauma. In patients with brain lesion, a pre-verbal, emotionally-focussed tonal language almost invariably is capable of reaching the still healthy sections of the person. Hence, it is possible for music therapy to both establish contact with the seemingly non-responsive patient and re-stimulate the person's fundamental communication competencies and experience at the emotional, social and cognitive levels.","1480":"It is pointed out in the initial theoretical considerations that comparatively few studies can be found in the pertinent literature that address the issue of younger non-disabled children's attitudes and behaviour toward children with physical disablement. The present study had comprised 23 second-year primary school-children (8 male, 15 female), age 7.6 to 8.6, from a community with a population of approx. 6000. At the time of our investigation, the subject of \"disability\" had not been explicitly dealt with at school, and the children moreover reported that they had not previously come into contact with disabled children either. The interviews were administered individually, using an interviewing structure of 19 questions pertaining to 7 different topics. Along with the findings for these 7 areas, the following can be summarized: The findings permit the conclusion that the majority of the children interviewed do not encounter disabled children in terms of an already manifest prejudiced behaviour. Restrictive opinions primarily have to do with functional limitations assumed to affect disabled children's abilities in play, are however unrelated to dimensions of the personality or a social behaviour that could entail rejection of the disabled child. On the other hand it was found that non-disabled children do anticipate the negative views held by others in their environment toward children with disabilities.","1481":"Selected findings are presented from an Emnid public opinion research institute study of n = 241 disabled competitive athletes. The majority of the interviewees engage in competitive sports for \"pleasure in achievement\", with their successes seen as confirmation of self and in turn entailing enhanced self-esteem and confidence in their own potential for achievement. On comparison with the performance of nondisabled competitive athletes, the majority of interviewees tend to consider their performance on a par. Disabled athletes hold the opinion that their public visibility constitutes a major contribution towards societal recognition of disabled persons. They hence also see themselves as widely accepted as competitive sportsmen\/-women by society at large. Also, their sporting successes contribute to a higher standing among their friends and acquaintances. The disabled sportsmen and -women do not anticipate any health hazards on account of their training and competition participation. The interview findings outlined are discussed in light of current knowledge and experience in the field of disabled competitive sports.","1482":"The Jugendwerk Gailingen's rehabilitees with severe craniocerebral trauma placed in open employment include some 10% who work in construction, electric and metal-working industry occupations involving exposure to fall hazards, as a rule having returned to their previous occupations or following vocational training. During their rehabilitation, specific considerations have to be taken into account due to this hazard, both relative to work characterization and to rehabilitee remaining abilities and vocational assessment. Initially, the risk of falling must be identified, with subsequent estimation whether continuation of the hazard-generating activity will presumably be possible and\/or justifiable. In the affirmative, this is followed by vocational assessment, which, beyond work tolerance and capacities, also deals with fall safety. The necessary strength, mobility, coordination, attention, concentration, and flexibility are assessed using the so-called Gailingen scaffold test. Although this test simulates but a fraction of possible work situations above ground and does look relatively harmless compared to real worklife, more than 100 rehabilitees have achieved successful, lasting integration in a variety of occupations which partly involve a rather high exposure to fall hazards, without any accidents having been reported at follow-up.","1483":"In the framework of a study on the rehabilitation needs in gastric and oesophageal cancer patients, 100 gastric and 100 oesophageal cancer patients were interviewed on their subjective emotional state and physical functioning. The potentially cured patients were admitted to our in-patient aftercare programme an average 9.5 months following primary treatment. Major psychological distress was reported by 69.5% of the patients. Brooding, unrest, nervousness, and insomnia were the most frequently named complaints in both groups. 93% reported physical limitations, and 80% felt their conditions of life more or less restricted by their disease. 50% of all patients reported lack of drive, 30% an inclination to withdraw and a basic attitude of resignation. No significant differences between gastric and oesophageal cancer patients were found concerning type and frequency of the complaint.","1484":"The Rehabilitation facilities for mentally ill and disabled (RPK) are designed to enable clients with chronic mental illness to (re)acquire the skills needed for their reintegration in occupational and\/or social respects. The peculiar feature of the RPKs is their holistic approach integrating medical-psychiatric care, vocational preparation and training services, as well as sociotherapeutic measures. Accompanying research findings clearly prove that, once they have gained a firm foothold in the RPK, the great majority of the rehabilitees will achieve successful and lasting rehabilitation. The medical phase is completed by some two thirds of the clients admitted. Drop-out usually occurs in the initial three months period. The medical phase is followed by medical-vocational services in approx. 60% of the rehabilitees, and the majority of these achieve successful reintegration, with a drop-out rate of 15-20% in this phase clearly below the rate during the medical service provision phase. RPKs operating along a cooperative model have proven their worth within a dense service provider network, while the advantages of the integrative model lie in its concentration of services under one roof. Recommendations given in particular pertain to simplification of admission procedures and to ensuring follow-up services after programme completion.","1485":"Young people with autistic syndrome or autistic traits have for some years also been included in vocational training centre programmes. The present study had been aimed at analyzing the experience gained during vocational rehabilitation service provision and at fathoming conditions for a successful training course and placement process. 10 centres reported their experience from vocational training of 29 autistic young people, with the following noted in conclusion: The vocational training centres primarily accept young people with qualified educational levels and moderate behavioural peculiarities. The training as a rule is completed successfully. During programme participation, however, considerable problems arise in acquiring social and communication skills as well as in cognitive respects. Notwithstanding successful training completion, only some 25% could be placed in appropriate employment in the general labour market. Communication problems, impact of vocational training centre infrastructure, supportive and follow-up services, preparation and follow-along of staff, as well as alternatives to current vocational education practices are discussed.","1486":"","1487":"","1488":null,"1489":"In this contribution the issue of professionalization is being discussed, mainly tailored to the field of vocational rehabilitation in Dutch Mental Health. Presented is an overview of existing routines frequently used in the methodical actions of industrial therapists and occupational therapists. Several important methodical suggestions for the concretization of a renewed concept of vocational rehabilitation were formulated. The last part of the contribution explores the key-question: \"Professionalization?\"","1490":"Starting out from the thesis that behaviour and felt experience, i.e., the patient's \"subjective world\", have considerable influence on chronic diseases and their consequences in the gastrointestinal field, a \"basic course documentation\"-based comparison has been carried out of the courses of 4-week in-patient rehabilitation programmes designed to increasingly incorporate interventions directed at this area; the study population had consisted of two groups of patients (n = 688 each) without any significant differences concerning age and sex distribution admitted during the summer terms of 1990 (Group A) and 1991 (Group B), respectively. This documentation (in DBASE IV format) compiles (anonymized) patient data at an \"objective\" level on the one hand, i.e. basic data (such as diagnoses, age, sex), results obtained by the Edinburgh Rehabilitation Status Scale (ERSS), risk behaviour, and scope of interventions both in the organ-medical and physical therapy fields and in the area of \"instruction, motivation, support, group work, and creativity\" (designed to achieve integration of behaviour and felt experience); on the other hand, at \"subjective level\", it comprises the patient's own judgements relative to the treatment regimen and its environment, with subsequent correlational analysis of the data obtained (using the SPSSPC statistical package). As had been expected, correlations have on the one hand been stated at the \"objective\" level between an increased share of more \"serious\" conditions (ICD) in 1990 as compared to 1991 and higher ERSS scores (i.e., increased impact of disease consequences), greater organ-medical care intensity, and frequency of incapacity for work; on the other hand, at \"subjective\" level, strong linkages were found among the item ratings for general sense of improvement, specific and general therapy, as well as so-called \"therapeutic environment\". When the two levels are linked, the sense of improvement, as expected, is found to correlate negatively with the ERSS, but positively with the scope of the interventions designed to foster integration of behaviour and felt experience. The judgements given for quality of care provided relative to the patient's self-reported primary disorder and for general medical care correlate positively both with the scope of diagnostic\/therapeutic organ-medical interventions and integration-focussed ones, which, at least from the patient's perspective, hence exercise an ascertainable, essential effect in the therapeutic setting of in-patient rehabilitation in gastrointestinal and metabolic diseases.","1491":"The concept of adaptation and quality of life has gained central importance in the research on chronically ill patients and their rehabilitation. This contribution examines the impact of psychological and behavioural factors on the quality of life and coping processes in two groups of chronically ill patients (i.e., n = 48 myocardial infarction survivors, and n = 48 patients with liver diseases). Coping responses and quality of life were measured using Janke et al.'s stress coping questionnaire SVF (1985), while other variables (psychosocial stress and social support) were determined by a variety of self-report data, test measures (von Zerssen's emotional state scale, 1976), as well as interview data, with repeat data compilation after three years (longitudinal study). Significant differences were found for each of the patient groups. Effectiveness of coping appeared to be negatively linked with frequent use of \"avoidance\", \"denial\", and \"resignation\" in patients with psychosocial strain and lack of information. The choice of coping strategy seems to be multi-determined and is related to illness state and sex, with changes occurring over time. The knowledge of coping strategy preferences is highly relevant for the relationship between physician and patient as well as for the process of rehabilitation.","1492":"Presented are the findings of a 5-year prospective study concerning residential rehabilitation of 53 subjects with chronic mental illness living in a differentiated system of complementary facilities and services. The focus had been the chronically ill patients' development and disease course, as reflected in their psychological wellbeing, work status, therapeutic requirements, social contacts, as well as periods of rehospitalization. At the end of the 5-year period, 50% of the subjects were living in sheltered communal groups, and some 25% fully on their own. Only 10 percent had returned to psychiatric hospitals as long-term patients. Vocational integration in the general labour market is only rarely achieved, but the work available in sheltered employment is suitable for 40%. All of the patients were in medical care after 5 years. Given a differentiated system of complementary support and services in the residential and vocational spheres, for medical care and leisure activities, persons with chronic mental illness, too, are able to live outside the psychiatric hospital, above all enjoying greater normality in their lifestyles as well as a higher degree of personal autonomy.","1493":"While specific methods from disabled and special education didactics are available for young people, pertinent didactical concepts and experience are lacking in case of adults, in particular for rehabilitees with chronic mental illness and brain damage. Further education schemes have hence been started in 1989 within the Federal working group of medical-vocational (phase II) facilities, focussing on appropriate learning strategies and on rooting them in the minds of educators and teachers. Oriented along the \"Berlin didactical model\", Stadler's approach is considered fundamental in developing a didactical concept for adults with disabilities. Practical suggestions and hints at existing, proven methodical strategies are used to help illustrate concrete possibilities for systematically gearing time-tested methodical strategies to disability-generated learning problems. An almost synchronous development, similar learning strategies are to be found in industrial and occupational didactics as well, under a \"holistic education\" and \"enhancement of key qualifications\" heading. Participant orientation as the fundamental principle of a \"disability-specific\" methodology, holistic didactic concepts, a fitting learning organization, application of project-, activity- and experience-based methods, fitting problem-solving techniques, as well as a reconsideration of current teaching principles, are in the foreground of the present contribution.","1494":null,"1495":null,"1496":"Starting out from a short description of typical life situations at stroke onset as well as a number of coping definitions, specific elements in stroke patients' disease experience are set out. Further, five typical intrapsychic reaction patterns during rehabilitation are outlined. Various variables relevant to the coping process are discussed in detail: somatic disease characteristics, personality traits and their impact on adaptability, previous crisis experience and coping strategies, social network, prognosis. Special attention is focussed on the significance of subjective perceptual, evaluation and interpretation processes. The implications specific disease symptoms (neuropsychological impairment, organic brain syndrome) may have for stroke patients' coping mechanisms are dealt with. By commenting on eight theses posited, psychotherapy specifies in stroke patients are described, emphasizing the need for careful diagnosis, also in view of somatic side effects of psychotherapeutic methods. A flexible approach is demanded, in line with each patient's capabilities. Highest initial priority is given to therapy elements that address basal human needs. With increasing recovery, a gradual transition from a verbal\/unblocking\/exercising methods to verbal\/conflict-oriented ones as well as from a more guiding\/supportive to an insight-oriented approach seems possible. The rank of behavioural therapy, psychoanalysis and group therapy is discussed in detail. Reasons are given for integration of system theory concepts, as well as constant availability of crisis intervention; participation in supervision activity is considered a must.","1497":"Set out and discussed are fundamental social-ethical issues in rehabilitation concerning the right to live, human dignity, personal growth, participation in working life, as well as recreation\/vacation main-streaming. The fundamental social-ethical position posited is one of acceptance of disability in every phase of human life, practically expressed in terms of trusting in the benefit of educational enhancement even in severe disability, as well as in assuming responsibility for disabled persons' living conditions.","1498":null,"1499":"Statistical data are set out describing the situation of persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) relative to early pensioning and vocational rehabilitation. Findings show that MS gives rise to extraordinarily early pensioning, also when compared to other conditions. From 1980-1990, a total of 14,811 persons with MS were pensioned prematurely; average age at the time, in 1990, was 44.2 years for men and 41.1 years for women with MS. The number of temporary disability pensions has been decreasing since 1985. Vocational rehabilitation (VR) services are relatively rarely provided in MS; in 1990, a total of 626 rehabilitees with MS were registered at the Federal Employment Institute. The majority of VR benefits provided to persons with MS concentrated on mobility allowances to facilitate placement or continued employment. Concluding, the findings are discussed, also touching on the possibilities for persons with MS being paid greater attention concerning VR service provision.","1500":"The burden facing family caregivers increases when dementia in aged persons progresses. The Dreycedern project therefore offers direct and indirect respite services, with the demented patients staying at the Dreycedern facility for one or two days a week. The care given by the facility provides family caregivers with direct relief and is aimed at activating the patient's remaining physical and mental abilities. Indirect respite takes the form of caregiver counselling and participation in a self-help group. The accompanying field study primarily focusses on the effects on the respite provided on \"family caregiver burden\", as well as on the impact of the activating care given to the demented persons concern-ing their mental status and greater independence, or otherwise, in day-to-day activities.","1501":"Adults with autistic syndrome are at risk of exclusion not only from the general labour market but also from sheltered employment, i.e. the workshops for the disabled. The present study was aimed at eliciting the causes of potential exclusion as well as conditions for successful vocational rehabilitation. An inquiry into the services provided to, and individual development of, 40 employees in 12 workshops revealed that only part of the subjects seemed firmly settled in the workshops. A large number is judged negatively not only due to poor productive performance but on account of behavioural peculiarities typical of autism, with some of them having been referred back to the workshop's entry training sections, thus loosing their entitlement to social insurance coverage. It was found in this study that the behaviour of autistic employees frequently resulted from adverse conditions of the workshop environment. Major improvements in this population's vocational rehabilitation outlook could be achieved by extended service provision and training at entry; reduced group size; formulation of individual service plans; providing relief as well as supervision to workshop staff; internal differentiation of workshop production sectors according to therapeutic criteria; careful selection of suitable tasks; as well as autistic employee enhancement through social-educational services.","1502":"The present study was carried out on an unselected population of 107 myocardial infarction patients admitted for immediate post-acute rehabilitation. The patients were assessed (a) at discharge from multidimensional in-patient treatment, and (b) after a period of 12 months back home. Our aim had been to trace those psychological and general cardiological parameters that contribute to a patient's reintegration into work life as well as improved quality of life. It was found that patients with good physical coping did not suffer a reinfarction in the subsequent twelve months period. Younger or middle-age, male patients significantly more often returned to work. Remarkably, no correlation was found between good psychological coping with the infarction and return to work. As had been expected, a higher quality of life was achieved by those patients whose psychological status is only slightly impaired, who do not attach too great importance to their job, and who reported good physical coping as well as social reintegration and successful adjustment in their lifestyle.","1503":"Since the late 60s, reality-oriented books for children and young people have increasingly turned to subject-matters and issues involving social\/societal criticism, among them the theme of \"being disabled\". In the discussion on the degree to which media, and books in particular, do affect children's attitudes and socialization, it has been underlined that media take effect in the development of specific attitudinal patterns and behavioural dispositions in those cases where the recipient has not already formed a \"completed\" opinion of the topic at hand. This in particular is true in children of primary school age, and above all relates to their view of the disabled person. Six selected children's books were reviewed critically, based on a catalogue of criteria permitting coverage of as wide as spectrum as possible of \"physical disability\" and allied subjects. Summarizing, it is noted that the books reviewed do give children the opportunity, and partly in an excellent manner, of gaining insights into the situation of disabled persons. The potential for didactical treatment in primary classrooms is pointed out.","1504":"","1505":"The sociomedical statements given on the basis of Sociomedical Clinic apraisement of 103 patients were compared with those rendered at discharge from previous in-patient rehabilitation. Discrepant judgements and evaluation problems in describing functional capacity at work are pointed out, and their causes discussed. Proposals are submitted for enhancing more effective cooperation between rehabilitation clinics and the Sociomedical Services of the pension insurance administrations.","1506":"Rehabilitation in Germany falls within the purview of the various branches of the social security and public welfare system, a decentralized approach which has stood the test of time. Notwithstanding, deficits exist primarily due to a lack of up-to-date intersectoral alignment a shortcoming to be remedied by comprising rehabilitation in a separate book of the Social Code. The various social security schemes responsible for rehabilitation are attaching much importance in this context to the linkages with their specific fields of competence as well as their programming latitude being maintained. The demands to be made from an overall perspective relative to a \"rehabilitation\" book are set out inter alia on the example of social assistance and youth services, on terminological issues, benefit scope, needs coverage, rehabilitation principles and procedures, as well as on cooperation aspects, also clarifying differing views among the branches of our social security and welfare system. A Social Code book on \"rehabilitation\" should essentially be aimed at focussing the variety of rehabilitative measures in terms of a holistic rehabilitation approach, i.e., to respond to the person's overall needs by overall service provision.","1507":"Social-psychological aspects and rehabilitation after liver transplantation were examined in 21 patients. One-year survival was not different in patients with alcoholic liver disease compared with patients with other end-stage liver disease (65% vs 71%). After liver transplantation a temporary return to alcohol drinking was observed in 3 patients (14%). 52% of patients transplanted for alcoholic liver disease are occupationally rehabilitated. Social-psychological conflicts were reported by 46%. Patients with alcoholic liver disease are potential candidates for hepatic transplantation.","1508":"This article examines the \"supported employment\" approach, which tries systematically to integrate severely disabled men and women into the open labour market. After describing the target population, we shall outline the specific support required, along with the benefits, risks and problems involved. Examples from a few industrialized countries, demonstrating the viability of training and employing severely disabled people, will illustrate the new approach. The activities described in this article are inn line with the goals of the ILO Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (Disabled Persons) Recommendation, 1983 (No. 168), which calls for \"research and the possible application of its results to various types of disability in order to further the participation of disabled persons in ordinary working life\".","1509":"Many patients with urological carcinomas feel able, and indeed are able, to return to work after medical treatment. From a medical, psychological and socioeconomic point of view, routine pensioning must nowadays be rejected. Vocational reintegration is prepared in an individual and comprehensive manner in facilities for medical-vocational rehabilitation (phase II). The indication for vocational rehabilitation measures depends on the prognosis, on age and motivation, as well as on treatment aftereffects. The implications of operative, radiation and chemotherapy for the timing and course of the rehabilitation measures are set out, tumour- and treatment-related restrictions in future working life are discussed from an occupational medical view. Special emphasis is placed on carcinomas that should give rise to very early initiation of vocational rehabilitation services.","1510":"In 1988, the Frankfort on Main Vocational Retraining Centre had decided in favour of increased, on-going admission of psychiatrically disabled adults, offering opportunities for their vocational education. The centre's objective is to enable psychiatrically disabled rehabilitees to successfully complete formal occupational training in as \"normal\" a setting as possible. This means: the Centre is a vocational rehabilitation facility, and is not directed at therapy or care. Psychiatrically disabled rehabilitees are accepted for up to 10 percent of available places in the various programme types. The overall objective is formal occupational qualification. A \"training centre\" open to all training orientations has been established for individualized service provision in the event of crisis situations during programme participation. Special attention is focussed on intensive, continuous further education of staff, inter alia by group supervision.","1511":"In recent years, work and occupational activity have come to assume a therapeutic orientation in the rehabilitation of persons with mental illness. The study presented addressed the specific ways in which work activities during rehabilitation programme participation may act in a manner conducive to rehabilitation. The findings point to a positive relationship between the opportunities objectively available in the work setting for rehabilitees to influence aversive conditions or occurrences and their work-related subjective well-being. A second step enabled us to show that subjective well-being is determined less by the situation objectively at hand but primarily by the mentally ill rehabilitees' perceptions of influenceability and, hence, the experience of controllability. Further, examination of the rehabilitees' attributional patterns concerning the various control experiences revealed that the extent to which their subjective well-being is affected is mediated cognitively. The findings are discussed in view of their implications for the vocational rehabilitation of persons with mental illness.","1512":"","1513":"","1514":"","1515":"Using an ABAB single case design, the effects of a combination therapy (phase A) of computer-assisted attention retraining and Progressive Relaxation (PR) are examined in comparison to those of condition B in which short breaks are used instead of PR. The patient was a 57 year-old man with specific attention deficits following spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage (without operation). In both conditions, A and B, the patient ran through three therapy sessions of 45 minutes duration in the course of three days, with 6 minutes of attention retraining alternating with 6 minutes of PR or break, respectively. The results revealed that a) in comparison to the baseline (attention retraining without PR or break), both conditions, A and B, enabled the patient to cope effectively with the 45 minute training sessions without significant increase of complaints (muscular tension, excitement); b) attentional performance (complete test d2) raised up to the average over the whole ABAB experiment; c) attentional performance (tested before and after each phase with a third part of test d2) decreased under the break condition during the individual sessions, while it was unchanged under PR; d) attentional performance at the computer retraining programme (\"Bild\" by Rigling) partially increased under PR and slightly decreased under break condition; e) there was less excitement and less muscular tension under PR in comparison to the break condition; and f) pain in the joints and exhaustion (both measured with the GBB) were reduced significantly under PR, as opposed to a marked increased in the break condition.","1516":"Notwithstanding considerable success, the concepts currently applied by vocational rehabilitation workshops for persons with chronic mental illness are deemed open to criticism in some respects. Presented is the PASS programme, developed on the basis of more than two decades of experience with the clinic's own rehabilitation workshop. The greater part of the five-phase programme no longer occurs within the workshop but is spent at training workplaces with regional firms. A mobile rehabilitation team does not only support the patients at their training facilities but also their colleagues and immediate superiors, who have been prepared for their forthcoming tasks by psychoeducational information meetings. These community-based, ecological system-related aspects of the programme are complemented by repetitive social skills training and group work with relatives. Assessments carried out in each phase provide important decision-making data for programme development and render its scientific evaluation possible. Our experience so far demonstrates the possibility of recruiting enterprises to provide training places.","1517":"After a short summary of the state of research on problems of work performance and job strains of psychiatric patients, a pilot study in job and task analysis is presented which examines job strains and impairment of work performance of psychiatric patients in various vocational rehabilitation facilities, based on the interactive theory of subjective job analysis. Together with semi-structured interviews and self-developed rating scales for measuring impairment of work performance, standardized questionnaires in job analysis (SAA, Martin et al. 1980; ABB, Neuberger &amp; Allerbeck 1978) are used. On comparison of the patients in the various rehabilitation facilities, differences in work performance and appraisal of job strains and work conditions were found. By discriminant analysis two types of facilities could be differentiated especially by features like work performance and prehospital vocational integration. The results of multiple regression analysis show that the impairment of work performance is influenced in particular by previous vocational integration and by the patients' appraisal of future vocational perspective. The results are discussed in comparison with other research studies in psychiatric rehabilitation. Further studies are suggested, inter alia, to record the present psychiatric state in a systematic manner and to include long-term criteria for success in vocational rehabilitation.","1518":"The evaluation of a greater number of patients with traumatic paraplegia and tetraplegia showed more than 20% of associated injuries of the upper limbs. In view of the fact that arms and shoulders of the paraplegic person take over a decisive weight-bearing function, we were interested in the effects of these special injuries on rehabilitation outcome. Injuries of the distal arm were found to have more serious repercussions for achievement of the rehabilitation aim than the relatively more impressing injuries of the shoulder girdle and the upper arm. Serious limitations were found in the range of motion of the affected joints. Compensation was due only to the skill of the paraplegics in dealing with these deficits in motion and in using the uninjured extremity. This is the main reason why the functional deficits in independence were relatively minor.","1519":"The rehabilitation of patients who have to be operated on because of severe craniocerebral trauma and in whom the roof of the cranium must be removed because of severe post-traumatic cerebral oedema, is extremely difficult. The slow rehabilitation and recovery of these patients, who also show psychological changes in most cases, must be attributed to the pathological intracranial conditions which have arisen in consequence of large defects in cranial bones. A causal correlation between severe pathological intracranial conditions, which have arisen not only from trauma but also from bone flap decompressions, and protracted postoperative recovery and difficult rehabilitation has only recently been established. Our experience has shown that rapid rehabilitation of the injured person can only be expected after skullcap reconstruction and normalization of intracranial conditions.","1520":"The majority of patients with severe craniocerebral damage can be enabled to return to a relatively independent life if early rehabilitation measures are provided. The number of beds currently available for early rehabilitation, however, covers little more than 10 percent of the demand at hand. Expanding the number of beds available hence is a pressing need. The present article contains pertinent information in view of qualitative and quantitative implementation of related efforts.","1521":"In January 1991, the Government coalition parties agreed that the existing rehabilitation and severely disabled persons legislation should be rearranged in a distinct manner and integrated in the German Social Code as Book IX--Integration of disabled persons. This forthcoming codification moreover is intended as an opportunity for introducing appropriate adjustments and amendments, as well as for considering the possibilities for limited material reform. The Federal Rehabilitation Council has submitted a number of proposals to the Federal government aimed at settling various intersectoral aspects of rehabilitation legislation in the forthcoming Book IX.","1522":"A six-months sports programme had been implemented to analyze the impact of movement, play and sports on the physical situation of persons having rheumatism, their mental well-being and attitudes towards sporting activities. 41 patients participated in the programme, attending training sessions in a fitness studio once a week. The sports programme contained general endurance training, functional and strengthening exercises, elements of gymnastics and play, as well as relaxation techniques. The following assessment tools were used: Measurement of Patient Outcome (MOPO) scales, sports questionnaire, and the STEP test. It was found that participants' health status, both physical and mental, had been influenced in a positive manner, with proof being provided of reduced levels of anxiety, depression, and pain. Moreover, attitudinal changes toward sports appear to have resulted, suggesting persistent motivation to engage in sporting activity.","1523":"A cohort of psychiatrically disabled persons was investigated to determine whether work performance changed after entry into a residential commune. Both before and after entering the commune, a differentiated spectrum of work opportunities graded according to performance requirements had been available. A clear enhancement of work performance was found following entry into the residential commune. In a further step, variables associated with above- or below-average increases in work performance were identified. On the whole, the results underscore the value of residential communes in the vocational rehabilitation of psychiatrically disabled persons.","1524":"Major structural labour market changes, i.e. dramatic losses in job opportunities for unskilled labour and continually rising levels of job requirements facing skilled workers on the one hand and an increasing demand for skilled workers on the other, are entailing enhanced job opportunities for disadvantaged societal groups, at the same time however also increasing the occupational risk of these populations, among them the learning disabled. The vocational training centres having for more than a decade been gaining experience in the vocational and social rehabilitation of this latter group, the project outlined is intended to make even better use of their potential. The main objectives of the project are: 1. optimizing the vocational training centres' range of placement-focussed measures by: intensifying industrial training periods, coordinated \"start up\" support on occupational entry, post-placement services; 2. transfer of the vocational training centres' technical knowledge and experience into industry-based training by: follow-along support services (\"ausbildungsbegleitende Hilfen\"), workshops on the initial vocational training of learning disabled young adults, and other forms of cooperation. Apart from reaching the goals outlined, the project is expected to give new impulse to the day-to-day practice of the vocational training centres as well as to generate even greater networking of the centres with their industrial environments.","1525":"Starting out from the 10th World Congress of the International Society for Rehabilitation of the Disabled, held 1966 in Wiesbaden on the subject of \"Industrial Society and Rehabilitation\", social-legislational developments are out-lined, among them the 1971 accident insurance coverage for pupils, the 1974 rehabilitation harmonization act, and the 1975 extension of social insurance coverage to disabled persons working in workshops for the disabled; problems yet unsolved in the structured system of social protection are pointed out. The problem of \"early rehabilitation\", still to a very great extent unresolved, is dealt with in the context of the present distinction between \"acute medicine\" und \"rehabilitation\" facilities. In rehabilitation of persons with chronic mental illness, numerous models have been developed; a generally accepted, and available approach however has not emerged so far. For ensuring care quality and continuity, the urgent need for community-based availability of the \"rehabilitation team\" is underlined, and interdisciplinary further education efforts are demanded for all professions in the team, both in facility- and community-based service delivery.","1526":"Uncertainty as to what exactly is comprised by disability is quite frequently encountered not only in the general public but also among rehabilitation workers. The \"normal\" is deemed the desirable, and \"disability\" turns into its negative counterpart. Attention is focussing on the deficits that appear on measuring and comparing. A critical discussion of deficit orientation in education and care of disabled persons is needed. Isolated identification of and attendance to deviations must be overcome by interdisciplinarity and team work, in order to pay due respect to the person as a whole, to his or her social and personal identity. Also, fundamental issues of the current ethics discussion in special education arise in this context. Shown on the example of J. J. Rousseau, reference to philosophical or educational \"authorities\" may turn out to be misguided.","1527":"Any person threatened by the onset of disability has a right to the assistance needed to integrate in work, career, and society (section 10, Book 1 of the Social Code). A highly sophisticated system of legal provisions and pursuant administrative competencies, eligibility requirements and benefit provision modalities seeks to fulfill this entitlement. The system of available services is subject to on-going development, with adjustments necessary in response both to medical advances and labour market or technological developments. The adjustment process is limited by the economic resources available, which may restrict the scope of what is considered feasible regardless of what might be possible or desirable. To avoid becoming entangled in the \"jungle\" of its own system of competencies and eligibilities, a rehabilitee-centred rehabilitation approach must seek to make even better use of the manifold opportunities of rehabilitation legislation in light of the individual case at hand and based on professional cooperation. Any further development of rehabilitation legislation will moreover have to pay attention to those persons for whom occupational integration is no longer, or not yet, possible, in order to face up to future social challenges.","1528":"The concept of rehabilitation initially is defined as it is understood in the Federal Republic of Germany today. The potential opportunities and risks inherent in an outcome-oriented notion of rehabilitation are set out in light of its historical development. The reasons for unemployment among severely disabled persons are analyzed from various perspectives, dealing furthermore with the manner the vocational rehabilitation system is responding. Also mentioned are the difficulties where our system is working only to a limited degree, as well as the consequences this entails. Further, reasons are given to substantiate that the rehabilitation of severely disabled people remains an important and meaningful task in our country notwithstanding current unemployment.","1529":"Both from a personal and professional perspective, considerations are presented concerning the domiciliary-familial rehabilitation of persons with spinal cord injury. The field of tension present within the living community affected by the disability (parents\/children, partners, children\/parents) is examined, the various specific strains, physical, mental, social-societal, are outlined. The problems entailed as regards autonomy\/dependence, intimateness\/distantness, lover, mother\/father, and avoiding\/facing conflict, are analyzed, and possible solutions suggested.","1530":"Rehabilitation is a process intended to lead from disablement to enablement. This process must begin at the very onset of an impairment, with close cooperation of the rehabilitee with all the specialties involved, as well as among these specialties, being an indispensable prerequisite. Clinical psychology is one of these specialties, its primary emphases are diagnostics, counselling, therapy, research, staff training and further education, as well as organizational, operational and institutional counselling. To take part in shaping a more humane world is a task of psychology in research, theory, and practice.","1531":"In the 60s, Occupational Therapy (OT) with spinal cord injured patients had primarily been based on manual activities, aimed at improving functional levels. Gradually, attainment of the highest possible level of independence became a central emphasis of OT care. While creative development of the patient seemed to conflict with this foremost objective of independence, practical experience in the meantime has taught that creative activity can be an avenue toward independence. Also, the OT regimen for SCI patients has for several years now been extended to include computer-based technology for functional treatment as well as prevocational measures.","1532":"Described is the position of physiotherapy in the rehabilitation of persons with spinal cord injury, starting out on the assumption that physiotherapy lays the foundations for functional rehabilitation, enabling the other disciplines to build up on. Ideally, the treatment approach is not confined to a single concept, but several treatment modalities should equally be available. Physiotherapy must be integrated into the overall team approach. This can only be achieved on the basis of mutual respect, as well as physiotherapy staff continuity which enables broad knowledge and experience to be built by physiotherapists.","1533":"Based on her own experience in the rehabilitation of spinal cord injured patients, the author describes the nursing service's self-concept and its development over the past 25 years, as well as changes in its working conditions inter alia entailed by technical advances. Requirements are posited, which are considered indispensable for comprehensive rehabilitation, specifically with regard to the aftercare necessary for the person with SCI in the domiciliary situation.","1534":"While preservation of renal function continues to be the primary objective in the urological care of spinal cord injured patients, new treatment principles have resulted in increased attention being given also to restoration of lost urinary continence, a goal shared by the patient as well. The fact that intermittent catheterization has stood the test also for the long-term management of micturition, as well as the development of effective medication for hyperreflective detrusor relaxation have resulted in a treatment concept that enables 70 percent of those treated to achieve dry intervals between catheterizations. Effective electromiction is today enabled by the sacral anterior root stimulator (Brindley), with continence ensured by sacral deafferentation performed at the same time; both measures have proved successful at medium term. Bladder augmentation is another operative measure for controlling detrusor hyperreflexia. Neurogenic urinary stress incontinence can be tackled successfully by implanting an hydraulic sphincter system (Scott). Both the advantages and the possible disadvantages or risks of these new management concepts are set out, dealing also with their indications. Successful treatment of erectile dysfunction is possible today, and inseminable sperma can be obtained in some 40 to 50 percent of the spinal cord injured patients.","1535":"The focus of Guttmann's treatment concept had been to set up a comprehensive rehabilitation system, aimed not only at saving the life of a person with paraplegia or tetraplegia but at giving it meaning as well. Progress made in the fields of rescue services, anaesthesia, intensive medicine, in spinal surgery, neurourology and diagnostics (CT, MRI) as well as in pharmacology, have decisively enhanced the possibilities of clinical rehabilitation, and have in some respects entailed deviations from Guttmann's classical treatment principles. Moreover, the patient population has changed in profile in the course of time, due to better chances of survival also in high-level tetraplegia, greater numbers of higher-age SCI patients and of patients with non-traumatic SCI (tumours, metastases, infections). A higher life expectancy achieved by better possibilities as regards prevention and treatment of SCI-related complications, new challenges for the future emanate from age-related diseases occurring in addition to the spinal lesion.","1536":"In the framework of a commemorative gathering and scientific symposium in November 1991, an account was given of the 25 years of service of the Rehabilitation Centre for Spinal Cord Injured Persons of the Heidelberg Orthopaedic University Hospital Foundation. Tribute was at the same time paid to the lifework of Kurt Lindemann, former director of the Orthopaedical University Hospital and rector magnificus of the Heidelberg Ruperto Carola University, in memory of the 25th anniversary of his death in 1966. Encouraged by the father of SCI rehabilitation Sir Ludwig Guttmann, of Stoke Mandevillehospital, England, Kurt Lindemann had taken the initiative for establishing this centre and prepared its opening in 1966. Comprising a clinical department, the Ludwig Guttmann House, and a department for vocational-social rehabilitation, the Kurt Lindemann House, the centre has since enabled provision of all measures required for comprehensive rehabilitation of spinal cord injured women, men and children--starting at the day of injury till full resettlement of this population in family, occupation, and society. Erected a quarter century ago, the centre has in the last two years been brought up to date architecturally and structurally; further measures for implementing the most recent state of the art in rehabilitating spinal cord injured patients lie ahead.","1537":"","1538":"In ten patients with schizophrenic psychosis and ten patients with multiple sclerosis, the coping and compensation strategies were examined by means of semistructured interviewing. The following categories were considered: 1. avoidance; 2. habituation and\/or adaptation to the disease; 3. efforts to compensate the deficits by will-power; 4. efforts to train certain types of behaviour; 5. self-treatment; 6. disease awareness and insight. Examples for these categories are given for both groups of patients. There is a surprising similarity in the statements made by the schizophrenic patients and those with multiple sclerosis. All of the patients with multiple sclerosis had developed coping strategies against psychological symptoms. It is suggested that the neuropsychological deficits in multiple sclerosis resemble the symptoms of reduced energetic potential observed in schizophrenia. In both groups efforts should be made to activate the compensation strategies by adequate training procedures.","1539":null,"1540":"Walking is one of those major everyday functions therapeutic efforts in disabled persons are aimed at, in order to maintain, or improve, their mobility. A six-months intensive sports and movement therapy programme for cerebral palsied children serves to set out the potential of comprehensive gait analysis in assessing treatment effectiveness, and to present pertinent parameters for assessment. Following therapy, positive modifications of the gait pattern were found using a variety of kinematic and dynamic indicators. Moreover discussed and dealt with in some depth are the gait analysis requirements in view of assessing treatment programme effectiveness as well as comprehensive documentation of individual gait patterns. Along with the kinemetric procedures, it is in particular the dynamometric measuring methods which are outstanding in these respects, as they demonstrate very great exactness of measurement and register numerous parameters at the same time, with the data being available relatively rapidly.","1541":"","1542":"On the basis of observations of the course taken by 5 patients with so-called Locked-in Syndrome (LIS), the level of functional performance that can be achieved by long-term rehabilitation notwithstanding very severe initial symptoms is set out. The priority measures in the early phases of the condition and the particular problems of long-term rehabilitation are summarized in a checklist. Technical aids to ameliorate communication are dealt with in some detail. Special importance is attributed to patient-centered psychotherapeutic support and to family involvement.","1543":"A catalogue of psychological items has been developed that enables any disabled person's job-related abilities as well as the psychological requirements of any job to be assessed. With this newly developed instrument, ability profiles of slow learners and of non-disabled persons have been drawn up. Structural analysis of these data show specific differences in the ability structure of the two groups. The results indicate new ways for well-directed, disability-related promotion in vocational rehabilitation.","1544":null,"1545":"Traditional educational curricula are inadequate for physically disabled students with very severe consequences of disablement, as they are insufficiently geared toward building Independent Living skills. Typical of their post-school situation nowadays, only few of them are in a position of making a direct transition into vocational training. The majority continues to need intensive educational-therapeutic services. The schools for the physically disabled seek to smoothen their transition into adult life by leaving-grade programmes aimed at providing opportunities for work-related experience as well as at building coping skills for day-to-day living. The work and life preparation programme represents a special organizational and didactical conception in this context, where the demands of adult life serve as the starting point for developing the learning and educational goals to be attained.","1546":"In our society, holiday-making and travelling have become civic rights. Handicapped people however frequently find this \"civic right to holiday travelling\" difficult to implement in the usual manner. Mobility barriers, behavioural uncertainty in the social-communicative contact of disabled and non-disabled people but also financial limitations act as disincentives. It therefore is necessary that disabled persons' organizations, non-profit and commercial service providers but also the Federal government step-up their involvement in this field and get efforts toward improvement started, an endeavour that could be coordinated and inspired by the Tourism and People with Disabilities working group established in 1989.","1547":"Reported is our experience with two computer programmes for aphasic people (language loss after stroke). The STACH and WEGE programmes combine data banks of written language, pictures, and auditory speech output (delta modulation\/Audicard 300 E by Speech Design, Munich) using MS-DOS. Special attention is given to the social environment, the patients' families and the context of self-help groups, who show great interest in this new facility for speech-training.","1548":"Rehabilitation treatment of adult patients with scoliosis essentially is of a secondary prevention orientation. Along with countering curve progression, the main focus is on improving secondary functional impairments of the cardiopulmonary system as well as on the management of scoliosis-induced pain. In-patient physiotherapy rehabilitation provides major impacts in these respects, especially since they have proven their worth in obtaining increases in vital capacity, rib mobility, cardiopulmonary functioning, and in reducing scoliosis-induced pain complaints.","1549":"Important aspects in the aftercare of patients with cancer of head and neck can be realized by physical training in a sports group. The aftermath of operative therapy, e.g. loss of motion, imbalances of muscular activity or respiratory movements, can be reduced. The main importance of physical training in a group is the patient's reintegration in a social environment. Evaluating the quality of life of the individual patient we found that this method of psychosocial aftercare can improve subjective quality of life. Therefore, this conception of rehabilitation should not be missing in the aftercare of patients with malignant cancer.","1550":"Investigated was the insurance course of 184 insurants of the Landesversicherungsanstalt Oberfranken und Mittelfranken who, in 1986 and 1987, had participated in in-patient rehabilitation procedures immediately following the post-acute stage, i.e. Anschlussheilbehandlung (AHB), after aortocoronary bypass surgery. Nearly 60% of these insurants were granted a pension within the first two years after AHB, half of them on a permanent basis. The pensioning rate is substantially influenced by beneficiary age: all of the 60 to 64 year-olds and almost every second of the 50 to 54 year-olds were granted a pension. Insurants with formal vocational education more often received premature pension than those without formal training. A cardiac load test showed that cardiac efficiency does not correlate with the return-to-work\/pensioning rate. Age seems to play an important additional role in this respect, as older beneficiaries were pensioned more often than younger ones, with the same cardiac fitness found for both groups in cardiac load testing.","1551":"Especially the chronically ill and disabled deserve to benefit from \"socially integrated psychotherapy\" in view of their specific situation of distress, which has often arisen without warning and unexpectedly. Dealing with bodily impairments, there are the so-called \"organismic\" methods using the hypnoid state as major component that have proven to be highly efficient. Dealt with are autogenic training, guided affective imagery, respiratory feedback and hypnosis. Hypnoid states can be regarded as a third basic state of consciousness in humans (besides waking and sleep). They play a major role in many forms of psychotherapy. The knowledge and selective use of underlying mechanisms enhance the potentialities of psychotherapy. The psychotherapeutic basic dialogue stays in constant accompanying function. We are opposed to a widespread misconception that psychotherapy is a method for the treatment of psychogenic disorders only. We obtained good results in the treatment of palsied patients of extrapyramidal and pyramidal type with hypnosis or autohypnosis as well as with our own model of group psychotherapy (autogenic training with concomitant analytic discussion, over a period of up to nine months). In this set-up we successfully mix patients with psychogenic and with somatogenic disorders. Although not a primarily psychotherapeutic method, respiratory feedback also makes use of the hypnoid state. Good results have been achieved with patients in rehabilitation and chronic pain sufferers. Occasional experience with guided affective imagery have been encouraging. We can conclude that psychotherapy with organically ill patients is indicated and promising. We need more appropriate training, supervision and concomitant scientific research.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1552":"The maintenance of old memories subsequent to brain damage is discussed with the particular aim of pointing out problems and possibilities of measuring them post-injury. Relationships between forms of brain damage and retrograde amnesia are outlined, and various recent tests designed to measure old memories are specified and assessed. From this survey it is concluded that tests and test batteries are rather heterogenous so far and at best only crudely comparable between studies, and that a clinically practicable (i.e., short), yet valid and reliable test still has to be created.","1553":"A guide dog user himself, the author nevertheless sets out to put forth in as unprejudiced a manner as possible the pros and cons of this mobility aid for blind persons. After a brief outline of the history and present situation of guide dog use in Germany, the author addresses the skills such a service animal must be provided with, dealing both with genetic and biographic issues relative to his or her suitability and training. Also, the team, conceived as a differentiated action entity, is set out in some detail due to its unique structure and dynamics, dealing also with its intricate relationship with the environment. Concluding, the author on the one hand addresses the psychologically important adjustment difficulties a person without previous experience in using this aid may be faced with, and on the other the partnership-based position of the guide dog in private and occupational social interaction.","1554":"The Federal Employment Institute's statistics of Sept. 1990 clearly show that severely disabled persons are more frequently hit by long-term unemployment than non-disabled unemployed. Unemployment of more than two years' duration at the time had been the case for some 30.8% of the severely disabled, compared to a share of 13.7% for non-disabled. This empirical fact has in recent years been increasingly dealt with in pertinent German-language literature, the discussion clearly emphasizing the demand that programmes aimed at the vocational qualification of unemployed disabled persons be provided, along with accompanying measures. This discussion had also give rise to the purposes of the present study, that is, to outline such a qualification programme within the purview of the Dortmund labour exchange, including participants' opinions of the measure. Over a period of 12 days, some 21 participants had therefore been invited for standardized questionnaire interviewing, with 8 of the 45 questions posed referring to personal biographies. The interview findings are represented in percent ranks, further statistical analysis, e.g. chi2-testing, was refrained from in view of the small number of interviewes. The study on the one hand shows that only few participants had achieved formal vocational qualification through programme participation, and on the other, that return to gainful activity is perceived as a major support in individual life planning. The psychosocial strains described by the programme participants yield important insights in view of the current debate about post-placement follow-along.","1555":"","1556":"Set out from various specific angles, the concept concerning a modern common industrial medicine\/safety\/ergonomics approach can be fitted into the present legal framework. Adapted according to specific needs, this approach can equally be applied in all areas--health promotion, prevention, cure, rehabilitation. Those involved in the current debate about industrial health policies start out from the premise that industrial medicine could contribute strongly in this respect. While the workmen's compensation scheme, together with the industrial medical profession, is to a considerable extent involved in the subject as a whole on the basis of the industrial safety Act, its competencies are however limited, being in actual fact confined to the field of health maintenance in the occupational context. The examinations they effect in this framework cannot be based on a holistic medical orientation, because our constitution has expressly excluded the private sphere of the individual (self-management domain). Hence, there are very little chances of success for any attempt of changing current health care practice solely via the workmen's compensation administrations. It currently is, rather, the health and pension insurance schemes who hold the potential for influence. The common approach of industrial medicine, safety and ergonomics outlined may be of considerable use also in view of their goals, and holds sufficient justification for their intervening favourably in the ongoing debate about quality and quantity of industrial medical service provision with the ministries in charge.","1557":"","1558":"The present contribution builds on the author's experience, is however not intended solely as a review, but sets out some approaches and suggestions pertaining to three areas which, in the author's view, belong to the problematic issues in the life of ill and disabled persons in our society. These are: the deficits in rehabilitation; the importance of talking with disabled or ill persons; and the educational integration of disabled children with its present possibilities and limits. Perhaps the views and suggestions set out can contribute to introducing a more everyday problem orientation into future discussions of issues to do with the handicapped and non-handicapped getting along with each other. While primarily starting out from his personal experience as a disabled person in dealing with the first two areas, the author's considerations concerning the third area-which currently is a matter of highly speculative debate in German special education-are based on professional reading and day-to-day involvement in teaching. According to the statements made by those unrestrainedly in favour of educational integration, their initiations seem to have channelled everything appropriately. Educational integration, however, has always been sought for children with less serious handicap, or those with serious handicap and average to good learning ability. For those with serious handicaps, possibly with additional learning restrictions, the author, in the face of an integrational euphoria currently often met with, feels obliged to predict that for this group the school for the physically handicapped will continue to be the \"receiving school\", as current integrational approaches do not include these pupils or do not meet their requirements.","1559":"","1560":"","1561":"Rehabilitation, along with curative treatment and prevention, is a function within a social system of comprehensive measures and services aimed at the maintenance and restoration of good health. Rehabilitation at the same time, however, is a task assigned to specific social service administrations within the structured system of social security. This entails deficits in the effectiveness and efficiency of rehabilitation measures. A working group on \"reorientation in health care\" has developed proposals for reducing these deficits, bearing reference, in its proposals, to the course of chronic diseases and pointing out the measures that would, in the various disease stages, be capable of securing care continuity as well as of improving the quality of care. Key factors involved are the rehabilitation competence of the primary-care physicians, as well as the competencies of patients themselves.","1562":"Though based on a uniform definition of rehabilitation, the rehabilitation services provided and the rehabilitative procedures applied have taken very different courses of development in the old and new states of the Federal Republic of Germany. Taking into account the varying approaches, considerations are presented in view of optimized rehabilitation in the Federal states, old and new.","1563":"Basic lines of rehabilitation in the former GDR are described, stating the legal bases. It is shown how connected functioning of rehabilitation measures (medical, educational, occupational, social) was made possible by organisational structures on the regional level (local rehabilitation commissions, local rehabilitation centres) and by the responsibility of all levels of society including employing establishments. Difficulties are mentioned which resulted from political and ideological points of view (non-educable children and adolescents, e.g.) and inadequate financial and material resources.","1564":"Written Chinese, due to its specific characteristics, poses extraordinary difficulties for its translation into Braille. To this day, this constitutes a serious handicap for Chinese-speaking blind people in education and employment. Reforming Chinese Braille, therefore, is an absolute necessity. Regrettably, only little research has so far been undertaken regarding the various possibilities available. A controversial debate on the alternatives for reform is sure to take place in the years ahead. Concrete research, if on a very small scale, has now at least been started in Marburg, with initial results expected by late 1991.","1565":"Vocational rehabilitation service provision is always required when current job tasks can no longer be carried out due to disease-related performance restrictions. For social service agencies and employment offices as well as the rehabilitation facilities to intervene, information is needed on the remaining abilities, in order to be able to match future job requirements accordingly. Chronic rheumatic diseases gain increasing importance due to their high incidence and chronic progression; their impact on the capacity for work is considerable, with little attention however so far paid by the rehabilitation community. For 30 rheumatic patients of working age, abilities profiles have therefore been prepared and requirements profiles been established for their current job tasks, based on the methodological concept of Ertomis-Stiftung which had been supplemented by certain items important from an industrial medical angle. The findings show that the rheumatic person experiences limitations in all movement functions, and that lifting and carrying in particular are not possible. A major request is inclusion of a dynamic assessment criterion in the abilities profiles, as the person with a rheumatic disease in principle is capable of carrying out all movements, not however at the speed required to perform the job tasks.","1566":"Presented are the objectives, premises, and methods of health training in the framework of inpatient rehabilitation of cardiovascular patients, the contents of a two-week group programme are reported. Central among the goals is information on the disease, on how to cope with it, as well as psychosocial reorientation of health behaviour. Various methods for achieving these goals are described, the focus being on group work programmed according to psychological considerations, and placed within a psychosomatic overall approach of the clinic.","1567":"The Hessian RPK model (RPK = rehabilitation facility for persons with mental illness) is characterized by a number of social-integrative features that might provide impulses for further rehabilitative models. Due to industrial linkages, gradual adjustment to competitive working conditions is possible. The person with mental illness experiences purposive rehabilitative services to adjust to normal conditions, which can be an important reference for him toward attaining normalization as well as integration. Also, the rural and extraterritorial environment, by reducing exposure to stimuli, can contribute to stabilization.","1568":"For many young people, their aspiration for an environmentally compatible, and societally meaningful, field of activity is very marked and reflects the values they hold. Vocational rehabilitation should be oriented accordingly, and take up the motivational potential implied. The more accurate the knowledge of previous vocational experience, motivations, attitudes toward work, and of the subjective difficulties in coping with work-related requirements, the more detailed can vocational rehabilitation planning be devised. The potential is increased by a concept that is guided by insights from the psychology of work and emphasizes individual rehabilitation planning as well as follow-along developmental counselling. Assessment of 52 individual service instances for mentally ill youths and young adults, of Berlin-Kreuzberg, revealed an appropriate placement quota of 67%. The developmental course taken in the individual cases shows that satisfactory long-term outcomes can be achieved through careful entry diagnostics, individual rehabilitation planning, ongoing developmental counselling, selective educational intervention, industrial try-outs, as well as stabilizing aftercare.","1569":"The hip joints of children with spastic cerebral palsy, notably in those with more severe forms of paresis as well as those with bilateral or tetraparetic involvement, are in any case exposed to extraordinarily great risks. Totally inconspicuous at birth, constant dominance of the spastically contracting hip adductor and flexor muscles leads to gradually advancing malpositioning of the femoral heads, along with flattening of the hip socket and its eventual total destruction. Complete dislocation of the hip joints results, in very severely affected cases already at age 2-3, but in the majority of children only several years later. In this equally tragic as, on the other hand, almost invariably preventable maldevelopment, the wheelchair takes on a doubly crucial role. This, for one, has to do with the many hours the child has to spend in it every day. On account of the fact that the regular wheelchair, above all when \"sportively styled\", is forcing both legs, i.e. the thighs and lower legs as well as the feet, to adopt a strictly parallel position, it enhances, and accelerates, the highly undesirable development of spastic hip dislocation. If, however, the wheelchair is redesigned in an appropriate manner, i.e. provided with an abduction seating orthosis, along with laterally repositioned foot rests, it will in the majority of cases be possible to prevent the development of hip dislocation. Detailed guidelines to achieve this end are included, and instructions are given for adapting commercially available wheelchairs.","1570":"","1571":"Medical-educational cooperation is of long standing in disability care. The roots of this tradition in the fields of blindness, deafness, physical disability, and mental retardation are touched on, and the further development of the overall medical-educational task in rehabilitation is outlined. Various aspects of team work and of remedial education systematics are set out in light of the changing positions among experts in the rehabilitation process. The importance of value orientation is emphasized.","1572":"60 adolescents whose course of recovery from their aphasic disorders had already been studied during the postacute treatment phase in a rehabilitation clinic were catamnestically assessed by a questionnaire. The aim of the study was to gain information about their further linguistic, educational, vocational and social development, and to evaluate the validity of the recommendations made at discharge from the rehabilitation clinic. The results show that inspite of the generally good improvement of aphasic disorders in adolescents, there hardly ever is complete recovery; and they mainly make clear the severe consequences on the further educational and vocational development, which seem to be underestimated as far as institutional help is concerned. Moreover the consequences of the language disturbances on social relations seem to be felt as even harder to cope with. The educational and vocational recommendations at the end of the postacute rehabilitation phase turned out to be valid to a surprisingly high degree. Concluding, some possible consequences the results could have on improving the rehabilitation process are discussed.","1573":"In the framework of a pilot study, 15 children having bronchial asthma (4 female, 11 male; age 5-11;6) participated, over a period of 8 weeks, in two weekly sessions of combined relaxation, respiratory and sports exercises. The present article in particular focuses on the relaxation exercises, made up of Progressive Muscle Relaxation and Autogenic Training elements as well as of phantasy travels, mantras, and periodic music. Ongoing observation of the children during training, the findings of subsequent semi-structured interviews with them, topical instances of coping with impending asthma attacks by using the techniques learned, as well as the results of a catamnestic inquiry some three years later--all indicate a positive impact of the relaxation exercises. Statistical analysis of the data at hand revealed significant improvements in a number of pulmonary function parameters (airway resistance, forced expiratory volume for 1 s, forced vital capacity, peak expiratory flow rate). Interpretation of these findings must however take into account the entirety of the training provided.","1574":"A case example is used to set out the practice of vocational assessment and work adjustment in a medical-vocational, i.e. Phase II, facility. Formulated jointly by the rehabilitation team, the basic therapy objectives, by constant liaison with the employer, are differentiated in view of the future place of work and the performance required from the patient. The individual case serves to illustrate the effectiveness of this therapy approach intended to smoothen the transition from inpatient treatment to vocational reintegration.","1575":"Therapy and rehabilitation of patients with craniocerebral trauma is particularly difficult to programme on account of the neuropsychological defects and personality changes found in this population. The Ulm rehabilitation hospital seeks to face up to this fact by intense interdisciplinary cooperation in the nursing and medical sector, the fields of logopaedics, Occupational Therapy, physiotherapy, immediate post-acute therapy including cerebral training, as well as the entire field of vocational rehabilitation. A dense time schedule has been established for graded introduction of the necessary therapeutic interventions in the sense of a therapy chain, with intense information flows among the therapists involved, thus ensuring a continuous process and joint adjustment of programming to the individual course, to new problems that may arise. The implementation of this concept is set out on the example of a young patient with craniocerebral injury, who had received treatment in various of our departments for a total of 12 months, finally bringing him up to the conclusion of his vocational education.","1576":"Given the need for long-term quality assurance in the rehabilitation of geriatric patients, it is appropriate to inquire into the relevancy of intra-clinical outcome criteria for the patients' everyday life. It is assumed that everyday life at home will differ substantially from clinic routines, and that the rehabilitation potential achieved in the clinic will not as a matter of course be transferable. The findings of a follow-up project clearly show that long-term maintenance of rehabilitation potential, i.e. quality assurance, may be endangered primarily in three dimensions--psychic, social, and organizational. An orientation by purely intra-clinical outcome criteria of short reach (self-care, ADL, etc.), therefore, is contrasted with the consideration of psychosocial outcome criteria of long reach (quality of life, competence) in assessing rehabilitation outcome.","1577":"","1578":"The article in the first line points out the housing problems faced by people with a severe physical handicap, especially with regard to nursing\/care dependence. In this framework, linkages are established with the needs associated with housing, the various practical approaches in the satisfaction of housing needs are outlined. The legal basis with regard to architectural aspects as well as relative to the financing mechanisms for nursing\/care and income maintenance are essential factors in view of their practical implementation, as is the acquisition of life skills on the part of those concerned. A number of possible changes in these respects are described.","1579":"The purpose of the present study was to establish the relationship between persisting aphasia and the extent of overall disability in the long-term outcome following left hemisphere ischaemic stroke. 55 right-handed patients who had sustained an initial left-sided cerebral infarction, verified by CT scan, were investigated after a mean observation period of six years. 39 patients were categorized as being non-aphasic, and 16 as being aphasic (3 Global, 6 Broca's, 1 conduction, 1 transcortical motor and 5 anomic aphasics) at the end of the follow-up period. Regarding motor and sensory functions, a correlation between the presence of aphasia and the severity of deficits could be established at the end of the follow-up period. With respect to activities of daily living, a significantly larger number of aphasic stroke victims had to rely on help by others. Furthermore, the persistence of aphasia also negatively influenced the subsequent occupational capacity. With regard to social participation and leisure activities, a significant reduction was found in aphasic long-term stroke survivors as compared to non-aphasics. Concerning quality of life, both groups reported a marked decline at the end of the observation period; the presence of aphasia had an additional negative effect. However, as regards the long-term non-verbal cognitive impairment, statistical analysis revealed no significant differences between both groups. In addition, aphasic stroke survivors did not demonstrate a higher incidence of depressive states than those without language deficit. On the basis of our results it is concluded that the presence of aphasia in left-hemispheric ischaemic stroke survivors indicates a more severe stroke, resulting in greater physical disability and social handicap in the long-term outcome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1580":"","1581":"Presented are selected results of a comprehensive study of 98 breast and intestinal cancer patients in the framework of an inpatient aftercare programme. In comparison to the outset, the patients' quality of life had increased clearly at the end of the aftercare measure: Physical complaints, functional impairments and psychic strain due to anxieties, depression or typical disease-generated problems have diminished. The patients' general life satisfaction at the end of the programme is good and does not differ from the levels found in a comparative sample of healthy subjects. The meaning of the \"quality of life\" construct, as well as of our findings, for rehabilitation research are discussed.","1582":"A total of 50 patients with complete paraplegia (Reduction of Earning Capacity--MdE--100%; average age 25 years, 9 months) had been followed up annually over a period of 10 years post-onset (= Date 0), when discharged from hospital treatment and alive at the 10th, and final, follow-up year (= Date 10). 5 paraplegics died during the 10 year observation period. Hence, 447 questionnaires had been sent out for collecting pertinent information, all of which were returned. The replies received were summed up in 10 time-schedule quotas as well as in cumulative quotas, adding together all replies. Cumulative quotas are as follows: Independence in getting dressed 92.8% (415 affirmative replies of 447 in all); Independent transfer 93.1% (416 affirmative replies of 447 in all); Independent wheelchair use 98.4% (440 affirmative replies of 447 in all). Due to the considerable changes that had occurred over the entire observation period relative to the ability to stand and walk as well as to drive a car, the time-schedule quotas showed great variations, so that these quotas are stated here only in respect of the 10th, final, year of follow-up: Ability to stand 25.6% (10 affirmative replies of 39 in all); Ability to walk 13.9% (5 affirmative replies of 36 in all); Ability to drive a car 82.2% (37 affirmative replies of 45 in all). The conclusions to be drawn from these findings are discussed in some depth.","1583":"In order to get more precise information on the staffing and structural capacities needed in the care and rehabilitative treatment of patients with cerebrovascular diseases (CVD), the profiles of illness and disability were studied retrospectively on the basis of the medical histories of CVD patients who had been treated at a neurological rehabilitation centre in 1987 and had mostly come from the facility's assigned catchment area. Due to insufficient documentation of certain profile data in the patients histories, the same data were recorded in a complementary study for all patients in this target population admitted in the first half of 1988. The classification of patients into nursing care categories, already practiced in everyday clinical routines, turned out a valid global estimate for the total nursing, medical and therapeutic efforts required in the individual patient. A high correlation exists between the nursing care category assigned and the numbers of necessary care interventions as well as functional disorders requiring rehabilitative attention. The nursing care interventions needed concentrate on certain situations during the day, which has to be taken into account in staff planning. Given the multitude of impairments and disabilities seen, comprehensive management in a neurological rehabilitation unit presupposes a team of diverse diagnostic and therapeutic specialists, which, apart from medical specialists and nursing staff, should at least comprise physio- and Occupational Therapists, neuro-linguistic or logopedic specialists, as well as psychologists. In view of the high incidence of accompanying internal diseases, a stroke rehabilitation unit must have access to an internal medical service at least on a consultancy basis, and available on an extended time scale.","1584":"Within our framework of \"comprehensive and permanent\" rehabilitation, the follow-up neurological rehabilitation service is an important element. Based on the findings of an anterospective computerized documentation, a ten year survey is given concerning more than 600 patients and over 15,000 home visits. Aside general epidemiologic data, such as age, gender distribution, etc., our findings above all show that improvements in rehabilitation profiles can be achieved even after prolonged periods of time (i.e., 12 months and over) after onset. This, for one thing, may help in countering a widespread rehabilitation pessimism and, for another, serve in motivating the responsible cost-carrying agencies to pay increased attention to the field of neuro-rehabilitation. Literature concerning systematic assessment of long-term rehabilitation outcomes is sparse and fragmental. Available data to a large extent are in line with our findings. Further accompanying rehabilitation research into these respects is urgently needed. A number of important service delivery\/organizational aspects have in addition been traced, which we are already trying to implement within our Vorarlberg rehabilitation model.","1585":"The presence of impairments in their newborn child entails parental mourning and coping processes, which are either accelerated, prolonged, or repressed by the professional help provided, depending on the nature and quality of such intervention. Based on Schuchardt's model of coping with crisis (1980), the interactional difficulties between professional helpers\/parents and child in the various phases are set out, inferring potential modifications in this interaction, but also changes in training and research contents.","1586":"A total of 263 respondents were interviewed relative to their attitudes towards disabled persons, using a standardized questionnaire. Of these 263 subjects, 144 lived in a community without any facility for disabled persons in the vicinity, 119 subjects lived close by a physically disabled persons centre. The \"attitudinal climate\" among all interviewees on the whole more on the positive side, it was found that those living in the vicinity of a physically disabled persons centre, though expressing less contact uneasiness when meeting physically handicapped children and young people, did however not give more positive--but neither more negative--opinions in other respects than those subjects not living near a facility for the disabled. The results obtained were further analyzed on the variables of age, sex, and closer contacts with disabled people among friends. It has, once again, been confirmed that attitudes toward disabled persons constitute a multidimensional construct that, to varying degrees, is influenced by a number of factors. Some consequences and considerations in terms of educational implementation possibilities of the findings are outlined in conclusion.","1587":"ERTOMIS Foundation, prompted by the WHO publication in 1980 of the International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities, and Handicaps (ICIDH), has developed an assessment system for vocational integration and placement of disabled persons. This EAM System is based on the comparison of requirements and abilities profiles, both comprised of 65 identically worded criteria for describing elemental functions. A pilot study was carried out by Forschungsgemeinschaft Arbeitsmedizinisches Zentrum Siegerland\/ERTOMIS Stiftung, of Siegen, verifying the EAM system's effectiveness and reliability on two groups of industrial medical clients, i.e. \"routine cases\" (severely disabled workers) and \"problem cases\" (workers with performance alterations). Study findings show that the presence of overstrain can be reliably proven and necessary action be reliably inferred by means of the EAM system. This permits workers to be retained while safeguarding their continued good health. The system moreover shows where remedial action has to be taken from a preventive point of view. On account of its use of elemental criteria, the system can be applied across trades and occupations, and is neither restricted to a specific branch of the social protection system.","1588":"Two studies on lay helping in the rehabilitation of persons with chronic mental illness are reported. Lay helpers, clients and staff from two social psychiatric centres participated in structured interviewing; supplementary procedures were used on some aspects. The findings show that interaction of the three groups included is moulded by a multitude of expectations and incompatibilities, which are of relevance to the very concept of lay help. \"Lay helping\" is set out as a very meaningful and urgently needed approach in the rehabilitation of persons with chronic mental illness- at the same time however characterized as a transition toward developing an independent conception in terms of community psychology and community psychiatry.","1589":"Rehabilitation outcome was examined within a social psychiatric model institution including several partial hospitalization programmes and various outpatient services. After a one-year period the treatment success was measured by objective criteria in 166 consecutively admitted patients, most of them diagnosed as schizophrenics. 75% showed improvements in terms of reduced institutional protection and a more independent living situation. Vocational rehabilitation was successful in 47%. There was no significant correlation between these outcome measures. A poor outcome was found in a group of patients who had received a comparatively high rate of therapeutic activities and was classified by sociodemographic variables. Consequences concerning the therapeutic approach in community mental health services and its evaluation are shown.","1590":"The expectations towards rehabilitation held by 45 stroke patients and their relatives were investigated. It was found that the expectations held by the relatives are more realistic and not quite as optimistic as those held by the patients. The patients above all hoped for physical-vocational restoration, the relatives on the other hand more for emotional-social recovery. Also dealt with are the expectations and notions of patients and relatives in respect of duration, location and material rank of rehabilitation. Pointed out are the difficulties to be reckoned with on account of the divergent expectancies of patients and relatives toward rehabilitation.","1591":"The considerable advances made in the rescue and intensive care fields have entailed drastically increased numbers of survivors of severe head injury. Because of ethical reasons alone, the call for early rehabilitation of patients with persistent vegetative state post-trauma appears justified. Aside lifesaving intensive medical care in the acute phase, available empirical studies have so far not been able to provide evidence for the superiority of specific early rehabilitation measures. Clinicians lack pragmatic decision-making aids in the question of how long patients should be treated in the acute clinic. Nursing homes currently are no alternative, as they will hardly ever be equipped in a manner enabling them to cope with the considerable nursing requirements posed by these patients.","1592":"The group of wheelchair sportsmen presented see their field of activity not only in terms of practising sports with its manifold positive effects but also in terms of providing information and care for hospitalized paraplegic patients and\/or recently discharged rehabilitees. The article is based on the answers to a questionnaire developed by the sports medical counselling office in Zwickau. Severely disabled persons, too, take pleasure in their improved fitness and performance.","1593":"","1594":"Over a period of two years, a total of 847 patients with multiple sclerosis (283 male and 564 female aged 18 to 79 years) were interviewed relative to the psychological care provided. Two patients currently participated in regular client-centered group therapy, 11 patients had regularly attended individual or group psychotherapy in previous years, and one patient had undergone family therapy several years ago. Another 26 patients reported occasional supportive counselling by their neurologist or family doctor in the framework of outpatient care. Ten patients used relaxation techniques such as autogenic training, and 42 patients reported emotional benefit from contacts within an MS self-help group. The findings of our study show that professional psychological care of persons with MS is extremely sparse, substantiating the call for better psychological services in coping with MS.","1595":"While concepts for the solution of didactical-methodological problems are available for brain-injured children and young people, such concepts are almost nonexistent for adults with craniocerebral trauma sequels. A case example is presented from an educationist perspective, illustrating the disruptive impact of craniocerebral trauma on the person's biography. Didactical and methodological problems not only arise from deficient cognitive functioning but also due to the psychosocial impact of severe brain trauma. Inter alia dealt with is the question of whether an independent didactical approach is needed, or whether concepts derived from general didactics can be applied. For learners with craniocerebral trauma, \"learning theory-based didactics\" is an especially suitable model; a brief description is given, and its application to the specific situation of this population outlined. People with brain trauma display problems in knowledge acquisition and concept formation (cognitive learning), in transfer of learning content and performance control. Though an independent didactical concept may not be necessary, it is however crucial that in respect of the teaching\/learning processes in this population, due attention is being paid to methodological principles applied in the special education field.","1596":null,"1597":"The aim of spondylodesis is to restore the injured spinal column to its previous shape and stability. In the transverse SCI patient, it entails easier intensive care in case of multiple injury as well as easier general nursing tasks, and greater intensity of physiotherapy in the acute and early phases. Compared to conservative management of the injured spinal column, mobilization is effected some 21 to 39 days earlier in surgical patients, total hospitalization in tetraplegics is shortened by 5 days, and by 34 to 57 days in paraplegic patients. Functionally valuable neurological recovery in primary complete paralysis occurs in 19%\/20% of conservative\/surgical cases, in primary partial paralysis in 67%\/58%. Stabilization of the spinal column however does not at the same time achieve a stabilization of the transverse SCI patient's entire situation--physical, psychological, social. Irrespective of the scope of paralysis, the advantages of a spondylodesis should be considered also in case of total paraplegia. Conservative management retains its importance in cases where surgery is not indicated, or even contraindicated. Comparable results are very rarely achieved outside the specialized centres. Acute cases of SCI should therefore be referred to spinal centres as soon as possible, which for their part have to be able to admit patients 24 hours a day, as well as to provide adequate care until completion of the entire treatment.","1598":"Independence in self-care is the basis for meaningful rehabilitation. This includes: eating, drinking, dressing, grooming, mastering communicational skills. Together with the Occupational Therapist, the client practises to gain independence and enhance his self-awareness. Only on this basis will the sick or handicapped person be able to master the requirements of everyday life in the institution as well as in his vocational rehabilitation and--most essential--later in everyday life and in the working world.","1599":"The use of \"Komhilf\", a newly developed communication aid for persons with severe physical handicap, is described on the example of two patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Aside individual letter input, it provides input of complete phrases signifying basic needs or common request, without a need for letter-by-letter spelling. After a short familiarization period, both patients were able to communicate up to two to three hours daily via \"Komhilf\". Psychic stabilization and increased levels of activity were observed in the patients, which subsequently also entailed increased compliance with other therapeutic measures. Additional features include good transportability, use in lying and sitting (wheelchair) patients alike, easy-to-learn operation, and, not least, a competitive price.","1600":null,"1601":"Organized cooperation in the field of vocational rehabilitation has been established at EC-level more than fifteen years ago, the first meeting of the community network of rehabilitation centres having taken place on the 20th of October, 1975. This cooperation has been intensified and extended by HELIOS, the second action programme on behalf of disabled persons adopted by the Council of Ministers in April 1988, to continue the efforts started by the initial action programme. In the fields of occupational qualification, languages, and new technologies, \"Europe 92\" will give rise to new challenges that imperatively ask for closer cooperation among rehabilitation workers in the Community. In the framework of HELIOS, this cooperation has already been started.","1602":"Improvement of the living and working conditions of migrant workers as well as their free movement and social protection are among the major objectives of the European Community (laid down in the Treaty of Rome). In view of the forthcoming European internal market after 1993 and the related potential for increased sociopolitical integration also of disabled persons, an overview is presented of the policies adopted in the various member states in order to enhance employment of disabled people. The article gives an analysis of basic principles, without appraising the various provisions.","1603":"The number of disabled persons worldwide being estimated to amount to more than 500 million, with over 30 million living in the European Community, the author deals with vocational integration of disabled persons in the programmes and recommendations of the United Nations, Rehabilitation International, the International Labour Organization, the Council of Europe, the European Community, as well as the International Social Security Association.","1604":"The day structure of persons with acute or chronic mental illness is a central problem field in the design of helping and supportive programmes. The specifics involved in chronic mental illness must therefore be taken into account to a sufficient degree. A specialized vocational rehabilitation centre has been established in Vienna in the process of reorganization of psychiatric care. The study presented, which comprised the 441 persons who had participated in programmes at the Centre during the initial six years of its operation, shows that rehabilitative intervention in particular has positive effects when taking place before premature pensioning. A follow-up study of 294 former programme participants found that a total of 132 persons (i.e., 44.9%) had been working permanently or at least occasionally after programme completion. Given the fact that the majority of rehabilitation interventions provided had occurred in cases deemed prognostically unfavourable, the findings clearly show the importance of specialized facilities. No significant influence on the course of rehabilitation was found to be related to age, sex, psychiatric diagnosis and frequency\/duration of previous hospitalizations. The rehabilitative process took a more favourable course in persons whose stay in the Centre had extended beyond six months.","1605":null,"1606":"Assisted by Deutsche Krebshilfe, the German cancer aid fund, a questionnaire for assessment of quality of life in patients with life-threatening skin tumours and disfiguring tumour sequels was developed at Fachklinik Hornheide between 1986 and 1988. A first step toward determining quality of life and for enhancing treatment-integrated rehabilitative work is the assessment of the subjective distress and problems experienced due to the illness and its treatment. This is the objective of the Hornheider Fragebogen, a questionnaire developed in the framework of the study on the basis of extensive literature search, structured interviews with patients and treating staff. This self-assessment instrument was answered by 131 patients with malignant tumours of the skin, twice during in-patient treatment and a third time some 6 months after discharge. Statistical analysis of the data collected proved the questionnaire to be valid, reliable and practicable. Additionally, it has been possible to draw up a number of significant results of immediate relevancy. It turned out that persons who are unemployed, divorced, or married but separated, as well as persons without school leaving certificate, experienced greater distress and more problems in many dimensions than the other respondents. The questionnaire was viewed as meaningful and as helpful by the patients in order to voice unspecific anxiety and questions. Also, the study entailed positive implications for our rehabilitative work already in this initial testing phase, by enabling us to give more specific support to the patients. The Hornheider Fragebogen, after review and abridgment, consists of 27 problem-oriented questions relating to eight dimensions of life.","1607":"Results of a questionnaire survey on the psychological services available at the vocational retraining centres in West Germany, together with the authors' long years of experience as rehabilitation psychologists in vocational retraining centres, show that psychological-therapeutical work in vocational rehabilitation has gained increased importance. Attention is drawn to the existing cooperation and role conflicts, with a simultaneously developing consolidation and acceptance of psychological competence of service within the rehabilitation centres. In order to cope with the psychological problems of rehabilitation faced at present and in the future, there must be a demand for strengthened stream-lining of the accompaniment of the vocational concept of qualification, for institutional endeavours regarding innovation and further training, as well as the putting into practice of cooperative organization, and of interdisciplinary and general exchange of experience, which has long been called for during the studies of the psychology of rehabilitation. Practical experience confirms the urgency of multiprofessional team- and case-supervision for effective therapeutical plans of action and controls.","1608":"Because of the favourable prognosis in patients with early stomach cancer even extensive vocational rehabilitation measures should be taken into consideration. Opposed to that is the fact that about 40% of these patients already exceed the age limit for employment and only 10% are younger than 45 years. The polymorbidity, too, is relatively high, 21% of our patients were not capable of employment already before the outbreak of their cancer disease. The postgastrectomy syndrome prevents 40% from resuming work within the first postoperative year and jeopardizes the working capacity even after that time, at least in patients with manual occupations.","1609":"A total of 50 patients with complete paraplegia (average age 25 years, 9 months) had been followed up annually over a period of 10 years post-onset (Date 0), when discharged from hospital treatment and alive at the 10th, and final, follow-up year (Date 10). Hence, 447 questionnaires had been sent out for collecting pertinent information, all of which were returned. 5 paraplegics died during the 10 year observation period. The causes of lethality, as well as further data on medical findings and ADL independence are reported elsewhere. In the occupational context, the following outcomes were found concerning vocational reintegration: The cumulative quota for training and standard-wage employment was 61.1% (273 affirmative replies of 447 in all); The time-schedule quota for standard-wage employment was 52.1% at Date 5 (25 of 48 paraplegics), 58.7% at Date 7 (27 of 46 paraplegics), and 51.1% at Date 10 (23 of 45 paraplegics); The overall quota for training during the entire observation period was 64.0% (32 of 50 paraplegics), and 66.0% (33 of 50 paraplegics) for reintegration into standard-wage employment. The factors which have contributed favourably to these rather positive vocational rehabilitation outcomes are discussed in some detail.","1610":"Presented are the findings of vocational training data analysis concerning the 91,241 disabled young people who had entered vocational training in the period 1982-87 carried by the Federal Employment Institute within the scope of \"Anordnung Rehabilitation\" (AReha). 77% of the young rehabilitees successfully concluded their vocational training at the first attempt; 22% dropped out, and 2% failed at the exams. Of those who had dropped out prematurely, some 39% participated in other types of vocational rehabilitation measures; no data are contained in the statistics concerning the whereabouts of the remainder. The majority of the young people, i.e. 77%, underwent vocational training in a recognized training occupation, the others in line with section 48 BBiG (vocational education act) or section 42 b HwO (handicrafts ordinance) to reduced requirements. 61% of the training measures were industrial ones, 23% provided in a vocational training centre, and the remaining 16% in some other non-industrial rehabilitation facility. The greatest single population among the young rehabilitees were those with learning disabilities, with a share of 63%. The Federal Employment Institute's statistics containing no data beyond the termination of training, information relative to vocational integration after training completion could only be gained on the basis of other, empirical investigations.","1611":"Developed in the 1960s, the concept for vocational rehabilitation in the vocational retraining centres has proven its worth also in the face of the great challenges of the 80s. Not all of the partly profound changes which have taken place in the environs of vocational rehabilitation over the last few years had been positive ones. Before this background, it must therefore be asked how the standard attained by the vocational retraining centres is to be viewed and which route the vocational rehabilitation field is going to take in the 90s. The process of societal and technological change over recent years is likely to further accelerate in the 90s, with numerous implications for vocational education and disability policies. Even more so than in the past, this process will require adjustments to be made, but equally give rise to innovative efforts and developments. The demands to be faced by the facilities are therefore going to increase, and major re-structuring processes will have to take place also in the vocational retraining centres.","1612":"","1613":"Chronic low-back pain is a frequent symptom causing considerable socioeconomic costs in many countries. Outpatient treatment of low-back pain often remains unsatisfactory. In our prospective study, one hundred patients on the five months waiting list were allocated randomly to attending the hospital either four months or six months later, the latter serving as a control group for those undergoing treatment. Health status was assessed using a multidimensional questionnaire, which had proven a reliable, valid and sensitive instrument in former studies. After four to six weeks of multidisciplinary inpatient treatment, a significant decrease in pain, anxiety and depression was found, whereas no improvement was observed in the control group. Multidisciplinary inpatient treatment therefore at least has short-term positive effects on patients' health status.","1614":"Using a variety of methods (standardized and open interviewing, medical talks, ongoing counselling, expert interviews), data had been raised from almost 400 persons with epilepsy (Grand mal) of working age (16-65 yrs.), permitting their life and working situation to be characterized participant observation. The project inter alia was aimed at describing the relationship of \"epilepsy and working world\", to determine the extent of participation in vocational rehabilitation measures as well as their course, in order to elicit criteria pertinent for introduction of goal-directed supportive action. The study findings are outlined; a model for estimating rehabilitative need is presented; needs-based groupings are characterized, and conceptual considerations concerning vocational rehabilitation of persons with epilepsy discussed.","1615":"Stubby prostheses have been used in the habilitation of very small children with bilateral lower limb deficiencies, particularly bilateral above knee limb deficiencies. While we reported on \"The Use of Stubbies For the Child with Bilateral Lower Limb Deficiencies\" in 1973, the literature has very little except in relation to the geriatric amputee. We have continued since 1973 to use stubbies in the bilateral above knee limb deficient child, as well as in the child with an above knee\/below knee combination, with great success in establishing early balance, followed within several months by the application of articulated prostheses with equal success in establishing independent walking without the use of crutches or walkers.","1616":"","1617":"Congenital limb deficiencies pose quite a number of questions, problems and tasks that go far beyond the surgical and prosthetic-orthotic aspects present. The question of amputation in view of improved function and appearance as well as easier prosthetic provision can be answered only in the context of the orthopaedic-surgical and prosthetic possibilities available. Social, cultural and religious factors are in addition enumerated that have to be taken into account.","1618":"The Krukenberg procedure has been performed unilaterally on juvenile amputee patients with congenital bilateral absence of the hands and observed by long-term follow-up examinations. The opposite extremity was routinely fitted with a standard prosthetic prescription as an assistive hand. In all cases, the Krukenberg stump became the leading hand. In some of the cases, the prosthesis on the opposite hand has been discarded in favour of the sensibility available without it. The prehension ability of the Krukenberg stump has provided the patient with all of his functional needs. The results have been remarkably rewarding to these patients. There has been virtually no concern evidenced by the patient or the parents about the appearance of the stump. The surgical procedure has been considered by be reasonably uncomplicated. Postoperative rehabilitation has been simple and rapid. The patients have continued to improve in their rehabilitation, and the Krukenberg forceps with its improved prehension and sensibility has improved the quality of life of these people. This procedure should be extended to more individuals who have the severe handicap of bilateral hand loss.","1619":"On overview is given of the range of methods for gait evaluation, describing briefly their individual potential and limitations. Included are a brief historical section, as well as the most recent, and highly sophisticated, systems; future research and development needs, not least with regard to practical feasibility, are pointed out.","1620":"","1621":"In the legislator's intention, the recent health reform legislation is aimed at strengthening solidarity and self-responsibility, so that our statutory insurance-based health care system may continue to be efficient and financially viable. The essential steering mechanism introduced is a system of fixed amount benefits in the various benefit areas, among them medicaments, technical aids such as wheelchairs, hearing aids, glasses, and various orthopaedic aids. Only part of the guidelines, tables and regulations needed for implementation have however been made available so far. It is therefore impossible as yet to undertake appropriate, objective evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of the reform for patients and health funds. It may however already be said that, in respect of dentures, transport, as well as burial costs, health fund insurants have to raise considerable extra means, partly touching on the financial substance of many insurants. A hardship\/overcharge clause is intended to keep the additional burdens socially compatible. This device however is absolutely insufficient in the case of chronically ill and very severely disabled people, paying no regard to the considerable additional expenses these populations have to incur for participating in general community life. The inclusion of benefits for domiciliary nursing and care is viewed as only a first step. The financial resources for protection against the risk of nursing and care dependency, however, should not come from the statutory health insurance scheme, but be based on a common pool of funds to be financed by the various social protection branches.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1622":"In light of contemporary social legislation, jurisdiction, scientific publications as well as the great numbers of institutions and facilities, the field of rehabilitation has undergone profound, positive changes from the beginnings of social legislation till today. Lawmaker and social administration are equally concerned with the tasks at hand today and in the future. The legislator is responsible for closing legislational gaps and for creating definitional clarity. Inter alia because of the high expectations relative to quality and quantity of social services and benefits, it is not possible in the Federal Republic of Germany to achieve greater simplicity and at the same time greater social equity of rehabilitation law. One of the main problems is to determine what exactly is comprised by \"social rehabilitation\" as well as its relationships with other areas of rehabilitation, aside from integrating social rehabilitation in its entirety into the catalogue of tasks incumbent on the social insurance sector. The self-government bodies are called on to make even greater use of the rooms for action accorded under the applicable provisions. This includes the competence for undertaking research, which, in particular in the health insurance sector, emanates from art. 217 SGB 5 (Social Code, Book 5). The social protection administrations are called on to define the bases for rehabilitation programme standards relative to the various disability types, in view of safeguarding rehabilitation effectiveness and efficiency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1623":null,"1624":"Given the profound structural changes of the first industrial revolution, physically disabled people, just like blind, deaf or epileptic children, had come to be confronted with disastrous living conditions in the large cities. Based on a sense of joint responsibility, the German Society for Cripple Care (today: German Society for Rehabilitation of the Disabled) was founded already in 1909, which, in the 80 years of its existence, has both considerably influenced pertinent legislation and herself been influenced in terms of constitution, membership and issues dealt with by the broadening of the rehabilitation philosophy. The call for clinic, school and vocational training under one roof had been the beginning of the rehabilitation team. The subjects dealt with at the Society's conferences over the last two decades have included numerous topics that in the meantime have attained socio-political relevancy, a fact that underlines the pacesetting role of non-profit, voluntary organizations in our social welfare state, but in the international network as well.","1625":"","1626":"","1627":"Given the limited competencies of the European Community (EC) in this respect, harmonization of rehabilitation at the level and within the framework of the EC is not expected to occur in the foreseeable future even after completion of the EC internal market. There will however be increased efforts to coordinate existing systems. Moreover, decisions and measures in other fields, with broader competencies on the part of the EC, may affect the field of integration of disabled persons (e.g., transportation, vocational education). In the same manner, the harmonization of technical standards applicable for medical equipment may influence the field of rehabilitation. If, after completion of the internal market, rehabilitative services were sought abroad in countries of the EC, refusal to accept the costs incurred on territorial grounds alone would not seem to be considered admissible any longer.","1628":"Organizations of the disabled do not see their information and counselling activities as competing against those of the financially responsible administrations but as complementary ones. Crucial to their work are the provision of guidance through the structured social protection system, familiarization of disabled persons with rehabilitation as well as their motivation and support, with the aim of rendering the disabled individual an equal partner in the process of rehabilitation. The area of social rehabilitation is a major focus in the counselling of disabled people. As specific institutional responsibilities for social rehabilitation do not exist, information and counselling activities in these matters are also directed at administrations and industry.","1629":"In the counselling of patients by the hospital social service, personal assistance and initiation of medical, vocational and social rehabilitation measures are intertwined. Counselling methods, scope, contents and goals are determined by the objective medical facts at hand as well as the subjective needs present in the individual case, and are limited by the structure of the hospital and its responsibility for acute care. Complementary to person- and problem-centered counselling with patients and their relatives as the nucleus of psychosocial coping with illness and disability, the hospital social service cooperates with the whole range of clinical professions involved in the individual case in reintegrating the patient, in particular with the physicians in charge of establishing the indication for rehabilitative measure, as well as with the entire range of rehabilitation carriers, with extra-clinical facilities and services within the health care\/social protection system. Evaluation, which would be necessary in view of outcome control and increased effectiveness of the counselling services provided in the hospital, does not occur so far. (Case examples are given to illustrate hospital-based counselling work.)","1630":"The resources and instruments available to the office-practice physician fail to come up to the postulate of \"rehabilitation of the person\". The decentralized system of social protection administration has resulted in areas of competence of medically unclear definition, which is the background of frequent attempts to shift costs on to other institutions. Bureaucratic procedures are highly intricate and lacking in practicality, possibilities for community service provision, for improvement of the labour market situation and for comprehensive care of the disabled are not available to a sufficient degree in the present system.","1631":"The present contribution seeks to outline the counselling possibilities on the part of the company medical service. Starting out from the legal bases (the Act concerning safety at work), the scope for action available internally and externally is examined. Towards the background of the assertion (which is in agreement with numerous other authors) that rehabilitation invariably means teamwork, the author seeks to describe the internally competent authorities and departments in terms of internal team, and to contrast it with the external team involved. A number of opportunities for cooperation are outlined, and already implemented practical approaches are pointed out. The company services are viewed in a community-based rehabilitation context, and the relationships with the financially responsible administrations and their facilities in respect of vocational and medical rehabilitation are set out. Systematic in-plant procedures are explained by a conceptual model, practical implementations (for ex. in the EAM system) are touched on.","1632":"The extensive vocational and employment information and counselling possibilities available in the framework of our social services system in the FRG, are aimed at attaining optimum vocational integration of the disabled clients. The legal foundations are in particular to be found in the Social Code and the rehabilitation adjustment act. Servicing some 80% of all disabled clients in this field, the Federal Employment Institute is the main financially responsible administration in vocational rehabilitation. The services and benefits provided are based on the employment promotion act and the directive of the Institute's governing body concerning industrial and vocational rehabilitation of disabled persons (AReha). Successful vocational counselling outcomes presuppose client participation; counselling contacts are free of charge to the rehabilitee, and are sought on a voluntary basis. The local employment office's medical and\/or psychological services will in many cases by called in by the counsellor. If these services do not arrive at a satisfactory proposal either, vocational assessment and work testing measures in vocational training or retraining centers are indicated. Vocational preparation may in addition be useful, e.g. in the form of promotional courses and\/or pre-rehabilitation courses. The catalogue of services and benefits available is complex and adjustable to individual needs. The rehabilitation measures provided invariably are aimed at achieving entry into long-term employment. When necessary, the disabled clients are followed-along by the counsellors until this goal is attained.","1633":"Based on an overview of the rehabilitation carriers' responsibilities within the social-political system of the Federal Republic of Germany, the contents and organization of counselling by the rehabilitation carriers are set out, along with the approaches taken for staff qualification in this respect. The importance of rehabilitation counselling is pointed out, which, in the face of already discernible labour market and social policy developments, is going to increase even further.","1634":"The factors involved in determining return to work following damage to the lower limbs were analyzed, on the basis of 519 patients (up to age 60) treated at the rehabilitation center of Konstancin, Poland. Correlations were determined between the results obtained in functional testing of pain complaints, movement range, muscle strength, locomotion and general fitness, and the patients' adjustment relative to gainful activity. It was found that the functional rehabilitation therapy carried out had in the majority of patients been appropriate in achieving the goals of treatment, i.e. patients' fitness, their range of movement and locomotion had been affected positively, and the occurrence of pain been reduced. The majority of patients had thus been enabled to return to work. Unsatisfactory outcomes, in the authors' opinion, have to do with severity\/extent of lesion or articular fracture involving torsion, as well as with neglect of early-enough functional rehabilitation therapy, associated with a still frequently encountered, mistaken belief that rehabilitation constitutes the last stage in the post-traumatic treatment process.","1635":"More than 300 patients with asymptomatic hyperuricaemia had been included in lipometabolic analysis performed before and after 4 weeks of a special low-cholesterol, low-triglyceride and low-purine dietetic regimen. Remarkable in almost the entire hyperuricaemic population (96.7%) had been the presence of serum cholesterol levels of more than 200 mg\/dl. Lipoprotein analysis showed that 87% of the patients had increased LDL- and 69% increased VLDL-levels; HDL-levels were pathologically lowered to below 40mg\/dl in 41% of the group. After a four-week rehabilitation programme, all lipometabolic parameters and serum urate concentrations were found to have been significantly reduced by the special diet. The results therefore are impressive proof of the major health benefits of purposive nutritional behaviour.","1636":null,"1637":"The goals to be attained by the patients frequently are determined by the various professions in psychiatry solely before the background of their various specialities. The new observation tool--LOVIPT--is aimed at enabling an integrative approach to be taken, leading from purposive observation of problem behaviour to the formulation of therapy goals. The potential range of objectives is worded in such a way that they can be taken over by other disciplines as well. Development and scientific validation are described in some detail.","1638":"Based on an introductory discussion of aspects involved in the nature of counselling in coronary patients and the problem of linkage between theoretical information and day-to-day living, a concept is set out for theme-centered counselling in the framework of out-patient coronary groups. Coping with the disease experience, reflecting the physical and psychosocial impact of the disease and its sequels, developing revised patterns of behaviour in dealing with stress and strain, as well as reassessing personal philosophies are suggested as essential objectives. Counselling techniques and contents of the approach implemented are outlined on the example of a group in existence for two years. The hitherto most important experience is that support within and by the group is the more effective, the more the group counselling process is pertinent to the social reality experienced by the various participants.","1639":"Rehabilitation preparation is needed to the extent that occupational reorientation may give rise to a multitude of personal insecurities. Increased requirements demand augmented efforts to motivate for independent and competent functioning in the occupational career ahead. Given this aim, the Bad Krozingen rehabilitation center's preparatory programmes, in their entry phase, are focussed on assessment of deficits in competence and on enhancing basic skills--social, educational as well as vocational. The subsequent main phase is aimed at demonstrating the practical applicability of learning contents in future occupational situations, and a reality-based vocational setting is sought to be attained by implementation of a holistic, project-oriented approach in this context in particular. The transition phase, finally, is intended to achieve the individual prerequisites for subsequent rehabilitation activities, in particular training programmes. Initial experience has shown that the approach outlined is promising in particular in respect of independence, social behaviour and motivation for the learning and vocational tasks ahead.","1640":"A phase II facility in the meaning of the federal government's action programme for the advancement of rehabilitation of disabled persons, the Ulm rehabilitation hospital offers a full therapy chain from acute treatment through to vocational rehabilitation measures. The range of services provided by the \"vocational rehabilitation\" department are oriented on the rehabilitees' individual potential, and are supported by a multitude of follow-along medical-therapeutic services. Experience over several years has lead to the conclusion that, obviously, comprehension and integration of the learning contents presented are not contingent on the individual's physical and intellectual capacities alone. A central determining factor for successful programme participation seems to be the personal coping strategy, closely linked with the rehabilitees' fundamental convictions and character. An attitude that attributes success to personal achievement can be contrasted with an attitude that views personal performance as being dependent on inapproachable outside influences, and an underlying optimistic attitude was found to correlate with successful outcome.","1641":"Prevention of and compensation for muscular weaknesses in postural disorders and physical disability are priority tasks of physiotherapy. A range of typical exercises are therefore being used to strengthen weakened groups of muscles, some of them traditionally already included in school sports. Most therapy concepts primarily focus on muscle strengthening, without taking into consideration that it is crucial to redress muscular imbalances by stretching contracted muscle groups as well. Based on this experience, the effectiveness of several specifically modified exercises was tested, derived from the usual range of physiotherapy activities in strengthening very commonly weakened muscle groups, i.e. the abdominal, gluteal, sacrospinalis and shoulder-blade affixing musculature. To increase exercise effectiveness, training machines were used in addition. Stretching exercises were carried out initially, in terms of passive stretching with isometric pre-tension. The following muscle groups were stretched: rectus femoris m., iliopsoas m., pectoralis m., and lumbar sacrospinalis m. Altogether, 64 patients between age 16 and 27 were examined following training therapy, 58 patients presented pure postural disorders, 6 had slight cerebral movement disorders. Two almost equal study groups were formed, one (31 patients) receiving only gymnastic exercises, the other (33 patients) using training machines. The muscular situation was tested after 6 months by means of Janda's semiquantitative muscle-testing. For further objective assessment of therapy outcome, Neugebauer's 'back-index' was determined. Muscular harmony and spinal balance were found to have significantly improved in the second group who had used the training machines. A slight reduction of muscle spasticity in addition was found in the patients with cerebral movement disorders.","1642":"","1643":"Persons with upper limb deficiency do not find it easy to lead a somewhat \"normal\" private, occupational and social life. True, society offers many kinds of assistance and support; it nevertheless is very much a matter of how the individual concerned reacts to the positive and negative influences and imponderabilities encountered. The present report sets out the efforts of a thalidomide-affected young woman who, in the face of numerous obstacles, left nothing untried to create a life basis of her own by obtaining a good vocational qualification as a technical draftswoman, regardless of her congenital upper limb amputation. Her success is proof enough that she chose the right course. This example, in more general terms, should perhaps be considered a prompting for society, on the one hand, to undertake the endeavour of providing quality assistance even in extreme situations and, on the other, to be prepared to have confidence even in those with very severe physical disablement to be able to accomplish goals which at the first glance may appear \"nonsensical\", such as a desire to be trained as a technical draftswoman even though one's hands are missing. The account not least shows the positive impact help and self-help may have in the rehabilitation of very severely disabled persons. The disabled person's reward primarily lies in the sense of independence achieved and in financial self-reliance, which in turn generate a sense of feeling free inwardly and outwardly.","1644":"In 1985, 517 of the 2,486 thalidomide-affected Germans were interviewed by mail questionnaire concerning their educational and vocational situation. 250 usable returns were received, and the sample was found to correspond to the overall thalidomide-affected population in terms of age, sex, and residence, with the exception however of above-average social status and educational levels. 49.4% of the interviewees were gainfully employed, 23.7% students; 17.2% however were unemployed, undergoing retraining, or working in a workshop for the disabled. Contrasted to the German population as a whole, our sample included more university graduates and workers in service sector occupations, and fewer in the crafts or in clerical occupations. Women tended more towards social occupations, men more towards technical ones. On account of their disablement, many of our interviewees were inclined to accept white-collar employment, because their desired vocational objectives had been inaccessible to them due to purely technical difficulties or problems related to rejection by others. 80% nonetheless declared themselves content with their situation, only those in a workshop for the disabled were less satisfied on an average. Contentness was found to be linked more with job satisfaction than with the extent of disablement. About one third of our sample lived with their parents, only four in residential accommodation. More than 75% could be considered independent and needing no outside assistance, with the same share holding a driver's licence. In 90%, the majority of private or occupational contacts, or even all of them, were maintained with nondisabled people. More than 80% considered themselves financially and socially equal to their fellow workers.","1645":"In view of the not inconsiderable numbers of pension insured who have undergone no medical rehabilitation prior to their being pensioned prematurely, the principle of \"rehabilitation comes before pensioning\" hence not being implemented for this population, it is deemed justified to inquire into the causes of this situation. In the framework of the present study of 902 questionnaires returned by office practice physicians, it is presumed that the office practice physician is the controlling agent in inducing appropriate patients at the right time to participate in a rehabilitation measure. The following indicators are presumed to decisively influence this steering function: Attitude towards medical rehabilitation; Disease\/disability-specific experience with medical rehabilitation measures; Satisfaction with the rehabilitation clinic selected by the pension insurance administration; Awareness of the rehabilitation clinics' range of rehabilitative services and the various treatment modalities available; Awareness of pertinent legal provisions; Cooperation between office-practice physician and pension insurance administration.","1646":"Analyzed was the medical documentation of 627 cerebral palsied children who had been treated at the Warsaw rehabilitation center STOCER of Konstancin, Poland. The analysis was to give evidence of how extraordinarily difficult a task the treatment of cerebral palsy is. Notwithstanding months of intensive and complex therapy, major functional gains were observed in only a small percentage of the patient group. Analysis results also illustrate the great importance of the child's intellectual level for the functional improvements that can be achieved. Our observations fully confirm the initially posited thesis that treatment success in these difficult cases can be expected solely in the framework of long-term therapy not only directed at functional development but, which is often decisive, focusses also on intellectual advancement. Improvements therefore presuppose comprehensive treatment based on close cooperation of the physician, physical therapist, educator, social worker, and psychologist, and - most importantly - the child's family. Given the need for long-term treatment and intervention, active involvement of the parents and carers can hardly be overestimated, as any potential progress in the child's functional and intellectual development will to a very high degree depend on their participation and commitment.","1647":"By means of standardized interviews and a self-rating scale, information was obtained from 51 dialysis patients concerning their duration of sleep, fitness, working capacity, interests, quality of life, etc. 34 of the subjects reported sleep disorders: 2 had difficulties falling asleep, 21 in sleeping through, and 11 experienced both. Severity of the sleeping problems increases with prolonged hemodialysis therapy; the same seems to apply to lack of an active lifestyle. 9 patients, apart from repeated nocturnal urination, no longer complained about sleeping problems following kidney transplantation.","1648":"Presented are the concept and initial course of post-graduate training open to graduates of the social sciences (i.e. holding a degree in social education, education, or social science), oriented on the occupational pattern of Rehabilitation Counsellor. The course has been set up in Bremen in cooperation with scientific institutions and rehabilitation facilities. Experience made with the first training course point to a need for specialist-based innovation in particular in the field of vocational rehabilitation.","1649":"Dealt with is the medical profession's legal status in the vocational education and vocational retraining centres. The legal basis for the medical doctor's activities in this type of facilities is clarified, drawing on the legislational history of various rehabilitation-related laws.","1650":"The task of appraising aptitudes and inclinations accompanies a rehabilitee and the rehabilitation workers involved for the entire duration of an occupationally-focussed rehabilitation measure. Explicitly so in vocational guidance measures, it aims at obtaining a sound basis for decision-making in view of vocational reorientation. Responsibility for this decision in the last analysis rests with the rehabilitee himself, an aspect that abolishes any strict separation of aptitude and inclination in predicting outcome in the context of occupational perspectives. Being the decision-making agent, the rehabilitee must therefore be offered typical situational fragments of a possible educational and vocational future, intended on the one hand to inform him of occupational alternatives and, on the other, to provide initial experience. The rehabilitation worker's role in this process requires a client-centered stance in terms of information provider and trusted agent, which is to help avoid an adverse exams climate evolve in this momentous decision-making phase. Psychological testing, from this angle, should be used merely as a supplementary means. The approach outlined for appraisal of individual potentials requires intensive teamwork, not least also in view of verifying individual capacity.","1651":"","1652":"The psychological and neurological disorders as well as psychosocial problems experienced by cardiac patients and their relatives while waiting for coronary artery bypass surgery are outlined, as well as their intrapsychic situation following the operation. With a view to providing long-term psychological support and care of cardiac bypass patients and their relatives, a care model has been developed which emphasizes the following: (1) initial contact and individual counselling immediately following establishment of the indication for surgery (2) client-centered groups to prepare for the operation, involving both the patients and their partners (3) client-centered (therapy)\/relaxation groups for postoperative patients. This model trial is described, covering its development, structure, and contents in some detail. An evaluation is given, as is an explanatory case presentation. The results obtained from 48 cardiac bypass patients in a follow-up study of their views concerning the psychological care provided, are presented in a summary account. Concluding, the authors outline future emphases for practical work and research.","1653":"The Diamed System has been developed to reduce the time-consuming testing routines involved in psychopathometric studies of disease course in the field of medicine. Test administration was to be relieved of those activities, in particular in repeat testing, examiners experienced as weary, unpleasant, repetitive, and uncreative. An important aim had been to permit data collection by as independent a dialogue as possible between the patient and the micro-computer, and extremely simple operations and instructions were considered of great importance. The opportunity has, however, also been utilized to implement promising performance testing procedures for measuring basic parameters of mental capability. Beside mental-amnestic capacity, the procedures cover subjective complaints because these, too, frequently are relevant in measuring the course of psychic disorders. The procedures incorporated in the Diamed System permit reliability verifications as to whether self-assessment and independent computerized testing might not be asking too much of the patients intellectually. Most of the procedures will be used for studying disease course in acute Organic Psychosyndromes and in all disorders that are associated with changes in mood and\/or with subjective complaints. Diagnostic assistance moreover is offered for determining the presence of acute Organic Psychosyndromes. Under the name of \"brain jogging\", an economical programme is introduced for mental training, aimed at maintaining and improving basic central information processing capacities. Its effect on intelligence and memory has been demonstrated on in-patient populations, both with and without brain-organic disorders. Notably in the case of acute Organic Psychosyndromes, it has turned out to be an effective supplement to drug treatment.","1654":"Type and frequency of anticonvulsive drug treatment have been analyzed in the case of 1154 mentally retarded adults. Compared with international studies, anticonvulsive drug prevalence is low and amounts to 23.0% in the institutionalized group and 11.9% in the noninstitutionalized. Anticonvulsive drug prevalence decreases significantly with increasing age. A comparison of the 1986 anticonvulsive medication with that of 1980 shows distinctly rarer prescription of phenytoin and phenobarbital, and a decrease in the treatment with three or more different anticonvulsants in favour of treatment with only one or two anticonvulsive drugs in 1986.","1655":"An essential prerequisite for integrating disabled persons is their mobility. The special transport approach, both in terms of handling capacity and cost involved, is increasingly turning out to be unable to achieve future-oriented solutions in this context. Disabled people wish to use the transport services available to the general public. They therefore demand public transportation policies to provide for their access to the mainstream system, ideally independent of outside assistance. Deutsche Bundesbahn, the German federal railways, in the field of tension between the need to orient its business policies on economic and financial considerations and disabled persons' demands that vehicles and premises be designed in a barrier-free manner, seeks to achieve solutions that are responsive to users' needs and at the same time economically justifiable. On account of the 19th century infrastructure legacy and a wide range of rolling stock in long- and short-distance rail travel, this can however be realized only step by step. The facilities offered to disabled people so far range from free use of short-distance trains to the accessibility-oriented design of coaches for the Intercity Express, the future of the railways in the European rapid transit network. The various services and facilities provided are hoped to foster disabled persons' decision in favour of the environmentally compatible rail mode of travelling.","1656":"Two study populations were examined, one for obtaining a frequency distribution of incapacity for work periods, the other for tracing the qualitative aspects of incapacity for work cases. Quantitative appraisal showed that 16% of all cases accounted for 49% of total incapacity time. Qualitative (microanalytic) appraisal of these 16% traced but a few disease groups responsible, amply dealt with in literature on chronic conditions. A shortcoming of apparently rather minor relevance in the individual case, has moreover been found to be systematic: prolonged incapacity for work periods inadequately explained by the diagnoses given on the incapacity certificate. Not least for this reason, appraisal by the insurance medical examination service should occur after three months at the latest. The criteria for initial selection are outlined in terms of three months incapacity for work, frequent recurrence of incapacity periods, and a catalogue of a few diagnostic groups.","1657":null,"1658":"Following above-knee amputation in aged persons, rehabilitative measures have to be initiated already by the acute-care clinic, inter alia because lack of movement fosters physical and mental decline. Energy consumption in walking with an above-knee prosthesis moreover is considerably higher than in the non-amputated. The rehabilitation counsellor is called upon to determine the most promising route in view of an acceptable long-term outcome. Our aim following wound healing is that of early prosthetic provision to enable the old patient to return to his familiar surroundings. Before taking a decision as to prosthetic and\/or wheelchair management, numerous parameters must be critically analyzed and appraised. These are dealt with in some detail in the present article. In case of prosthetic management, the model used should reflect current levels, and be supplied in the raw to permit convenient implementation of necessary corrections. General physical as well as gait training are of great significance. Selection of a wheelchair should be a matter of individualized prescription. The above-knee amputee must be viewed from his whole personality, i.e. rehabilitation not only refers to looking after the stump but has to consider the entire person. An essential role is played here by the individual's social environment.","1659":"","1660":"Our working world cannot be pictured anymore without computers of all kinds and sizes - which renders them equally relevant to the field of rehabilitation to disabled people. What is less known and accepted is the fact that the computer constitutes a technical device excellently suited for a multitude of purposes in the day-to-day life of disabled persons. Commercially available devices and programmes frequently can be used directly, and adaptations of earlier developments can be transferred with only minor modification. The present contribution is intended to give an idea of currently available, practical experience-based possibilities for highly efficient, and at the same time economical, provision of technical aids making use of personal computers.","1661":"Presented are the findings of an examination of 28 students from the secondary school sector, level I, grades 7-9, undertaken at the special school for children with developmental disorders (= behavioural disorders) at the Fritz-Gansberg-Street in Bremen. Results show that the students, who generally speaking not only are known to display socially deviant behaviour but often also suffer from minimal brain dysfunction (MCD) and, occasionally, organic cerebral damage, increasingly \"neglect themselves\" in a medical sense, in particular relative to uncontrolled consumption of drugs and neglect of their overall physical development. Pertinent special educational problems should therefore not be dealt with within the school alone, but should equally be addressed from a social or even preventive medicine angle. Close cooperation between teachers at special schools and medical doctors should therefore be sought, and possibly introduction of outpatient services at the school or initiation of doctor\/school sponsorships.","1662":"Reported is the evaluation of a computer-directed training programme for visual attention, that is based on the results of experimental studies by Zubin (1975) and Shakow (1979). With reference to Zubin's model, this training programme addresses active maintenance of selective visual attention (in terms of \"sustained attention\"), applying Shakow's diagnostic research paradigm (with a preparatory stimulus, an RT stimulus, and a variable preparatory interval) in a behavioural setting (learning of strategies for attention) for clinical purposes. In a pre-post-study carried out for a three-week programme, the results of single case experiments showed a significant decrease of reaction time variability, which partly persisted in follow-up studies. It was found that attentional performance increased in both psychotic patients and patients with cerebral dysfunction. In the second phase of statistical validation on patients with psychotic attention deviations, both attention performance and transfer effects were verified. The behavioural training methods, which were implemented to foster attention, proved helpful in the majority of cases. For greater practicability, a programme version for use on the home computer has been developed. The study on the whole illustrates the growing utilization of computer technology in neuropsychological rehabilitation.","1663":"Since January 1, 1986 all our diabetes mellitus patients have participated in a structured diabetes education programme of two weeks duration. A systematic review of 260 diabetic patients treated by us up to June 30, 1987, has shown that only 25 (9.6%) had been suitably informed about their disease. Necessary therapeutic consequences, such as strict dietetic measures, additional insulin therapy or intensified conventional insulin therapy, were more readily understood and accepted after the education course. The basic conditions present in a specialized rehabilitation clinic are more favourable in view of good longterm metabolic control than in the acute hospital or in general practice.","1664":"The personality changes frequently observed in the wake of craniocerebral trauma are a serious impediment to psychosocial rehabilitation of those concerned. Based on empirical research, the present contribution is intended as a pleading for adoption of a multidisciplinary and multidimensional approach to personality change post craniocerebral trauma, taking the dynamic complexities involved into consideration. The current, stereotyped characterizations of the changes of personality caused by organic brain damage have not been confirmed for the patient population investigated by us. Crucial to avoidance of a rigid, static view of the personality changes is direct inclusion of the familial and social environment in the process of diagnosis and rehabilitation of the person with craniocerebral trauma. As exemplified by a case analysis described, it is possible, above all, to trace the systemic-etiological forces active in determining the nature and contents of the personality changes, in stabilizing or reinforcing them.","1665":"The limitations faced by purely clinical facilities in providing comprehensive rehabilitation for long-term schizophrenic patients having been made increasingly clear by a changing labour market, the Department of Social Psychiatry's community mental health system had already in 1978 been extended to include a work therapy shop, i.e., a printing shop geared to general economic conditions. This effort of integrating various rehabilitative activities \"under one roof\" within the workshop while maintaining the continuity of medical treatment, is discussed by a synoptical presentation of findings from quantitative und qualitative analysis. It has been possible to show that a wide spectrum of graded rehabilitative activities can be implemented successfully in a well-defined, work life oriented setting. Given close linkages of the workshop with a structured, comprehensive care system, the advantages inherent in integrating medical, vocational, and psychosocial rehabilitation efforts obviously outweigh the disadvantages of insufficient specificity and diversification.","1666":"Psychiatric clinics report great difficulties in motivating patients, on successful completion of medical rehabilitation and vocational therapy, to file an application for vocational rehabilitation. And if they do so, the mentally ill persons more frequently then other disabled persons break off the vocational rehabilitation measures taken. After a two year discussion process, a study group in Berlin (West), which consisted of representatives of different institutions involved in vocational rehabilitation, have published a memorandum stating the central obstacles for mentally ill persons to enter and remain in a \"Workshop for Disabled.\" Proposals are made how to improve the situation.","1667":"23 employers, who had hired 26 psychiatric patients coming from the vocational rehabilitation workshop of the social-psychiatric university clinic in Bern (Switzerland), were questioned about the performance and behaviour of these patients. Secondly, they were asked about their experience in cooperating with the psychiatric caretaking service provided. The employers seemed to be very motivated in helping to reintegrate mentally ill patients. They have acquired an astonishing amount of knowledge in dealing with patients and with problems emerging at work. They expressed interest in more contact with psychiatrists and other caretakers, and in more information about mental illness. The authors conclude that employers should be contacted more often and that in particular the treating psychiatrist could support and further motivate employers, which would certainly be helpful for the employed patient.","1668":"Reported are the results obtained in assessing young brain-injured patients of a rehabilitation hospital (N = 39, male subjects). \"Vocational therapists\" had evaluated the patients relative to achievement and achievement motivation variables, and results of routine performance testing had also been available. The KEMB (Konstanzer Erfolgs-Misserfolgs-Batterie--Constancy success-failure battery) was administered in addition. Vocational therapists' ratings and KEMB findings permit the conclusion that the less severely disabled patients tend to hold unrealistically high objectives. Whereas results were found to be consistent in this patient group even across the different methods used for evaluating achievement motivation variables, this did not apply to the more severely disabled subjects. For this latter group, the KEMB achievement motivation findings show hardly any relation with the achievement motivation ratings given, but, rather, with specific performance tests used in organic brain damage and with duration of the condition. It seems that achievement motivation can in the less severely disabled subjects be understood in its usual sense; those with more severe disability on the other hand seem to strongly orientate their motivation on the specific deficits associated with the organic brain damage, thus arriving at possibly more reality-adjusted objectives. KEMB and progress in general performance within the rehabilitation programme--especially in the more severely disabled patients--are found to correlate much closer then is the case for the various performance tests administered routinely for outcome prediction.","1669":"","1670":"","1671":"The selection of workplaces for disabled people requires the matching of their abilities with the requirements of potential workplaces. Such a comparison may occur in particular by directly contrasting abilities and job demands, for instance by profile comparison. Abilities are thereby described in terms of job demands and recorded in standardized items. In a synopsis of 13 existing job\/person evaluation techniques it was to be ascertained which items are used for assessment of abilities and job demands and how detailed the various sections of abilities and job demands are recorded. For reasons of perspicuity the items used in the various techniques were grouped in 10 different sections. It turned out that the sections \"work environment\" and \"movements of parts of the body\" were in general emphasized most. Finally, the different sections are emphasized and subdivided differently in the various techniques, according to their scope (such as employment agencies, personnel planning, job design) and their range of applicability (to one company\/different companies, to different branches of industry, etc.). The criteria of universality, completeness and acceptance are discussed in terms of devising an assessment technique.","1672":"","1673":"Placing persons having a mental illness in the open labour market has in recent years become increasingly difficult. The question therefore arises whether an attempt should be made to improve occupational access through rehabilitative measures, or whether pensioning would not be the more appropriate action. In the framework of a prospective 5-year catamnestic study of first-admission psychiatric patients, the course taken by them was investigated, as well as the factors that had been relevant in the decision to pension the patients, or to provide rehabilitative services. It was found that pensioning and rehabilitative measures differ in no essential degree as to their shares, and that both types of approach had occurred in only very few cases. Disease-specific factors (psychopathological symptoms, readmission) are suggested to be involved concerning the route taken. Pensioning on the one hand, and rehabilitation service provision on the other, are linked with the age and diagnoses of the patients, as well as the extent of their social activities.","1674":"From the socio-economic point of view, early prediction of outcome after stroke is of essential value. The longterm prognosis of 310 patients suffering from ischemic stroke, was therefore investigated by means of questionnaires. The mean follow-up period was 62.5 (S.D. 21.9) months. The results of patients who had suffered cerebrovascular accidents other than ischemic stroke or only transient ischemic attacks were not included. It had been the aim of the study to determine the predictive value of some clinical variables and symptoms in the subacute stage as regards the familial and social functioning handicaps to be expected later on. Between the number of strokes as well as the severity of some clinical signs (motor deficits, sensory deficits, speech disorders, organic mental syndrome) on the one hand, and the restrictions experienced in familial functioning on the other hand, a clear cut correlation was found. As regards social functioning, two additional predictors of unfavourable outcome could be identified: age, and lesion within the left hemisphere. The findings indicate that some clinical variables and symptoms in the subacute stage are of great predictive value concerning the ensuing handicap in familial and social functioning. These variables may help to develop individual strategies as regards the further social management and support (e.g. discharge arrangements, care services, rehabilitation programs).","1675":"Between Oct. 1984 and March 1985, a total of 120 former patients of our clinic were visited at home or in residential facilities for care of the elderly, and interviewed by a physician and a social scientist regarding their current health and psychosocial situation. All patients had had a primary diagnosis of stroke, and had been discharged from hospital an average 16 months ago. The sample comprised 44 men (36.7%) and 76 women (63.3%), the average age was 74.8 years, average length of hospitalization 48.6 days. The study results presented show that (even in cases where the treatment in a rehabilitation clinic is viewed in positive terms) the rehabilitation process as a whole cannot be regarded as completed; instead, continuation of aftercare by provision of differentiated assistance and support to the ex-patients, their relatives, and the farther social environment must be considered; this includes assistance with home care; support of family self-help efforts; effective use of available social services; continued provision of physical and, above all, speech therapy; and, finally, increased involvement and linkages of self-help activities (self-help groups) with other providers of aftercare.","1676":"79 patients with ischaemic stroke were investigated, with 31 patients showing a pure hemiparesis, 22 an additional depressive syndrome and 26 a dementia. After an average time intervall of 28 months, a follow-up investigation was performed on these 3 groups relative to their course and rehabilitation outcome. No significant differences were present between the 3 groups as regards age and sex distribution as well as hemisyndrome severity. The neurological and psychiatric findings at follow-up differed significantly from the primary findings. Also, significant differences were found in the degree of disability, and in the self- and family ratings of rehabilitation outcome, with a poorer long-term course, i.e. a higher degree of disability, significantly more frequent in the dementia group. Comparison of self- and family-ratings showed that self-ratings given were significantly worse in the dementia and depressive groups, whereas patients with purely neurological symptoms rated themselves better than their relatives did.","1677":"Between 1983 and 1986, a total of 1012 patients were treated in our rehabilitation clinic after intervertebral disc surgery, either admitted shortly post op, or at a later time. Males outweighed females in proportion by 56 vs. 44%; the average age at surgery was 44 yrs. for male, and 42 yrs for female patients. 966 patients (95%) had undergone lumbar surgery, 46 (5%) surgery in the cervical region; 12% of the patients were operated twice and 2% for a third time. Except for those admitted shortly post-surgery, an average period of 6 to 7 months elapsed between the family doctor's, or specialist's, application for a rehabilitation measure and admission to the rehabilitation clinic. Average duration of incapacity for work totalled 6.2 months (males 5.6 months, females 6.8 months). Of the 228 patients with \"incapable for work\" status on admission to the clinic, 160 were discharged home capable for work, another 34 were recommended for work trial. The remaining 34 patients were referred back to the acute clinics for further diagnosis, or renewed surgery. The advantages of in-patient rehabilitation measures, among them post-surgery postural etc. training (\"back training\"), are set out, along with ways how the rehabilitative procedures should be dovetailed with the course of management.","1678":null,"1679":"A questionnaire inquiry was carried out with the Psychological Services of the Vocational Training Centres in the Federal Republic of Germany, directed at their fields of work and their position within the facility. The Psychological Services invariably are involved in the admission procedure, and counselling as well as therapeutic work, individual and in groups, have become a firmly established focus alongside their traditional diagnostic tasks. Aspects of supervision are increasingly being used as new methods of personnel development. Though staffing has improved since 1977, great variations still exist between the various centres, and our findings clearly point out the gaps in service provision related with lower client\/psychologist ratios. Following introduction and consolidation of the Psychological Services, a phase of re-orientation seems to be under way, with special attention to focus on interactional processes within the facilities, on implementation of rehabilitation objectives, and on entry of clients with chronic mental impairment.","1680":"A mail survey of clinics in the Federal Republic of Germany revealed that aphasia assessment is performed primarily by speech &amp; language pathologists, and medical specialists. Psychologists, linguists, and speech educators, on the other hand, are involved to a much lesser degree in the process of aphasia diagnosis. Diagnosticians primarily rely on psychometric aphasia testing. Utilization of these procedures appears to be motivated by their high degree of formalization, which facilitates diagnostic objectivity, and by the good selection, syndrome classification, and severity determination this entails. Criticism is directed at the structural complexity of the tests, insufficient economy, their restricted scope, and insufficient coverage of non-language defect syndromes. Psychometric aphasia testing in many cases is used in combination with other, clinical (i.e. non-standardized) aphasia testing procedures, the advantages of the latter appearing to make up for the disadvantages in the psychometric procedures. Despite their shortcomings of not permitting adequate checks on aphasia course, use of these other procedures is held to be justified in that they are economical to administer; have a broad range of application, i.e. are useable also in acute or very severe conditions; cover non-language disorders, and, finally, are therapy-oriented. Field workers in the survey sample insist on having available both the psychometric and clinical procedures. For those involved in constructing aphasia assessment procedures, this indicates a need for developments in both \"directions\", which obviously are complementary to each other. Action theoretical criteria may be useful in elaborating clinical procedures.","1681":"To obtain further insights into the rehabilitation outlook in different baseline conditions, a comparison was made of data and treatment outcomes in 92 patients having aphasias of different etiology and disease duration. Rating as \"improved\" was contingent on significant changes in at least 2 subtests of the AAT (Aachener Aphasietest), which is a fairly stringent requirement. This criterion was met by some 35% of the patients overall, independent of their age; the percentage increased to 45% in case of treatment onset during the first year, while in later onset, significant improvement was achieved in 15% only. Aphasic syndromes secondary to hemorrhage, trauma, tumors, or infections, usually are less severe than the predominant classical syndromes, i.e. Global, Broca and Wernicke aphasia, caused by ischemic stroke. CT lesion size did not yield any definite information. Minor improvements below the required significance levels, and, above all, gains in communication performance, i.e. further consolidation, could be achieved by appropriate management even after the crucial initial year, which, however, does not imply any fundamental changes in the rehabilitation prognosis as such.","1682":"The right hemisphere syndrome is considered an area bordering on neurology, psychology, and psychiatry, a field today referred to as \"neuropsychology\". This syndrome as a rule is secondary to a right-hemisphere stroke, and in particular involves spatial disorders and constructional apraxia. Among the spatial disorders, the so-called neglect syndrome can be distinguished, i.e. unilateral spatial disorders pertinent to the left side. The right hemisphere syndrome constitutes an impairment of identification, of synthesizing perceptions that the sense organs, notably the eyes, deliver to the brain. It therefore is not a disturbance of perception, but of the processing of sensory information. The sense organs usually are intact, and there is no dementia. The so-called right hemisphere syndrome is not of scientific interest alone. Rather, in view of appropriate patient management and of not mistaking patients for demented or uncooperative, this syndrome must be diagnosed and treated in an early enough stage. Given correct diagnosis and treatment, the prognostic outlook is better in this syndrome than in the purely motor conditions.","1683":"Our slogan of rehabilitation to be \"holistic and permanent\", in terms of its holistic aspect, expresses inclusion of the patient's total environment--relatives, politics, administration, legislation. The aspect of permanence may involve periods of many years, and is not amenable to standardization; meaningful limitation is subject to the individual needs, based on critical scientific follow-along of rehabilitation. The emergence of \"rehabilitation hospitalism\" may best be prevented by proper attention to the patient's emotional situation and social environment, with special regard also to experiences of frustration, to regressive tendencies, \"associated depression\". Well-versed rehabilitative management should therefore include the dimensions of pleasure and diversity. We have been able to realize some of the above in the \"Vorarlberg Rehabilitation Model\", in terms, on the one hand, of the scientific identity of rehabilitation, and of individualized, optimum patient-orientedness on the other. An important step forward has moreover been the inauguration of a \"Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Neuro-Rehabilitation and -Prevention\" at the Landes-Nervenkrankenhaus Valduna, of Rankweil, Austria.","1684":"In the framework of a prospective longitudinal investigation, the occupational course of first-admission psychiatric patients was analyzed for the first year (1980) and the fifth (1984) post-discharge from the clinic. Findings indicate that, to quite an important degree, tendencies towards occupational disintegration had existed already immediately after the first in-patient treatment episode. This applied almost totally independent of the clinical diagnosis given at the time of the first hospitalization. Only persons with substance abuse illness had been affected clearly less often, the situation four years later being however comparable. Except for the groups of neurotic and personality disorders, the occupational situation had by then however tightened drastically for all of the diagnostic groups, a structural analysis making it clear that this development had initiated already in the course of the first year. Thus, all patients who had been without work over the entire first year of the five-year period, had already reached the \"terminal point\" in their employment history. As far as diagnoses are concerned, our study confirms the experience that a schizophrenic illness will by no means always entail a straight course toward an unfavourable outcome. The investigation at the same time however also indicated that non-schizophrenic illnesses take a more unfavourable course than had been expected. In relation to earlier longitudinal catamnestic studies of persons with schizophrenia, the findings for our schizophrenic patients moreover were markedly worse, this discrepancy being presumed to be accounted for by the different methods applied, different selection criteria, as well as differences in economic activity at the time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1685":"The numbers of in-patient rehabilitation procedures immediately following the post-acute stage, i.e. of the Anschlussheilbehandlungen AHB, have been steadily increasing over the last few years. Their share in the total number of general rehabilitation measures has meanwhile risen to almost 10 percent. The pension insurance carriers' fulfillment of their legal task of maintaining, or improving, the earning capacity of the insured, is verified on appropriate data. The present study covers those insured of the LVA Baden, the workers' pension insurance administration for the region of Baden, who had completed an AHB measure in the three years 1982-1984. Results obtained show that 60-70 percent of the participants in such an AHB measure subsequently returned to employment. Pensioning occurred most frequently in myocardial infarction patients, i.e. in 40 percent of all cases, and least frequently in patients with musculoskelettal disorders, i.e. in 25 percent. The pension insurance administrations have undoubtedly chosen a very appropriate route in introducing the AHB measure. It will, on behalf of the patients, be necessary and useful not to end the rehabilitative efforts on the day of discharge. Provision of follow-up care should be included in the AHB approach.","1686":"Presented are results from the project \"Post-placement-services at the workplace for persons with mental illness and mental disability\". Its goals and tasks have been to support mentally disabled clients in the process of occupational reintegration, to assist them in case of threatening dismissal, to mediate and clarify in case of problems at work. Over a period of two years, 208 clients participated in the project, most of them after discharge from in-patient psychiatric treatment. The description of the project's approach focusses on the industrial situation, setting out the possibilities and limitations of industrial rehabilitation.","1687":"Sports activities in the vocational education centres are viewed as an indispensable rehabilitation measure. Its contents and organizational structure however is to a large extent left to the individual centres. Implementation of effective sports is endangered by the lack of homogeneity in the young trainee population as regards type and severity of the disability, age, maturity. After setting out the present situation and the function of sports in a vocational education centre for physically disabled young people, a school course system is presented that, by achieving a relatively homogenous composition of the sports groups, enables sport-oriented instruction to be realized. In this course system, the young people are allocated to the various courses through sport selection and counselling, based on the criteria of inclination and suitability. The range of sports offered also includes sports for the very severely handicapped, which are described briefly.","1688":"Directed primarily at preventive and compensatory objectives, sports activities in the framework of vocational education are intended to enhance essentially the physical and psychic well-being of the young people in later employment. They even involve goals that are pertinent to occupational qualification. The reality of motor promotion of disabled young trainees through sports, however, does look unfavorable. Physical-motor deficits in the trainees, explained in terms of their particular biography, make up for an additional, acquired problem that can have far-reaching implications for their occupational future. Difficulties in view of systematic promotion, as well as possibilities and initial efforts towards improvement, are dealt with on the example of the vocational education centre for physically disabled young people of the Annastift, Hannover. Intensive motor promotion in more severely disabled young people during their vocational training has entailed noticably favourable results relative to coordination and physical fitness. Besides its effect of general activation, comprehensive, holistic sports-motor training above all seems to have a generalized effect on everyday and work-related tasks (such as gripping, walking).","1689":"Work therapy (Arbeitstherapie) has become an intermediate link between medical and vocational rehabilitation. It is distinct from insurable employment primarily in that it is guided by a medical treatment plan directed at the rehabilitative needs of the patient. Delimitation problems as against insurable employment mostly occur due to the requirement that the work therapy setting should be realistic. This entails a risk of abuse. Where work therapy is provided in practice, greater note should be taken of today's degree of differentiation in vocational rehabilitation, which has made available a great many avenues so that direct provision of vocational measures to the patient may be more meaningful. Preparatory vocational rehabilitation services may be considered if the patient's working capacity needs to be improved and is amenable to goal-directed enhancement. It is not necessary that this should occur in courses. It, rather, can also be done through individual measures. And it is moreover possible to include general education goals in an occupation-related manner.","1690":"It is initially outlined that cancer diseases have serious implications for the psychic well-being and the social relationships of those affected, and that disease experience and coping are influenced in an intricate manner by a variety of factors. The independence of social work, and its importance, in the field of cancer aftercare become evident in its focussing activities on the social dimension of the disease, i.e., the individual life situation of the client, and in devising varied forms of social support. The importance of social relationships and social integration for success, or failure, of the process of adjusting to the disease-related changes in the life situation are stressed. Successful adjustment is considered an essential prerequisite for securing, or restoring, a maximum level of quality of life, thus also for enhancing the recovery process.","1691":"The effects of a course of music therapy with free improvisation, consisting of 27 sessions over a period of 6 months, were examined in a controlled study of matched therapy and waiting group, each comprising 7 patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective psychosis. The psychopathologic picture having essentially remained unaltered on the measuring instrument used (Lorr scales), significant positive changes were found in the self-assessment questionnaires completed by the participants. Improvements in recreational and social behaviours could not be shown. The disease and reintegration processes took similarly positive courses in both groups, supported by the extensive range of psychiatric\/psychotherapeutic services available in the Munich area. The improvising orientation of the music therapy course had mostly been approved of by the patients, it however also gave rise to a desire for more structuring and a more goal-directed therapeutic approach. A tendency towards the initial values, i.e. a deterioration, was stated in the therapy group at follow-up six months post-therapy.","1692":"The general framework of vocational rehabilitation has changed since introduction, in 1970, of the federal government's action programme to promote rehabilitation efforts. While the vocational education centres are major providers of vocational rehabilitation services, it has so far been omitted to adjust their mandate to these changed overall conditions. This reassessment is urgently required to be able, among others, to answer the following questions: Will it be necessary for the vocational education centres to offer occupationally qualifying alternatives outside the Vocational Education Act? Will another task accrue to the centres in the framework of the \"upgrading offensive\", by providing continuing vocational education to jobless disabled people? How could the gap between client functioning levels and occupational demands be eliminated? Which will be the future position of vocational education centres within the overall vocational education system? After setting out the changed overall framework, the present article seeks to outline the perspectives ahead.","1693":"The risk factors for occurrence of pressure sores--pressure, temperature and humidity--were measured in extensive tests on commercially available wheelchair designs. The effects of different chair positions on the strain and pressure distribution on the backrest, seat surface and foot rests were recorded on a universally adjustable experimental chair. In order to appraise the influence of various types of handicaps, the experiments were conducted with paraplegic, spastic and hemiplegic subjects. It became evident from the results obtained that the currently used suspension belt chairs display serious deficiencies, inherent in their construction principle. Above all, they do not offer an adequately large support area to handicapped persons with severe atrophy of the gluteal muscle. Also, a backrest shape with lumbar pad, as requested by physiologists and orthopaedic surgeons, is technically difficult to realize. Considerable improvements with respect to pressure distribution and orthopaedically correct support of the seated patient can be achieved by using a shell seat construction. In order to enable the handicapped person to use various sitting postures, the backrest should be provided with a rotary joint to the sitting surface.","1694":"","1695":"There is an increasing frequency of lumbar disc surgery in many countries. In the Federal Republic of Germany, many patients are admitted to in-patient rehabilitation immediately after surgery, which causes additional socioeconomic costs. In order to assess the efficiency of this therapy approach, we used the MOPO Scales, a thoroughly evaluated instrument describing patient health status in both its physical and psychosocial dimensions. In 79 patients who had been followed-up over six months post-discharge from in-patient rehabilitation, a significant increase in mobility, physical activity, activities of daily living, household activities, and social activities was found, as well as a significant decrease in pain, depression and anxiety. These results prove lumbar disc surgery combined with immediate post operative rehabilitation to be efficient.","1696":"Clinical neuropsychology has so far mostly been concerned with theoretical aspects of the brain-behavior relationship, as well as the diagnosis of cognitive deficits after brain damage. Only very recently has cognitive rehabilitation of the brain injured patient become a major area of interest in neuropsychology, and computer-assisted therapy of higher cortical functions is playing an increasing role especially in the United States. A survey found that 73% of the rehabilitation centers included were using computers in delivering their cognitive rehabilitation therapy, major areas of computer-assisted therapy being deficits of eye-hand coordination, attention, concentration, orientation, visual-spatial processing, memory, discrimination, problem solving, and concept formation. Treatment of speech disorders using computers is so far limited but will improve when more efficient language analyzers and synthesizers become available. More powerful microcomputers will lead to both computer-assisted and computer-managed cognitive programs, which allow for maximum flexibility and individualization of treatment. Computer use in cognitive rehabilitation should be subject to supervision by a therapist, and the following requirements should be met: 1) detailed diagnostic analysis of the differential cognitive performance pattern of a patient; 2) individual adaptation of computer peripherals to achieve optimum patient-computer-interaction; 3) selection and adaptation of therapy software to match the individual cognitive performance profile of a patient. Cognitive computer therapy appears to be most profitable in the rehabilitation phase and in post-rehabilitation treatment.","1697":null,"1698":"Theoretical considerations in, and an exemplary instance of, group speech therapy with aphasic patients are submitted for discussion. Contrary to current practice, individual and group therapy are considered of equal rank, as all aspects of speech and language can be realized in the latter, with both approaches having similar goals. Group work contents is characterized as verbal coping with guided verbal tasks. Group composition is recommended to emphasize speech and language criteria, as opposed to social and psychosocial criteria. Also dealt with is the position of the speech therapist.","1699":"Twenty patients presenting functional syndromes of various kinds, localizations and severities without any tangible anatomic-morphological causes having been found, were treated on the basis of behavioural self-direction. Self-rating instruments were used for therapy control. Following a mean 45-61 sessions of individual therapy, highly significant reductions were stated in respect of the probable occurrence of the usually extensive symptoms. This positive outcome was found to persist at follow-up twelve months later. This management approach turned out a very economical one. Further investigations appear indicated.","1700":"Presented is a newly developed rehabilitation survey scale for the field of neuro-rehabilitation, in which levels of functioning relative to ten specific and four global functions are documented at set intervalls by means of a five-grade rating scale. Additionally, numerous symptoms or associated phenomena are recorded ungraded. Used in the clinical setting, this scale affords a quick overview of the rehabilitation profile, with relatively little time and effort being required. Scientific evaluation may uncover information on the impact the disorders of specific functions have on global functions, which is relevant primarily in the social context. Also, the scale may be applied in the framework of larger-scale comparative studies. Dealt with in an extensive discussion, our newly presented scale may be accorded a number of advantages over currently used scales, which warrant its introduction. It is the outcome of many years of developmental work and pertaining reliability verifications.","1701":"A mobile respiratory aid has been developed for a 7-year-old child in cooperation with the Institute for Electromechanical Construction of Darmstadt Technical University. Born prematurely in week 27 with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, she has thus been enabled to leave the ward without any major technical difficulties, opening up numerous opportunities for development to the child notwithstanding her continuing dependence on the breathing aid. The robust, handy device weights less than 10 kg, and is housed in an aluminum case the size of a briefcase. It is battery-driven, a charging lasting for some 7 to 8 hours of operation. All parts subject to wear, such as filter, tubings, and bellows, are commercially available through the medical equipment market. Reported is a period of use of more than 2000 hours, and it is hoped that other pediatric centres looking after children with similar problems will cooperate in further developing this mobile CPAP respiratory aid.","1702":"It had been particularly noticeable in the post-war years that a surprisingly large number of women who had undergone cancer treatment (mostly for uterine and breast cancer) had to be readmitted in poor general health soon after their initial discharge home. Although the full treatment regimen then available was applied (such as blood transfusions, vitamin-glucose-infusions, and antibacterial medication), a larger number of deaths occurred, without any trace being found of the presence of residual cancer, early recidive, or second carcinoma. Close medical observation, finally, lead us to conclude that these patients' stamina had been too deeply undermined to be able to overcome the disease and treatment aftermath, caused mainly by chronic under-nourishment, both quantitatively and qualitatively, by often disastrous housing conditions (in refugee camps, cellars, etc.), the emotional strain experienced due to death or imprisonment of the closest relatives, and, in particular, by the resulting obligation to maintain the family, usually through work under very strenuous conditions, as well as by flight and hence loss of the accustomed environment. In cooperation with the social security administrations, these insights brought about the provision of \"convalescent cures\" of 4-6 weeks duration, with repeat health resort treatments being possible till the end of the third year post-discharge. Again involving the social security institutes, these measures, in the process of our growing knowledge of fact and inter-relationships, were extended to become the disease-specific aftercare treatment provided in rehabilitation clinics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1703":"Some 40 accredited aftercare clinics are available for inpatient cancer aftercare, since 1981 also for immediately post-acute treatment courses. These clinics are used for both, the frequent physical treatment aftermath from oncological diseases in the otological or gynaecological field, and for psychic stabilization when psychosocial problems arise. Participation in autogeneous relaxation training, yoga, and\/or psychotherapeutic services are found to entail improved disease coping. Concrete patient care expectancies primarily center around movement therapy, lymphatic drainage (in breast carcinoma), speech therapy (in laryngectomees), pain control, but are also directed at psychosocial care in terms of achieving\" inner calmness and relaxation\". Given the age distribution seen, increasing the quality of life takes priority over restoration of the working capacity.","1704":"Individually adapted, functional office furniture is not only capable of making physically or sensorily handicapped persons more independent but also enhances their performance. These effects combine to bring about greater personal freedom, making it unnecessary for the handicapped individual to ask for help ever so often. Different types of disability may require totally different technical solutions. The present contribution deals with various office furniture programmes adapted specifically to the needs of certain types of handicap, such as those of wheelchair users, visually impaired or blind persons, hand amputees, or cerebral palsied persons. Examples are described of disability-adapted office designs both for training purposes and workplaces, including CAD or a specifically designed arrangement for technical drawing with the feet. The main objective is to show that individual functional losses can already be compensated for to a large extent by proper selection of commercially available furniture and workplace design.","1705":"Some 30.5 million Germans hold a driving license. For the person with a physical handicap, too, active traffic participation is of special importance, in that it constitutes an essential link in his rehabilitation. Road traffic authorities, in view of traffic safety, are held to consider both, the handicapped individual's interest in obtaining a license and society's claim to safety. Numerous studies have established the fact that disabled drivers, in particular those with impairment of the limbs, are neither more accident-prone nor otherwise more conspicious in road traffic than the non-disabled. The view that the driver with a physical disability poses particular risks, has been invalidated by extensive factual data and thorough literature review. Diseases of major relevance for driving ability are touched on, the range of adaptive equipment is exemplified. Physicians in accident surgery primarily have to deal with trauma to the spinal cord and limbs. The majority of these conditions permit good compensation by technical devices, enabling safe driving of a private car. Awareness of legal\/administrative aspects of licensing, as well as of the adaptive potential of technical aids are of great importance to both physician and client.","1706":"Services for mentally retarded adults have undergone major changes over the past 15 years in the United States of America. Through the impact of \"normalization\", the calls for implementing fundamental civil rights for all citizens, and by applying methods of an essentially behavioural nature, services have gradually been moved out of the institutional sector and into the local communities. A regional service delivery model established in the state of Nebraska illustrates this development toward individualized living and competitive employment in the community.","1707":"An overview is given initially of study findings pertaining to unemployment, work history and workplace experiences of people with epilepsy (disclosure, job reallocation, sick leaves, up-\/downgrading, accidents). The author then describes new approaches to improving the vocational integration of persons with epilepsy, by focussing on the one hand on extending the range of occupational assessment, and the adoption of new job placement assessment, and the adoption of new job placement strategies on the other, which concurrently seek to influence those factors that are detrimental to the occupational outlook of the person with a seizure disorder (notably frequent seizures, psychiatric problems, low educational levels, negative employer attitudes). It is suggested that the feasibility of these new strategies, developed and field-tested primarily in the Anglo-American countries, should be verified within the social-legislational context of the Federal Republic of Germany.","1708":"At the beginning and at the end of inpatient cardiac rehabilitation, 105 male cardiac patients were examined with a newly designed questionnaire for life satisfaction assessment (Fragebogen zur Lebenszufriedenheit-FLZ). Data collection moreover included the Freiburg Personality Inventory, the Freiburg Somatic Complaints Lists, an adjective list assessing current mood, questionnaires on anamnestic data, treatment expectancies and life habits, as well as medical data. Significant correlations found between the FLZ and subjective or objective criteria of rehabilitation outcome indicate the importance of life satisfaction, with more content patients showing better outcomes. No mean value differences were found in respect of medical data, less content patients, however, reported more previous hospital stays and rehabilitation treatments. Also, there is a tendency for physician to discharge these patients as \"unfit for work\". 83 of these 105 patients participated in the follow-up study twelve months later. Life satisfaction is now lower, somatic complaints and emotional lability have increased. 90 percent of the patients with high life satisfaction, but only 66 percent of those with low life satisfaction, are back at work on follow-up. Fitness for work at follow-up, though primarily related to the rating given at the end of inpatient cardiac rehabilitation, is influenced to a high degree by non-medical factors. The results obtained underline the significance of patient illness behaviour, and point to a need for further improving individual psychological counseling during cardiac rehabilitation.","1709":"156 stroke patients were followed-up over a period of up to twelve months from the event. During that period they had participated repeatedly, or continually, in comprehensive inpatient rehabilitation programmes at the Bad Schallerbach rehabilitation centre, Austria. The services provided were characterized by a comprehensive medical, vocational and social orientation. Rehabilitation outcome assessment related to personal functioning levels (ADL performance, intellectual functioning, communication, social behaviour, etc.) as well as the basic working capacity. Based on medical findings, the results stated toward the end of our comprehensive rehabilitative efforts showed improvements of personal functioning by about 66 percent, and attainment of a basic working capacity in 22 percent of the patients. Outcomes varied for the different causes of stroke; three patients had died during the observation period due to renewed stroke. The principles to be observed in comprehensive rehabilitation are discussed, with special emphasis on those in stroke rehabilitation.","1710":"For a disabled person to be able to realize his potential for rehabilitation to the fullest extent possible, individualized provision of technical aids may be necessary along with the medical and therapeutic services needed. The present report describes the modifications and additional devices incorporated in an electric wheelchair to answer the specific needs of our severely handicapped client.","1711":"","1712":"","1713":"In its programme of action \"Rehabilitation in the Eighties\", the Federal Government declared that coordinated further education for professional workers in rehabilitation administrations and rehabilitation facilities was to received increased attention in the future. Efficient rehabilitative work presupposes adequate qualification for these tasks in those entrusted with providing rehabilitation services to persons with disabilities. On-going further education of professional workers is indispensable in achieving this objective, in addition to their initial qualification. Hence, the financially responsible rehabilitation administrations and the Federal Rehabilitation Council, on the initiative of the Federal Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, agreed to carry out inter-agency education seminars. For professional workers employed in rehabilitation facilities, the working groups of rehabilitation facilities have started such inter-facility further education in 1986, in coordination with the Federal Minister of Labour and Social Affairs.","1714":"Working conditions in telephone exchanges are undergoing major changes with the penetration of computer technology. Although overall telephone utilization continues to grow, more and more jobs are being lost by the impact of rationalization. Operator jobs in private exchanges, at the same time, rank high among the job opportunities for disabled people, specifically for the blind. Workstation adaptations, on the other hand, are a valuable working aid for all blind or visually impaired operators, in that they use blindness-adapted information output via the Braille terminal. Pins (dots) being used to represent written information on a braille keyboard, the device in this application is not used as an input but for output purposes. The information a sighted person reads from an LC (line) display, is literally \"put at the fingertips\" of a blind operator. Following an overview of technical details of both conventional and adapted exchanges, the present report deals with operator training and employment opportunities for blind persons in private branch exchanges.","1715":"The need for psychotherapy with hearing impaired persons, and its necessity, are undisputed among professional workers. Yet, hardly any theory-based, field-tested experience exists so far concerning the procedures to be employed. The present contribution delineates both potential and limitations of psychotherapy with this population. Four schools of psychotherapeutic thinking are investigated as to their specific potential for contributing to psychotherapeutic work with hearing impaired clients. The aspect of \"communication channel\" is picked out from systems theory; from psychoanalysis, the concepts of therapeutic contract and transference appear significant; Humanistic Psychology, with its contributions concerning extraverbal expression and verbalization of feelings, has opened major routes of access to the hearing impaired individual; the broadest range of concepts and intervention strategies is presented by behavioural therapy. Behavioural approaches--cognitive conditioning, self-control techniques, thought-stopping, cognitive re-structuring--may be of greatest use in working with deaf clients. Given the cognitive and communicative characteristics of the target population, therapeutic work needs to be performed in an eclectic and synoptical manner. Its prime objective lies in uncovering the \"deaf identity\", in developing and protecting it.","1716":"Presented are 31 patients who had been admitted to our clinic for physical medicine for post-acute rehabilitation treatment. On admission, 25 of them suffered from incomplete tetraparesis. All patients were able to walk at discharge, some still having to rely on aids. 29 patients had achieved full independence in ADL tasks. Further gains in muscular strength and functional capacity were achieved over a period of up to two years of continued treatment on an outpatient basis.","1717":"Rehabilitation medicine is considered one of the most important coordinating disciplines of modern medical intervention. It is the answer to the omissions of medicine in the past in that it turns explicitly toward the consequences of diseases for the quality of life. The social and philosophical movements which have strongly influenced the development of comprehensive medicine are globally outlined. These movements, along with demographic changes, are viewed as the main contributive factors for the development of rehabilitation medicine as a methodologic practical mode of medical intervention, directed at the consequences of disease and trauma as expressed in the terms of impairment, disability, and handicap. The methodology of rehabilitation is outlined, with the rehabilitation medical diagnosis viewed as the indispensable prerequisite and basis for rehabilitation programming in cooperation with the disabled person himself.","1718":"Ten patients who suffered from severe hemiplegia on account of a cerebral arteriovenous angioma had been followed up after complete removal of the angioma (total extirpation; day of surgery = Date 0). In the course of this follow-up, a total of 100 questionnaires (N = 100) became available for study through yearly catamnesis for ten years, along with other pertinent documents. - None of the patients (mean age at Date 0: 29 years, 3 months) died during follow-up. Our inclusion criterion having been permanent, severe hemiplegia, organic personality changes of a usually mild (or even slighter) degree persisted in all patients among other permanent disablements. The so-called \"reduction of earning capacity\" (MdE) totalled 100% in nine patients, in 1 patient it was 80%. - 82 of 100 answers concerned the positive item \"getting fully dressed, unaided\" (8 of 10 patients at Date 10), 90 of 100 answers the positive item \"walking without attendant\" (9 of 10 patients at Date 10; average walking distance 2.2 km). Relative to \"training and regular-pay employment\", 34 positive answers were received (n = 97; 4 of 10 patients at Date 10). Given a broader interpretation of \"vocational reintegration\" to include homemaking and sheltered employment, 55 positive replies were received (n = 97; 7 of 10 patients at Date 10). The various conducive factors that had contributed to these favourable outcomes in spite of the condition's severity are presented in detail.","1719":"Experiences of cancer patients' self-help groups can provide impulses for the programming of rehabilitation measures. Exemplary is the information work (information procurement and distribution) of these groups. Problems emanating from disturbed interpersonal relationships and the stigma of the disease are dealt with implicitly rather than explicitly, with only certain patients, however, benefitting selectively from this kind of coping, depending on the stage of the disease and on their social context. The groups succeed in substituting missing or disturbed interpersonal relationships, they sometimes however find it difficult to ward off those aspects of isolation that have arisen with the onset of the disease. These difficulties weigh on other parts of the informal network, especially on the families.","1720":"Starting out from a curricular analysis of Klauer's \"G-V\"-tree structure (1984), a training scheme for developing central intellectual performance is set out and evaluated. The training consists of operations to determine sameness (G = Gleichheit) or differentness (V = Verschiedenheit) of features or relationships. As suggested by the theory of the G-V algorithm, and after only four training units of 45 minutes each, significant gains in general intelligence were found in the two training groups of slow learning students from a special school for the speech disordered, gains that the two control groups did not demonstrate. Meichenbaum's cognitive modelling with subsequent verbal self-instruction served to facilitate task solution procedures. The findings are discussed within the theoretical framework of the G-V system, emphasizing in particular its relevance for modifying and enhancing information processing functions in learning disabled students.","1721":"In dealing with the issue of readmission of psychiatric patients into in-patient care, the focus had in the past primarily been on clinical variables such as diagnosis, or severity of the clinical picture. The present study, however, had centered on occupational variables, such as vocational training, occupational status, periods of gainful employment, and unemployment. This complex was studied in a sample of psychiatric patients, with analyses directed at: percentage of the initial sample readmitted after a catamnestic period of 1 and 2 1\/2 yrs. resp., diagnostic groups with increased readmission incidence, and occupational variables associated with the need for readmission. Summing up, it may be stated that occupational handicaps arose in particular in the diagnostic groups of endogenous psychoses, whereas in other groups (such as neuroses, alcoholism) the issue of \"social handicaps\", in particular, had been in the foreground.","1722":"A short-term occupational prognosis had been given for first-admission psychiatric patients, occasioned by information from the field that, in case of mentally ill persons, measures for their vocational rehabilitation frequently either are started too late, or are inappropriate in scope, because associated impairments are insufficiently dealt with, underrated, or even overlooked at all in the early stages of the illness. Following Wing's concept of disability, an attempt was moreover made to identify barriers for occupational resettlement. The findings provided the basis for considering the question of scope and type of within-clinic or external measures to be initiated, or stepped up, to facilitate these clients' access to gainful employment and, hence, able to positively influence the future course of their condition.","1723":"To change some crucial elements of coronary-prone behaviour in cardiac patients is considered an important task of behaviour medicine, to reduce physico-chemical and, in particular, psychosocial \"risk factors\". The experimental study presented had examined whether the type A behaviour pattern, defined as the essential element of coronary-prone behaviour for its latent provocation of stress reactions, can be positively modified through behaviour therapy-focussed treatment within a clinical setting. A total of 91 persons, i.e. 49 recent-MI patients from an inpatient rehabilitation programme and 42 clients of a smoker counselling centre, were examined to identify type A or type B behaviour patterns (Rosenman u. Friedman, 1964). Of 39 type A post-MI patients, 13 (randomly selected) subjects were included in the \"trial group\" (VG), and participated, within a 4-8 week inpatient rehabilitation programme, in psychological training of stress management, relaxation, and self-control techniques; 3 patients denied participation; the remaining 23 type A post-MI patients, and the 20 type A smoker counselling clients, served as control group KG (A) and KG (B), who did not receive psychological training. Psychological and physiological parameters were assessed at the beginning (t1), the end (t2), as well as 3 and 6 months (t3 and t4) following completion of the psychological training. The results obtained confirm that the MI group includes significantly more type A persons (80 percent) than the cardiologically inconspicious control group of smokers (48 percent). Analysis of the data obtained at the various measurement points show that, as opposed to KG (A) and KG (B), significant improvements have in fact occurred in the trial group, such as reduced mental and psychovegetative stress reactions, which persisted even 3 months after programme completion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1724":"The study evaluates unselected \"blue-collar\" patients (n = 642) included under the social insurance law guidelines of rehabilitation. Rehabilitation measures had become necessary in these patients because of existing or impending invalidity in diseases of rheumatic origin. In 421 patients (= 66%), a connection with the place of work appeared possible. This entailed adaptation or change of the place of work in 297 patients (= 71%), the result of these measures after a period of two to three years being described. General aspects of occupational rehabilitation measures are discussed.","1725":"In our modern working world, young adults with disabilities not only face problems in securing employment, but, also, in finding adequate vocational training places. This had in the 1970s lead to the establishment of vocational training institutions. Local employment offices and employers however, again and again complain about poor organic capacity and endurance in young people trained in these centres. It consequently is very difficult for these young people to be placed in the open labour market. A study of the various principal demands on motor functioning and of pulmonary capacity was to clarify the extent to which deficits in motor and cardiopulmonary fitness exist. A total of 328 subjects (mean age 18:5 years), among them 17 wheelchair users, were examined relative to their motor and organic capacity. Significant deficits were found in nearly all component functions compared to nonhandicapped peers, with arm and trunk muscle strength the only exception to this negative performance picture. The motor deficits found were greatest in respect of dexterity and balance. Possible reasons for these motor deficits are discussed, and measures concerning disability-specific sports classes are discussed.","1726":"Depending on the remaining functions of the limbs, head, or articulation organs, various types of aids are available to motor impaired persons for controlling technical devices. For those with their speech organs and speaking ability unimpaired, an innovative approach has recently become available through voice input which uses speech recognition to automatically identify spoken input. This mode permits the largest possible information input per time unit, may however involve faulty recognition. Practical applications of speech recognition systems for motor impaired persons lie in the private and occupational settings, with purposes ranging from telecommunication, environmental control, to locomotion or computer control. Examples are the speech-controlled use of a television set or a wheelchair. Apart from controlling technical devices, voice input may, in other disabling conditions, also be employed to aid human communication. An overview of commercial speech recognition devices is given.","1727":"After briefly differentiating the terms visual impairment, profound visual impairment, and blindness, the authors address the mobility problems of blind and visually impaired persons. The second part of the contribution presents and discusses the main findings of a study, conducted by the authors in 1982, concerning the mobility of blind and profoundly visually impaired persons, including, in particular, the problems encountered by this population in using public transport.","1728":"A case example serves to consider the problems involved in the issue of whether higher-age paraplegic patients can be rehabilitated. What is needed in these cases, in particular in the first few weeks, is careful clinical-neurological examination in view of identifying, the phase of spinal shock being over, any signs of a possibly incomplete spinal lesion (e.g., extensor hyperactivity) and deciding the course to be taken giving due consideration to age-related factors. The amounts of time and therapeutic resources needed certainly being considerable especially in the rehabilitation of older paraplegic patients, such efforts should, however, be undertaken when motivation and mental acuity, hence patient ability to cooperate, are good; helplessness, dependence, and change of environment (by referral to a nursing ward) will, in particular in the old person, almost invariably entail rapid decompensation.","1729":"Starting from the problem of psychological care for patients during rehabilitation following myocardial infarction the concept of a theme-centered group programme is presented. The essential goals of the programme are helping patients cope with the crisis of infarction, reducing risk factors, and changing coronary-prone Type A behaviour. The specific situation of a patient following myocardial infarction as well as typical defense mechanisms and coping styles are discussed. Topics covered in the programme are: Situation following myocardial infarction, Impact of psychosocial stress, Coping behaviours, and Returning home, return to work.","1730":"The cardiac diseases present in 274 multimorbid, older patients (mean age 72,42 yrs.) have been examined in the study reported. Careful differentiation of cardiac diagnoses present at the time of admission was found to be of utmost importance in outcome prediction. The combination of cardiac decompensation and arrhythmia, and recurrent infarction in the presence of myocardial scarring, respectively, had been the most important factors concerning functional capacity at time of discharge. Mortality, too, was found to be related to these criteria.","1731":"A programme for rehabilitation of severely mentally impaired patients (mainly psychotic disorders) in local companies, industrial and municipal, is presented. Introduced in 1970 and extended since 1983, the programme is based on a theoretical model for social work practice, that centers around the concept of resources and interaction. Preliminary experiences with this on-the-job vocational rehabilitation approach are reported.","1732":"The course of rehabilitation in 11 young patients with craniopharyngeoma was investigated. With intelligence well-preserved, neuropsychological diagnosis revealed impairments in rate and persistence in virtually all patients; behaviour disorders were present in 8 of the 11 patients, with efforts to distinguish psychoorganic from psychoreactive causality however not always successful. The neuropsychological deficits and behavioural deviations mentioned, rather than complications of a medical nature (1 of 11), resulted in only 2 patients having been able to maintain their premorbid educational\/vocational status. The rehabilitative outcomes obtained in patients with clear-cut indications of diencephalic lesion (among them variations in vigilance, polyphagia, adipsia) had been unsatisfactory, whereas, in the other behaviourally disordered patients, successful outcomes were achieved by a therapeutic approach tailored to the specific needs of the individual condition.","1733":"Described is a group of 40 mentally ill offenders, discharged from hospital an average 9 years ago. This group had been served for an average of two years at the rehabilitation department of the Karl-Bonhoeffer-Nervenklinik in Berlin, with the majority having been placed in insurable, performance-adapted outside employment and discharged home or into other appropriate living situations. A follow-up study was carried out in March 1984 concerning renewed delinquency, employment, financial and living situation. Two of the rehabilitees had committed some offence, which resulted in their conditional discharge being revoked. In 1984, 15 of the former clients were found to continue in insurable employment, 5 former patients had died in the intervening years. Some hypotheses are given to explain the successful outcomes attained.","1734":"The study presented deals with the issue of therapy compliance on the example of female patients with breast carcinoma, who had received adjuvant chemotherapy. Catamnestic results are reported for 44 patients who had answered a complaints questionnaire and participated, additionally, in unstructured interviewing on the problems and strain experienced during and following therapy. The study group consisted of 10 women who had dropped out of treatment, and 34 women who had followed the treatment as scheduled. The physical and emotional strain found are reported, and discussed from the perspective of therapy compliance. Of particular interest in this context is the doctor-patient-relationship, i.e. the question of how the patients' subjective considerations and medical cost-benefit calculations could be heeded in as open and trustful an exchange between doctor and patient as possible.","1735":"Medical examination data were compared with psychosocial questionnaire findings in a retrospective study of 536 myocardial infarction patients. The average observation period was four years. On the basis of cardiac catheterization results, obtained during participation in post-clinical rehabilitation, four diagnostic groups were formed in order of disease severity. Return to work, early resumption of working following post-clinical rehabilitation, and the subjective perception of cardiac complaints did not show any clear-cut association with severity of the cardiac findings. The two conclusions drawn are that in addition to the somatic factors involved, psychosocial ones will have to be given greater emphasis in the rehabilitation process, and successful rehabilitation should not be determined exclusively on the criterion of vocational resettlement.","1736":"","1737":"Congenital or acquired conditions directly or indirectly causal in total or partial impairment of manual function are set out. The possibilities for creative-expressive activity, using various techniques, nothwithstanding manual disabilities are pointed out. In Cefischer, who until his war-related loss of both upper limbs had been a renowned cartoonist, a comparison of his works, drawn initially by hand and later with the mouth, reveals his characteristic style of expression having remained the same. Further examples are given of creative expression in the presence of manual disability even under extreme circumstances (such as 11 years of confinement to the Iron Lung). Arts and crafts work of persons with leprosy-related manual handicaps are mentioned; typewriter graphics as a method inaugurated by Basset is presented as used in young people with total manual disability. Partial disability of manual function due to arthritis was present in Renoir, Jawlensky, and Grandma Moses, the course of their conditions is described over time. Contents and form of their pictures, after long years of being manually disabled, do not reveal any essential changes in comparison to their earlier ones.","1738":"Current labour market developments, i.e. decreasing manpower demands, aggravation of selection, will in the years ahead confront vocational rehabilitation policy, too, with important decisions in terms of expanded service provision or intensified selectiveness. Short-term economic, labour market-oriented cost-benefit considerations will in this process be opposed by longer-term, education and social policy ones. The risk of lasting ruptures occurring between the employment-possessing population and the long-term unemployed, or those in highly jeopardized jobs, with the new social inequities thus generated, will in particular have to be given attention in future decision-making.","1739":"When genetically based impairments cannot be prevented by early-enough genetic counselling, parent guidance and early services are urgently needed. Understanding the parents' psychoemotional situation, tactfulness, and easily understood language are important premises in such counselling. For early provision of services to be effective, close cooperation needs to be ensured between physicians, therapists, educators and social workers. Their common objective is to reduce the extent of disability as much as possible, and to achieve conditions conducive to integration. In progressive conditions, the aim is to put off the onset of complete helplessness and to maintain the child's quality of life at as high a level as possible.","1740":"","1741":"The type of occupation proposed as well as factors determining these proposals, i.e. vocational prognosis, were examined in 58 persons to be rehabilitated who already had been integrated into working life at the time of epilepsy onset and participated in a one- to three-week vocational assessment programme in a vocational training center. Suggestions for vocational retraining were made to 49 of the 58 clients, with clerical occupations proposed to almost half of them, manual ones to appr. one third, and technical training to a sixth of the clients. This distribution of training suggestions is the reverse of the clients' former occupations, and did not always meet the wishes expressed by the clients. Careful evaluation and counselling might reduce some of these discrepancies. The level of the occupational training proposed was influenced most strongly by work rate, with dosage of anticonvulsive drugs being the most important factor in slowing the clients' pace. Psychological problems were common, did however not primarily influence the level of training proposed, but rather the decision between vocational training vs. invalidity pension or medical treatment.","1742":"On account of the fundamental changes in treatment modalities, an ameliorated prognostic outlook, as well as a not inconsiderable variety of reversible and irreversible treatment-generated disorders, current concepts for rehabilitation of patients with M. Hodgkin require thorough reconsideration. It is not the early detection of recidives, but identification and, whenever possible, therapy of the treatment aftermath that should be the primary function of tumour aftercare. Splenectomy, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy may entail long-term immune-system or cardiac disorders, scelettal impairments, functional disorders of the lung, liver, kidney, or the endocrine system, vascular diseases, dental problems, leukeamia, or second carcinoma. As primary therapy is increasingly being geared toward taking into account this possible aftermath of treatment, aftercare and rehabilitation of patients with M. Hodgkin, too, should be adjusted to an increased awareness of unwanted long-term side-effects.","1743":"Based on a holistic understanding of rehabilitation, overall objectives in rehabilitating patients with malignant brain tumour are outlined. On the background of demands to orient rehabilitational efforts more than hitherto on the specific needs of those affected, results obtained from interviewing 36 brain tumour patients are set out, regarding their anxieties as well as factors that were experienced as helpful in the process of coping with the disease. The rank of assistance in adjusting to impending death in rehabilitative work with patients who have malignant brain tumours is discussed. Also, possible reasons are outlined for patients hardly ever talking about their condition's life-threatening nature on their own initiative. A patient-centered approach is advocated for the psychoemotional support of this patient group, implications for training and further education of hospital workers are discussed briefly.","1744":"Transitional residences are of particular importance among the rehabilitative facilities for the mentally ill that had been called for by the Psychiatry Enquete. Their primary objective is to enable clients cope with (relatively) self-reliant living. Along with achievement, or restoration, of working capacity and its consolidation through (part-time) work, emotional growth, self-assertion, and social skills are to be developed. In view of practical implementation of the theoretical concept outlined in the Psychiatry Enquete, and based on their long years of experience in the field, the authors have drafted guidelines for meaningful professional work in a transitional setting, in view of overcoming recurrent initial difficulties and living up to the high goals envisaged. Client selection and careperson qualification are indispensable prerequisites in the sequenced provision of rehabilitative care, directed both at the vocational and leisure domain and the personal growth of the clients.","1745":null,"1746":"Over a period of 17 years, 455 disabled individuals in all have moved out of the Senator-Neumann-Heim, a residential and rehabilitation facility for persons with severe physical disablement. Of these, 151 had participated in educational and\/or vocational rehabilitation measures. 33 of the current 136 residents participate in educational programmes, another 34 are settled in gainful employment. A detailed description of the various types of schooling, as well as of preparatory services and incidence of university studies, serve to illustrate the potential held by effective, individualized preparation for vocational integration. The essential factor for settlement in gainful activity had invariably been sound, requirements-oriented, successfully completed vocational training, either in a vocational training center, or in the dual system of industrial training and professional school. Issues relative to daily working hours, psychosocial follow-up, residential possibilities, partnerships, are discussed.","1747":"In an investigation of psychosocial strain in persons having a facial or skin impairment, a total of 25 patients of Fachklinik Hornheide (a special clinic for the treatment of tumors, tuberculosis, and for facial and skin reconstruction) had participated in in-depth interviewing. It was found with unexpected clarity that these clients are exposed to a high measure of negative environmental reaction. In addition to having to cope with stressful disease consequences, often entailing a \"loss of face\" with the major problems of self-worth this involves, these negative experiences in many instances lead to behavioural problems, withdrawal reaction, occupational repercussions, or severe emotional crisis in those concerned. The degree to which these patients can overcome their problems is to a large extent dependent on how parents, spouse, colleagues, and important others respond. Early enough involvement of significant others, possibly already at the time of medical information, as well as support during emotional crisis are capable of considerably alleviating the coping process. The psychosocial problems confronting persons with disfiguring facial conditions have to be taken into account during therapy in order to successfully enhance the purpose of integration into the social environment.","1748":"Orthopaedic treatment for the elderly is aimed at enabling these persons to master their life. It includes not only the actual treatment of illness or disability, but also the influence exerted by their environment. Among the main problems aging people encounter in coping with orthopaedic disorders are decreasing adaptability and limitations in their capability to cope with stress situations. Not only the bone itself, but also the motoricity are affected. Physical therapists and physicians must take these factors into account in their efforts to successfully assist these aging people.","1749":"Rehabilitation of physically disabled persons and resettlement of employed orthopaedic patients into social and working life are integral components of orthopaedics. Unless the patient is reintegrated, orthopaedic care remains incomplete. It is absolutely necessary to develop, already during counselling and at the outset of in-patient therapy, a detailed treatment plan that takes into account the pertaining vocational and social integration considerations. Besides outlining some general ideas, the specific experience at the Orthopaedic Clinic of Frankfort university are described.","1750":"The impetus for therapeutic intervention does not emanate from the individual concerned; it comes from his or her family, who, in turn, must be comprised in the care provided, regarding unrealistic expectations, reluctance to assume responsibilities, refusal of \"charity\", guilt feelings. Service provision in mainstream facilities involves serious hazards for those with severe multiple disability. Medical and educational concerns may run counter to each other. Medical treatment-based impediments for educational care may be hospital stays, surgery, braces, postural devices, extensive physiotherapy, or drug treatment. Among the positive aspects of educator\/physician cooperation are the facts that the educator develops a sense for movement therapy considerations, while the physician becomes aware of the importance of educational care, not least in case of profound psychic involvement.","1751":"The Sermon on the Mount should be understood in the dynamic context in which Jesus himself had turned toward the weak and infirm. His own action, so he willed, is to be carried on in the action of his disciples. Jesus blesses those who \"use no violence\"--this, also, implies that one should not by violent means protect against suffering, which in actual fact is increasingly being done in the selective termination of pregnancy. Jesus wants his disciples, as he himself had done, to become ready to share and help carry the suffering that disability may bring down upon a family. His calling his followers the \"salt of the earth\" also means that they seek to make life \"tasty\", i.e., worth living for others, a challenge which is being faced in committing to the care of disabled persons.","1752":"The question of whether rehabilitation of physically disabled people constitutes a challenge for the Christian churches must be answered with a clear \"Yes\" by their members. The churches and hence the Christians themselves, must on the basis of their faith make it quite clear that rehabilitation of physically disabled persons is a holistic process involving body, mind, and soul. Physical care must therefore be matched by intensive spiritual assistance; that handicapped persons are of equal worth in the sight of God as the able bodied, hence do not constitute \"unworthy life\"; that physically disabled persons must be afforded an existence worthy of human dignity; that Christian communities should encourage volunteer work; that provision of good education and vocational training, as well as preparation for a meaningful life without gainful activity, must be given attention. All these emanate from the call to emulate Jesus Christ.","1753":"Rehabilitation of disabled people has at all times been an essential element of orthopaedics. The great advances made in orthopaedic surgery over the last few decades have however not resulted in rehabilitative activity having become superfluous. On the contrary, better medical restoration provides a better starting base for vocational rehabilitation. Rehabilitation generally has better technical possibilities today than it used to, which contributes to its being more successful today. Most important of all has however been the progress entailed by a fundamental change in how rehabilitation is conceived: Today, we consider the disabled person a full and equal member of our society, whose integration in competitive employment we mean to foster to the greatest extent possible.","1754":"Describing the current status of the \"school for the physically disabled\" and the developmental tendencies observable in this type of school, the author in particular contrasts recently evolved practice with the existing legislative and administrative orientations. It is found that on account of demographic and socio-medical developments and pressures, actual practice has gone far beyond the administrative framework, entailing a need to catch up in terms of conceptual thinking and administrative provision. This need to catch up essentially pertains to conceptual integration of the consequences that arise from the inclusion of students with increasingly severe disablement, to questions of occupational outlook for physically handicapped students with learning disabilities, adequate conclusions as regards creating a flexible organizational structure in the individual school, as well as the problems involved in statutory provision relative to the necessary paramedical services and the linkages between therapy and education, also in terms of cooperation between school and public health services.","1755":"Special educational reflexion is directed at, and analyses, the ever specific situation of the child with a physical disability, in order to attain the conditions enabling subjective and intersubjective reality to be formed and stabilized. 'Dealing with the external world' means complex and differentiated perception and internalization, particularly, subjectively relevant and meaningful activity: all this describes the individual learning and achievement behaviour of the child with a physical disablement. 'Achievement' becomes a category of high subjective significance, which requires constant intersubjective recognition. Motor behaviour as an objectifyable phenomenon must be distinguished from personal motor activity, at however limited a level of constitutional and functional motor competency it may occur. Expectation of success, and the avoidance of failure, are intrinsic constituents of educational reality in dealing with a physically disabled child. As Krappmann puts it, the achievement the individual must accomplish as a condition for enabling his participation in communication processes to occur, is designated as the category of identity.","1756":"The legal bases for rehabilitation and integration of the physically disabled have developed from public welfare provisions, the beginnings of disability care having been part of public poor relief schemes. Ensueing developments range from cripple care programmes to today's efforts to establish a uniform social code, which is expected to benefit the individual disabled person by bringing about a marked simplification of the current legal and administrative situation. The extension of the scope of rehabilitative efforts, which since Bismarck's time had comprised nursing and institutional care in cases of physical and mental ailings within the framework of poor relief, had initially occurred outside Prussia by including education and vocational training for disabled people (the beginnings of \"rehabilitation\"). A more comprehensive approach to disability care in the sense of extended assistance was embodied in the Prussian cripple welfare act of 1920. The Federal Social Assistance Act of 1962, in the final analysis, had developed from this tradition. This 1962 act not only established a duty to provide public welfare but also gave those concerned a legal title to this kind of assistance.","1757":null,"1758":"Starting out from describing an orthopaedic institute with an orthopaedic-rehabilitative approach, established in 1780 by Venel in the Suisse canton of Waadt, a historical retrospective is given of the field of rehabilitation of the physically disabled, going back for some notable industrial and social medicine aspects to Graeco-Roman times. Reference is in particular made to the peculiarities of 19th century private, residential care, and the development of modern-day facilities for persons with a physical disability is outlined.","1759":"Drawing on personal experience, the author points out that paraplegics too are capable of independent sailing. Physical restrictions relative to on-board mobility, sail manoeuvring and change of sides can be made up for by structural adaptions and special techniques. Certain safety precautions are indispensable. The sailing performance of paraplegics compares with that of ablebodied sailors, and cruising under a paraplegic skipper's responsibility is certainly possible.","1760":"Presented are the findings of a follow-up study of 258 psychiatric patients who had for the first time been admitted to inpatient psychiatric treatment in 1979. Using standardized forecasting instruments, the patients themselves, their treating physician, and a member of the care staff were asked to give their views of the patient's occupational outlook, his chances for resettlement, and the need for vocational rehabilitation services following discharge. The needs statements made at discharge are contrasted with the vocational and job-related rehabilitation measures actually initiated and carried out in the year following discharge; additionally, the patients' vocational situation at discharge is compared with their situation twelve months later, and the course of the rehabilitation measures provided is described. Along with the discrepancies between needs statements and amount of vocational rehabilitation services actually initiated and carried out, the empirical findings point to a non-specific, dispersive approach to providing rehabilitation services. The possible causes for this discrepancy between needs and service provision, with its rather serious implications, as well as the doubtful effectiveness of the rehabilitation services provided are discussed, practice-related consequences are outlined.","1761":"The relationships between various indicators of (1) subjective perception of clinic environment, (2) subjective state of health and perceived health changes during rehabilitation, (3) clinical ratings (physician's ratings of health status and its changes), (4) medical-diagnostic laboratory data, and (5) patient history, were studied in a sample of 144 myocardial infarction patients who participated in a four- to six-week early rehabilitation programme. Canonical correlation analyses point to intricate, statistically significant interrelationships among subjective perceptions of treatment environment and subjective health status changes, physician's ratings and laboratory findings, as well as subjective perceptions of treatment environment and patient history. All other combinations of variables did not reveal statistically significant canonical correlations. The findings show that subjective perception of the treatment environment is an important psychosocial variable relevant to subjective well-being of myocardial infarction patients and their subjective recovery during rehabilitation.","1762":"In 1981 the Rehabilitation Centre Laab (A-2381 Laab im Walde, Austria) had admitted a total of 1149 patients. These included 968 patients with diabetes mellitus (431 male, 537 female), of whom 428 (44.21 percent) had been insulin-dependent (IDDM) and 540 (55.79 percent) non-insulin-dependent (NIDDM). The mean blood glucose (MBG) levels present at the time of admission indicated that glycemic control was better in patients with IDDM than those with NIDDM. The poorest glycemic control was encountered in NIDDM of (A) age 31-40 (MBG = 187 mg\/dl) and (B) over age 70 (MBG = 194 mg\/dl); it had been possible in these patients to lower MBG to (A) 138 mg\/dl and (B) 147 mg\/dl. Juvenile IDDM patients (under age 30) had poorer glycemic control (MBG = 190 mg\/dl) than the older IDDM patients (MBG = 181 mg\/dl), and therapeutic success was greater in the latter group. Concluding from the glycohaemoglobin changes found, improvements in glycemic control were achieved in 35.32 percent (IDDM: 15.39 percent; NIDDM: 19.93 percent); in 62.08 percent (IDDM: 26.65 percent; NIDDM: 35.43 percent) it had remained unchanged, and had deteriorated in 2.16 percent (IDDM: 1.75 percent; NIDDM: 0.41 percent). For 13 patients treated so far by diet alone, oral medication had to be started; 2 patients (0.2 percent) required immediate introduction of insulin. In 126 patients (12.9 percent) on oral medication, insulin therapy had to be initiated, whereas in 32 cases (3.3 percent) oral medication was discontinued in favour of purely dietetic control.","1763":"","1764":"In the present contribution, Witte's concept of a holistic disability and rehabilitation psychology is applied to the sector of vocational rehabilitation. The author starts out, on the one hand, from the approach to rehabilitation psychology as a sub-speciality of Applied Psychology, and, on the other, from the fundamental interlacement and complementing nature of basic research and application. Considerations concerning assimilation of disabled persons in working life are outlined before this background.","1765":"The article gives an overview of efforts made in various countries (the U.S.A., Canada, Sweden, and the Federal Republic of Germany) toward achieving greater accessibility of their public transportation systems. Various initiatives are shown to have been created in the 70ies on the part of public authorities and public transport providers, that have entailed the development of special vehicles, special information systems and architectural solutions. On analyzing the policies of both the transport providers and the competent public authorities it is, however, found that, although creation of an essentially barrier-free transportation network would be possible from the technical point of view, they refrain from subscribing to this objective. This has resulted in transportation of the disabled being oriented toward special services because these are far less costly than fundementally re-designing existing public transportation systems.","1766":null,"1767":"Based on the development of gerontology and geriatrics in the Federal Republic of Germany, various geriatric rehabilitation issues are presented. The different types of geriatric facilities are described.","1768":"The psychosocial rehabilitation of older persons is one of the main problems in health policy. About one quarter of the over 65-year-olds face psychic problems, without, to a large extent, receiving adequate treatment and rehabilitative care. Substantial deficits exist above all in the out-patient and non-residential service sectors. In in-patient care, existing methods for psychosocial intervention (such as psychoanalysis, behavioural, client-centered, family, Gestalt, milieu, or music and dance therapy, psychodrama, reality orientation training, or resensitization techniques) are hardly ever used. This absence of applied geronto-psychology is attributable to the shortcomings of available assessment methods, multiple methodical problems of intervention research, and--above all--to insufficient staff positions for psychosocial professions in the gerontological sector. Provision of further permanent posts for psychosocial workers; development of age-specific assessment methods; interdisciplinary and systematic interventional research; the development of ambulatory, community-based services as well as intensive support for existing self-help efforts are therefore called for.","1769":"Neither traditional dyslexia research nor intensive efforts undertaken by the special education sector in reading-writing education have hitherto been able to remedy the fact that relatively large numbers of special education students are unable to read and write when they leave school. Learning to read and write continues to mean drudgery for many children. Experimental research in reading and writing learning processes has achieved approaches capable of providing effective help specifically to the \"hard-core\" cases of reading and writing failure. This, however, presupposes an understanding of the information processing and storage processes required in reading function, or, rather, of the deficiencies involved. The present contribution therefore intends to familiarize the special education practitioner with the still widely unknown psychological foundations of cognition and memory that are indispensable for implementing effective reading education course.","1770":"Development, trial and evaluation of a training approach to aging memory are described. The 6-unit small-group programme is based on empirical findings concerning age-related reductions in memory functioning. Initial controlled evaluation of the training effects indicates improvements in various memory functions, suggesting the programme's usefulness in applied gerontopsychology.","1771":"Considerations within a broader theoretical framework are presented that relate psychic well-being and psychic stability of both older and younger persons to their self-concepts of achievement and ability: The better the \"psychic well-being\" and the higher the degree of \"psychic stability\", the more \"favourable\" or \"positive\", i.e. with more socially desired characteristics, are the various self-concepts of achievement and ability of both younger and older individuals. 87 psychiatric patients with a diagnosis of \"depression\", considered a population with lower levels in respect of \"psychic stability\" and \"psychic well-being\", had been compared to a sample group without psychiatric problems. Initial evaluations of available empirical findings, i.e. the data for three differentiated self-concepts of achievement and ability and a self-concept of sensitivity and general emotional state, obtained from a total of 174 subjects (91 aged 50-81, 83 aged 23-49), have failed to falsify our hypotheses but have, rather, substantiated them. The 87 psychiatric subjects from various age groups had significantly less \"favourable\" self-concepts of achievement and ability and a significantly less \"positive\" self-concept of sensitivity and general emotional state than the subjects in the parallel sample.","1772":"In order to verify the effectiveness of various rehabilitation activities commonly used in geriatric clinics or nursing homes, a total of 453 persons from seven clinics\/nursing homes had been assessed four times in 12 months by staff from the respective facility. First, the thesis of the multimorbidity in old age was confirmed by an average 4.4 diagnoses per patient. Rehabilitation measures were found to have been only rarely provided, with rehabilitative efforts having focussed mainly on the patients in better shape. On the other hand, visits from close relatives such as children or spouse are more frequent for patients who function at lower levels. It has been possible by cross-lagged correlation to demonstrate the positive effects of concentrated rehabilitative efforts undertaken over a period of twelve months. A significant correlation to specific rehabilitation techniques has not been stated.","1773":"The numbers of old people are increasing, as are the amounts of finance required for the care of the elderly. In addition sickness funds, too, are confronted with rising funding requirements due to the multimorbidity of old people. The causes underlying the increases in nursing and care expenditure to be carried by the communities, as well as of services and benefits to be made available by the health insurance sector, are put forth. Early rehabilitation would be capable of eliminating many of the causal factors involved, and doctors in particular have to become more aware of the importance and potential of geriatrics. This approach could remedy the resignation found in many of those concerned, hence stimulate overall rehabilitation efforts. Rehabilitation of senior citizens aims at reducing the functional limitations experienced by old people, seeking to reduce the extent of disablements in daily living, i.e. to preserve a high level of independence in the seniors. The services and programmes necessary for achieving this aim are described.","1774":"Starting from the basic equation of research on aging [behaviour = f (age)], various issues involved in defining the subject-matter of that research are discussed. Advantages and disadvantages of aging research methods (i.e. cross-sectional, longitudinal, and time-lag study, cohort analysis), evolved by extension of the basic equation, are put forth and are critically discussed in terms of the relevancy of the findings obtained.","1775":"Our current approach in the case of elderly people requiring nursing and care--namely, provision of supplementary social assistance benefits when old-age pension amounts are insufficient and if the incomes of children and grandchildren are below certain levels--is turning over 70 percent of all persons in residential care into recipients of rather modest amounts of pocket-money. Their financial provision for old age, built over decades, becomes null and void. In the case of home care, small invalid care allowances are granted to cater for additional needs, amounts, however, which are adequate neither to cover for the expenses involved nor to properly honour the caretaking efforts incumbent on the relatives. This reveals two decisive shortcomings in our present system for helping persons in need of care: benefit and service provision give undue priority to residential service delivery, instead of enhancing the necessary extension of community-based or ambulatory services; the current societal distribution of financial burdens is not compatible with the requirements of a publicly organized scheme for protection against general life-hazards that could hit everyone and should therefore be borne jointly. The article sets out the above situation through examples illustrating the various life situations of people needing nursing and care, and discusses three alternative approaches to achieving social security and protection: to extend health insurance coverage to non-curable\/non-rehabilitable conditions; to create a separate social insurance branch to cover the life risk of needing nursing and care; and to initiate federal legislation for introduction of tax-financed, flat-rate invalid care allowances proportional to the care intensity required, while establishing user charges in the case of residential care services.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1776":"Rehabilitative pedagogics deal with the entirety of \"educational\", or \"pedagogical\", approaches and activities that seek to diminish the physical, mental and\/or psychosocial handicaps faced by disabled people, or to develop alternatives enabling them to compensate for existing disabilities Specific difficulties are present in the care and treatment of older persons, which--despite a lack of empirical substantiation--have entailed a widespread assumption that there is only very limited benefit in rehabilitating older people. This view is critically discussed, and perspectives for \"worthwhile\" rehabilitative-educational approaches in the psychosocial and psychosomatic care of elderly people are presented.","1777":"An initial mail survey in Sweden has shown that, roughly, at least 4 percent of all mentally retarded persons display self-abusive behaviour. Those concerned usually are severely or profoundly mentally retarded, and the autoaggressive behaviour occurs very frequently, in most instances daily. Almost three quarters of self-abusing retarded persons live in institutional settings, such as special hospitals or residential homes for the mentally retarded. The age distribution found in the self-abusing population deviates substantially from the expected distribution. Life expectancy seems reduced. Gender-specific differences have not been found. A social-psychological care approach (empathy, improved life conditions, meaningful activities, systematic behavioural modification) may have an alleviating, or even remedial, influence.","1778":null,"1779":"A group of 40 patients with complete paraplegia, selected to specific criteria (such as extent and location of SCI, age, cost-carrier) had been followed-up annually over a period of ten years post-onset by means of mail questionnaires. The filled-in questionnaires had been returned in all instances. The present study dealing with pressure sores occurred after discharge from hospital treatment, some 324 questionnaires, of 400 in all, have been included in the evaluation. Concerning decubitus frequency, it was found that pressure sores had occurred in 160 of the 324 years of follow-up (49.4 percent). Of these 160 instances, 53 (33.1 percent) were however classified as \"short-term decubiti\" because they had lasted for one to four weeks only. Notwithstanding limitations in study comparability, an attempt is made to contrast the incidence rate and ulcer durations found to findings reported elsewhere in the literature. As far as the study admitted statements on causal factors, these are grouped according to etiologies. Finally, the contribution outlines conclusions as well as consequences for prevention and therapy.","1780":"The rapid development of new electronic information technologies is outlined, which are definitely going to affect existing social and economic structures. The new medium Bildschirmtext Btx (the interactive videotex information system of Deutsche Bundespost) will, in the opinion of the author, radically change many aspects of our life, as had been the case with telephone and television. The question is therefore raised as to the part Btx might have in the field of communication among those involved in rehabilitation. The contribution explains what Btx is and how it works. Examples are given to illustrate the wide scope of possible applications, which make Btx a useful tool in rehabilitation as well. Besides, the question as to the cost involved is answered. In the opinion of the author this new Btx communication technology holds great potential to become the \"medium in rehabilitation\".","1781":"Notwithstanding the wide socio-cultural scope of theoretical social policy, those, at any rate, who are involved in practical social policy making time and again face the task of providing an economic justification for their respective programmes; the field of rehabilitation of the disabled is no exception to this rule. An economic justification of rehabilitation service provision would however imply their flexibility within economic development: content programming continuity and economic justification will clash as the economic situation changes. Maintaining, or honouring, present rehabilitation service programming will jeopardize economic justification, whereas orientation of rehabilitation practice toward economic justifiability would imply the need to abandon redemption of present content programming. This entails a normative dilemma between rehabilitation content programming, or goal-setting, on the one hand, and its economic-functional, theoretical justification as reflecting given economic circumstances on the other. This normative dilemma gives rise to critically re-consider current practice in, and the rank accorded to, economic justification in rehabilitation service provision.","1782":"The psychosocial services provided over a period of two years to 24 children and young people with chronic renal insufficiency in various disease stages were analyzed on the basis of patient files. A total of 1475 contacts (units) were classified according to the four dimensions: (1) type of care provided, (2) problems dealt with, (3) contact persons, (4) disease stage. Variety and multitude of the individual psychosocial problems present demonstrate the scope for psychosocial activity. Supportive services (1) pertaining to the so-called disease-context (2) and, more specifically, personal contacts with the patients (3) in the dialysis stage (4) were found to prevail among the functions of the attending psychologist. Psychosocial services focussing on specific individual and\/or practical issues had plainly been far more important in the care of the chronically ill children and their families, than approaches based on classical clinical psychology and psychotherapy. These findings have resulted in increased staffing for supportive services \"on site\" (i.e. during dialysis time), which has entailed greater latitude in the time available for dealing with relevant preventive aspects in preparing patients for dialysis and transplantation.","1783":"Talking with cancer patients is a process situated in a special field of tension. The individual affected by cancer suffers in multiple ways: from his somatic disease, his emotional reactions to the condition, from an ever-present fear of disease recurrence or spread. The patient is afraid of a lack of acceptance on the part of his environment, of social isolation and communication deficits, of insufficiencies in his ability to cope with the condition. This is where \"Mitseinsbehandlung\" sets in, an empathic, holistic approach to treatment bearing on all the various planes at which help is required. This approach is described in more detail.","1784":"Analyzed for the first time in 1973, the age distribution in the Swedish mentally retarded population was reexamined in 1982. Within a decade considerable changes were found to have taken place, whereas the numbers of disabled persons as well as their share in the total population had remained the same. The share of children and, above all, young people up to age 20 is declining considerably per age group. This could be accounted for by the introduction, in the early 70ies, of prenatal diagnosis and its growing impact, as well as by a considerably higher share of abdominal deliveries. The age-group proportion of mentally retarded in the total population of the 25-34 year olds, on the other hand, is markedly higher today than it had been 10 years ago. This fact is thought to be associated with the introduction of antibiotics in Sweden in 1948. The life expectancy of the other, older mentally retarded persons, too, is higher today than in 1973. This is most obviously explained by the substantial improvements that have occurred since in the living conditions for mentally retarded persons.","1785":"The \"Moegeldorfer Group\", an initiative group integrating disabled and non-disabled persons, had been studied using qualitative interviewing techniques. The following motives and effects of group involvement have been found: Predominant among the disabled members had been the recreational opportunities offered by the group, along with the possibility of coming to know people who could help them outside group activities as well. Getting acquainted with disabled persons had been in the foreground among the non-disabled members. Their major problem, apart from rendering assistance, had been to become aware of, and learn to cope with, disability-related communication barriers. The voluntary encounter of disabled and non-disabled people is considered a positive first step towards changing the relationship between disabled and non-disabled persons as it exists in our society.","1786":"The study deals with the vocational careers of 102 cerebral palsied young people who had ceased to attend the educational and therapeutic programmes provided by the Nuremberg \"Day Centre for Physically Disabled Children\", following varying periods of service utilization between 1973 and 1978. Of the study group total, 19 are mildly disabled, 40 moderately, and 43 severely disabled. Of 23 persons who were fully integrated vocationally at the time of study, 19 (i.e. 84 percent) are moderately to severely disabled. Tabular information included shows that achievement of full occupational integration is determined less by disability severity than by intellectual potential. It also becomes clear that earliest possible transition from special schooling to mainstream education will be of advantage to the vocational opportunities available to the individual.","1787":"The experience made over five years of operating a collection scheme for second-hand technical aids are described. Affiliation with a pediatric centre has provided opportunity for the child trying out the aid envisaged, and for evaluation by doctor and therapist prior to aid re-prescription. The main principles to be observed in aid provision are stated. Present organizational and financial problems are described, which, however, are considered secondary to the scheme's usefulness, not least in view of cost savings.","1788":"Access to the world of computers, which today are penetrating all areas of life, is to a far-reaching extent impossible for blind or visually impaired persons, on account of the usually visual information output of the systems. Developed at the Electromechanical Design Department of Duisburg University, the computerized workplace described features spoken output of everything that normally would appear on the display screen, i.e. the visual mode has been replaced fully by spoken communication. Using this learning and teaching aid in schools, vocational training facilities, at the workplace, or at home, the blind person is enabled to learn how to programme, to develop programmes, or to work with off-the-shelf software.","1789":"The concept of incapacity for work has been defined by a number of court decision. These have, also, considerably widened the originally narrow concept of disease as the cause of incapacity for work, to cover for example hospital diagnostic procedures, elimination of a congenital defect in view of health improvement or prevention of adverse psychic sequelae, addiction, mental disorders, and so on. In cases of step-wise return to working, the incapable-to-work status continues to apply, as in the event of an unsuccessful trial to resume working. When an illness occurs during participation in a retraining programme, incapacity for work is not determined in terms of the former occupation but in the context of the demands posed by the vocational retraining being attended.","1790":"","1791":"The principles developed some 40 years ago by Sir Ludwig Guttmann and Ernest Bors for the treatment of spinal cord injured persons have in the Federal Republic of Germany been taken up, in the fifties, by a few doctors as well as the Central Association of Industrial Injuries Insurance Institutes. Their efforts have brought about a radically different situation concerning life expectancy and life-styles of SCI patients, not only the accident-injured but increasingly also for persons with disease-related spinal lesions. The emphases of development have been: improved mechanisms for referral to specialized facilities, rescue system progress, new findings in diagnosis and therapy, improvement of social and vocational re-integration, growing mutual understanding of paraplegics and their environments, as well as increased self-assertiveness of the paraplegic population. These aspects are examined more closely. Further improvements may be achieved through: admission to specialized treatment facilities immediately following onset, appraisal of relevant issues pertaining to indications for, and techniques of spinal surgery, improved preventive efforts relative to thromboses and embolism, control of the paralytic bladder, a smoother provision of adapted living conditions outside the clinic-based special facilities, and through extension as well as lifelong availability of adequate aftercare services. In the event of certain illnesses, up-to-date treatment of paraplegics must be ensured by the hospital departments concerned with the basis illness. Recreational facilities, and inclusion of psychological and psychotherapeutic services in residential rehabilitation programmes for SCI patients require further attention.","1792":"Follow-up rehabilitation (Anschlussheilbehandlung--AHB) is more and more developing into the decisive element of an up-to-date concept of rehabilitation. It covers patients in urgent need of rehabilitative services immediately following discharge from hospital treatment in order to enable them to reintegrate more speedily in occupational and social life. Field studies have shown that the number of patients referred to these follow-up programmes could be increase tenfold. This would either require special AHB counsellors to be established at hospital level, or the creation of adequately staffed AHB centres servicing a certain number of hospitals. Both alternatives would be intended to select, in consultation with hospital doctors, those patients who could benefit from AHB measures, to assist in their referral to the appropriate AHB clinic, and to foster cooperation and contact between referring hospital and AHB clinic. The existing network of AHB clinics should moreover be extended in view of greater community orientation of service delivery. Follow-up rehabilitation programmes contribute to cost containment, as daily rates in AHB clinics are lower than in the hospitals, and because prolonged incapacity for work is avoided through early rehabilitation.","1793":"Prejudicial social attitudes towards people with disabilities have from time out of mind been handed down from one generation to the other. They reach far back into the history of mankind. From a social-educational angle it is relevant to trace not only the motivational aspects involved but also the formative forces in historically evolved ambivalent attitudes towards persons with disabilities.","1794":"","1795":"The present article reports the findings obtained from wheelchair field testing at Frankfurt central station and airport, initiated by the working group on \"Public Transport Accessibility\" of the Federal Rehabilitation Council (BAR) and approved by its managing board. Relevant information concerning accessibility and useability of this major traffic junction for handicapped persons is presented. The test emphases are put forth, namely access of wheelchair users to intercity and suburban traffic as well as to air transport facilities. Planning and implementation of the field test as well as participating persons and organizations are outlined; test sequence and test evaluation are described. Finally, major aspects of test findings and their evaluation are dealt with in more detail.","1796":"Based on the special problems encountered by older and disabled workers, the authors investigate the potential of \"learning and communications skills\" training in enhancing the vocational and social reintegration in trade\/technical-sector occupations. The experiences outlined refer to retrainees in the field of metal processing. They demonstrate that extra-functional learning goals such as communication skills and the ability to learn systematically, are more easily accomplished when the skills training occurs in association with the functional learning objectives (i.e. occupation-related skills).","1797":"Founding of a working group of the rehabilitation facilities of the II. phase has occasioned the present study of developments in this area, as seen in particular from the vocational angle. The main emphasis is the role played by the call for integration in rehabilitation, i.e. inclusion of the disease- or disability-generated occupational problems as a vital social aspect to be considered in the treatment and rehabilitation process. For patients in residential programmes, examples are given from the sector of \"occupational therapy and job family-related vocational assessment\": preparatory vocational programmes, occupational analysis, vocational assessment, and individualized conditioning. Beyond medical care, the centres of the II. phase had been intended to provide \"vocational adjustment services\"; critical appraisal however reveals the degree of legal imprecision of this term, as well as its lacking in factual delimitation from other forms of rehabilitative measures stipulated in rehabilitation legislation. Also, the vocational functions assigned to the II. and III. phase respectively, tend to overlap more and more, at least at the conceptual level. What is therefore needed to further development of the vocational tasks and functions to be integrated in the II. phase into a direction where a need does exist and where the specific potential of these centres can be used in a meaningful and economical way: the care of most severely disabled persons for whom vocational services require a special educational emphasis.","1798":"Critical evaluation of the long-term follow-up experience in three patients with melia leads to the conclusion that prosthetic care must be regarded as inadequate and useless, as an instance of overtreatment. The reasons are shown, the special problems in rehabilitation of amelic patients are put forth.","1799":"When the therapeutic alliance between physician or psychotherapist, and epileptic patient is seriously disrupted (non-compliance) group psychotherapy is capable of bringing about marked changes in coping with the epileptic condition. Even a brief therapy of 20 sessions with epileptic young people undergoing initial vocational training contributes to their learning to perceive problems present in their vocational-social development, as well as various disease phenomena and therapeutic possibilities. Eight young adults aged 18-20 years who had been referred to the Annedore Leber Vocational Training Centre for psychological and neurological examination suffered from frequent seizures, which had in each case been attributable to non-compliance. On completion of therapy, serum levels of anti-epileptic drugs had reached the therapeutic range. None of them failed to complete their vocational training.","1800":"Rehabilitative measures should not set in only after a patient's discharge from hospital but already during his in-patient stay. This applies in particular relative to the occupational integration or reintegration of psychiatric patients, all the more so since rehabilitation always includes a certain measure of prevention. The author presents the system of occupational rehabilitation consulting hours practised at the Psychiatric Clinic of the University of Mainz for some 15 years now, in which some 800 patients have so far been counselled; further, the work of the clinical psychologist in the framework of this rehabilitative measure is described. The psychological evaluation methods used are presented in detail, emphasizing their importance for occupational rehabilitation. Social contacts being essential also in the working world, the relevant personality questionnaires and projective methods used are set forth, illustrating their relationship to the patient counselled.","1801":"Integral cooperation of a clinical psychologist or psychotherapist in an internal medicine rehabilitation clinic is required because the presence of (contributory) psychic causes is evident beyond any doubt in numerous complaint syndromes. Regrettably, decision-making bodies frequently fail to acknowledge the necessity of competent psychological help. Various activities have developed as specific psychotherapeutic tasks, among them individual interviewing and above all group work (client-centered psychotherapy, staff-client meetings, health education, autogenic relaxation training, creativity therapy, biofeedback, and so on). Client-centered psychotherapy indications are outlined. Medical psychology, psychotherapy, and psychosomatic aspects of disease concepts must not be ignored if major concerns in medial rehabilitation and inpatient rehabilitative treatment programmes are to be dealt with effectively.","1802":"The article gives an overview of the importance and potentialities of psychology in the context of rehabilitation, outlining, among others, the psychologist's various tasks and functions relative to diagnosis, counselling, and therapy in medical, education, vocational, and psychosocial rehabilitation. Theories describing psychosocial factors involved in the development of, and in coping with, disability are discussed. Further, psychological intervention approaches are set out, focussing on their particular relevance to rehabilitation. Special attention is given to the psychologist's position within the interdisciplinary team, as well as to possibilities for, and requirements of, professional training and further education in rehabilitation psychology. As the various subjects could not be dealth with exhaustively, the article includes numerous references for further reading and links up with subsequent five contributions dealing with the main theme of the present issue of Die Rehabilitation.","1803":"","1804":"On account of negative reactions encountered in their social environment, as well as unfulfillable aesthetic expectations they themselves hold concerning their physical appearance, persons with facial or other damages to the skin are weakened in their selfworth to a degree that they no longer dare to show their body. Repeated frustrations have entailed a level of sensitization that withdrawal into isolation appears the only course of action possible. In the Hornheide special clinic, an integrated rehabilitation model has been developed and tested, incorporating a special desensitization procedure by exposure to swimming pool situations, which is described in detail in the present article.","1805":"Responsibility in the field of non-industrial vocational rehabilitation is divided between the public law social security institutions, and the rehabilitation facilities which, formally, come under private law. The legal bases governing the relationship among financially responsible social security institution - rehabilitee - rehabilitation facility have as yet not been determined by normative legislation. This fact gives rise to difficulties in dealing with the legal issues involved. Rehabilitation services are delivered by facilities for vocational training or re-training, as well as workshops for the disabled. Since the 20th pension adjustment act has come into effect, the most important financially responsible social security institution has been the Federal Employment Institute.","1806":"In 50 children admitted to the Gailingen neurological rehabilitation clinic for children and young people following craniocerebral trauma to undergo several months of rehabilitative treatment, the process of regression of the neuropsychological disorders incurred has been systematically monitored. At the onset of in-patient rehabilitation the children under study demonstrated reduced performance levels, the disorders taking the form of a marked disintegration of the various functional dimensions. In the course of the rehabilitative treatment, hierarchical integration of the various functions concerned increased steadily, resulting on the whole in more economical and adequate cognitive strategies. The rehabilitation process as such is conceived as a process of re-structuring, and not primarily as a learning process in the classical sense. The regression of the initial symptoms over the three-months observation period had been verifiable in all test procedures applied. Yet, some 25 to 30 percent of the children under study presented considerable learning impairments on their discharge from in-patient treatment, so that special education measures are indicated for these children.","1807":"","1808":"The sailing schooner Jachara makes one-week turns in the Western Baltic Sea with the youth groups on board serving as crew members. Numerous changes and adaptions have since 1979 been introduced so that, today, ship is suitable for young people with hearing, and visual impairments, as well as for wheelchair users.","1809":"A sub-project of the research investigation \"Model Workplaces for Disabled Persons in Sheltered Workshops in Berlin (West)\", the pilot project \"Placement Models and Industrial Workplaces\", which was funded jointly by the Federal Ministry for Research and Technology and the senator for Labour and Social Affairs of the Land Berlin, undertook to investigate more fully into the issue of opportunities for, and obstacles to industrial placement of disabled persons, in particular of sheltered workshop clients, by studying the situation present in selected enterprises, and to elaborate, on the basis of empirical stock-taking of the problems found, proposals for measures directed at improving the conditions for integrating disabled persons in open employment. Apart from analyzing workplaces as to their suitability for sheltered workshop clients, the project included expert talks involving staff from various functional departments of several Berlin enterprises on problems and general conditions in the industrial integration of disabled persons. The present contribution reports some of the main findings of these expert talks, and is intended to examine more closely some central issues in industrial placement of disabled persons. In particular, it deals with - the current state of, and the basic organizational conditions for industrial integration of disabled workers, - the attitudes of employers toward recruiting disabled persons. On this basis, approaches are outlined for improving the employment situation of the population concerned, as well as their prospects of (re)settlement.","1810":"On the occasion of the International Year of Disabled Persons, postage stamps have been issued by almost all countries in the world, individual ones, arranged in series or as commemorative sheets. Hardly an aspect of rehabilitation having been omitted, a wide range of stamps is available. This article, therefore, gives an overview of the 73 stamps before the author, organizing them into major rehabilitational categories. Many countries have used the emblem of the Year, depicting a disabled and a non-disabled person joining hands in mutual support, surrounded by the United Nations laurels. Other frequent themes are a country's most pressing rehabilitation problems, tasks ahead, or integration-related subjects. Noteworthy is the frequency of symbols representing certain disabilities, such as wheelchairs, crutches, eye\/white cane, or ear\/hearing aid, being used by countries around the world to advocate understanding and helpfulness towards disabled persons. Commemorative medals issued for the International Year are also mentioned.","1811":"To this day, sports and movement therapy hold a marginal position in psychiatric rehabilitation. In order to survey the psychiatric facilities as regards personnel and space available, questionnaires had been sent to 260 hospitals. From evaluation of the data received from 121 clinics (46,5%), a therapist-bed-ratio of 1:125 was obtained. It was found that this ratio worsens with increasing numbers of hospital beds. More favourable conditions are present in special clinics in the fields of child and adolescent psychiatry, addiction, and psychosomatics. A majority (85%) of the staff administering sports and movement therapy do not hold additional qualifications specific to this area of work. Movement and sports therapists frequently are not yet included in the therapeutic team. An unfavourable situation is present in terms of space and equipment available. In order to ensure adequate therapeutic work, changes are needed as regards staffing, space, and contents.","1812":"","1813":"The article presents the system for medical-psychological base and trend documentation developed between 1977 and 1980 at Rotenburger Anstalten der Inneren Mission (Home Mission). A practicable system from the user angle, it is operated on a mediumsized data processing unit. Being a pure dialogue system with programme generators, it is easy to handle and flexible in its possible applications, several of which are illustrated by examples from the rehabilitative field. As the various characteristics used can easily be attributed with other contents, and as the data base can moreover be expanded, the documentation system could also be used by comparable facilities that have the necessary electronic data processing equipment at their disposal.","1814":"The concept of integrated developmental intervention with profoundly disabled children has been evolved and tested in the school trial carried out at the Landstuhl Rehabilitation Centre Westpfalz. In its basic stage the intervention programme encompasses the availability of a good caring relationship between caregiver and child, with reliable satisfaction of needs and gentle child-centered care. This serves as a basis for systematic perceptual development by Basal Stimulation, movement development and initiation of communicative behaviour. The second stage in this developmental approach includes facilitation of continued growth of the children by experiencing concrete doing and meaning contexts. In line with the particular life situation of the parents and their children, parent involvement takes on a special dimension. Developmental intervention with profoundly disabled children presupposes the existence of an appropriate general framework.","1815":"Any educational theory, hence also of education of the physically disabled, combines both deduced constituents of educational philosophy and constituents generalized from educational science in an experiental sense. By combining normative goal concepts and empirical analysis, it has to lay the basis for responsible action on the part of the educator. These foundations of an educational theory for education of the physically disabled as an \"action-oriented science\" are considered in a discourse of the relationship between experience, theory, and practice. Several exemplary aspects are set forth, with an emphasis being placed on a historical science-critical reflection on the connection of scientific (pre-)-experience and (pre-scientific) theory formation. Concluding, the author points out the implications in view of intensifying the theory-practice-relation in the professional training for education of physically disabled persons.","1816":"","1817":"","1818":"Reduced physical capacity in schizophrenic illness has been described in medical literature, but so far not been substantiated empirically. The findings of progressive bicycle ergometry confirm the assertion, with the following main results having been obtained: 1. As opposed to a matched comparison group of untrained healthy clients, the schizophrenically ill patients demonstrated significantly lower endurance levels in respect of the aerobic-anaerobic threshold. 2. Relative to the load maximum attainable highly significant differences existed between the groups. Particularly noteworthy had been early exercise termination already at submaximal loads by the schizophrenic patients. 3. The patients under study obtained values one third below standard compared to the maximum load target for untrained persons, with age and weight being taken into account. The findings are discussed as regards the possible causes of the performance reductions found as well as possibilities for improvement, demanding in particular that sports therapy programmes receive greater emphasis in the rehabilitation process. Also, the results obtained should be taken into consideration in the design of vocational rehabilitation measures.","1819":"Medical elimination\/reduction of a more or less acute functional disorder may be something considerably different from restoration to good health, or the ability to lead an independent life. The form this discrepancy may take; what it can mean to the patient, not least in terms of time consumed; which possibilities there are in view of a new beginning, a re-orientation; which ways and means there exist on the part of the patient as on that of the therapeutic personnel involved, or in the light of the legislative provisions; which role is played by society through the employer; how difficult it is to give a prognosis; these are the issues the authors intend to illustrate by describing the rehabilitation process a young woman of 26 years of age underwent following successful re-canalization of a previously thrombosed basilar artery by urokinetic fibrinolysis. It is also underlined that any rehabilitative measure taken should be oriented towards attainable goals, and be based on consultation (but not necessarily general agreement) among the rehabilitative team. This approach will help the patient comprehend the purpose of the measures taken, and serve to prevent hard feelings that may develop.","1820":"","1821":"Intended for the disabled person and those who advise him, for the physician and occupational therapist, as well as the engineering staff involved, an overview is given of assistive devices that have recently become available, i.e. --telephone sets for disabled persons of the German Federal Postal Administration and\/or Standard Elektrik Lorenz AG, with or without environmental controls, --pertaining accessory units, --other devices designed to assist telecommunication. Based on novel, residual-capacity-related classifications of disability, the appliances that may be required in the individual case are set forth. Graphs are used to depict the various disabilities concerned, with reference lines and arrows pointing to the devices answering to the requirements of a given disability. Concluding, the author deals with some issues involved in counselling and provision.","1822":"By a number of varying actions disabled people have attempted during the International Year of Disabled Persons to draw the general public's attention to the marginality of their position. The sometimes offensive course of action adopted by some gave rise to a variety of responses. What has at any rate been re-affirmed is the demand of disabled people to take their problems in their own hands. A look back into the history of self-help associations however shows that equal hardships will not of necessity bring about solidarity. It will, therefore, be crucial to foster the ability for integrative solidarity both among the groups of disabled people and on the part of the non-disabled public.","1823":"","1824":"In the four phases of rehabilitation (the medical, educational, vocational, and social phase) it is the function of the law to set the frame of objectives for, and the procedures to be followed in, rehabilitation. In this connexion, legal science has a threefold function: It is an auxiliary and reference science of educational and medical rehabilitation; it is the basic science for transferring social policies into substantive legislation; and alongside the social sciences, it is the special branch of science relevant to social-vocational rehabilitation. An overview of the lectures and courses offered in the field of rehabilitation demonstrates that the legal discipline is markedly under-represented when compared to the medical and social sciences. Six postulates are put forward for the legal science's role of basic science, followed by a demonstration of its capacity of special branch of science by means of the \"Rehabilitation Guidelines for the Future in the Medical, Vocational, Educational and Social Fields\" issued by Rehabilitation International. Finally, the legal science's function of auxiliary and reference science is set forth, allocating to it a general function of reference science. For accomplishing these tasks, an Institute of Rehabilitation Law is called for, and the central tasks of such an institution are described, e.g. linking rehabilitation practice and legal science, uniform curricular orientation of the professional schools, international comparisons of rehabilitation legislation, or the importance of the law for the development of rehabilitation models as well as for the pertaining operational requirements.","1825":"In the summer of 1980 fifty women with breast or uterine cancer participating in a health resort measure for cancer aftercare took part in an extended sports and movement therapy programme, which included hiking, swimming, play and dance activities, as well as specific gymnastic exercises to improve shoulder joint function. Only 38 percent of the women had previously received physical therapy during primary clinical treatment. On the basis of a standardized questionnaire submitted at the beginning and at the end of the aftercare measure, information was obtained from 42 women on their holiday and leisure behaviour, on the expected aftercare measure outcome, as well as their attitudes towards sports. In a follow-up interview some six months later 71 percent reported continued sports activities. Exercise programmes must be simple, their effectiveness explained, and they must be felt to be beneficial. As had been the case with the coronary sports groups, the establishment of local \"cancer sports groups\" needs to be actively pursued.","1826":"The author draws attention of three myths that seem to be establishing in the framework of psychosocial rehabilitation of cancer patients, i.e. - that our current knowledge of the psychosocial situation of cancer patients is sufficient to enable systematic therapies to be offered; - that our current knowledge allows coping processes in cancer patients to be evaluated; - that disease models stemming from the treatment of neuroses can be transferred to psychotherapy of cancer patients. The potentially adverse implications these doctrines have for practical therapeutic work are underlined, and proposals are put forward relative to the fundamental research needed in the field of psychotherapy of cancer patients.","1827":"The assistance offered to a patient during the process of adapting to a stoma should always be tailored to individual needs and to disease development. This requires consideration of all those involved in treatment and care, including from the very outset the family doctor, the patient's relatives and pastor, as well as the nursing staff of community-based health and social services centres (Sozialstationen). Adjustment to a stoma takes about twelve months. It is important, among others, to see about social-legislative aids being made available, and to actively enhance the patient getting in touch with a self-help group if he does not do so of his own accord. The smooth interplay of all those involved in treatment and care, the experience of a kind of therapeutic community, are most likely to ensure to the patient an individualized and speedy course of the rehabilitative process.","1828":"When sufficient experience had been accumulated to support the view that intensive aftercare of the consequences of cancer will have a favourable impact on the individual's prognosis, the German social insurance institutions extended coverage to aids for vocational reintegration, and a medical indication of cancer rehabilitation. Own experience gathered since in the longterm care of cancer patients, which lasted up to three years, almost invariably brought about improvements in the quality of life, often a prolongation of survival time that was worth living, and occasionally a shorter incapacity for work. The decisive factor in this connexion was found to be individualized occupational therapy measures, which, when appropriate, included art and music therapy, structured psychotherapy that included relaxation exercises and group talks as well as recreational activities, both active and passive. The significance of these therapy plans is understood when one takes into account that cancer patients tend to withdraw from their environment due to their anxieties and an impaired self-worth. On account of misconceptions on the disease and its causes those affected by it are often kept away from and further isolated, which aggravates the already existing deficit of social contacts. Insufficient ability to creatively use excessive leisure time will invariably entail brooding over one's personal fate, with depressive reactions being an often unavoidable result.","1829":"100 patients of the neurological clinic of the University of Cologne affected by tumors of the brain or spinal cord, had been interviewed according to a catalogue of disabilities developed on the lines of the WHO classification of impairments, disabilities, and handicaps. Two months later, 55 patients who had had a previous disease history of less than 12 months, again reported on the course of their disease and the difficulties they experienced. Most of them in their middle years, the patients studied were disabled to very different degrees, the majority of them experiencing greater or lesser limitations in almost all areas of life. The occurrence of individual disabilities, above all visual impairments, personal care disabilities, of locomotion, manual activity, and disorders of balance, was found to be dependent on patient age and tumor diagnosis, whereas disease duration appeared to have little impact.","1830":"","1831":"Inpatient measures are an important element of cancer aftercare. The statutory bases are contained in the various branches of the pensions and sickness insurance systems, as well as in the Federal Social Assistance Act. The establishment of working groups of the financially responsible institutions has, in many parts of the Federal Republic of Germany, entailed decisive improvements in the potentialities of inpatient aftercare measures. Speedier and intensified communication and cooperation among all persons and agencies involved are needed.","1832":"The major aspects of oncological rehabilitation and aftercare are set forth. Among the medical subjects dealt with are causes, forms of treatment and their results, as well as the consequences of those cancers having a particularly far-reaching impact on the patient, both at the somatic and psychic levels. This is followed by an outline of the limitations and potentialities present in vocational rehabilitation, of measures available for, and objectives of, vocational reintegration, with subsequent consideration of the social environment as regards recreational activities, sports, problems of housing adaption, and transport participation. The author concludes by briefly explaining several of the pertaining social-legislative questions.","1833":"In the framework of a personal investigation seven blind hand amputees (survivors of world war II, and of the Portuguese colonial war) had been interviewed to study the influence of myoelectric prosthetic fitting on their social and vocational rehabilitation. Five of them use their prostheses from eight to fifteen hours a day, primarily in the office; at home they prefer their Krukenberg stump. For the clients' self-esteem, the cosmetic factors seems to be decisive. Yet all of the clients engaged in (desk) work emphasize that they could do their jobs without using the myoelectric prostheses, without however wishing to be provided with some other type of prosthesis.","1834":"The former Spinal Cord Injuries Department within the Hamburg Accident Hospital of the Industrial Injuries Insurance Institutes has been expanded from 33 to 100 beds. 60 beds started operation on Febr. 1, 1981, another 20 on Aug. 1, 1981 and the remaining 20 beds on Jan. 1, 1982. The present report is based on admissions during the first twelve months of the Centre's operation, i.e. 136 recent cases and 98 re-admissions, 92% of which had come from Northern Germany. 35% of the recent cases had been admitted during the first 48 hours post-onset. 39% of the patients were tetraplegics, 57% had complete paralysis, 13% non-traumatic affections. 60% of the patients had associated injuries. 60% were covered by statutory sickness insurance. The average length of stay was 113 days for tetraplegic, and 112 days for paraplegic patients. In 60% the extent of paralysis remained unchanged. Of 10 deaths, three were due to pulmonary embolism. Decubitus ulcers had been the indication for re-admission in 36%, of whom only 20% were tetraplegics. Average stay for decubitus ulcers was three times as long as in other re-admission causes. The services rendered by the various professional departments as well as by medical consultants are reported in tabular form. The expansion responded to an urgent need, and has, among others, contributed to easing many avoidable social problems (such as long distances from home).","1835":"328 patients with a definite or classical adult rheumatoid arthritis were studied over a five-year treatment period. Two groups of patients were established from this total population. One group was treated primarily on an outpatient basis, with the treatment consisting always in medical care given by the general practitioner or a hospital outpatient department. The other group received inpatient treatment in a special rehabilitation centre once or twice a year, or according to necessity. During these measures the whole range of medical, vocational and social care was provided, as appropriate to the clients' needs. On evaluation of this five-year period, it is found that the patient group who had undergone periodical rehabilitative treatment every year demonstrated markedly better functional results than did the group which had almost exclusively received medication.","1836":"The Social Code prescribes to the institutions financially responsible for rehabilitation to use their budgetary funds in accord with the principles of cost-effective and economical conduct, and to set up cost-benefit analyses in appropriate cases. This, however, presupposes a close and trusting working relationship between the financially responsible institutions and the rehabilitation facilities. It is possible to apply cost-benefit analysis to vocational rehabilitation; however, only those data should be included in the assessment that can in fact be clearly quantified. To ward off the danger of vocational rehabilitation missing labour market demands, improved statistical accessibility is recommended. The financially responsible institutions and the labour administration should draw up an overall statistical survey of rehabilitation--possibly in the form of a \"rehabilitation report\"--, containing break-downs of labour market statistics for comparison. This would facilitate vocational rehabilitation being accompanied and evaluated by research, the results obtained would be more obvious and clear. Improved prediction as regards employment opportunities of the rehabilitees could result.","1837":"Research and development in the area of wheelchair design has almost come to a standstill in the post-WW II period. The project outlined in this paper has considered technical-functional aspects, handling characteristics, recent ergonomic findings, as well as semantic functions, and translated these into exemplary solutions. The concept of an indoor wheelchair with a limited range of outdoor uses is determined by the unit construction principle (seating and frame). The chair has a firm upholstered seat with the backrest being adjustable to individual needs by means of a gas compression spring (working\/resting positions). The seat folds and can be detached from the frame. The frame, too, is collapsible by means of a folding mechanism. Armrests are adjustable in height to individual needs. A special alternative has been developed for elderly persons where specific requirements and needs had to be accommodated.","1838":"Rehabilitation facilities (N=110) in the Federal Republic of Germany had been surveyed in order primarily to take stock of the psychological\/psychotherapeutical services available for treatment in various disorders. The numbers of psychologists employed are shown to vary with the diagnostic groups served by the respective institutions. Facilities in the field of child and adolescent psychiatry, for the care of disabled person, and of persons with dependence problems are much better provided with psychologists than are facilities in the fields of psychiatry, neurology, and internal medicine. The same picture is found as regards the patients\/psychologist ratios applicable in the different facilities. Preference of certain psychotherapeutical models (behavioural therapy, client-centered psychotherapy, psychoanalysis) varies with facility type. Especially noteworthy is an apparent predominance of inpatient services as opposed to outpatients models of service delivery. This fact is an indication of insufficient availability of follow-up care. Finally, various curricular aspects of the professional training of psychologists are outlined in relation to the recently established specialty of rehabilitation psychology.","1839":"The workload on a physically disabled subject is compared to the load on a non-disabled subjects at identical tasks over a period of 5 shifts each. Various indicators for assessment of the physical working capacity as well as recordings of heart rates during activity are compared. The findings indicate that, in spite of comparable load, the strain may be greater for the disabled person than for the non-disabled, which does however not necessarily entail a difference in output.","1840":"Despite an increasing availability of smaller decentralized facilities, the main responsibility for provision of inpatient nursing and care of disabled persons continues to lie with the homes and institutions traditionally providing long-term services for disabled people. In Baden-Wuerttemberg, a total of 70 homes and institutions, which vary greatly in size and structure, as available, comprising a total of 10,457 places in their nursing and residential sections. By far the greatest portion of the existing places (78.5 percent) is provided by institutions catering people with mental retardation. The average utilisation of the places available in homes and institutions is 97.4 percent. Client population structure in the facilities for mentally retarded persons differs appreciably from that of other facilities. This applies in particular to client age and to the treatment and therapy the individual receives. According to a 1979-1980 survey, the waiting lists of the homes and institutions comprised 785 applications for admission of disabled persons among them 290 applications for urgent admission and 495 made for precautionary reasons. A total of 9,148 places are available in sheltered workshops in Baden-Wuerttemberg. Average utilisation is 92.2 percent. Workshop population structure is characterised by a high share of younger clients. Only few openings will therefore presumably contrast with a high number of applications for entry that are expected to be forth-coming The need for sheltered workshop places will therefore continue to rise over the years ahead.","1841":"The institutions traditionally catering for the mentally ill and disabled are more and more turning into Psychiatric Hospitals (Clinification). Efforts are being concentrated on treatment and therapy, while a majority of the chronically ill and disabled are placed in nursing homes for their long-term care (and are pensioned prematurely). Though an extensive network of rehabilitation facilities has been developed in the Federal Republic of Germany, and although social legislation has provided for equal status of the mentally ill and disabled with other ill or disabled persons, only a negligibly small number of patients from psychiatric facilities are given the opportunity for participating in rehabilitative measures. This arises from the fact that the present range of facilities has in the fist line been developed according to the rehabilitational needs of people with physical disability, and from a reluctance on the part of the agencies financially responsible for rehabilitation services and benefits (with the exception of social welfare) to honour this social legislative title of their mentally ill or disabled insured (except for patients with dependence problems and neuroses). As the official disability statistics, too, usually negate the specificity of mental illness and disability the problematic issue does not emerge openly.","1842":null,"1843":"Starting out from Caplan's thinking on the concept of prevention and on crisis theory, it is contended for the care of persons with paraplegia, as for that of physically disabled people generally, that psychological prevention must set in already during their stay in hospital. A study of 77 paraplegic individuals confirms the urgent need for these efforts, which aim at reducing the occurrence of stressful situations and at promoting the most favourable outcome possible. They presuppose a search for environmental conditions that may generate crisis in individual disability groups, and also on what exactly it is that makes up for their being psychologically taxing. The findings obtained then form the basic structure for the concrete procedure to be followed by the rehabilitation facility. The central focus of this management approach is the problem-solving method, coupled with and extended by major components of discussion therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy, and of social skills training.","1844":"","1845":"This study permits analytical statements on the possibility of taking up work by progressive steps (increasing working hours 4-6-8 hrs), which had been initiated in 1971. Previous (publications had confined to purely descriptive statements (2,3,4). Summarising, the following findings are essential: Premature retirement is less frequent. Resettlement in employment is achieved more smoothly, if not in all instances earlier (in relation to the point of time when full-day working is resumed). The improved psycho-emotional situation created by this mode of resettlement is rather clearly felt by the clients, and is stated to have been an aid of decisive value. It was found that there is too little awareness of this possibility of step-wise return to work after prolonged incapacity for work. More factual information needs above all be disseminated to institutions at enterprise level (company doctors, personnel departments, members of the personnel and works councils).","1846":"Considering the benefits of toothbrushing in dental health, the superiority of the electric toothbrush over conventional toothbrushes is described. The various special effects of electric toothbrushing for the cerebral palsied and the epileptic child are set forth, as are the procedures to be observed in initial use. In the treatment of dysarthria, the electric toothbrush may moreover be helpful for desensitizing the mouth area. Carers should be advised on how to apply the electric toothbrush as well as on the effects of so-called oral jet cleaners.","1847":"A case report is presented describing the possible applications of couple therapy (Masters\/Johnson) in couples where a severe physical disability is present, beyond disturbances of sexual functioning. In the instance reported, a severe sexual aversion was present in the wife, with disturbances of excitation and orgasm, while the husband was paralysed due to adult poliomyelitis affecting his entire trunk and limbs. Based on the course of therapy and its outcome, the author discusses the specific problems and potentialities of this type of therapeutic intervention.","1848":"Neither in the Federal Republic of Germany has the 1981 International Year of Disabled Persons (IYDP) brought about what quite a few disabled people had expected it to. It could not possibly have done so. The problems of people with disabilities are so complex that one year alone is not enough to make society aware of all of them, not to speak of sensitising the disabled and the able-bodied towards getting on well with one another, to achieve which would improve the life situation of disabled people to an appreciable extent. Yet something good has come about, though perhaps not in terms of \"measurable effect\", namely an increased consideration for people with disabilities on the part of the able-bodied. And this is essential to the future of the disabled population. Beyond New Year's Eve 1981, it is up to the disabled (and many of them are in a position to do so) to keep alive the many initiatives and issues raised by IYDP, and to see to their continued discussion.","1849":"","1850":"Psychosomatics are presently undergoing a period of reorientation. Its scope is extending beyond the traditional, typically psychosomatic disorders to disease processes that are of considerable relevance to rehabilitation, offering novel explanatory models. Psychosocial influences are vital to the course of rehabilitation, too. This is discussed on the examples of coronary diseases and motor disability. Psychic factors may increase the risk of being affected by a disease, or they may be activated during the disease and rehabilitation processes (as in traumatic neurosis). In either case can maximum rehabilitation success be accomplished only when these factors are taken into account. Hence, psychotherapeutic supports are indispensable components of the rehabilitation effort, with analytical therapy needing be supplemented and abbreviated by other techniques. In their institutional structures, rehabilitation facilities moreover have at their disposal a therapeutic potential that could be utilized. This would however presuppose an increased interest in psychodiagnosis - not least in view of the pressing need for prevention.","1851":"","1852":"Based on the experiences gained with over 10,600 patients affected by attritional, degenerative or other changes of the locomotor system, as well as by insufficiencies of the cardiovascular system, early rehabilitative health resort measures are reported on. Assuming appropriate prior diagnostic as well as monitoring procedures being provided form movement therapy and sports, conceived as integrative components of an active treatment plan comprising natural remedies, are gaining increased importance. In line with sports physiology evidence, adequate improvement, however, presupposes application of these measures at a rate apt of achieving an appreciable, measurable training effect. This is true especially in those cases where a wide spectrum of gymnastic or sports activities - with an emphasis on group activity and expert supervision - are offered that are not based on the principles of increased performance alone but are designed to give some scope to personal inclinations. Along with its purely therapeutical value, health resort early rehabilitation conceived on these lines offers meaningful opportunities for actively experiencing success, an experience that is capable of giving new impulses for a modified life style at home, thereby contributing positively towards the general health of our population.","1853":"The widespread terminological habit of describing and explaining even very profound disabilities along the conceptual lines of developmental retardation is critically appraised and commented. Emphasis is given to essential, if often unidentified or unsaid, implications of this explanatory approach, i.e. the assumption of common characteristics in the \"retarded\" person and the \"non retarded\" younger person, implying the optimistic fiction of a contigency for \"catching up\" on present developmental delays. This conceptual model is discarded as representing a deceptive euphemism, springing from the absence of an anthropology that posits acceptance of a human being regardless of his or her being different without challenging the fact of his or her humanness and intrinsic rights.","1854":"Starting from the usual in-patient rehabilitation measures for myocardial infarction patients and based on the authors' clinical experiences, a working model is presented concerning the health educational care of patients undergoing rehabilitation procedures immediately following infarction or bypass operation. The new concept is based on a psychosomatic view of the cardiovascular diseases, and uses group-dynamic elements in its methodological approach. The rehabilitational tasks of health education are understood as therapeutic strategies and are aimed at achieving changes on the attitudinal and behavioural level.","1855":"Two practical examples are given to demonstrate variants in the use of anatomical forearm-hand splinting in a child with arthrogryposis. Crucial to successful application had been thorough functional assessment carried out previously by the occupational therapist.","1856":"The present study deals with the question whether there are differences between disabled (n = 83) and non-disabled (n = 32) subjects concerning their ratings of (a) their subjective confidence in their potential for occupational activities and (b) the anticipated requirements of their intended jobs. No statistical differences have been found. Thalidomide-affected subjects however tend to choose an occupation the anticipated requirements of which are identical with their own subjective confidence in potential skills while ablebodied subjects ascribe themselves a wider range of potential skills their intended jobs. No statistical differences have been found. Thalidomide-affected subjects however tend to choose an occupation the anticipated requirements of which are identical with their own subjective confidence in potential skills while ablebodied subjects ascribe themselves a wider range of potential skills their intended jobs. No statistical differences have been found. Thalidomide-affected subjects however tend to choose an occupation the anticipated requirements of which are identical with their own subjective confidence in potential skills while ablebodied subjects ascribe themselves a wider range of potential skills and abilities, beyond those required by the chosen job. The second emphasis of the study dealt with the effects of the \"induced\" occurrence of events unrelated to the training itself on the remaining preparedness for activity (frustration tolerance). Disabled subjects demonstrate significantly higher frustration ratings in the \"reactions of attachment figures\" factor than the control subjects. This does however not diminish their preparedness for activity (i.e. to train for the chosen occupation). The study is based on the choice of occupation behaviour questionnaires by Bender-Szymanski (1976).","1857":"","1858":"","1859":"Hand in hand with the continuing development of vocational counselling for disabled young people went to updating and differentiation of vocational orientation material available to the disabled for preparing their choice of occupation. Increased attention had above all been paid to counselling of the thalidomide-affected. Their concerns, especially as regards assessment of aptitudes and inclinations, are particularly headed in vocational guidance, an instrument that had been defined more specifically in the late seventies. The vocational education centres must be considered an essential aid in the training of, particularly, the physically disabled as the required accompanying services (for medical, psychological and social educational care) can be made available here. By means of training regulations for the disabled, as provided for in the Vocational Education Act and the handicrafts ordinance, these training facilities for the disabled are also most readily in a position to make allowances in view of the nature and consequences of a disability, when this is held to be necessary by the vocational counselling service due to the professional opinions presented by psychologists and\/or physicians. No rehabilitation measure can however be initiated unless the disabled young person and his or her parents consent.","1860":"An analysis is presented of the total of 13 official surveys conducted between 1906 and 1979 of the number of disabled persons in the former German Reich and today's Federal Republic of Germany. The concept of disability was found to have been adapted to societal changes. From a helpless charge to be taken care of, the concept of the disabled changed into that of a person suffering from illness, to become that of the rehabilitee having a physical, sensory, mental, psychic, or educational handicap, who has a right to being accepted as a full and equal member of the community. As regards the method of data collection, the initial state surveys administered in an authoritarian manner (via official agencies) were followed by direct interviewing of those concerned; today the disabled are again registered via official agencies. All of the surveys are characterised by inconsistent use of almost any variable; this fact--besides the lack of comparability of the statistics with each other--warrants fundamental doubt in their usefulness as planning tools. In all surveys the number of disabled persons had been underestimated.","1861":"The number of heart\/circulatory disease rehabilitation cases closed annually by the Federal Employment Institute has remained almost the same over the 1972-1978 period. In 1978 the national total of closed heart\/circulatory disease cases amounted to 6,325, with 945 of the clients having attended vocational rehabilitation measures\/courses. Some 25 percent of the cases are classified as \"condition following myocardial infarction\"; in male clients, this applies to about one third. Compared to the number of male clients, women are strongly under-represented in vocational rehabilitation of heart\/circulatory disease patients. In relation to the structure of the gainfully employed population total, the frequency of vocational rehabilitation measures on heart\/circulatory disease diagnoses varies strongly among the individual Laender employment office districts. Considerable differences are apparent when the age structure of heart\/circulatory disease rehabilitation cases is compared with that of any other disability group. In case of the first, the number of cases increases with age, while the trend is the very opposite in the latter case. This fact shows that vocational rehabilitation measures for heart\/circulatory disease patients need come up to special conditions, and that they have to be determined on different criteria. The rate of integrational solutions considered a positive outcome is considerably lower for heart\/coronary disease rehabilitees than for the total of rehabilitees. The participation in vocational rehabilitation programmes of 14.9 percent equally is considerably lower than the corresponding percentage of the total number of rehabilitation cases (26.2 percent).","1862":"Which effects of rehabilitative\/preventive treatment and psychotherapy during health resort rehabilitation procedures can be demonstrated in self-concept of patients? Are the effects of preventive\/rehabilitative treatment sufficient to stabilise psychologically impaired patients? Both at the beginning and at the end of health resort rehabilitation, 123 non-selected patients without psychotherapy, and 76 psychologically impaired patients who had received an average 7.5 hours of psychotherapeutic care, answered the Giessen test. Significant differences in initial and retest values are interpreted as effects of the rehabilitative\/preventive treatment, and as combined treatment plus psychotherapy effects. In order to obtain those effects that are attributable solely to psychotherapy, 29 persons showing equivalent values had been selected from each of the main sample populations, and comprised in two parallel samples. 1. Reduced depressiveness and an increase in positive social responsiveness are interpretable as effects of the treatment, with initial values having however been relatively inconspicious. 2. Psychotherapy patients are more compulsive, considerably more depressive, as well as more withdrawn and reduced in social potential than the other patients. The combined effect of treatment and psychotherapy achieved a marked decrease in depressiveness and compulsive behaviour, with positive social responsiveness and social potential increasing. 3. These same effects are present in the control group, and therefore are shown to be attributable to psychotherapy, not to the rehabilitative\/preventive treatment received. If the psychologically impaired patients are left without psychotherapeutic care, depressiveness and compulsive behavior will on the whole persist. They continue to feel rejected and despised, and remain unable to use the social opportunities available during health resort rehabilitation procedures. Their social potential does not increase.","1863":"Based on the assumption that myocardial infarction constitutes a multi-factorial psychosomatic-somatopsychic event, the author discusses the following psychotherapeutic objectives in working with myocardial infarction patients in a rehabilitation clinic: --treatment of hospitalisation symptoms --information on and awareness of risk factors --coping with the event --development of modified lifestyles.","1864":"The first Chair of rehabilitation psychology established in the Federal Republic of Germany was started at the Institute of Psychology of Freiburg University in the 1979\/1980 winter semester. On the basis of the conviction that interdisciplinarity constitutes a fundamental requirement for work and research in the rehabilitation field, the author discusses the tasks of rehabilitation psychology, and its relationship with medical and vocational rehabilitation. The working conditions faced by psychologists in the rehabilitation facilities as well as the preparation they hitherto used to receive during their studies for work in the rehabilitation field, are criticised. The curriculum developed in Freiburg for \"rehabilitation psychology\", as one of the fields of applied psychology included the studies for a university degree in psychology, is explained. Further, the new department's service delivery functions and intended research are presented.","1865":"The author holds the following theses: Rehabilitation is characterised by stigmatisation and isolation rather than by a holistic approach aimed at achieving partnership and through their own life performance, as a rule give an example of a social community: there are no marginal groups, unless the individual and his or her family conceive themselves as outsiders or marginal groups, and choose this situation as outsiders or marginal groups. and choose this situation to continue. What is desirable, however, is that joint efforts be made towards partnership. The route to reaching this aim --implies new standards in the sense of a higher degree of scientific orientation; --utilises life as a vehicle of cognition, and as an experimental activity undertaken by the cognizing individual; --is being put to the test of reality in the examples for integrated group cooperation within \"workplace families\", conceived as the basis for the development of \"neighbourhood families\", local groupings and so on in close interrelation with existing facilities and services.","1866":"In the 1977-1979 period, 84 thalidomide-affected young people who had followed secondary education up to level I (Sekundarstufe I; school leaving age approx. 16 years), had been interviewed on their sexual experiences. The group was composed of young people with purely orthopaedical impairments, which were rank-ordered in four degrees of disability severity according to the extent of medical lesion. The group under examination was matched by a parallel group of non-disabled young people who had been selected on the criteria of sex, age, educational level, vocational objectives, and occupational status of the father. In comparison to the non-disabled, physically disabled young people are demonstrated to have deficits in sexual experience, which are getting more pronounced with increasing severity of the disability. These deficits in sexual experience do not seem to stem from a lack of social contacts, but rather from their perceived non-compliance with the norms that govern non-disabled people's concepts of performance, attractiveness, and sexuality. The physically disabled young people are aware of these problems; they however seem to be able to cope with them through their leading a \"normal\" life as regards such aspects as school education, vocational training, and social contacts. Special emotional problems may however develop in the severely disabled young people. An additional sexual problem may arise from their partly less pronounced acquisition of typical sex-role identities, which may however also be viewed as a potentially positive circumstance.","1867":"This case-study of a 12-year old girl with learning and behavioural impairments investigates whether, and to what extent, a reduction of anxiety can be achieved by means of behaviourally oriented sports therapy. Following systematic use of behaviour therapy techniques as well as of model learning and systematic desensibilisation methods, significant modifications (p less than .05; p less than .01), or at least a tendency towards reduced anxiety ( p less than .10), have been stated both in respect of sports-related anxiety as well as of general and situational anxieties; assessment was made by means of the HANES KJ (Hamburg neuroticism and extraversion scale for children and adolescents), two sports-specific questionnaires, and a sports-motor test. No changes were stated using the AFS (anxiety questionnaire for students). The findings to a very large extent confirm our initial hypothesis that bodily movement is an agent capable of achieving anxiety reduction when behaviour therapy methods and techniques are used in the design of the sports activities.","1868":"An examination programme for assessing the functional capacities of the upper extremities with special regard to manual skills is presented. Experience involving 200 clients are reported on, permitting to assume the programme's usefulness in assessing functional disorders in the hand.","1869":"","1870":"The first stamps to draw attention to physical impairment were surcharge stamps issued during and after World War 1. A 1931 charity issue offered by the Netherlands post office was made up of postage stamps indicating to the public some of the problems involved in the care of handicapped children. Depiction of the concept of rehabilitation on stamps have been substantiated after 1945 by special cancels and first-day covers, and will be amply complemented in 1981, the International Year of Disabled Persons. Stamp and postmark collection is a hobby. If done with a view to specific design themes, it is a systematic hobby. The author describes the principal lines along which topical collection of disability-related stamps can be organised.","1871":"Within the framework of a study visit conducted to prepare for a German-French student exchange programme, various schools for the disabled as well as medical and vocational rehabilitation facilities had been visited, located in the vicinity of Toulouse and Auch in the South of France. Our interest focussed on programmes for motor development and stimulaton. Although the provision of physical education in not stipulated in the educational curricula, and notwithstanding a rather unfavourable general situation, promising beginnings have been noted. With the exception of leisure-time activities motor development is ignored in the vocational training facilities, while the clinics are limited to therapeutic activities. Model character can be attributed to the efforts undertaken by the YMCA in cooperation with the sports institute of Toulouse University (U.E.R.E.P.S.), aimed at comprehensive development and stimulation of the disabled within the YMCA-operated sheltered workshops which provide manifold opportunities for sports activities along various organisational patterns. Where coordination of activities exists among the facilities, it does not include the areas of physical education and sports. Even more so than in the Federal Republic of Germany, insight into the need for systematic development of the disabled through physical exercise seems to be lacking.","1872":"","1873":"Self-determination of the disabled is examined in the present paper on the criteria stated in the constitutional document of the Federal Republic of Germany, and in the United Nations' Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons, with a view to determining the extent to which disabled people are infringed upon in practising self-determination. It is shown that restrictions in self-determination are directly related to the severity of the disability, arising in particular from dependence on personal care, wheelchair dependence, financial difficulties, and in an institutional setting. Self-determination is a central concern in the entirely of disability work in the Federal Republic of Germany. Its implementation can be achieved only if a greater level of awareness and acceptance on the part of the non-disabled is brought about, as a basis of the will for positive partnership with the disabled. The disabled must equally accept the changes necessary to their lifestyles, in order to translate their right to fully develop their personality into actually self-determined life.","1874":"","1875":"Rehabilitation in transitional facilities (transitional residential homes) is a possible approach for those persons with psychic disorders or handicaps who are not in need of institutional care but cannot be treated adequately on an outpatient basis either. The cost of such rehabilitative programmes is carried by the social welfare authorities in more than 85 percent of the total number of clients. From the point of view of those concerned, who previously had been contributing to social insurance schemes, referral to social assistance is deemed an incompatibility. A change to his situation could be achieved by extending the scope of medical or vocational rehabilitation to include these benefits by way of legal interpretation rendered by the courts, or by the legislator conferring responsibility for the social rehabilitation field on the agencies financially responsible for medical and vocational rehabilitation.","1876":"Despite the many--often allegedly sensational--advances in the field of arm prosthetics, we continue to be far removed from satisfactory solutions especially where the needs of armless and bilaterally phocomelic children and young people are concerned. Continuing intensive research and development are needed but will never be able to render superfluous the compensatory potentialities of the feet in substituting hand function. Work to date in development and testing of technical aids for disabled children, which has been grant-aided generously over the past by the Federal Ministry of Youth, Health, and Family, as well as the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Order, have enabled us here in our Heidelberg clinic to elaborate the catalogue of indications and contraindications described for the prosthetic management of armless or phocomelic children and young people; to develop child- and age-adapted programmes for the training of compensatory functions; technical aids for coping with the activities of daily living, and to achieve the described further developments in the field of prosthetics. These novel types of prostheses have meanwhile been used successfully for patients with accident-related armlessness. These experiences are of use not only to the field of prosthetic management but beyond that to the entire rehabilitation programming for armless persons, on the medical side of which highest priority is given to the training of inherent compensatory functions (hand function substituted for by the feet in the case of normal hip and knee joints, otherwise by the mouth), aimed at achieving maximum independence in daily living activities and as a preparation for best-possible integration in the educational, vocational, and social fields.","1877":null,"1878":"From its establishment in 1966 the Rehabilitation Center of Cologne University has documented its medical, social and prevocational evaluation findings, and subjected the prognoses given to periodical follow-up verifications. A statistical overview of the years 1971 through 1978 describes the numerical development of in- and outpatient rehabilitees, diagnostic groupings, and follow-up results. Development, organisational patterns, and working approaches at the centre as well as the importance of integrated prevocational training are underlined, as is the need for more medical rehabilitation facilities.","1879":"","1880":"A group of 40 clients with complete paraplegia, selected on a number of criteria (such as extent and location of the spinal cord lesion, age, financially responsible agency) had been followed up from the onset of paralysis. At the end of the 5th year post-onset, the following was stated in the 37 survivors: 28 of the 37 paraplegics (75.7 percent) have achieved vocational resettlement (in the broadest possible meaning of that term); of these 28, 16 (43.3 percent) were employed in standard-remuneration occupations; 6 (16.2 percent) had entered training or retraining programmes; 6 (16.2 percent) were engaged in domiciliary activities for at least 5 hours a day or employed in a sheltered setting. None of the paraplegics drew unemployment benefits at the report time; 9 (24.3 percent) had not been resettled vocationally. The article reports on those factors of paraplegia that have comparatively favourable effect on a return to occupational activity (such as use of both arms, absence of psycho-organic syndromes, stability of the neurological syndrome), on permanently detrimental consequences of omitted or insufficient early treatment, as well as on the importance of secondary prevention measures following discharge from inpatient treatment.","1881":"Medical assessment of a disability, and of the disabled person's performance profile, are necessary for identifying a need for rehabilitative measures, and as one of the sources of information required for individual rehabilitation programming. Assessment of this kind may be sufficient for the multitude of clear-cut rehabilitation problems to be considered provided that due regard is paid to the final goal of any rehabilitative actin which is not medical or vocational but to compensate for those consequences of impairment and disability that make up for social handicap. Persons with severe or multiple disabilities, especially in the case of progressive impairments, require a more indepth and multidisciplinary evaluation on the basis of prolonged and, if necessary, repeated medical rehabilitation measures. The approach in existence at the rehabilitation centre of Cologne University, which has been forming over almost 20 years, is used to describe the process of medical, social, and prevocational assessment in various training areas, the coordination and documentation of the final evaluation, and the indispensable verification of rehabilitation prognoses through long-term follow-up. Notwithstanding growing difficulties faced in vocational resettlement and increasingly severe impairments in the rehabilitees, more than 70 percent of prognoses in the last years, too, have been correct. Rehabilitation procedures and evaluation results proved to have been equally reliable for somatic, psychic or multiple disabilities.","1882":"The experience made in the field of rehabilitation in the post-WW II period have not only led to the enactment of Parliamentary legislation. The personal experiences of rehabilitation workers has often entailed their having gradually formed guiding principles that are being strongly insisted upon in all their dealings with their disabled clients. Rejection of these guidelines may lead to the disabled being regarded as unfit or unwilling, and even more so if he tries to develop personal views on his part in rehabilitation. There is thus a great risk of rehabilitation becoming an end in itself for those who are pursuing it. The disabled for their part should not only underline their rights but accept the responsibilities as well. The risk of stiffening oppositions on all fronts is best countered by those involved talking with each other on a partnership footing. Partnership is however also needed among those who have to co-operate in the various field involved in rehabilitation.","1883":"Severe congenital or acquired physical impairments result in disabilities that, in the first instance, entail various disorders of functions the \"normal\" person has at his or her disposal. These, on the other hand, engender grave disturbances of the interpersonal and social reference systems every human being is fitted into, and which are a premise of existence as a \"person\". Rehabilitation conceived as an effort towards overcoming such disorders and disturbances must make use of any means and possibilities at its disposal in order to compensate for, or alleviate, these repercussions at all levels of the reference system. Within the entirety of these efforts and increasingly important part falls to the development and utilisation of modern technology. The person's relationship with the environment, and his or her ties with it, are in many respects brought about by the technico-instrumental aids;--communication, handling, locomotion, eating and drinking, food processing, production and reproduction, and many more. The kaleidoscope of technical aids available today is outlined, as is the need for a correct, and above all individualised, approach in the process of procurement and training in their use. The physician as well as the para-medical staff involved require comprehensive factual knowledge but at the same time far-reaching commitment to these tasks to enable them to make optimal use of existing possibilities, and to cope with the difficulties that arise. Special mention must be made in this context of administrative impediments and economic constraints.","1884":"Disability work\/rehabilitation is an extensive and multiform field of work in which diverse scientific disciplines, fields of expertise, and specialists (but also \"laymen\") combine in team work. Social workers\/social educators, trained at special professional training colleges but at the present time still rather insufficiently prepared for working in the disability\/rehabilitation field, have an important contribution of their own to be made in this team. The present paper puts forward for discussion ten theses concerned with professional training of social workers\/social educators for work in the disability\/rehabilitation field. The objectives of such training must be to qualify for appropriate action in the disability\/rehabilitation field. This action must: --bring to bear the specific contribution of social work\/social education, --be based on sound professional knowledge, --include \"cognitive\", \"affective\", and \"actional\" dimensions, --be aware of its own positions and objectives, --be characterised by client-centredness, and willingness as well as the ability to cooperate, --be committed, independent, and responsible.","1885":"Various procedures for psychodiagnosis of mentally disabled persons are critically described. Diagnostics and therapy are conceived as a process that should not be fragmented. Advantages and disadvantages of a rigidly structured diagnostic approach are discussed. The various possibilities for psychological examination of the learning disabled are accepted as a meaningful foundation for subsequent stimulation and therapy only if they include cooperation of the parents and the therapeutic or functional personnel. Anamnesis as well as observation and analysis of behaviour are emphasised as especially needed diagnostic tools. This is illustrated by means of the diagnosis of aggressive behavioural disorders in learning disabled included in a therapy group. The main emphasis in psychological management of the mentally disabled is placed on behavioural therapy. The author posits departure from its more orthodox methods, and suggests orientation towards Lazarus' model. The necessity for the therapist to be committed with his whole personality is regarded as fundamental to a community for diagnosis and therapy.","1886":"The frequency of psychosomatic disorders and psychosocial burden in women referred to a spa\/reconvalescent home for mothers gave rise to a comparison of their patterns of complaint with those of female patients in a psychosomatic hospital. Those complaints that were described in the complaints scales as markedly impairing their health were found to be largely identical in both groups. Assignment of the women to the one or the other type of institution (by means of a discriminant analysis) was determined less by their complaints scores than by socio-economic variables (age, marital status, number of children, occupational activities), which is explained by differences in group composition.","1887":"The findings of the study are presented in extracts, and are compared to results of representative surveys (Federal Republic of Germany) in order to trace the differences that exist between the study sample and the rest of the population. It was found that spinal cord injured persons have more living space at their disposition than other people in the Federal Republic of Germany. Gainful employment, frequency of travelling, and mobility are considerably reduced in comparison to the pre-injury condition. The unemployment rate is above the national average. Severely disabled wheelchair drivers overestimate their independence. They are for example reluctant to admit that they depend on personal assistance and technical aids. The investigation clearly shows that further effort has to be made to gradually diminish unrealistic self-images in spinal cord injured person, and to improve markedly those of their living conditions that can be influenced from outside.","1888":"The study tries to answer the question which changes are experienced by laryngectomised persons in the various spheres of their life, and how these are coped with. Twenty former patients of Insel Hospital of Bern, switzerland, who had undergone laryngectomy between 12 months and 27 years ago, were covered (questionnaire, personal interview). The results revealed that many of the changes found - nearly without exception limitations in former activities and restrictions of social contacts - do by no means constitute inevitable repercussions of the postoperative condition. As a consequence of the findings of the study, perspectives are outlined aimed at avoiding this deterioration in the quality of life.","1889":"","1890":"Named \"Profi 2\", a device has been developed that is the first to enable even students with very severe motor impairments to cope independently with learning material on practically all subjects. The student operates the device by means of a single, and individually adaptable, motion sensor, and, without the teacher, therapist or similar personnel having to be present, receives continual feedback information as to the correctness of how he is proceeding. Additionally, the student's individual steps are stored in order to enable subsequent evaluation to be carried out by the teacher or therapist. The micro-computer component including the capacity to discriminate between voluntary and involuntary movement, impairment-related unintentional activation is practically ruled out.","1891":"","1892":"Lasting rehabilitation success is proven to be achievable through appropriate follow-up care. A group living project for five rehabilitees had therefore been established in the state-assisted housing sector, after selection of a suitable group of inpatients for this model project. Among the criteria for selection were: rehabilitation success so far, i.e. vocational reintegration, and suitability for group living. The difficulties encountered in the search for an appartment are described. The concept of our group living project included joint living of attendent and rehabilitees for an unlimited period of time. The case histories of the residents are outlined to give an idea of duration and severity of illness, and thus to enable evaluation of the risk involved in discharge from inpatient care. All clients have dependence problems, and had for this reason alone already been refused by other follow-up facilities. Three of the group members had to be exchanged after twelve months, loss of employment occurred only once. The initial difficulties and tasks of the attendent are described.","1893":"","1894":"","1895":"The majority of disabilities are coupled with impairments of the motor system. In its action programme on rehabilitation, the Federal Government therefore recognises that sports should invariably be included in present-day rehabilitation as provided in the centres for vocational rehabilitation. This thesis was investigated on the basis of a study of 14 vocational re-training centres (= 93 percent) and 13 vocational training centres (= 81 percent) in operation in 1978\/1979. It was found that there still is marked understaffing in this sector, especially as regards specifically trained personnel. The majority of sports facilities moreover are still in need of equipment capable of stimulating motaivation. The organisational patterns found in the field of sport for the disabled widely lack uniformity, with solutions being rather unsatisfactory.","1896":"The author outlines a group of disabled who are suggested to be inadequately covered by the usual targets of rehabilitation (reintegration in the labour market, independence in the activities of daily living, starting a family--in short: \"normality\"), because of the presence of severe and extensive disabilities or disability combinations. Starting from an analysis of the living situation these children are facing in their childhood, and a projection on the living situations to be expected in adulthood, the essential principles of an educational concept are developed which, at the price of departure from established educational ideas, is intended, ideally, to enable the course of education to be adjusted to the living situation of the individual. These individualised programmes must be based on an established right to being different, and insistence on the inalienability of equal value and equal rights as a task of education in the schools for the physically disabled.","1897":"The present state-of-the-art in \"Revalidation\" in the Netherlands is described, where the term is used to denote medical rehabilitation including prevocational assessment of physically disabled persons. Sample surveys in 1971\/72 revealed insufficient awareness and under-use of existing rehabilitation services. Since then, special emphasis has been placed on out-patient rehabilitation (clinics), with facilities and services being organised so as to serve a region of appr. 300,000 persons each, or an area within a radius of 30 kms from the facility. Organisation and staff schedules of rehabilitation facilities are discussed. Recently, marked preference of the \"active\" therapists can be noted. As in other countries, further development of the Anglo-Saxon team  concept has, in the Netherlands too, given rise to a number of problems which are discussed more fully.","1898":"Novel verbal and nonverbal therapeutic techniques are described by means of examples. The aphasic clients range from preschool and school children to young people up to the age of 18. Identification and evaluation of main interest areas enabled individualised combinations of therapeutic measure as well as novel play and\/or work situations to be developed, which also involved technical devices: animal voice imitation, play telephone, normal telephone, typewriter, electronic pocket calculator, magic screen, keyed instruments (toy piano, etc.). Rhythmically stressed and \"sports\" speech training (revolving disc, indoor bicycle, \"jouk\" sport), hydrotherapy, horseback riding, swimming. Age-adapted conversation, storytelling, motivation through joy and success (\"circulus hortativus\"), music therapy. Even in cases of extremely delayed treatment, advances may be achieved. Special hints: shorthand therapy, pseudo-phenomena, cotherapy, conversion of right-handed to left.","1899":"","1900":"There have been many discussions about both the term \"learning disability\" and the population group afflicted with this problem, which do not have a solid basis of understanding. This can be attributed to sevral factors, in particular: a) The term \"learning disability\" has its origin in school organisation and is somewhat clearly defined only within that framework and related fields. Hence, it is difficult to apply this term to other areas. b) In most cases, the term \"learning disability\" is used to describe highly heterogeneous phenomena, which are attributed to manifold and complex causal factors of mostly unknown origin. The following article discusses the difficulties arising in connectin with the use of this term. In addition, the term is studied from the educational, psychological, sociological and medical viewpoints. It seems to be necessary and useful, particularly with a view to the appropriate special educational and rehabilitative measures, to subdivide this heterogeneous disability group - as it can be found today in special schools for the learning disabled - into partial grous with different learning and performance levels.","1901":"The methods of the Italian physician Maria Montessori influenced the development of modern learning practices. There is general agreement that the Montessori phenomenon is personality forming. Aspects of this method, which are relevant for the rehabilitation of the brain-damaged and, in particular, the aphasics are presented. Possible shifts of emphasis within the relationship therapist - method - patient are analysed. Examples are used to outline in how far an increasingly patient-oriented therapy can influence the development of the aphasic patient.","1902":"A survey of 128 hospitalised secondary school pupils carried out to investigate their attitudes towards the hospital, medical and paramedical staff is used to indicate the significance of play, instruction and work for hospitalised patients. A study of restrictions in the field of daily activities reveals that psychological sequelae are present in all hospitalised patients. In order to counteract these sequelae, i.e., compensate for, or prevent them, didactic and therapeutic goals for hospital instruction are set up and explained.","1903":"Medical care is predominant in the early education of disabled infants. Although the physician is the first specialist assessing the disability, he should not dominate the course of the therapy for too long. Otherwise other occupational groups, e.g., pedagogues and psychologists are involved too late in the therapeutic process. The result is that the development of disabled babies and infants is characterised by a deficiency in the most sensitive learning and receptivity phase. Early educational measures are most often carried out at home with the active assistance of the parents. For families who have not, or not yet, accepted the disabled child the experts' help is of particular importance. Early education of disabled children is still at a developmental stage. It is hoped that the following article will increase the knowledge about this problem complex and encourage discussion.","1904":"A physical disability is always the starting point of a life-long process the dynamics of which are determined by the autonomy of the biological and psychological maturation, as well as by social influences. The motor development of the physically handicapped child is related to its personality formation. Motor and behavioural deficiencies can worsen and produce long-term effects. Therefore, starting as soon as possible, at best on a daily basis, physical education and kinesiotherapy must be used to compensate for these deficiencies and activate the forces of psychological and physical self-regulation. Physicians and kinesiotherapists must pay more attention to the normal need of movement of physically handicapped children. The motor development of the physically handicapped must become an integral part of the paedagogical responsibilities of physical education. For this reason, it is necessary that physical instructors with special qualifications are systematically employed in special schools and rehabilitation facilities.","1905":"The article shows that psychology's current situation with its confusing variety of theories and methods and, accordingly, heterogeneous examination findings, is also reflected in the discussion about the performance behaviour of the physically handicapped. This fact made it necessary to apply different concepts of the so-called normal psychology to this particular field. On the basis of limited approaches which place organic impairments - perceptual disorders and motor disturbances due to organic brain damage - in the foreground, a description of other research lines is crried out, which not only permit the taking into account of the performance aspects, but also motivational, interpersonal and social viewpoints. The continuous expansion of this field of consideration results in a skeleton concept which encompasses the whole of the person-environment relations and not only individual and isolated fields. In this connection the methodical consequences of this concept, i.e., the attempt to create biotic study situations, are discussed. It is hoped that in the future such new psychological approaches will also assist in the practical study of problems of the physically handicapped.","1906":"Early education of disabled children is presented as a specific and indispensable yet integrated part of a complex task which can be mastered solely by inter-disciplinary co-operation and interchange between educational, psychological, medical and clinical services. The author submits a concept - developed and put to the test at federal state level - of a regional and closely knit network of educationally-oriented education services. Statistical data obtained from 103 early education facilities in Bavaria give an insight into the work of such institutions.","1907":"After an intensive training in regular verbs used in different contexts of fifteen-year-old mentally and speech retarded girl was able to produce creative sentences such as \"Yesterday I made the bed\". Before the training she only used sentences without conjugating the verbs, e.g., \"Yesterday make bed\". Upon re-examination three years after completion of the training the effects of the treatment were still evident. Also, when describing pictures, re-telling something or freely relating the girl used regular verb forms as often correctly as she did in the training sentences, both immediately after the training and three years later. The same appplies to irregular verbs despite the fact they were not included in the training programme.","1908":"Within the framework of an empirical study carried out in a special kindergarten it was attempted to answer the question whether it is necessary and possible in such an institution to develop the children's skills in daily living activities. A six month systematic programme was set up for a five-year-old boy suffering from spastic hemiparesis which was designed to develop his skills in personal hygiene, and general behaviour in the kitchen area. In preparing the programme each of the two fields was first treated separately in detail, then the common factors taken into account. The programm's subdivision into an ultimate goal and two partial goals assisted the implementation of the eighteen training steps. A comparision of the knowledge of, and skills in, the two fields before and after the training showed that they had increased both in quantity and quality. As the boy still showed a headway over his peers - comparable in their disabilities - three years after completion of the programme as far as independence was concerned, it can be said that special training in daily living activities can and must be carried out in a special kindergarten for physically handicapped children provided the training is based on a specialized and fully structured programme.","1909":"The purpose of the article is to contribute to the extension and differentiation of the discussion about social group specific socialization. This is done in such a way that the sociological analysis is no longer restricted to sociocultural deprivation, but extended to the relationships between biological and social facts which can also be considered to be dependent upon the overall structure of society. The example of malnutrition is used to demonstrate to what extent biosocial variables add - in a complicated interplay with socio-cultural deficits - to the decrease in sociability and socialisation opportunities of the children in question. This applies particularly to learning disabled children in our country.","1910":"The increasing number of people over the age of 65, who are naturally more often disable than the average, obliges all concerned to discuss and explore all possible rehabilitation measures. The problem is not so much the development of new methods but the difficulty of putting known and well proven therapeutical principles into practice. With the help of a model plan of a large city the article demonstrates how rehabilitation services can be integrated into the structures of geriatric care.","1911":"The rehabilitation of patients who underwent an intervertebral disc operation is, inter alia, decisively determined by after-care. In this context, attention must be drawn to the post-surgical goal-oriented physical therapy which is important for the healing process, re-adaptation and duration of treatment. The Brunkow special isometric exercises bring about a quick and permanent re-adaptation and provide a good basis for the patient's exercise at home.","1912":"","1913":"The article demonstrates, on the basis of arithmetic lessons with physically handicapped pupils, that individualised teaching methods can be considerably more effective with the aid of technology. The demand for extreme individualized instruction justified not only by psychological but also physical reasons, is attempted to be met in an important partial area, i.e., the acquisition of arithmetical skills by means of practice. Within the framework of a research project carried out on behalf of the Federal Minister of Labour, a device has been developed which takes into consideration the medical, special educational and technical viewpoints and helps to meet the practical requirements whilst taking into account the multidisciplinary problem complex. the device is an electronic trainer for mental arithmetic exercises which can be constructionally adapted to the pupil's physical deviation. It is programmed by the teacher in accordance with the different performance levels and is then a direct partner irrespective of the pupil's degree of disability.","1914":"The systematic vocational resettlement of the disabled necessitates the preparation of working place related requirement profiles which have to be compared with the work specific performance profiles of disabled job seekers. The authors use the example of a multiply handicapped dysmelic person to discuss and explain the different aspects of such a methodical approach from the angle of the employment opportunities in the printing industry.","1915":"The complete vocational and social re-integration of the psychiatrically disabled (schizophrenic type) is only possible to a certain degree, even after a temporary stay of approximately one year at a transitional home for the psychiatrically disabled where comprehensive therapeutic measures are provided. This is shown by the experiences gained during a three-year period of work with a study sample of 190 persons at the socio-psychiatric rehabilitation centre \"Bodelschwinghaus\" in Neuss, Federal Republic of Germany. A partial rehabilitation i.e., the ability to live in a community home and work in a workshop for the disabled was more successful. As a rule, the psychiatrically disabled need a long time in an encouraging and sheltered living situation which, nevertheless, must be open to the social environment, to obtain, in some cases, the degree of stabilisation necessary to one day lead an independent life. Accelerated measures structured according to economical and financial principles do not meet the needs of the psychiatrically disabled. This is why a rigorous separation between transitional and permanent homes is not appropriate in psychiatric rehabilitation.","1916":"A successful therapy of drug-dependents can only be carried out in special facilities providing intensive inter-disciplinary care. In the Hochstadt district hospital (Bezirksklinik Hochstadt) treatment encompasses detoxication, weaning and after-care. The goal of the therapy is the permanent abstinence of the patient, finding of his identity, treatment of his somatic and psychic disturbances and diseases as well as the learning of techniques enabling him to resist addiction producing substances after his discharge from hospital, and his social re-integration. The methods used are group-therapy, as a behavioural therapy with psychodynamic aspects, ergotherapy and physiotherapy as well as socio-therapeutic measures. The therapy has a high success rate. Catamnestic studies show that 50% of the patients were still abstinent one year after their date of discharge.","1917":"Owing to the biology of arteriosclerosis elderly previously affected patients have, as a rule, to undergo lower limb amputation for occlusive artery disease. This creates particular problems which must be taken into account when choosing the surgical technique and providing the prosthesis. The article surveys the common methods and describes, in particular, the knee disarticulation including the early prosthetic fitting carried out at the author's hospital, which in their experience can decisively improve the patient's rehabilitation.","1918":"A standardised questionnaire and personality test were used to study whether women after breast cancer treatment, or women treated for genital cancer need psychosocial counselling more frequently. The interview was given to 308 women during the author's tumor after-care consultations. 1. Repercussion on their marital lives were reported three times more often by women treated for genital cancer than by women after mastectomy (p less than 0.01). There was not significant difference with regard to their family status. 2. As epidemiologically expected -- mastectomy patients had born less children than women treated for genital cancer (p less than 0.05). 3. A reduced self-confidence was reported more often by patients treated for breast cancer than by the other patient group (p less than 0.01). 4. No decrease in working performance was observed by 50% of the women treated for genital cancers as against one third of the masectomy patients. 5. Work resumption was reported more often to be strenuous for masectomy patients than for women treated for genital cancer (p less than 0.05). 6. Woman after mastectomy experiences 50% less sexual repercussions than genital cancer patients (p less than 0.05).","1919":null,"1920":"In many cases, the provision of an automobile equipped with a special control system is a necessary part of the rehabilitation of the severely disabled. The car is so important to the disabled as it enables him to overcome daily the distance between home and place of work, hence increasing his mobility and life quality. The presented care control system was developed to meet the individual needs of a particular disability. It is, however, possible to use this system for, or adapt it to, similar types of disabilities. This problem complex has been overcome by following innovations: 1. The electronically controlled accelerator which can be operated with minimal finger pressure. 2. The LIDA shoulder device for tetraplegics, a connecting piece between the shoulder and the manually operated brake lever. 3. The removable armrest on the right hand side of the driver's seat to improve the sitting stability. The car can be easily be converted for \"normal driving\". The author received financial assistance.","1921":null,"1922":"In Denmark, the audio-paedagogical care of hearing-impaired adults is examplarily organised. A considerable role, within this rehabilitation system, is played by the local teachers of the deaf who, in co-operation with the national audiological institutes, do most of the audio-paedagogical work.","1923":null,"1924":"The article presents a model for the psychological treatment within the framework of an in-patient rehabilitation programme for patients suffering from heart and circulatory diseases. On the basis of research work investigating the psychological factors of heart diseases, this model describes details of a clinical-psychological intervention and psychotherapeutic\/psychosomatic supervision tested over a two-year period at a specialised rehabilitation centre for heart and circulatory diseases.","1925":"Ten years have now passed since the foundation of the Federal Rehabilitation Council. Its work has both reflected and guided the development of rehabilitation in the Federal Republic of Germany in the last ten years. The Federal Rehabilitation Council has given its members the opportunity of bringing their services and benefits into line. It has submitted suggestions for improvements of the legislative provisions to the legislative body. Special attention has been given, in this context, to the conclusion of the \"special agreements\" on behalf of the different rehabilitation agencies designed to ensure the speedy and smooth completion of the rehabilitation process. Furthermore, the Federal Rehabilitation Council has attended to the problems of the disabled and defended the interest of various disability groups. In addition, the Federal Rehabilitation Council has endeavoured to contribute to the international exchange of experience. Special attention has been placed on public education. As rehabilitation will not be allowed to stand still, the Federal Rehabilitation Council will base its future work on this principle.","1926":"The author surveys the development of geriatric care in Great Britain and describes the relationship between geriatric medicine and psychogeriatrics. Both specialties have evolved within the system of progressive patient-care day hospitals. The responsible ministry lays down a norm of two places in both the psychogeriatric unit and geriatric days hospitals to every one thousand people aged 65 and over. The author presents the range of functions of the geriatric day hospital as well as its role within the framework of facilities caring for the aged.","1927":"Within the framework of a representative survey 1879 gainfully employed persons - trainees, workers, employees and supervisors - were asked about their attitudes towards the vocational and social integration of the physically disabled. The article describes the following results: 1) The majority of those who responded, particularly workers in subordinate positions, were of the opinion that firms, management and co-workers were rather unwilling to accept the physically disabled as competitive and equal employees and colleagues. 2) With regard to their personal attitudes there was a striking contrast: a high general support of the vocational resettlement on the one hand and a considerable resistance against the disabled's complete vocational and social integration on the other. 3) The degree of social distance was strongly dependent on the social situation and the type of the disability. 4) The rejection of the physically disabled seems to be mainly influenced by the following determinant psychological factors: a) the assumption that they are to blame for their disabilities b) the negative image of the disabled's personality traits, vocational performance abilities and their occupational behaviour.","1928":"The curricula of schools for the physically handicapped have, as yet, been influenced too much by those of regular schools. Which is why at special schools, too, the primary focus of all educational and therapeutic measures is placed on a qualification of the pupils. Also those pupils who, as a result of the severity of their disability, will not be able to enter vocational training are instructed on the basis of curricula modelled for the non-disabled. The purpose of the following article is to introduce this problem complex which has been present for years but not yet received satisfactory solutions. It is hoped that the described experiences gained with the three groups of pupils will stimulate the discussion.","1929":"","1930":null,"1931":"The authors tries to answer the question whether logopedical rehabilitation in its present form meets the requirements of its object, i.e., the speech impaired individual as seen from the perspective of prevention or reduction of his social and vocational disadvantages resulting from the language disorder. Against the background of society's \"deficiency -- classification-attitude\" towards the speech impaired, logopedical rehabilitation should enhance more intensively the emancipation of the speech deviant individual. The study of the practical realization of this requirement demonstrates that logopedics -- still considerably influenced by medical conceptual models -- which is understandable both historically and socially, has not made steps towards emancipatory rehabilitation. Prospects and approaches towards emancipatory rehabilitation resulting in an improvement of the speech disorder are demonstrated.","1932":"In community psychology the individuum-centred medical model of disease, which, as a rule, determines the psychological and psychotherapeutic work has superseded socio-psychological concepts and approaches. The authors describe the basic requirements for a psychosocial counselling service at a vocational retraining centre which is guided by community psychological ideas and principles. The article reviews the manifold problems of the rehabilitees, the comprehensive services and the efficiency of the intervention strategies recorded over a two-year period. Furthermore, the authors discuss their experiences with preventive measures in connection with both early detection and prevention of problems. Through its adjustment to the concept of community psychology the responsibilities of psychological and psychotherapeutic services within an institution obtain a considerably higher differentiated structure, and at the same time, meet the demands more adequatedly.","1933":"A judo group was formed at the Wolfsburg sports club with twenty 9 to 15 years old children who received treatment at the centre for developmental diagnostics and pediatrics. The children suffered primarily from more or less pronounced cerebral motor disturbances. Other functional disturbances such as perceptual disorders, language and reactive behavioural disturbances completed the picture of minimal brain-damage. The training programme attributed more importance to functional judo exercises than to perfect judo techniques. Allowances were made for individual difficulties. After 15 months of training improvements were observed in the motor, psychological and perceptual fields. This is why the authors believe it is worthwile to consider judo also in connection with rehabilitation.","1934":"The article reviews in a critical survey the current opinions on the possibilities of improving the motor functions of cerebral palsied children with the help of riding therapy. Furthermore, the essential motor difficulties with spasm, athetosis and ataxia are described. It is demonstrated that only a small number of these typical difficulties can be tackled by means of riding therapy and that some key problems, particularly encountered by the spastics, cannot be solved. If, despite these facts, the favourable effects of riding on the cerebral palsied cannot be denied, then this must be attributed, first of all, to the unique psychological motivation derived from riding. Credit is given to the effects on the autonomic nervous system, the psyche, the world of experience and the behaviour.","1935":"According to 5 Sect. 3 of the Act on the Standardisation of Rehabilitation Services (Rehabilitations-Angleichungsgesetz) an individual rehabilitation plan must be set up if several rehabilitation measures, e.g., medical, vocational and social measures are necessary, or, if different rehabilitation agencies are financially responsible for these procedures. This applies, as a rule, to the rehabilitation efforts for the severely brain-injured. The case history of a young brain-injured patient is used to demonstrate that an overal improvement can be achieved if a close co-operation between the hospital, rehabilitation centre, attending doctor, rehabilitation agencies and employers is ensured. The different measures must be adapted to the individual degree of work tolerance of the patient. Out-patient measures should be carried out -- and this not only because of the lower costs involved. The so-called \"Anschlussheilverfahren\" which means a treatment programme following the acute phase, initiated by the responsible agencies for the pension insurance scheme, does not seen to be the appropriate routine treatment to be carried out in the rehabilitation of the brain-injured, as they require more comprehensive and long-term therapy.","1936":null,"1937":null,"1938":"","1939":"Electric Wheelchairs are driven on public roads. Neither an operating license, liability insurance nor special driving license is necessary according to Road Traffic and Road Licensing Regulations. Statutory regulations prescribe that these wheelchairs must be fitted with two independent brakes and adequate lighting equipment. Safety can be increased by: Totmann brake system - battery servicing - improved battery chargers and technical safety tests. Maintenance of the wheelchair prolongs its life. Social security agencies should allow a large number of the most severely handicapped people to benefit from medically prescribed wheelchairs.","1940":"Special education is characterized as an integral part of education in general, and of the interdisciplinary field of rehabilitation. Its close relationship to social work\/social education and its dependence on relevant related disciplines are pointed out. The establishment of a \"general special educational theory\" is regarded as problematic and theoretically impossible, as concrete and differentiated educational statements must always be made in relation to quite definite groups of pupils and\/or educational needs. Theoretical reflections and practical actions in the field of special education are, therefore, necessarily directed towards persons with certain types of disabilities and\/or specific special educational needs. While \"General Special Education\" (or \"Education of the Handicapped\") is rejected as an intermediate field of theory between general education and specific special educational theories, the importance of interdisciplinary and comparative actions in the area of special education and some other overlapping tasks in this field are emphasized.","1941":"","1942":"","1943":"The article presents a data survey carried out by means of a questionnaire, the \"ward atmosphere scale\" described by Moos (1966--1974), U.S.A. In Austria, the effects of socio-ecological influences are examined for the first time at the rehabilitation centre in Hochegg. The data refer to autumn 1975. At that time attempts were made at Hochegg rehabilitation centre to develop a staff-centred guidance style and a client-centred therapeutic milieu in the sense of a therapeutic community. The patients were offered therapeutic programmes which were to the greatest possible degree tailored to their individual needs whilst not interferring with the patients' spontaneity and personal initiative. The analysis of the variables used in Hochegg are illustrated and compared with the mean values of the American results. It is pointed out that studies of existing conditions performed in an endeavour to create more human working conditions, are met with disapprouval. The first results of the survey are intended to be used as the basis for the improvement of the questionnaire and are helpful in decision-making regarding the development of therapeutic styles which meet the needs of the patient, regarding staff management and architectural influences.","1944":"It is demonstrated that physical disabilities involving motor deficits automatically result in communicative limitations which become particularly evident in calsses. As a rule, the consequences of a slow writing performance due to physical disability are a decrease in performance. The supply of intellectually normal but severely physically handicapped pupils with adequate technical aids designed to compensate for their disabilities is, therefore, a necessity which improves their educational opportunities. With the help of an adjusted and technically supplemented tape recorder it is demonstrated in how far a technical apparatus can become the \"tool\" of a special education teacher.","1945":"","1946":"As an experiment in integration, the joint placement of physically handicapped and non-disabled pupils into the regular class settings of a school belonging to the Hessisch-Lichtenau experiment makes special social and educational measures necessary both at school and in the residential home. The main activities have to be directed towards scientific studies of existing problems and their practical solutions. The following article describes the problems arising from the integrational efforts and suggests possible solutions.","1947":null,"1948":"The article reports on psychodiagnostic examinations performed on clients under in-patient spa treatment. The groups studied--patients with psychosomatic and general internal diseases--were subjected to the Freiburg personality inventory, the colour pyramid test and the progressive matrices test. The results were compared with normal population standards and clinically diagnosed neurotic patients. Furthermore, the spa treatment results of the psychosomatic patients were recorded during the third and fifth week. The most important outcome was that both groups of patients presented a series of typically abnormal signs as regards clinically relevant factors, whereby the psychosomatic patients presented a very similar test picture to the in-patient clients receiving psychotherapy. In contrast to the patients with general internal diseases the psychosomatic patients showed more neurotic personality traits than the standard. The degree of severity of the clinically diagnosed neurotic disturbances is reflected in the neuroticism test values. In the psychosomatic patients the psychic complaints, in the narrow sense, were predominant. The complaints as a whole showed a regressive trend; of the individual complaints only physical fatigue diminished markedly. Periodically recurring symptoms were not observed.","1949":"Based on detailed statistical data--104 patients were studied--the article points out a success rate of 68% in connection with the vocational resettlement of psychiatric clients. The criteria used to determine success were at the time of discharge permanent employment in workshops for the disabled, competitive employment or part-time jobs. A follow-up study carried out about seven years later revealed a 39% success rate as regards the clients' stability in employment. These statistics demonstrate that of 37% rehabilitees who had formerly committed a criminal offence most probably only one percent was recidivious. Furthermore, the article reports on the methods considered to be causative factors for the therapeutic success: Adequate medicinal treatment, as well as an essential pre-requisite for rehabilitation, the creation of a therapeutic milieu. Also, particularly important for a lasting success is the continuing follow-up for which appropriate facilities, especially living accommodation, community living and homes must be provided.","1950":"In Sweden efforts are being made to integrate the mentally handicapped as much as possible into society. If these efforts are to be successful society must concede to them the same rights it does to its non-disabled citizens. On the basis of the terms \"legal status\" and \"legal capacity act\" the article examines the consequences which might arise for the mentally handicapped from their being granted these legal rights. As the Swedish society principally allows the mentally handicapped the right to sexual intercourse difficulties arise, in particular, if there is the possibility of procreation and, even more, if children are desired. The pros and cons of pregnancy and its consequences for mentally handicapped people are discussed. Old and modern countermeasures (marriage obstacles, sterilisation, abortion) and the alternatives (systematic sexual instruction, counselling as regards preventive measures and control of their use) are compared and examined in view of their applicability in accordance with the Swedish normalisation efforts. The study showed that mentally handicapped persons can live--also in the sexual area--according to the same principles that guide us all, if we help and advise them adequately and at the right time. Under these circumstances restrictions are no longer the rule, but the exception.","1951":"","1952":"The experiences gained over a twelve year period with wheelchair-users attending Marburg university are reviewed. The technical pre-requisites gradually developed at the university and the Konrad-Biesalski-Haus, a residential home providing accommodation for both, disabled and non-disabled students, have proven good and served as a model for similar facilities in Regensburg, Darmstadt, Hannover, Bonn, Bochum and Bielefeld. Up to 1977, 25 severely handicapped students had successfully completed their studies at Marburg university. Of these, 19 are employed according to their qualification or are taking post-graduate courses. According to the graduates' experiences, personal contacts with the appropriate authorities and private employers were very important for their vocational integration. The general public's understanding of the disabled has improved. What remains to be done is the amelioration of vocational and study counselling services for physically disabled secondary school pupils. Preparatory measures for job placement following study completion should be initiated early on.","1953":"The article reviews the rehabilitation legislation in the Federal Republic of Germany since the social-liberal coalition took office in 1969. It shows that for the first time legislation attempts have been made to realise a uniform socio-political concept for the disabled in which rehabilitation is considered an important and independent socio-political task. With the gradual improvement of the legislative provisions the aim has been to try to remove the negative effects brought about by structural weaknesses of a historically developed social security system for the disabled,--especially the unequal treatment of the disabled, varying according to the origin of the disability, and the disadvantages brought about by the organisational and legislative disunion of rehabilitation services. At the same time, the article makes clear that more reforms are necessary in the future, e.g., a further standardisation of rehabilitation services, the elimination of architectural barriers, reform of the benefit system, improvement of the social security for people in need of care and the guaranty of a regular income for those disabled from birth or childhood.","1954":"The purpose of the study was to teach a 15-years old mentally and speech retarded girl the use of simple generative sentences by means of question-answer procedures (cf. Clark &amp; Sherman 1975). Whereas at the beginning the girl rarely produced correct new sentences, there was a marked improvement towards the end of the training programme. The generalisation effect--probably a result of the training--was such that also irregular verbs were formed with regular endings.","1955":"On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the special education department the teachers' training college an \"academic week\" was held in Cologne from June 20-24, 1976. Many German and foreign educational scientists and social paedagogues reported on the problems and research findings in the different fields of education and rehabilitation of the disabled. Since 1966 this department has experienced an unexpectedly rapid development. The majority of today's approximately 2600 students are pursuing studies to become teachers at schools for maladjusted children, the deaf, mentally disabled, physically handicapped, for children with learning disorders, with speech disorders and the hard of hearing. Approximately 250 students are trying to obtain a degree in education. Since the beginning of this decade, research work has been considerably intensified and is not mainly concentrating on the following five aspects: Studies of the theoretical, terminological and methodological approaches of special education--research projects concentrating on the social-scientific aspects of the problem of disability and the disabled--psychological studies of the learning and performance behaviour and the work load capacity of children at special schools--projects to ameliorate the communication and language capacity of the disabled--studies in connection with the planning and organisation of learning and instructional processes such as didactive and communication aids at special schools.","1956":"Owing to manifold changes in the external conditions of the Freiherr-vom-Stein-Schule and the rehabilitation centre \"Lichtenau\" as well as the shift of emphasis in society's attitudes vis-a-vis the disabled, it seemed necessary to prepare a further report on the experiences gained with this school experiment in Hessisch-Lichtenau. A short survey of the school's personnel and facilities as well as the organisational structure of the co-operation between these two institutions is followed by a detailed description of the underlying paedagogical conception and the tasks resulting from it. Despite existing limitations and numerous difficulties it can be said that this school experiment has yielded positive results. This is evidenced by the impressive number of physically handicapped people who have left this school with a qualifying examination and are now--as far as it is known--in gainful employment. These figures and the public education efforts carried out by the rehabilitation centre have given rise to the setting up of similar facilities. The article closes with a report on a training programme developed on behalf of the Hessen Minister of Cultural Affairs, which is intended to provide all student teachers working at general schools a basic knowledge in special education.","1957":"In an article published in this journal (pp. 101-106, 1977) I stated that prejudices towards the disabled cannot only be attributed to societal factors and stressed that the world-wide existence of these negative attitudes can be explained by two biological pre-dispositions, i.e., the inclination to a specific reaction towoards outsiders and the fear reaction towards strangers. Zimmermann and Kagelmann criticise this opinion. They are convinced that these negative attitudes are almost exclusively caused by societal conditions. In this article I reply to their viewpoints and demonstrate that it is not contradictory, as my critics say, that we observe, on the one hand, the widespread existence of a specific reaction towards outsiders, and on the other hand, the occurence of social help amongst animals and human beings. These two attitudes are only antagonistic components of social behavior. The problem of the applicability of animal research results to human behaviour is studied. Zimmermann and Kagelmann's statement that ethologists do not want to see the dangers inherent in the theory of inborn dispositions is vigorously repudiated. It is demonstrated that \"inborn\" does not mean that this behavioural disposition is determined by fate, since genetic pre-dispositions, too, can be influenced by environmental factors such as education.","1958":"Neumann's opinion that prejudices towards the disabled are decisively determined by inborn reactions, i.e., the reaction towards outsiders and the fear reaction towards strangers, is put to question. Ethological and ethnological research results demonstrate that the studies of human and animal behaviour towards the \"disabled\" are still in an elementary stage and that hitherto available results only permit the conclusion that animals as well as human beings display a very complex and differentiated behaviour vis-a-vis the disabled. In connection with human beings this complexity is seen as evidence of the outstanding significance of societal factors--in their broadest sense--for the formation of prejudices towards the disabled. The necessity of a goal-oriented elimination of these prejudices is stressed. Furthermore, attention is drawn to terminological problems and the difficulties or comparisons between human beings and animals.","1959":"Within the framework of an epidemiologic field study conducted in South Niedersachsen a standardised questionnaire was used to obtain data on the social and medical situation of persons with multiple sclerosis. Of the 195 people with multiple sclerosis questioned in that area in 1976 answers were received from 178 (91%). The mean age was 46 years, the average history of disease 15 years. Family status and social position corresponded to social average. A social downfall as a result of the disease was not found to have taken place. Approximately 50% who had been employed prior to the disease (N = 147) had given up their jobs at the time of the survey. The monthly net income was found to be average. Of the studied persons 42% were living in their own houses or flats. A lower percentage, compared to the general public, was living in lodgings (58% instead of 65,7%). The majority (56%) was living in flats suitable for the disabled. 13% of the surveyed persons lived alone, 5% in homes. Social care was found to be very poor in comparison with medical treatment. The introduction of compulsory notification for this disease was advocated by 83% of the people questioned.","1960":"The article reports on early rehabilitation measures carried out at a health resort on nearly 4000 patients with signs of \"wear and tear\", degenerative and other changes of the musculo-skeletal system as well as insufficiencies of cardiovascular system. Provided the preliminary diagnostic examinations are carried out and medical supervision ensured physical training and sports become increasingly important as integral parts of an active treatment plan including natural healing methods. Sport-physiological experiences have, however, shown that a real and measurable positive training effect can only be achieved if these components are administered in the correct dosages. This holds particularly true if a wide spectrum of gymnastic and sports exercises is offered - primarily in groups and under professional supervision - which are not only intended to increase physical capacity, but also respond to individual inclinations. Thus, in addition to its therapeutic value, early rehabilitation at a health resort can provide the feeling of achievement appropriate to give the rehabilitees new impulses at home. As a consequence, these programmes make a positive contribution to the well-being of the general public.","1961":"The article surveys some of the scientific fundamentals of hippo- and riding therapy, and its methods using the characteristic horseback three dimensional rhythmic movement impulses for its therapeutic values, particularly in cerebral palsy. The influence of riding on posture and balance reactions, position of the pelvic, postures of head and trunk as well as rotatory movements was demonstrated in film studies using the cerebral palsied with different syndromes as an example. Electromyographic examinations of antagonistic muscle groups, kinesiologic analyses with the help of a video-recorder, as well as motor tests to evaluate coordination and balance control confirm the practical experience, i.e., that the hippo- and riding therapy has a positive influence on the neuromuscular dysfunction in cerebral movement disorders. A lasting improvement of motor and intellectual abilities was proven by a long-term study which also revealed that motivation was the driving force.","1962":"During the last ten years of the Deutsche Vereinigung has made especially important socio-political topics - which are presented in detail in this article - the subjects of its congresses and working conferences. In particular, through the re-organisation of its council the Deutsche Vereinigung has provided the organisations for the disabled, the social security agencies, the representatives of the facilities and the occupational groups a forum for expert's discussions. Today's problems of a restricted number of vocational training places and the structural changes of the labour market have most afflicted the disabled. A solution can only be found within the framework of overall societal considerations which should take into account the question of the possibilities and limits of rationalisation and, in accordance with foreign models, the extension of the special labour market for the disabled. Integration and participation also means involvement in the gross national product.","1963":"There are only a few qualified supervisors for sports for the mentally handicapped although they are greatly needed. The Deutsche Caritasverband (association of German catholic welfare organisations) has now developed a training programme for sports supervisors which follows the training regulations of the Deutsche Sportbund (a German sports association). It is intended for all interested in working with the disabled. The whole training course consists of 180 hours. It is devided into a basic and an advanced course, each lasting one week of 75 study hours. Between these two courses the attendants are obliged to study at home and to observe and work with groups of disabled for at least 30 hours. The studies mainly focus on the two subjects \"sports for the physically handicapped\" and \"sports for the mentally handicapped\" and lead to the sports supervisors certificates A or F of the Deutsche Behindertensportverband (a German association for sports for the disabled).","1964":"Sports and play can constitute useful components in the production-free programmes of workshops for the disabled. As a result of a survey carried out in 1976 with the help of a questionnaire statements can be made on the sports situation of 150 workshops catering for 19 450 disabled people, i.e., two thirds of the workshop places currently available. Approximately 60% of the disabled do not have the opportunity of participating in sporting activities: 28% have one sports lesson per week, 9% two and 2% three. Table tennis and ball games are the most frequently mentioned. This applies also for the leisure time sports of the disabled. - As there is only a small number of appropriate facilities belonging to the workshops it is recommended that those of neighbouring schools and clubs be used. Sports lessons are usually given by special teachers' assistants with an additional qualification, as there are only a few physical education instructors with a particular knowledge of sports for the disabled. As an interim solution group leaders could be trained as sport supervisors.","1965":"Long-distance swimming competitions for the physically handicapped constitute a new measure in sports for the disabled. Such competitions can only be carried out after intensive training as a result of which predictions can be made for sports for the elderly practised for health reasons. Also, younger disabled people with different severely restricted physical functions, e.g., the paraplegics and the thalidomide disabled, are able to take part in these competitions and possibly even to swim against the non-disabled if they are fitted with the appropriate aids. The effects of endurance training are presented on the basis of many years of experiences with a supra-regional swimming group. The possible consequences for leisure time sports in clubs and organisations are discussed. The results and interim times of the two Cologne swimming festivals are documented in detail and analysed to determine performance pre-requisites. The relationship between general sports and sports for the disabled is reviewed and studied in view of a possible social integration.","1966":"","1967":"1. The final goal of rehabilitation is - according to &amp; 39 cap. 3 BSHG (Federal Law on Social Assistance) - the integration of the disabled person into society. This goal is reached as soon as the disabled person has been resettled into employment and professional life through adequate measures and when it is possible for him\/her to participate in community life. Through his resettlement into employment and professional life the disabled person's integration into society is thus achieved in part. 2. The responsibility for the various phases of the rehabilitation process is divided among different social security agencies. Comprehensive rehabilitation is guaranteed through the close cooperation between these agencies.","1968":"Has not the term \"rehabilitation\" been very frequently used lately to describe exclusively vocational rehabilitation? If, however, \"rehabilitation\" does not cover all aspects of rehabilitation including the efforts made to provide  the severely handicapped with the opportunity of developing their potential to the fullest then the severely handicapped are automatically considered segregated. What we do for them can only be described in a negative way. We are unable to integrate them vocationally but we do not want to leave them their fate, either. Without a positive exression for the efforts made for these fellow-citizens alone from the way we think and talk this part of rehabilitation implies inhuman tendencies.","1969":"During two-day cross country skiing courses for beginners telemetric pulse measurements were carried out on male patients with recent myocardial infarction and middle-aged sportswomen (first day: instruction in techniques; seocnd day: walking tour). The following results were obtained: 1.  The pulse frequency varied little during the different exercises. 2. With the exception of two people the established target pulse rate (work pulse) was not significantly exceeded. 3. In no instance during ski touring was the target pulse rate more than 10% higher than the mean pulse rate (values obtained by pulse counting). The results clearly show that cross country skiing is an extremely suitable sports activity for both preventive and rehabilitative cardiology, as it can be learned easily and carried out at different work loads.","1970":"Patients with myocardial infarction undergoing a multi-stage activation programme according to the WHO recommendations, consisting of five basic phases, can be mobilised about 85% of the time within the first 20 days of hospitalisation and about 55% of the time already in the second week after the attack. The average hospital stay is four weeks. In the hospital phase the early mobilised patients showed a decrease in early mortality and complications, e.g., reinfarction, heart rupture, development of aneurysm, cardiac insufficiency, thromboembolism, and heart arrhythmia, compared to 190 patients of the same age, who were under traditional bed rest and anticoagulation therapy. It is particularly interesting to note that patients under bed rest and anticoagulation therapy (risk group II B) far more often incurred complications than patients without cumulative risk factors (groups IA, IIA), and patients undergoing early rehabilitation (group I B).","1971":"","1972":"The article studies the question whether the self-concept of wheelchair-bound people - as described in a personality questionnaire (Freiburg personality inventory) - differ from that of the non-disabled and other disability groups, and to what extent. The study was performed on 297 wheelchair-bound persons and corresponding reference samples. There was evidence that differences between these groups are existent. The way wheelchair-bound people describe themselves indicates mechanisms developed to compensate for reduced self-acceptance. Furthermore, the study results argue in favour of psychological training methods to be applied in the rehabilitation of this disability group and the development of appropriate measuring instruments.","1973":"The following article wants to bring city guides for the disabled into focus, which appeared in rapid succession in the Federal Republic of Germany since 1971. After reflecting about the purpose and effect of city guides upon the consumer, city planners, and the wider public the author surveys hitherto published guides. Based on his own essential contribution to the making of the guide to the city of Ludwigshafen the author retraces the various stages of conception.","1974":null,"1975":"As a rule, rehabilitation programmes provided at state psychiatric hospitals and sheltered workshops in the Federal Republic of Germany suffer from a lack of training possibilities for patients from commercial, administrative and clerical occupations. The situation is the same for school pupils and students. With the introduction of a work therapy concentrating on clerical activities into the rehabilitation programme of a psychiatric hospital, patients from jobs requiring particular intellectual skills can benefit from an appropriate and graded programme designed to re-develop previously trained skills, orient in a new occupational field and provide the opportunity of trying out jobs. In particular cases this therapy also assumes the function of a useful form of occupational therapy and enlarges the range of available occupational and work therapeutic methods.","1976":"The medical profession and therapists continue to believe that total aphasia is untreable. A case report is used to demonstrate the diagnostic features of aphasia and describe the course of the impairment from the complete loss of speech, via the learning of highly automated expressions to the aquisition of single words which the patient uses independently in the different contexts. This development involves all language functions equally. The therapy is based on conventional methods, deblocking stategies, speech therapeutic talks - principal item of the treatment - and dialogue exercises carried out under normal conditions. The problems relating to deblocking methods are discussed. A description is made of the methods which have been developed from a combined audiovisual, tactile and writing motoric speech activation programme. The article presents the linguistic signs of the syndrome in an advanced stage and demonstrates the development of the thinking structure and the psychic problems with the help of the tree drawings.","1977":"The technical aids used by children undergoing inpatient treatment at a centre for the cerebral palsied were critically assessed over a one-year period. Of the evaluated technical aids 50% were optimal for the child under consideration, the remainder was inappropriate for one or more reasons. The most frequent amongst the non-optimal were either not medically prescribed or adequately adapted and tested. The children in question are hence threatened with unnecessary deformations, an insufficient utilisation of their development potential and a lower degree of independence. Also, the financially responsible agencies have to cope with considerably larger expenditures.","1978":"Rheumatoid arthritis\/chronic polyarthritis and ankylosing spondylitis belong to the most common inflammatory rheumatic diseases. Owing to their progressive character they can result in morphological and functional defective conditions making rehabilitation procedures necessary. In contrast to other diseases calling for rehabilitation treatment the rehabilitation of these two diseases is in the majority of cases a life-long process, during which a change in rehabilitation goals and procedures is not seldom. Hence, rehabilitation is a dynamic process which requires flexible adjustment. A positive rehabilitation outcome is dependent upon the following factors: (1) the patient's disease (duration, stage, type of affection, progression, inflammatory and immunological activity, general condition and drug tolerance), (2) the patient's personality (age, intelligence, motivation), (3) the patient's home and vocational environments. In addition to technical pre-requisites, which are also important, the following medical ones have to be outlined: early diagnosis and initiation of therapy and the availability of a comprehensive treatment programme embracing drug, surgical, physical and balneological therapies, also as an in-patient. A further pre-requisite is the high rheumatological qualification of the responsible physician, who must maintain good contacts with the other members of the rehabilitation team. In the long run, this qualification can only be achieved with the provision of adequate training programmes, and if rheumatology is accepted as an independent discipline.","1979":"","1980":"The rehabilitation of patients with myocardial infarction starts at an early stage of the disease, with an activation programme. In the post-acute phase this is substituted by the early rehabilitation programme carried out in cardiological centres. When the patient is discharged from hospital he undergoes an approximately one year out-patient long-term rehabilitation programme, which encompasses all sorts of secondary prevention with respect to risk factors (i.e. carbohydrate and lipid metabolism disturbances, nicotine abusus, and hyperalimentation) as well as phychosocial assistance and adequate physical therapy. These procedures have yielded positive results. In a series of 800 patients who underwent long-term rehabilitation 75.8% had resumed work. Also important is that with the help of the long-term treatment the patients became less anxious and could hence be re-integrated more easily.","1981":"Little has been written about the effects of sports activities on neurological diseases such as cerebral palsy, hemiplegia, brain trauma and paraplegia, and the available reports are mainly related to cardiopulmonary parameters. Compared to the securing of physiological data, it is more difficult to operationally define, or quantify questions concerning the motivation and social background--in a broader sense, sociological background--of the patient. Both data, however, are indispensable to rehabilitation. The experiences gained with a group of children with spina bifida attending a school for the physically handicapped, are used to describe the sequela of the central nervous system defect with which the physical education instructor has to cope, and stresses how important mutual information amongst the team members is for successful rehabilitation. The criteria for sports activities with spina bifida children are: (a) to promote their independence, (b) to give them socialisation stimuli, (c) to enhance their physical performance. It is hoped with this programme that a further personality maturation and stabilisation be achieved.","1982":"","1983":"A practical example shows that the rehabilitation of a single, dependent paraplegic cannot be terminated with the completion of the medical rehabilitation phase and the provision of an adequate job. The complete integration necessitates well organized care and assistance. In the described case this has been achieved by personal initiative, because for this problem complex there is a gap in the state rehabilitation system. Private care by conscentious objectors is described and put to discussion.","1984":"The purpose of the following article is to present the rehabilitation efforts in France. It describes legal provisions, especially the French Rehabilitation Act of 1975, the \"Loi d'orientation\", with some of its most important rules of application, as well as some concrete individual measures. It describes approaches which differ from those in the Federal Republic of Germany. The article focuses particularly on the activities of the voluntary organisations and the efforts towards a barrier-free architecture.","1985":"Based on the fact that prejudices and negative attitudes towards the disabled are not only common to our culture, but a worldwide problem, the following article studies their genesis from the point of view of behavioural science and biology. Dispositions of the mind transmitted by society can only be considered as one causative factor amongst many for these undesirable prejudices and attitudes. It is shown that human inborn inclination for a specific reaction towards marginal groups and the equally inborn fear-reaction towards strangers are also contributing factors to the formation of prejudices. This theory is supported by findings of the animal behavioural science and comparative human ethology. As inborn prejudices can be influenced by education and need not be put down to fate, two suggestions are made concerning the elimination of negative attitudes, e.g. (1) to make man aware of the fact that as a cultural being his inborn negative reaction towards marginal groups is inappropriate. As a consequence, this reaction must be transformed both culturally and ethically, (2) to eliminate the fear-reaction towards strangers, amongst other things, through integrated education.","1986":"","1987":"Identified and evaluated were a number of medical and sociological data, e.g. diagnosis, age, population of the place of residence, financially responsible agencies, on 1399 rehabilitees who were admitted to the Dortmund vocational re-training centre during the first five years of its operation (1971-1975). The primary diagnoses (highly identical with those indicative of vocational rehabilitation) and the overall diagnoses (primary and secondary diagnoses) were classified into disease groups according to the ICD and compared with the frequency distribution in the 1970 microcensus. Significance computations determined yearly deviations of the different data, i.e., a significantly steady increase in emotional disturbances. The classification of diseases and disabilities clearly shows the problem complex of adequate comprehensive therapy and medical care, and marks the role of medicine at a vocational re-training centre.","1988":"The concept of a social rehabilitation theory should not focus exclusively upon the one-dimensional aspect of restoring the ability to work, but also embrace the behaviour of the individual in all areas of life. The term rehabilitation as used in a modern highly industrialised society has to take into account the social change which has undergone the term \"disease\", and should respect scientific findings relating to nature and sociology. This would motivate the social environment of the rehabilitee to cooperative understanding and reduce the manifold conflict situations which the chronically ill encounter in the time following rehabilitation. A therapeutic approach towards social rehabilitation could be constitued by improved preparation of the rehabilitee for the post-rehabilitation time--i.e. therapeutic talks and group therapy designed to develop and stabilise behaviour patterns allowing for new and\/or different work assignement, also on the premise of reduced possibilities of role functioning.--The diversified psycho-social problems call for increased psychotherapeutic and sociotherapeutic assistance during rehabilitation.","1989":"A group of 22 patients suffering from osteogenesis imperfecta tarda were evaluated on their school and vocational education, sport activities as well as personality development with the help of follow-up studies, questionnaires or medical records. 21 patients had at least received elementary school education and had been average or good pupils. Five of six patients who had meanwhile reached adulthood had received higher education and vocational training. Owing to their disease five of six patients had to give up their original jobs or occupational plans. There was only one female patient who had received vocational guidance. Of ten children and six adults five and four respectively carried out sports in their leisure time. To improve the patients' situation it is immediately necessary that (1) the parents be informed of the nature of the disease as well as its heridity, and be advised how to handle these children; (2) the patients and their parents receive educational and vocational guidance.","1990":"Patients suffering from hip osteoarthritis mostly accompanied by long histories of pain, showed encouragingly positive attitudes towards their surgical intervention and hospitalisation, and were satisfied with the results of their operations. In the majority of cases post-surgical treatment was not intensive enough and lacked strict medical supervision. In some cases after-treatment was not administered at all. During medical treatment the patients had experienced the therapeutic value of living carefully, which resulted in the post-surgical use of walking aids and influenced the type of occupational activities and the use of leisure time and holidays. In most cases the rehabilitation phase after intertrochanteric osteotomy was no longer than expected. In comparison with the male, female patients generally had less chances of an optimal rehabilitation outcome owing to the household demands arising immediately after hospital discharge, far longer use of walking aids and less favourable transport situation. The author's optimistic expectations regarding rehabilitation results have not been fulfilled.","1991":"","1992":"","1993":"","1994":"Considering the disabled's role from the societal point of view and the necessity to re-integrate him to the fullest possible extent into the working process, the author raises the question in how far the (see article) 90\/91 of the Works Constitution Act is also relevant for this group of employees. The results of these considerations is the initiation of a work science focusing on the disabled, or the resolute application of work scientific findings to the disability sector. Some ergonomic and safety related considerations strengthen the claim for social integration of the disabled. They should be included - together with a number of systematic job analyses in part already carried out by the author of this article - in the training programmes of job analysists for industrial firms.","1995":"The experiences with 595 adult non-swimmers receiving swimming instruction during the years 1974-1976 are discussed on the basis of selected and cited tape interviews. Theoretical reference systems are described against this background of empirical observations, e.g., Alfred Adler's interpretation of individual psychology - that one's style of living is influenced by early childhood experiences, human indifference or hostility. Recent works of brain physiologists are mentioned, which deal with the two forms of human consciousness: the verbalisation of linear, logic and abstract thoughts in the left hemisphere (in the case of right handed persons), and the specialisation of the right hemisphere in the perception of symbols, pictures and irrational feelings. The helpful effect of a non-directive, client-centered atomosphere is discussed. The behavioural changes in patients who learned to swim are compared with the hypothesis formulated by Hoppe - that psychosomatic diseases might be caused by a functional disconnection of the two hemispheres.","1996":"The purpose of the study was to find out the individual and social factors influencing the understanding and judging of the speech-defective's language by speech-functioning persons. In contrast to prevailing opinions, it was proven that the evaluation is not controlled by \"adopted\" prejudices, but by the real understanding of linguistic and paralinguistic components of language. Within this context, the level of understanding and the significance of these two components in view of the evaluation depends on the sociolinguistic milieu to which the speech-functioning individual belongs.","1997":"Spiroergometric examination with defined work loads and permanent records of the common circulatory and metabolic values were carried out on a group of healthy adults and one wheelchair occupant, using a fixed wheelchair simulator with lever propulsion, which was connected to an ergometer. Comparative studies were performed in three different seat positions in relation to the lever, as well as six different lengths of the connecting rod. The best values were measured, under steadystate conditions, with increasing lengths of the connecting rod and posterior placement of the seat unit. The results are in agreement with the experience gained by other authors with respect to arm work, and show that the optimal efficiency of hand lever work is obtained in the anterior position. In this context it proved to be particularly advantageious from the ergonomic viewpoint, if, when bending forward, as necessitated by a long connecting rod, both the upper part of the body and the trunk musculature are employed. The practical consequences of the simulator tests on an adequate wheelchair design and wheelchair prescription are discussed.","1998":"The author is of the opinion that rehabilitation is characterised rather by stimatisation and isolation than by overall measures persuring the aim of partnership and community organisation. As a rule, the severely handicapped set an example of a social community through their own life performance. In their social community marginal groups are unknown unless the individual considers himself and his family outsiders or marginal group, and favours this situation A desirable goal, however, is that joint efforts be made on the part of all members of the community and that these efforts be based on partnership. A means to reach this goal is through the creation of local citizen groups as co-ordinating bodies of neighbourhood self-help groups, if possible, in all local districts. The author gives some examples on how this can be realised.","1999":"The basis of this study is the examination of 100 people who suffered from severe neurological and psychic defect syndromes. Of this group 49 were re-examined eight years later- age-range then 20 to 34. The vocational prognoses which were given at the first examination were determined according to the degree of severity of the disability and proved to be correct in 39 cases. In five cases each, the level of productivity was assessed either too high or too low. Only eleven of the sample group had an income exceeding DM 500,-45 were living either with their families or in institutions, and of the remaining four, who rented rooms, two were married. The course of life of this category of people, who suffers from such a wide range of disabilities, can be facilitated if attention is paid to the vocational prognosis before the individual starts vocational training.","2000":"","2001":"During the last eight years we examined 45 patients, mostly juvenile, with brachial plexus injuries arising from motor-cycle and moped accidents. The neurological findings, radiological picture on the myelogramme, sanguineous fluid, different electrodiagnostic examinations and sweat secretion tests provided information on the location of the lesion and the defects to be expected at a later date. However, no method permitted determination of the total extent of the damage. In some cases we observed partial, oftern considerable improvement even in the second and third post-accidential years. Follow-up studies showed the significance of the personality structure as well as social conditions with respect to vocational rehabilitation, and the danger of early resignation. Consequently, rehabilitation efforts should start immediately after the healing of the initially incurred injuries.","2002":"Trampoline therapy is a useful part of the medical rehabilitation treatment of brain-injured children and adolescents, if the basic principles of accident prevention are observed. The therapy should only consist of systematically organised exercise series and be carried out by adequately trained sport teachers, medical paedagogues or physical therapists. In the \"Jugendwerk Gailingen\" an improvement of the standing balance and movement co-ordination was achieved in more than 20 patients with hemiparesis and tetraparesis. Only little progress was achieved in atactic and athetoid patients. It is important to stress the positive psychological effects of the trampoline therapy.","2003":"Examined were 43 patients and 27 relatives all suffering from a hypertrophic type of peroneal muscular atrophy. Owing to foot deformities and a slowing of the nerve conduction velocity a diagnosis was already possible in their childhoods in the majority of cases. Although, after the 20th year of age, the pareses of the legs progress only slowly, considerable pareses of the small hand muscles can still develop in adults. With adequate counselling, rehabilitation measures should become necessary only in rare cases, or, if a kypho-scoliosis has already developed in childhood (10% of our cases).","2004":null,"2005":null,"2006":"","2007":"","2008":"","2009":"","2010":"","2011":"","2012":"Speech techniques can always become automatic with exercises provided the only purpose is the initiation and formation of particular habitual speech-motor patterns such as the coordination of respiration and phonation. However, if the speech-technical measures alienate the stutterer's spontaneous speech, exercises designed to automate speech flow seem bound to fail, since the stutterer cannot fully identify himself with a manner of speech which is not the expression of himself. The anxiety inherent in some speech situations should be allayed by the speaker's accustomization to the adverse stimuli they produce. However, in the final analysis, the irrationality of speech situations defies a systematic approach. Thus, it is the relaxation method connected with the process of graded desensitization of the stutterer which is therapeutically effective and not his adaptation to particular speech situations.","2013":"One group of the disabled, i.e., the most severely handicapped, will not be able to benefit from the improvements brought about by the new Act on the Severely Handicapped, if the statutory orders of the Federal Government and the provisions of the Federal Employment Office are implemented as planned. In this event it would become extremely difficult for the severely physically handicapped to participate in the life of the community. The article demonstrates how a sheltered workshop for the disabled which, in part, looks after the most severely handicapped needing special care: - will not achieve recognition under 55 of the Act on the Severely Handicapped, - will not benefit from either institutional or individual support provided by the organisations of - the labour administration, - will not obtain contracts from either industrial or public enterprises because the orders cannot be set off against the equalisation payment, - cannot help their disabled employees to become eligible for social security benefits. This development which for the most severely handicapped represents a step backwards must be removed from those who are the most afflicted. It must not happen that efforts made at school to promote and integrate the disabled terminate in segregated facilities (nursing homes), which are run under different subsidy regulations. What is needed is a concept for appropriate care and support of the most severely handicapped and their integration into suitably equipped small groups within workshops for the disabled.","2014":"The transition to industrial therapy following a preparatory period in a handicraft work therapeutic unit constitutes for the patients a decisive step from rehabilitation in a hospital to other rehabilitation facilities. Described are work principles, time of practice, payment, projects, social protection of labour, patients, working time, transitional period, assessment, theoretical instruction and work under real working conditions.","2015":"As, from the socio-psychological point of view, disability constitutes a communication problem, it was studied in how far the principles of communication therapy - originally developed for the treatment of marriage and family problems - can be applied to the psychological rehabilitation of the disabled. The author and her colleagues are of the opinion that the communication therapeutic approach can essentially improve the rehabilitation process, especially through the direct involvement of everyday social partners.","2016":"Professional workers in vocational research are often asked what kinds of vocational training will be made available in the future for certain groups of people. An answer can be provided neither by demand prognoses nor by analyses carried out to determine the tendency of chance on the labour market. All the more so as today's scientific methods make it almost impossible to obtain reliable data on future vocational structures. When disabled adolescents chose their careers it becomes especially evident that permanent vocational resettlement is only possible when professionals from the various disciplines are closely co-operating in the selection and structuring of the different training programmes. On the other hand, the above considerations reveal the research gaps which have to be bridged if vocational training centres are to provide the disabled adolescents with an equilibrated selection of vocational training programmes. These considerations are presented here to a larger group of professionals from whom the author would appreciate incentives and critical comments.","2017":"Within the scope of an additional micro-census inquiry--carried out in 1974--the Federal Statistical Office in Wiesbaden assessed the number of physically, mentally and psychologically impaired children. The results are differentiated according to the types of disability and therapy, age, in-patient treatment and special school attendance. Furthermore, the estimated results are compared with earlier surveys of the Federal Statistical Office and other estimates.","2018":"On the basis of short definitions of the terms \"attitudes\" and \"prejudices\", a report is made on important studies carried out under the aspects of \"lack of information\", \"social distance\" and \"social labelling\". Available evidence indicates that the functional problems of prejudices towards the disabled and, consequently, the reasons for their origin have not been sufficiently examined. Overall societal approaches based on the Marx theory cannot yield satisfactory results. On the basis of an interactive approach, prejudices are characterised by manifestations of disturbed interpersonal communication and interaction. The consequences of these facts, which are relevant to the change of attitudes, are summarised in ten theses. These should be evaluated in a practical adult education programme.","2019":"The article reports on the vocational rehabilitation of 141 patients with chronic renal insufficiency in the compensated retention phase (creatine 1,3-7,9 mg%). It points out in how far rehabilitation is dependent on the disease, type of work performed and degree of severity of the renal insuffiency. It also stresses the necessity of an early detection and prompt initiation of vocational rehabilitation.","2020":"An important pre-requisite for the rehabilitation of paralysed persons is a substantial restitution of the static stabilisation and functional adjustment to the changed situation. From a large number of technical aids used for this purpose, the article reports on the application and first experiences gained with three new types of ortheses.","2021":"120 children with head trauma, sustained in traffic accidents and 21 children, who witnessed the accident of a friend or relative, were examined with the specific purpose of identifying the effects such accidents may produce on the mental and emotional development of a child. On the basis of some case histories the author demonstrates the most frequent post-traumatic psychogenetic behaviourable disturbances and presents suitable types of assistance.","2022":"The article reports on psychotherapy accompanying counselling sessions for patients undergoing in-patient psychotherapeutic treatment. With respect to the practical implementation of vocational counselling sessions, the experiences gained within this framework are summarised in three principles: (1) Psychotherapy accompanying vocational counselling sessions are contraindicated if they relate to a partial aspects of problems which so far have not been therapeutically treated. (2) The sessions should take place at the final stage of treatment. (3) The recommendation for a job change should only be given if two conditions are (simultaneously) met: a) the patient can no longer cope with his job and is dissatisfied with it. b) There must be (at least) one alternative job for which the prospects are more favourable. The communicative situation (counsellor, therapist, social worker, employment office, and financially responsible agencies) is discussed as well as the specific behavioural patterns of the patient (acting out, indolence, tremendous demands, wish to have an adjunct therapy, need to safeguard himself.","2023":"Work load evolvers from objectively describable and measurable tasks, which can be adjusted in intensity or duration. These tasks must be performed by different people; showing identical loads, as a rule, produce different effects on different people. This fact, i.e. different persons - different effects with identical loads, is, in ergonomics, operationally called strain (Laurig, W. 1975). Hence, strain is not only the consequence of work load, but also dependent upon the differences inherent in persons under the same load. In addition to the independent of the operations to be performed, there can occur further loads, i.e., physical environment influences. Hence the purpose of testing the work load of the disabled is to assess wide-ranging types of physical and psycho-mental loads with respect to their individual strain intensity and to develop, on the basis of the findings, appropriate proposals for career plans.","2024":"Physical education of physically handicapped and sensorily imparied children - with its general goals and, especially, its efforts to improve social integration - is understood as an essential part of rehabilitation. The pre-requisites, possibilities and limits of setting up sports teams are discussed on the basis of the types of disabilities suffered by the team members. In addition to homogenous and non-homogenous teams, sports teams should be developed in which the disabled are active alonside the non-disabled. More than ever, sports will be for those disabled who are able to participate - a means of enlarging social contacts. The personality of the sports teacher, who must have a broad knowledge of the methods applied in sports for the disabled, is considered a decisive factor on whom success or failure depends. The given examples are based on experiences gained by the author and his colleagues. The setting up of such sports teams should be followed by new approaches in the clubs and associations activities, as well as in the financing of sports for the disabled. Suggestions are made on how this can be realised.","2025":"The position of disabled people in societies such as the Federal Republic of Germany, is characterised by the status of marginal groups in the sense of social discrimination. As can be demonstrated by the discrimination shown towards the disabled in employment, there are two different paradigms of the socio-scientific marginal group theory suitable for explaining this fact. According to the socio-psychological approach, vocational discrimination is understood as a sort of social punishment for the violation of norms and values. The socio-economic approach, on the contrary, considers the unfavourable job situation of the disabled a by-product of a general development towards underemployment and the de-manning programme in capitalistic systems. In some respect, the theoretical approach seems to be more resonable, but to comprehend adequately the marginal group status of the disabled, it is necessary to integrate both the socio-economic and socio-psychological theory components.","2026":"On the basis of a URO-CHECK-list drawn up by the rehabilitation centre Tobelbad near Graz, 120 spinal cord injured persons were re-examined with the purpose of identifying changes in the urogenital tract. The classification and evaluation of the urological complications revealed a surprisingly high percentage of severe changes which had occurred during the first decade after the accident. As a consequence, it must be ensured that spinal cord injured persons receive yearly check-ups in a urologically oriented rehabilitation centre where all modern examination methods, including electronic techniques for the measurement of bladder pressure and urethral resistance, are available.","2027":"The article presents the results of re-examinations performed on 120 persons with spinal cord injuries due to industrial accidents. Comparisons were made between paraplegis and paraparetics with varyingly long histories of spinal cord damage. Examined was: independence in daily life activities, walking ability, frequence and type of complications, and employment. It was surprising that spinal cord injuries with incomplete lesions were relatively more often associated with complications than paraplegia, the most frequent complication being the urinary tract infection. As was to be expected, all groups of paraparetics were more independent in their daily living activities than the paraplegics. Walking ability diminished with age and also the length of time since injury. Whereas in the sample group D (up to five years after injury) only spinal cord injured persons with incomplete lesions were gainfully employed, in the groups A-C (up to 20 years after injury) the total of 13 paraplegics with complete lesions had a job.","2028":"The problems faced by blind adolescents when leaving special schools to enter employment differ considerably from those encountered by people who lost their sight during adulthood. The realisation of the fact that their blindness leaves little occupational choice often results in job apathy. It is, however, especially work capacity and occupational activity which serve again and again, in discussions on the full integration of the blind, as proof of the visually impaired's equal position within society. In particular W. Thimm has proved that blindness has a decisive impact on the social position of the individual blind person as well as the whole disability group of the blind, because this is essentially determinated by the employment status. The individual job performance of some blind is generalised too rapidly. The fear that jobs carried out by the blind are jeopardised by the increasing automation is certainly not unfounded, especially in large enterprises. At present, however, it is not possible to make a prognosis on whether in the future job opportunities for the blind will be available or not in certain branches of industry or in specific branches of production (this varies from one firm to another and is dependent upon many other factors). Consequently, it seems to be necessary for institutions involved in the vocational training of the blind to adjust in due course to the new situation in the theoretical and practical implementation of rehabilitation.","2029":null,"2030":null,"2031":"The purpose of this study was to answer the following questions: (1) Is it more effective to treat spastic cerebral palsy with the Hufschmidt electrical stimulation therapy combined with the Bobath neuro-development treatment or only with the Bobath therapy? (2) Can a general increase in activity be obtained by the electrotherapeutic muscle stimulation? A test group (combined Hufschmidt\/Bobath therapy) and a control group (Bobath), both consisting of 10 subjects, were observed for four months. The duration of observation was divided into two four months treatment periods with a rest interval of two months in between. At the start of therapeutic measures, motor activity and psychic condition were tested with corresponding motormetric and psychodiagnostic techniques; three check-up examinations were carried out at the end of the first, and at the beginning and end of the second period of treatment. The motor-metric control examination showed that at the end of the first period the test group had achieved by far the better results, but at the end of the second therapeutic period, both groups were equally successful. The combined electrophysiotherapy hence reached in a relatively shorter time - as it were by leaps and bounds - the optimal obtainable state of functional improvements which, with the Bobath therapy alone, can be effected more slowly but with more continuity. The psychodiagnostic controls clearly indicate that the electrical stimulation produced an unspecified increase in activity, especially after the first phase of treatment, whereas in the second phase this could only be proven in a graded form. The report closes with an examination of the results and their consequences for the implementation of the treatment for cerebral palsied children.","2032":null,"2033":"Within the framework of a test performed at a school for the physically handicapped, 10 pupils with disabilities varying in type and degree of severity completed a typing programme which was adapted to their individual physiological possibilities. The deliberate use of audiovisual media contributed both to an adaptation to the disability, motivation of the pupils and intensification of the learning process. The assessment of the test results illustrated the success rates which can be expected if such a learning programme is carried out with physically handicapped pupils.","2034":"First of all, the article reports on experiences made with dysmelic children undergoing typing instruction as presented in professional literature. Then follows a discription and comments on the outcome of a study, encouraged by \"Aktion Sorgenkind\", in which a training programme was tailored to the individual movement potential of eleven dysmelic children, and resulted in their mastering the recommended movement patterns two years after the end of the course. The observed loss of typing efficiency was due to the lack of practice in higher education schools, as a result of which suggestions are made for the introduction of restructured special education procedures.","2035":"1. Early detection and treatment of epidural haematoma is vital to the chance of survival. In this respect physician's training needs to be improved. 2. The operation method of choice, particularly in the case of advanced midbrain lesions, is the extensive decompression operation (hemicranectomy) with duraplasty. In each case it is imperative to pay special attention to the relationship between blood pressure and brain perfusion until the state of decompressive is reached. 3. Late complications such as a disturbed circulation of the cerebrospinal fluid may occur and should be prevented by a shunt-operation. 4. ECG changes are still detectable even after many years. However, they give little indication on the patient's tendencies to fits. Post-traumatic cases of epilepsy may even occur more than five years after injury. 5. Patients suffering from epidural haematoma are in need of careful medical, psychiatric and social care for many years after injury, even if they seem to have been restored both neurologically and psychiatrically at the time of hospital discharge.","2036":"A visit was made to representative centres for the treatment of aphasia in five European countries and information gathered on their organisational structure. Instructional material and rehabilitation techniques were compared and a number of therapeutic methods identified. In this context it was noted that, due to a number of interesting approaches, the therapy of aphasia seems to be extensible and in many ways open to modifications.","2037":"This paper presents the conditions, possibilities and success rates in the rehabilitation of the elderly. Comparisons are made between two large groups of elderly people with chronic diseases. It is shown that 34% of the chronically ill, so-called \"nursing home cases\", could be rehabilitated after an average stay of 510 days in a rehabilitation centre. Old age is no hindrance to perseverance in medical rehabilitation. The methodical approaches in medical rehabilitation of the aged are described. Finally, suggestions are made as to how physicians in hospitals could be convinced of the promising prospects of rehabilitating elderly, chronically ill people.","2038":"","2039":"","2040":null,"2041":"Since November 1973 a riding course has been carried out with six blind adults. Due to the instructional methods the participants were able to ride independently, without an attendant, after only 30 hours. The effects of riding on the blind encompass coordination training and development of muscle strength. Furthermore, riding has a pronounced influence on the circulatory system. This attractive reaction activity provides the person who, as a result of his specific handicapping condition is limited in both the spatial and social fields, with an expansion of his living space and sphere of experience.","2042":"","2043":"The article reports on the results of vocational rehabilitation efforts in 399 schizophrenic patients. The criterion for assessing the rehabilitation outcome was a regular job for at least three months after discharge from the hospital - which was achieved in 51% of the schizophrenics as compared to 63% of the control group. In the majority of cases good rehabilitation results could be achieved only by placement in a job which, compared with the previous position, required less skills. In analysing the rehabilitation success in its relation to different variables it was noted that the diagnostic assignment to paranoid types of schizophrenia was positive whereas the opposite was found in the cases of hebephrenic courses and defective conditions. As a rule, better success could be achieved with older patients, which is attributed to vocational stabilisation before the onset of the disease. More effective than the correlation with diagnostic and psychopathological data was the examination of the relationship between success and the variables 1) social background and 2) attitudes. Very negative factors turned out to be social origin and milieu conditions, economic and family situations, the states of unemployment at the time before admission and an insufficient adjustment to the training programme. No correlation could be found between success and a longer history of employment. Social isolation could be largely eliminated through the therapeutic family milieu offering identification possibilities. In addition, the study revealed the importance of a continuous psychosocial follow-up care.","2044":"Rehabilitation must not only be identified as the total services provided for disabled persons, but also in relation to its effects on society as a whole. In addition to the general interdependency between socio-political measures, prime emphasis is placed on the principal social and economic relationships. In particular, attention is drawn to the specific characteristic of human work as an expression of personality, investment in human beings, productivity of rehabilitation efforts, and aspects of operating efficiency.","2045":"It is particularly the disabled children and adolescents who suffer most from marginal group life in our society. For a sound social and emotional development they need interaction with their peers. Youth group activities as carried out in the Federal Republic of Germany, for instance by the Georgspfadfinder, provide the disabled young people with living space which enable them to train social skills and come to terms with the environment. These wide-ranging, common activities can help to change the attitudes of all participants, thus enhancing the process of social integration.","2046":"Disabled people not only encounter barriers in their physical environment (in the form of steps which social rehabilitation is making efforts to level, remove or overcome through ramps) but also in the intellectual and emotional fields (in the life and thinking habits of our society, in expressions, song texts, etc.) i.e. basic expressions which seem to be applicable to the lives of the non-disabled but which prevent the disabled's access to life in the community. The examples given are: \"What you are depends on what you have\", \"the world is beautiful\", \"everything will turn out all right\". These expressions are, at least, as detrimental to full integration as the steps at the entrance to the post-office. The elimination of these sayings would not be beneficial to the disabled alone, but to all people: our life would become more honest and less strained. Phrases of the Biblical Message serve as the example for a thinking model which could give the impetus to a common learning process of tension release. Efforts to lessen the restraint (that is to correct the cited expressions) are called \"weltanschauliche Rehabilitation\", but whether this should rather be understood as a part of social rehabilitation or its parallel is a question which still remains unanswered.","2047":"","2048":"","2049":"","2050":"","2051":"","2052":"","2053":"","2054":"","2055":"","2056":"","2057":"","2058":"","2059":"","2060":"","2061":"","2062":"","2063":"","2064":"","2065":"","2066":"","2067":"","2068":"","2069":"","2070":"","2071":"","2072":"","2073":"","2074":"","2075":"","2076":"","2077":"","2078":"","2079":"","2080":"","2081":"","2082":"","2083":"","2084":"","2085":"","2086":"","2087":"","2088":"","2089":"","2090":"","2091":"","2092":"","2093":"","2094":"","2095":"","2096":"","2097":"","2098":"","2099":"","2100":"","2101":"","2102":"","2103":"","2104":"","2105":"","2106":"","2107":"","2108":"","2109":"","2110":"","2111":"","2112":"","2113":"","2114":"","2115":"","2116":"","2117":"","2118":"","2119":""},"articletitle":{"0":"[Correction: Childhood Cancer Patients in a Family-Oriented Rehabilitation Program: Goals and Change in Physical Functioning].","1":"[One-Year Course of Geriatric Rehabilitation Candidates with and Without Outpatient Geriatric Rehabilitation Care (AGRV)].","2":"[Work Participation after Multimodal Rehabilitation due to Neurological Diseases - Representative Analyses Using Routine Data of the German Pension Insurance].","3":"[Improving Social Participation through Cochlear Implants for Hearing Impaired Persons?
